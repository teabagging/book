The author, herself an activist, tells the story of the injustices that were done to the Spaniards, Mexicans and Indians by the early American explorers who came to California. Ramona, who is part-Indian. becomes the heroine in a tale of love and hate. The book is one of the most famous stories ever written about early California, and there have been annual Ramona-festivals in many towns over the years. There is also a town named Ramona in southern California. Most of the characters are very well drawn, but the main character of Ramona is lacking. This does not spoil the impact of the book. As a lover of early western history in America, this book is the best I have ever read about the transition of the old world into the new. Reading it for the second time, I have enjoyed it even more."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I actually read a 1908 edition of this book but this was as close as I could find. I found Ramona to be a pretty good story but had trouble understanding why it was said to have been monumental in bringing changes to the government's treatments of Native Americans or why it apparently received such myth like status in certain parts of Southern California. I was raised in or had family in nearly all of the territory mentioned in Ramona (which ranges from San Fransisco all the way down to Mexico). I had never heard mention of the story until a local book dealer here in NC offered me a copy of it. It was only recently that I got around to reading it and I did like how well the book describes all the mountainous terrain I grew up in and miss so much, particularly the mention of manzanita trees which are so beautiful but are only indigenous to that area. Also the mention of all the missions, particularly the one in San Diego I visited so often was a nice mental vacation back home.Outside of the background, I was excited to read this book that was suppose to have been so life changing for the Native American people, as half my family falls in that category. Unfortunately, I was not struck by anything earth shattering. Jackson does talk about the government's early allowances of whites basically claiming public domain over the natives' homes and lands, which was definitely tragic but the true horror of what really happened at that time never really reaches the level it needs to to be moving. You would gain more from reading pure historical accounts or textbooks or visiting native area museums near the reservations. I found Ramona to be more of a love story than anything and even the love story was sweet but again, just short of really moving. Ramona herself goes through mental and physical maturity and it was nice to see her grow with each experience throughout the story but her love Alessandro struck me as mostly annoying to be honest. It seemed he spent all of his time in constant outrage, whining, paranoia, melodramatic smoochy love talk with Ramona, or just bat crazy. Granted his people had been through some hell, but even when things were good for him, Alessandro just never struck me as a real man secure in himself and I wondered what Ramona was fawning all over. Even Ramona at one point makes a comment that she jumped to hear Alessandro laugh because it was so rare.I saw one reviewer on another of edition of this book mention that it seemed that Jackson was trying to write how she assumed the Native Americans spoke and acted. That is definitely the impression I got too. Particularly with Alessandro but with many of the Native characters, they would either sound White-influenced or Mexican-influenced in their speech and behavior but never really Native American to me. Jackson's \\"Indian\\" dialog reminded me of the way they would make Tonto speak in the old Lone Ranger movies. Not to mention that Natives (at least the men lol) are not so open with their emotions and feelings, even with wives. There is a guardedness and stoicism that just wasn't well portrayed here.Like I said, Ramona is pretty good to get an idea of the Southern California landscape, and there are some great interesting characters - Ramona herself and especially the sassy Aunt Ri (though her deep Appalachian dialect makes for tough reading-at certain parts it goes on for pages!). The love story between Alessandro and Ramona is cute and bittersweet and you do feel for them through their joys and tribulations, but overall it just wasn't QUITE as moving as I was hoping for."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"As a playwright, I haven't been inspired to adapt a novel until I read Ramona. What works for me? The melodrama is, after all, average, and the love story...a little predictable. But there's something audacious about author Helen Hunt Jackson and her bold \\"Mother Jones\\" muckraking persona that constantly reminds you throughout the pages about the injustices committed against Native Americans. Yet, in spite of this heavy message, there's something utterly fascinating about its main characters--the beautiful Ramona, the daring Alessandro, the unforgiving Senora, even the wimpy Felipe. They create a powerful scenario worthy of intelligent, passionate drama. I, in turn, wrote the play which has been produced at PlayWright's Theater in Phoenix and at Arizona State University in Tempe. I've adapted the story, done my own interpretation of it, but the essence has remained the same."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I had found a a very old handwritten letter written in 1904 by my Great Great Aunt, telling about her trip from Ohio to California. In it she mentioned visiting this book author's home and she encouraged her sister, my Great Great Grandmother to get and read Ramona! Well, I wondered if, by any chance, this book was reprinted and I found it on Amazon! It is a great read, my Great Great Aunt was correct!!!"},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Several years ago, I read an article in the San Francisco Chronicle about this book. I was surprised, because I didn't even know that a book was written about how the indigenous peoples of California felt about the change from being governed by Mexico to being ruled by the United State of America. It was heartbreaking to read, but it's a must-read for everybody who lives in this country. May we never forget, so that it won't happen again."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I loved Ramona. It was the most beautiful story I have ever read. A wonderful look at California right after it came under the control of Americans. A story that has history, romance, prejudice, love, loss, and everything in between . Please read this book. I only regret that I never read it until I was in my thirties. This is Helen Hunt Jacksons masterpiece and the attention that it gave to the treatment of Indians is remarkable."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"There is no doubt that Helen Hunt Jackson's novel Ramona is a classic -- the fact that it is still in print more than 125 years after it was first published is testament to that. The novel is primarily a love story set in Old California at a time when three cultures -- Mexican, Anglo and Indian -- were colliding. Jackson's intent was to create a story (and much of the events in the book were real-life events that she wove into her tale) that would bring the plight of the Indians to the attention of the white American population. And in that she had a fair degree of success, as her book was popular and there did seem to be some shift in sentiment towards Native Americans in the wake of its publication.All that being said, Jackson's writing is undeniably weak. Although she was a successful and popular writer in her day, to the modern reader her style is overly melodramatic. All of her characters are one-sided and under-developed. Aunt Ri, who is one of the more interesting ones, unfortunately speaks in a dialogue that is practically indecipherable. Near the end of the book, when some of her speeches go on unbroken for a page or more, I had to skip them entirely because it just took more mental effort to make sense of them than I was able to muster.Ramona, the main character around whom the entire story revolves, is just the sort of heroine that Walt Disney would begin to crank out, starting with Snow White in the 1930s. Abandoned as a child, raised in a loveless home by a foster mother who bordered on cruelty and neglect, Ramona is nevertheless sweet and good and perfect in every way. Oh, and captivatingly beautiful, also (natch). She starts out perfect on page 1 and remains so all the way to the end, and inspires near-reverence in everyone who encounters her. She is a total bore.This isn't a terrible book -- as a picture of the long-lost culture of Old California it is both effective and unique (I know of no other novels set in this time period that are so well-known as Ramona). But it is definitely not all that engaging, as evidenced by how long it took me to read it. I should have easily finished the book in two or three days but it took me more than twice that long, because I just wasn't compelled to pick up the book and read it.For those who are particularly interested and intrigued in the setting of Old California at the end of the Mexican era and the dawn of the American one, I could recommend this. Just don't expect it to rock your world, and you shouldn't be too disappointed."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"This book is an excellent story. Lots of California history..or better..Alta California as it was known in the era.BEWARE OF THE PHYSICAL BOOK !!!!! It is about 10\\"x11\\"...printing of the story is VERY!!!! pale.I will keep this....but have ordered an older, normal paperback version...similar to the one I left accidentally at the San Diego airport.Terrible size and print itself. Find another book of Ramona, by Helen Hunt Jackson....and be ready to want to go to Old Town San Diego.Michaelene Gon."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Published in 1916 Jackson's classic romance--in every sense of the word--recreates an already bygone era. After the 1834 Secularization of the 21 missions in the chain founded by Father Serra, the California of the grandees slowly, inevitably began to fade into historical memory. Three groups were drastically affected by the disintegration of this social system--admittedly not free of innate injustice. Ruin fell upon the devout Franciscan fathers, the Hispanic hidalgos who had received vast estates from the King, and the Native Americans who first respected the land--ever at the bottom of the social chain.Depicted as the underlying moral evil of all three groups are theYankees--Americans in general, whose greed and violence destroyed innocent lives, trampled decades of royal justice and raped the landscape of Alta California with wanton violence and callous indifference. Dispersed among these recriminations and regrets the author weaves a grimly fascinating tapestry of love, psychological brutality, outraged or warped honor and overbearing pride.Senora Moreno rules her household with an iron fist and a cold heart, except where it concerns her only, somewhat nave son, Felipe, 20. A master at manipulation this dowager wields absolute power to her vast household and retainers but also behind the scenes, deferring only to aged Father Salvierderra, for whom she has had a chapel built.Keeping selfish secrets about her dead sister's half-breed daughter (who considers a marriage between a white man and an squaw valid?), she hoards both the jewels and the love int ended for the girl. Obeying only the letter of her promise to her sister, she never intended to honor the spirit of motherhood, thus condemning Ramona to be raised without affection.At 19 Ramona is lovely, sweet, gentle and genteel (thanks to her convent training) but sheltered in a simple country lifestyle, where she is kept in ignorance of the reality of the present world and her own, mysterious past. This tenuous status quo changes when the annual sheep shearing occurs, the year that 21-year-old Alessandro, the educated son of a chief, leads his band of Indians to the hacienda. Their hidden love smolders until it erupts in a passionate embrace, which is unfortunately witnessed and misinterpreted by the shocked Senora.Her outraged reaction and fierce determination to punish theculprits sets in motion a chain of events which result in both the loversfleeing the rancho. There follow years of persecution of this doomed pair, as they seek to live peacefully--in harmony with nature and man. Jackson includes heavy themes in this story: racial prejudice, the power of Catholicism, the tension between mother and son, and the regenerating force of love. Partly a novel of social protest, RAMONA--despite its semi-tragic denouement, remains a classic tale of old California, whose pathos and passion reach out to modern readers."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"This book might be the only romance novel that I've read in my life, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It painted a detailed portrait/landscape of what California was like in the late 1800's."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"It was a book that kept you reading and reading. Book was in goodshape and packaging was good. Received the book in good time."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I had never heard of this classic 19th century read but I am glad I got to read it. While definitely written in a style and ethos we would consider old fashioned, this book is the Uncle Tom's Cabin of Native American relations and a valuable read. Plus the plot has a satisfying finish."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"This book rivals any of the greats. Sometimes slow reading but for the most part a &#34;can't put it down&#34;."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Although this is entirely a work of fiction, the author, Helen Hunt Jackson, spent a significant amount of time with the indigenous population of California and asked them extensively about how they felt about their land changing hands from the government of Mexico to that of the United States of America. This is a must-read for everyone who lives and have lived in California, so they can gain a much clearer perspective of what it means to be a Californian. As painful as it is to read about Ramona's life experiences, it is humbling to know what she went through. It leaves the reader wanting to know what happens next."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"The book arrived promptly from the vendor; in excellent condition. Have read it and loaned it to a friend; we both enjoyed the story and the history of early settlement of California particularly."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"This book is so much easier to read due to the large print. I purchased it for my 95 year-old mother and she expressed her joy at being able to read the print without getting headaches."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"The propaganda classic of 1884. Jackson intended to stir American sympathies for the plight of Native Americans, which probably explains the flat perfection of her Indian protagonists, Ramona and her lover/husband Alessandro. The two are hounded pillar to post by greedy American settlers, with no recourse to law and no protection from church or state.I'd give the first half of the book five stars and the second half three. What gives it five stars? (1) The setting: Old California, just after the territory has changed hands from Mexico to the U.S. Both the Moreno ranch and the Indian villages and ruined missions were fresh and alive.(2) Senora Moreno. The wily, domineering matriarch steals every scene from her pushover son Felipe and blandly-angelic foster daughter Ramona. She's complex, and Jackson does a great job getting inside her motivations.And the three-star second-half? Well, when the book has to depend on Ramona and Alessandro for interest, it gets a little dull. The good-hearted Tennessee poor-white family that shows up livens things up somewhat, if only because the reader must expend great effort to translate Auntie Ri's orthographical-nightmare dialect."},{"Title":"The Monk; Original Text, Variant Readings, and \\"a Note on the Text\\"","review":"I found this an unexpected page-turner, even more than two centuries after its initial publication.

Hegel first distinguishes between ordinary Aesthetics and his notion of Fine Art, that is, Human Creativity. Nature can be Aesthetic, but only Humans create Fine Art, and it is Fine Art that Hegel wishes to explore in this masterpiece.In great detail, Hegel explains why his concept of Spiritual Freedom is central to Art, just as it is central to Politics, to Religion, to Free Thinking and to Science. Fine Art is distinguished by its direct and personal appeal. A human hand fashions a single object with such care, devotion, skill and imagination that it may be treasured by millions for centuries. This is no act of conditioned reflexes, but an act of profound Freedom and awareness of Spiritual reality.The key to Art, for Hegel, is always the Spirit. If the Spirit can shine through, then a work of Fine Art can be a great work. The more the Universal Spirit of humanity shows forth, the more attractive that work is to the millions. For that reason, Hegel suggested, the greatest Art is religious Art or any Art that rises to the level of the spiritually sublime, as in Tragedy.Hegel considered that there is a hierarchy among the Arts. The Arts with the most matter are always a little bit lower than the Arts with less matter. For example, for Hegel, Architecture is the lowest form of Art, because the Original Idea can rarely be perfectly executed through coordinating and budgeting the large crowd of workers needed to complete it.Sculpture is higher than Architecture, but the limitations of the large marble mass were considerable when compared with the relative Freedom offered by oil on a canvas exhibiting colors, shapes and light, said Hegel.Higher than Painting are Dance and Music, Art forms that again require many people. However, the substance of these Art forms is not found simply as the human body or the musical instrument, rather, it is found within fleeting motions of the body, or the fleeting vibrations of the instrument. Music is ethereal, and when a musician stops playing, all Music itself stops. Further, Music is invisible to the eye, audible to the ear but also to the heart, and has the capability of manipulating human emotions in the most unique manner.But the highest form of Art, said Hegel, is Poetry, and the highest form of Poetry is Tragic Drama. Drama is an imitation of Life - not just as in Comedy, the external vagaries of Life, but the inner Life of the human being who suffers and who dies.Hegel remained a Christian all his life, although he was, as Cyril O'Regan aptly demonstrated, a Heterodox Christian. So we should not be surprised when we read that the Tragic Drama of Christ was, for Hegel, the highest expression of Fine Art, and a narrative that could not be repeated enough times by the Artists of each century."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"I've studied a number of languages so I approached this book with a reasonable understanding of grammatical terms and language constructs. Overall this book was decent. However it was not the exceptional text I had expected.You will receive a good amount of Irish vocabulary but the approach to language instruction is tedious and non-intuitive. It takes the approach, \\"here's a bunch of vocabulary and here it is in a sentence.\\" However then they leave out key details for later chapters while you're left confused about the point of the exercise.To add, the tapes are very low quality. The people speaking do not make an effort to pronounce things clearly and speak far too quickly. Mixed with muffled recordings, it makes for a very difficult educational experience. I did however invest in the \\"Irish Grammar book\\" by Nollaig Mac Congail and it was like someone flipped on a light switch. This course is not effective on its own. I'd recommend it, certainly but not as a standalone text!"},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"This book is a proper teaching book, similar to what I used in school, with vocabulary builder and lessons that guide you step by step to learning Irish Gaelic.

The progression of the lessons seems a tad random compared to other foreign language methods, but it eventually goes everywhere it needs to. The text leaves something to be desired, at times, for its explanations which can be a little vague, but (with repetition) mastery is still possible. The cassettes are helpful, but they would be MORE helpful if they were CDs (for purposes of navigation). The cassettes would be more helpful, too, if they also went through the vocabulary for each lesson rather than just the exercises. Get ready to take notes and do some individual research."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"I am (mostly) of Irish extraction and decided to learn Irish. They say that the Irish are stubborn; they have to be to learn this language. I have been using this book and Rosetta Stone. I think Rosetta Stone is good for people who don't have any explicit experience with grammar (such as young children), but for me, at least, not learning the grammar as I go along is frustrating, even though Rosetta Stone is very good. This book addresses exactly what I want to know, including pronunciation. Even if you aren't going to speak Irish but perhaps only read Irish, you still need to know how to pronounce it. This book has helped me get to the point where I don't have to consciously think about which letters to ignore and which letters get combined to make a different sound. Irish spelling and grammar are almost making sense to me now. Don't try to learn more than one lesson at a time. It is worth it. The only negative I can think of is that the CDs, in some places, have a faint echo in the background of what the speaker said, delayed by enough that you can distinctly hear it."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"This book is an essential one for anyone who wants to learn Irish.

I have learned how to speak the Irish language as fluently as an American who has not traveled across the seas can. What leaves this book at four stars and not five for me is the complexity of the design in the book and the simplicity of the explanations.First of all, I spent ten minutes trying to find the pronunciation table of the different consonants and vowel combinations. They were hidden in the back with a bunch of other appendixes that I felt should have been a part of the book. But that also goes with my issue with the simplicity of the book.This is not going to teach you how to understand the Irish language. Having studied ancient languages such as Latin and Sanskrit I am rather used to the formal training of understanding each word and how it is formulated and transformed throughout the sentences. This book has an appendix that if you took the time to learn on your own you could attempt something like that, but there is no chapter based around such a structured understanding of the language.But of course, although I do have these complaints, I am only taking it down to four stars because it is a good book to learn to speak the Irish language. So if you want something that is in-depth enough to teach you the pronunciations and a great CD accompanying it as well as learning common sentences and a good learning structure, then this is perfect for you. However, if you are looking for a complete understanding of the language and the ability to break down the structure then perhaps you should look for something else."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"While this book is technically comprehensive and the recorded conversations with transcriptions and translations are very useful, most of the book is harsh and minimal.

Once you get past the phonetics.. important for ear training - this course is the cornerstone of the study of Irish as spoken in the West. A few people report trouble; perhaps they are looking for an instant Irish phrasebook approach. For the serious student who truly desires to learn Irish, there is no substitute for this book."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"This book is brutally fast-paced, and seems to assume a pretty solid knowledge of linguistics. For example, in lesson 2, it states, \\"A second person singular pronoun, e.g., t&uacute;, tusa, is used wen addressing one person. A second person plural pronoun, e.g. sibh, sibhse, is uned when addressing more than person. The plural is not used to express politeness or formality\\". That last sentence would be utterly cryptic to someone who has never studied a language that makes a T-V distinction. On the other hand, if you're already a polyglot, this book is probably exactly what you're looking for.As a side note, the binding is not very good. I've owned the book for one week and the pages are already falling out."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"The 1995 edition, which had horrible binding and provided Audio-Cassettes, is an embarrasment to M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Sidhial's fine course in studying the Irish language. I brought the recent 2006 edition for my friend. This edition has a better layout, it uses simplified terms, it still uses proper grammar terms \\"Second person singular\\", \\"Third person plural\\" but it offers a better explanation of the terms,but it can not avoid using them, I don't see another way of expressing such a term.Numerous lines such as \\"Do not use the plural for formality or politeness\\" will be confusing to English speakers, as in Scottish Gaelic, French, Spanish and Latin people use the Second person plural for formal purposes. I.e. Vous and Tu (the French words for two).M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Sidhials' \\"Learning Irish\\" focus's mainly on the Conamara Dialect, specifically the Cois Farriage dialect, which is found on the coast of Galway. I myself am a native Gaeilgeoir from Conamara and don't live far from where M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Sidhial was born, I specifically chose this product to give to my friend because it was based on my dialect of speaking, but if you do not want to speak the Conamara dialect, you should purcahse another product. If you were unaware of dialect differences, than choose a product that offers a dialect. 'Standard Irish' is a cultimation of various dialectual aspects, and gives an unauthentic feeling, I strongly recommend a product with a dialect, Connacht, Munster or Ulster. (Conamara is a member of the Connacht dialect)Remembering that I am writing about the 2006 edition, it is an amazing revamp from the older editions. This edition provides an intensive hsitory of the history of the Irish Language, it also features a number of idioms which make you sound very authentic, after only a few days my friend sounds alot like me, using phrases I myself use, giving her a native feel. ONLY purchase a copy with the Audio CD's, you will learn the grammar and words where the CD's will help with your pronouciation. DO NOT just purchase the Audio CD's they do not provide any grammar help, their job is to provide pronouciation examples.Overall, this product matches a teacher, and deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"I bought this book based on the great reviews in this section, so I feel compellled to add my comments. I have studied seven languages over many years, three of them extensively, and am quite familiar with the methodology for learning a new language. This is far and away the WORST textbook/tape series I have ever encountered. I can only deduce from the other reviews that the reason people rate this course highly is that it is better than all the other alternatives for learning Gaelic. Perhaps, but it is still abominable, in terms of the methodology. In each chapter, a list of vocabulary words is given. This is pretty standard for language texts. However, in all the other language texts I have used, what follows is extensive practice exercises and grammar rules, so that you use the vocabulary in context over and over before going on to the next chapter. In this book, by contrast, what follows is one or two extremly compact (to the point of being unintelligible, in some cases) grammar rules, with almost no explanation, followed by an extremely terse list of \\"text\\" sentences, using some pretty odd subjects as examples. At the end of the chapter is one paragraph, as short as possible, using every word in the vocabulary section not used yet - which means there are a lot of silly, non-sequitur sentences placed one after the other. As for the tapes, as is mentioned in another review, they could be of better quality. More important, there is NO SPACE left on the tape to repeat the phrases given - absolutely unconscionable for something presenting itself as a language course. So, if you want to actually repeat the phrases, you have to keep pausing the tape between every phrase. This might be a minor issue if Irish were a language that was written as it is spoken; as most people are aware, this is not the case. You cannot learn Irish without listening to it.I know that Irish is a difficult language to learn, and that there is a dearth of good books from which to learn it. My issue with this book is not that it is difficult. My issue is that it is extremely terse, with almost no explanations and virtually no practice exercises. It would be better off presenting itself simply as a book on Irish grammar and vocabulary rather than an instructional textbook, although it would be difficult to use even as that, because it is not indexed well. I wouldn't recommend this book as the SOLE text for anyone. I plan to keep slogging through it, but am searching now for a supplement, to get some useful practical exercises."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"This was the first book on Irish that I bought. It set my learning back ten years. Irish is a complex language that has sounds and grammar not found in English or other western European languages.If you are a beginner to Irish take a course in it. Go to [...] and look for courses in your area. If you are learning on your own, first look at Bunt&uacute;s Cainte (isbn 1-85791-065-6) to learn how to speak and \\"hear\\" Irish. For a good modern grammar look at Irish Grammar Book by Nollaig Mac Cong&aacute;il (isbn 1-902420-49-7).Then, after you have a good exposure to Irish and want to learn the Connemera dialect, buy this book."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"If you want to learn to speak Irish, this is the book and tapes for you. To me without the tapes it would take twice as long.The language is a difficult one. For many reasons. And as another reviewer stated there are so many letters in words that are silent. The pronunciations are very different from ours, for example the authors name is pronounced Meal O'Sheal. But this book is so detailed they even tell you how to place your tongue in your mouth when pronouncing sounds. I started to take notes on index cards to help me, but everything I tried to short cut that way was already listed exactly that way somewhere in the book already as a quick reference guide. It's not something you'll learn over night, but this will definately teach you."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"This edition, the book and audio casettes, gives a great introduction to the Irish language.

The lessons on the CD start in Chapter 1 like they should but then skip to the Appendix -- have fun trying to find that in a hurry, while you dash to your cd player to hit pause. Then back to chapter 2, where they don't go through the vocabulary, but start reading from about the 3rd page in the chapter, so you can flip pages trying to figure out exactly where these people are reading from once again dashing for the pause button.I am not a person who learns languages easily, and having to jump about and guess where the heck these people are (reading the PAGE NUMBERS off on the cd would have been a nice cue since they skip about) does not help matters. I managed to learn to speak German with the Pimsleur system and I did it so well that my German friend likes to show me off to her friends because I can speak without an accent. The reason I chose this program is because with Pimsleur I did learn to speak,but I did not learn to read and write. Unfortunately with this program I will learn nothing at all because the teaching is just horrid.This might be a good program for someone who already speaks some Irish and wants to brush up, or who has someone who does speak it and can help them get through it. If you don't speak any Irish and you want to learn.....look elsewhere. For a novice this system is a joke."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"good beginning course in irish. i'm getting a lot out of it. i especially appreciate the fact that the transcriptions are done in IPA and not in the writer's own system. i've had to buy and return several other courses because they thought it would be easier on me if they wrote the pronounciations in english graphemes. his descriptions of irish sounds are done with a linguist's eye, but in a way that is easily accessable to those not familiar with linguistic jargon."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"The seller sent me the wrong edition.

There is no English guide--just four tapes of Irish. Is something missing here? Im' returning them. The tape without a guide are useless to me."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"Three years ago I decided to learn Irish, and in the next two years I bought three different courses. The first two were simply useless, (that's the obvious reason for my buying new courses) you could learn some phrases, but not construct sentences yourself.Learning Irish, on the other hand, is an excellent book, which gives you a thorough vocabulary and grammatical knowledge. It consists of 36 lessons, all containing vocabularies, grammar instructions, texts and excercises. The cassets which accompany the course are recorded by native speakers, and gives you the exact pronouciation of the Irish spoken in Connemara and the Aran Islands.Learning Irish is a very demanding course, but when you have completed it, you will be able to communicate confidently in Irish. (This is the only Irish language course of which I would say so). The different topics in the lessons make sure that you will be able to cope with all kinds of situation in Irish, and will take you far deeper into the Irish Culture than just a basic knowledge.I went to live in Ireland for two months after completing this course, and I spent a good part of that time in na Gaeltachta&iacute;, the Irish-speaking areas, and I didn't have to use English even once. My nextdoor neighbour was a native Irish-speaker, and the Irish he spoke is exactly the same as is used in this course.If you are really serious about learning Irish, this course is for you.(P.S. Do NOT buy only the casettes, they are only intended to help with your pronounciation!)"},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"If your intention is to learn the language and not just how to throw out &quot;help-me-I-need-directions&quot; phrases, this is the way to go. Make sure you get the set with the tapes. Irish pronunciation is absolutely unconscionable. Fathomless, I tell you! Why on earth put all those letters in the middle or end of the word if you just already know you're not going to bother pronouncing them?? I digress. This book has one downfall. It teaches a little bit parts to whole. One lesson will tell you the vocabulary word &quot;say&quot; as in &quot;they say.&quot; Many lessons later you learn &quot;say&quot; as in &quot;I say.&quot; Rather than learning conjugation, you learn the word. HOWEVER, you do eventually learn conjugation (oh, dear, do you ever!), and you kinda hafta know some already conjugated words to make sentences more interesting than &quot;there is a dog.&quot; Irish grammar is freakish, even more so than the strange at-the-end-of-the-sentence-is-a-verb German. Sometimes to express an action you use the English &quot;to be&quot; (Ta). This book walks you through it all. I do every lesson, copy the vocab to cards, practice the cards all the time, and listen to the blasted cassettes every time I'm in the car. So, every now and then, I take my husband's car....Anyways, it's really quite intense. Do not enter into this lightly! This is a language in dire straits. You can become a speaker and help to keep it alive."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"After researching Irish language courses at my local libraries and on-line, I selected two textbooks for my own study of this language. The two books are Teach Yourself Irish by Diarmuid O Se (1993 edition) and Learning Irish by Micheal O. Siadhail (1995 edition). Before reviewing each one, let me first warn those wishing to learn the rudiments of this language that you may find Irish grammar, spelling, and pronunciation hopelessly complex and illogical. (Fortunately, it uses the Roman alphabet.) Whichever book you chose, proceed in small steps. Read just a chapter a day to keep your frustration to a minimum. I recommend beginning with Teach Yourself Irish, which I found the more enjoyable of the two. Each of its 20 chapters opens with short dialogues, topical as well as interesting. Next comes a review of grammar clearly explained at a very basic level. All of the chapters conclude with exercises requiring the reader to answer in short phrases or sentences. There are also illustrations scattered throughout the book, thus breaking up the monotony of the text. Too many other language books, like Learning Irish, lack pictures to liven up the text for the beginner. On the audiotapes for Teach Yourself Irish the dialogues have been re-created by native speakers who demonstrate, as I understand it, the Munster dialect.If you want a more thorough grounding in the language, read Learning Irish next. In its 36 chapters it will reinforce what you have learned in Teach Yourself Irish, explain the grammar in greater depth, and expand your vocabulary. Each chapter begins with a laundry list of words. It is followed by a presentation of grammar which I found quite dry and boring. (It will put you to sleep if you are not careful!) Next there is a paragraph or two to translate, drawing on the words in the vocabulary list. Finally, there are sets of exercises to test your skills, including one English-to-Irish exercise. As a do-it-yourself language student, I found myself too lazy to write out the answers for the exercises in both books. Instead, I would translate by sight, while taking quick peeks at the answer key provided at the back of each book. The audiotapes for Learning Irish offer a detailed treatment of what the author considers the more standardised pronunciation found in Ireland today.A word about dictionaries: The selection of Irish dictionaries currently on the market is disappointing. I ended up buying the Pocket Oxford Irish Dictionary because I thought that it was the best one for beginners. I am still waiting for the big publishing houses, namely Cassell's, Collins, or the Oxford University Press, to put out an up-to-date, standard Irish-English/English-Irish dictionary with a phonetic pronunciation guide for each entry. This book would serve as an essential reference for the intermediate or advanced student."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"Irish, the ancient language of Ireland, is still a living language and spoken as the native tongue on the western seabord of Ireland; it is a language extremely rich in culture and literature. Today a revival is taking place in Ireland, and more and more people outside the traditional Irish-speaking areas are once again learning the tongue of their ancestors. The same revival is also taking place abroad - many Irish speakers can be found outside Ireland.My grandmother, who was a native speaker, emigrated from Co. Cork while still young, but she never forgot her language. I learned quite a bit from her, and have had a burning interested in Irish since then.When it comes to learning Irish, there is no other book that could match this brilliant book by &Oacute; Siadhail. Indeed, I doubt there is any language course in any other language that equals it. It starts of from the absolute beginnings and take the learner through 36 extensive lessons. After having completed these lessons the learner should be quite confident in speaking an Irish ranging far beyond just daily topics.Every chapter consists of four parts: a vocabulary, thorough grammar explanations, a text and excersises. The structure is perfectly logic, always building on what the learner already knows. The course advances quite fast, but never makes any sudden leaps. Thus, the learner never feels that he suddenly finds himself in troubbles due to not understanding the words or the grammar. The language taught in the course is natural spoken Irish, so the learner will be perfectly accustomed to hearing natural and idiomatic Irish.In fact, even for a fluent Irish speaker this course is a catch, since it is so extensive as to be considered one of the best descriptions of the Irish dialect of Conamara. Thus, even after completing the book, the learner can come bakc to it again and again.I definitely recommend this wonderful book to everyone who wishes to learn this wonderful language"},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Siadhail's &quot;Learning Irish&quot; is, quite simply, the text book we all started with who are now entering the Irish-speaking life. It teaches a living dialect of the labguage, instead of maintaining the fiction of the existence of a standard language outside the pulpits of official scribes. It also jettisons boldly those features of the standard grammar which are not alive anymore in spoken Irish. This is, of course, a mixed blessing. On the one hand it makes the learners more friendly towards native spoken Irish - no more written-language pedants with a hideous accent trying to tell the natives how they should speak Irish. On the other hand, reading literature after this course may require some readjustments to the more complex morphology of the written language. However, the book duly highlights the most difficult and idiomatic features of Irish grammar, instead of leaving the learner with a developed &quot;what's it in English&quot; syndrome, as too many textbooks do, thus producing intermediate learners with a better-than-native grasp of the genitive, but with no idea at all of the distinction between the two verbs &quot;to be&quot;. &Oacute; Siadhail firmly tells us about the most idiomatic parts of Irish, equipping us very well to meet the reality of the Gaeltacht."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"Many others have reviewed fairly the strengths and weaknesses of LI. I wanted to offer advice to beginners wondering if this is the best book for their needs. Yahoo groups are making their way through LI as one group focused on Connemara dialect-- for the Cois Fharraige version as spoken along the Co Galway coast is that which &Oacute; Siadhail teaches; other Yahoo groups are learning Munster or Ulster Irish with different texts; another group takes the Standard \\"school\\" Irish via Mairead N&iacute; Ghrada's primer \\"Progress in Irish.\\" So, you have options that combine introductory textbooks with web- based discussion lists, often with sound files added by learners. This improves upon the dodgy semi-audible cassettes that some editions of LI come with and others do not. A CD version is rumored.This book also came out in different printings; the latest 1992-era cover boasts of it being an improved edition, but little changes within beyond a somewhat clearer font and resetting of the layout (not enough if you ask me-- this book takes scrutiny and sharp eyes to make out crucial accents over many small-type letters; the italics are not easily discerned from a quick glance of many passages). LI contains errors; the answer key is not always correct, and explanations occasionally are lacking for idioms or vocabulary necessary for what a chapter may expect you to translate. This can be a far more frustrating book than an idealistic learner may expect.I have taught grammar in English, but the linguistic explanations provided here at times bewilder me. It's not a well-organized progression of content for each lesson. Not until Ch. 12 do you learn the copula. Verbs begin to be taught in greater number later than you'd expect. The author may insert essential information into a tiny footnote or a blip of a phrase (often an exception to a rule he's explaining, or an idiom otherwise not to be found in the 30 chapters) within an otherwise unrelated paragraph. This book, the back cover tells us, is for the self-tutored learner or the intrigued linguist, but it may please the latter who's able to understand the convoluted and compressed paradigms and examples better than the clueless newbie.I do like the little texts ending each chapter to translate from Irish-- these are my \\"reward\\" for finishing a chapter after the grueling work of making the English sentences in the other exercise into Irish. Despite answer keys, much will elude you as to what &Oacute; Siadhail wants you to write and what you thought you must write given the past lesson. Also, that lesson may give you many words that you will not use until much later-- if at all. This hit-and-miss approach may reflect real-life uses of a language learned in the real world, but it does try a learner's patience.Still, it's the only book teaching a dialect between north and south, and thus considered as the Connacht mean between Munster and Ulster extremes! Unlike most primers, it plunges you into a dialect with its own irrational peculiarities, and this immersion is necessary once you leave standard \\"school\\" Irish texts for learners behind. However, for absolute beginners, I would supplement this with a more concise, friendlier introduction such as Gabriel Rosenstock's \\"Beginner's Irish.\\" This concise text is more \\"updated\\" than \\"Progress in Irish,\\" but \\"PiI\\" features short chapters and the latter is easier to consult; Rosenstock combines an overview of the language with samples of how it works and has evolved alongside lessons.If you're only curious for now about the language's context and what it's like past and present, \\"The Irish Language\\" by Darerca N&iacute; Chart&uacute;ir is recommended. Grammatical explanations much more detailed but also much clearer than those in LI can be found in a reference guide that anyone slogging through LI will soon need: Donna Wong's \\"A Learner's Guide to Irish\\". (I review Rosenstock, N&iacute; Chart&uacute;ir, and Wong on Amazon.) Nollaig Mac Cong&aacute;il's \\"Irish Grammar Book\\" is a shorter reference while &Eacute;amonn &Oacute; D&oacute;naill's \\"Teach Yourself Irish Grammar\\" (unlike the dreaded revision of \\"Teach Yourself Irish\\"!) is another useful self-learning text combining explanations and exercises."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"Date: Sunday, February 06, 2000As someone who had started before on various other courses, I found LEARNING IRISH simply excellent. You get the feeling from the beginning that the author is building your confidence while introducing you step by step to the Irish language. The boxed-off tables in the initial lessons are particularly useful. The build up of the vocabulary and the gradual introduction of the two verbs 'to be' and the handling of the noun are all outstanding. The texts attached to each lesson give it a life and context which is most helpful.This is a course with no gimmicks. It's demanding but it works. The cassettes which accompany the book are clear and natural and I found them very helpful. I recommend LEARNING IRISH heartily to anyone who wishes to learn the Irish Language."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"This is a teeth-gnashing grown-up course for serious students only! It is not \\"friendly\\", like Pimsleur. You will learn grammar and structure until you're blue in the face. This text is incredibly dense and compact, and requires the reader to take initiative in knowing how best to work for him/herself. Someone who has trouble doing this will have an impossible time with this textbook.I find the indexing system to be inadequate; it is difficult to find what you're looking for. I find the vocabulary overly extensive. (Do we really need to know how to say \\"sheepskin\\" in Irish?) In the glossary, you'll find \\"tomorrow\\" but not \\"today\\". But these are small trifles, easily overcome, once you get used to how this author thinks and presents material.One absolutely MUST use the cassettes. (But surely, this is true of any language, no?) The (quasi-)IPA prononciation system is helpful, but only when you listen as well. By the way, for those who know IPA, O'Shiadhail's usage in this text is idiosyncratic, and will not be helpful without studying the examples.This is a great course, not for the faint-of-heart, but for those who really want to learn Irish in a bad way. For those, there is no course better at present."},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","review":"I have been studying Irish for the last 2 1/2 years from a top professor in the area here in the states.

But, if that isn't available to you or you have moved on from a class and want to study more, this is a great resource to reflect on!

I first read this book as a summer orientation assignment just prior to my freshman year in college, and I guess it's a good thing that I still own that copy, given its availability at the moment. I guess it was a key influence to a kid of my generation who was just beginning several decades of wishful-thinking liberalism. Particularly where law and order is concerned--this is the autobiography of a man who claims to have been set on the right path by a number of people, one of whom was the warden at San Quentin. So you have to take with a grain of salt Sands' claim that he was rehabilitated from criminal status by the people he thanks with this book. In truth, Sands clearly admits being traumatized by an abusive mother and a semi-absentee father, and in rebellion, pulled a couple of \\"young hood\\" stickup jobs, wound up in \\"Q\\" and drew the attention of Warden Clinton Duffy, who from Sands' accounts became the surrogate father he had to wait for too long for, but who fortunately came into his life before it was too late. One thing Sands doesn't seem to realize here, however, is that he never was a bona-fide criminal--just a mistreated kid who took out his rage on innocent bystanders. Duffy simply spotted that fact and had the ability to deal with Sands in the way he needed. Which is to say there was always hope for this man--something that cannot necessarily be said for every man who winds up \\"in the System\\". After a stint in the Merchant Marine and the Middle Eastern petroleum industry, as well as the entertainment industry, Sands returns to the \\"family business\\", so to speak. Duffy, as well as rehabilitating Sands, had raised an adoptive son who followed in his footsteps as a ciminologist. A later book, \\"The Seven Steps\\", describes the rehabilitation and counseling program Sands creaated which that book is named after, but it's easy to spot the fact that Sands' biggest sucess stories in that book were men with roughly the same accessibilty as he had in their stage of life. Let's face it, gang--Sands was always a man born to help people, not victimize them. He proves this in an unrelated anecdote in this book about nursing back to health a woman friend critically maimed in an accident. There's no doubt, taking Sands' story as a whole, that his brief \\"partial life of crime\\" was but a temporary aberration. Contrary to what I was peer-brainwashed to believe when I first read this book, there are good guys and there are bad guys. This book was written by one of the former--an unusual autobiography of a great man who tells us that if it hadn't been for certain people, he'd have turned out a real scumbag. Which I seriously doubt."},{"Title":"I'm Gonna Like Me (rpkg): Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem","review":"It is rare that a book comes along that all children will love. I say love all children because we have wee ones who are hearing or sight impaired and its nice to see a book that these children as well as able bodied children can enjoy. For the hearing impaired child the illustration will bring the book to life. While the sight impaired child will find the words \\"illustrate\\" the book.And for the rest of us the combination is a sure winner. And its not a sappy feel good self esteem book but more along the lines of we are all human and fall down, and feel we don't fit in at times, but it is in keeping trying that is what make life work. And its a book that will appeal to boys and girls, males and females. And lest you think it is only for wee ones, its also a good book for teens, college kids, those going thru lifes many passages. Or for someone who is going thru a rough period in their lives.As a rule I avoid celebrity books like the plague, but Ms Curtis is a true talent."},{"Title":"I'm Gonna Like Me (rpkg): Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem","review":"Dynamic duo, Jamie Lee Curtis and Laura Cornell are back with their fun-filled and entertaining guide to &quot;letting off a little self-esteem.&quot; Follow a boy and girl through their day, from the time they open their eyes in the morning, to the moment they close them again at bedtime. They like themselves, through the good and the bad...&quot;I'm gonna like me/when I open the box/and smile and say &quot;Thanks&quot;/even though I got socks&quot;, the right and the wrong...&quot;I'm gonna like me/when my answer is wrong,/like thinking my ruler/was ten inches long&quot;, when they rise to the occassion...&quot; I'm gonna like me/when I clean in a flash/and play with my brother/and take out the trash&quot;, or when trying something new...&quot;I'm gonna like me/when I eat something new/even if Grandma makes/octopus stew.&quot; Ms Curtis' joyous, rhyming text is filled with energy, and just begs to be shared and read aloud. But it's Ms Cornell's bold, bright, and busy illustrations that make this picture book really standout, and children will revel in all the witty detail as they explore each dazzling, two-page spread. Perfect for youngsters 3-7, I'm Gonna Like Me is a captivating, feel good, little gem that tells kids not to be shy about it, but to celebrate their special selves in everything they do. &quot;I'm gonna like me/cause I'm loved and I know it,/and liking myself/is the best way to show it.&quot;"},{"Title":"I'm Gonna Like Me (rpkg): Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem","review":"As a psychotherapist specializing in children, this is a lovely fun book for reinforcing self esteem and helping us accept our foibles."},{"Title":"I'm Gonna Like Me (rpkg): Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem","review":"Sometimes a book can teach a lesson in just the right way to a young child. As an elementary school teacher, I have found self-esteem to be the core of a capable, compassionate, confident child, and I look for books that reinforce this concept. \\"I'm Gonna Like Me\\" lets kids know that whoever they are is just fine and that doing the right thing in a situation is the best thing to do even though it might not be exactly what the child wants to do. Her delightful rhymes hold true throughout the book, and the illustrations help bring the lessons to life. Another wonderful book that I use in my classroom to complement this one is \\"Chelsea's New Home\\" where a golfish's belief in herself helps her make her dream come true.

I screw up and miss the mark more often than I wish in life, and my self-esteem stays intact (finally!) Here Jamie gets to the point and relays the often-misunderstood definition of self-esteem in a way that kids can understand: our innate worth (self-esteem) is just a fancy-schmancy term for self-love, and it is separate from the quality of our achievements, other people's opinions, criticism or praise of us, or having character defects which need improvement (a lifelong challenge for humans.) Keeping it simple is often the best approach, which is why I love to look at children's books for personal reminders. By the way, lest anyone mistake this for a psychology text, it is not. It is a children's book. Fun. Simple. Charming. A joy and a pleasure."},{"Title":"I'm Gonna Like Me (rpkg): Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem","review":"Being a kid is tough. You have peer pressure, bullies, and loads of other stuff to deal with. This book teaches kids a valuable lesson - you are who you are and you're fabulous just as you are!You can never praise your kids too much. You can never give your kids enough positive reinforcement.

I look forward to getting more Jamie Lee's wonderful books!"},{"Title":"I'm Gonna Like Me (rpkg): Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem","review":"While this book follows in the successful footsteps of the other Jamie Lee Curtis/Laura Cornell books, I urge readers to take a second look, and look specifically at the pictures. The words are fine and give us an important message, but the visual message is equally, if not, more important. Children are visual learners. We want to raise successful, confident children of both sexes, so why does Cornell have to give us the boy as a firefighter and a girl as a nurse? My absolute unfavorite is where the children are given medals of honesty and as a best friend, while surrounded by adults wearing their medals. The males are wearing medals of bravery, intelligence, politeness, suaveness, and impatience. The women are wearing medals of adult cute, svelte, and pear-shaped! Come on, where's the gender equity, Jamie?"},{"Title":"I'm Gonna Like Me (rpkg): Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem","review":"I wish they made a companion book for the parents of the children who read this book - no, really - I am serious. Maybe the parents can simply read this along with their children and talk about the \\"parent\\" way these lessons in self esteem/self love continue to show up long after the baby teeth fall out and the teams are chosen for kick ball.Perhaps the parents need to read this as a bedtime story for thirty consecutive days and keep a diary of how their own self esteem changes over the 30 days.The vivid colors, the rhyming verse style of expression, the alternating boy and girl story teller (I love that it is not a \\"girl\\" book or a \\"boy\\" book. I wish there were some so-so days mixed in, too - yet that is another piece parents can weave in for their children.Most of the scenarios are either highs or lows - and certainly relatable.Excellent choice which can be read over and over and over and recalled when the tough moments - and moments from celebration - appear in the life of a child."},{"Title":"I'm Gonna Like Me (rpkg): Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem","review":"This was bought for my granddaughter and am completely satisfied with the book.

The age range listed for this is 4-8, but I really think this is one of those books that is a perfect read aloud (especially given that most kids up to age 8 can't read cursive and half the text/font is cursive) for 0-6, kids older than that probably aren't going to be as engaged in the message of the book, as was the case with my kids. My 6 year old loved it, but my 8 year old didn't enjoy the story as much, though she did enjoy pouring over the pictures with her brother (and reading him the badges and stuff) after the reading and they got a good chuckle out of all the zany and vivid imagery used.In the end, the message given is one that is necessary, especially for younger children and would make for good story time discussion with kids ages 4-6 and maybe a little older...there's nothing intrinsically wrong with you if you get an answer wrong, someone doesn't like you or you get picked last. The message is that these things don't FEEL so great, but they don't affect who you are or your worth as a person and that is a strong, positive message. I give it 4 stars, a great message that can't be stressed enough to young children...to appreciate who you are and try all the things you wan to try because even when you're wrong, you learn from it!"},{"Title":"I'm Gonna Like Me (rpkg): Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem","review":"This is a self-conscious book that has colorful, detailed, highly stylized illustrations covering the theme of self esteem.It's not a bad book, nor does it offend, but it seems kind of glib. Does anyone think a child will listen to this story and be injected with self-esteem? That kids really think it's OK to be a slow runner and be chosen last? That kids are all really well-adjusted and nice, making it easy to be yourself day in and day out? It's nice fiction, but it doesn't ring true to any child past the age of 4.Another problem I have is that half the pages are written in a cursive script. My son is 7 and a really good reader, and yet he needed help with some of the book's text.If you're looking for something positive to read to a child who is not yet reading on his or her own, this might very well work for you. I can imagine cuddling a preschooler, who would enjoy the rhythm of the words and the colors on the pages.Older children may just look at you with a skeptical expression."},{"Title":"I'm Gonna Like Me (rpkg): Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem","review":"This book was a new one to me and one that I will use year after year with my class.Kids and adults alike loved it."},{"Title":"I'm Gonna Like Me (rpkg): Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem","review":"Actress jamie Lee Curtis is taking a shot at childrens books and doing quite a great job.

But enough about me, how about you?\\"I completely love this book. The illustrations, like other books illustrated by Laura Cornell, are really cute and detailed. The rhymes throughout the book fit together really well.I would use this book definitley in kindergarten classroom near the beginning of the year when a child may not be feeling very sure of him herself because they don't know everyone yet and may feel a bit insecure.Really a good book for all children."},{"Title":"I'm Gonna Like Me (rpkg): Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem","review":"I'm Gonna Like Me, Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem, by Jamie Lee Curtis and Laura Cornell, is a great book. This book is about all the different way a person (or kid) should love themselves. This book looks at a day of two young people, a boy and a girl. It reviews all the moments throughout their day when they may not be confident or proud of themselves and tells why at those very moments they should be the most proud and confident of themselves.I would say that the reading level of this book is about 3rd grade, because of some of the words, such as swinging, octopus, and grandma. Although I think the book would make a great read-a-loud for pre-K and up. The subject matter within the book is suitable for many developmental levels, specifically I would say k-3 would understand the message this book brings, although many adults may even be able to learn a bit form this book.The book contains 18 pages, though they are not numbered. Also, text is not on every page. It takes about 15-20 minuets to read the book out loud. Though it does flow quickly because of the rhyming of the text.The text in the book may be a bit confusing, because shorthand is used for one character, the boy, and longhand is use for the little girl character. The writing makes perfect sense once you start reading the book and looking at the illustrations. The illustrations within the book are colorful, whimsical, and full of life. Just from looking at the picture you can learn so much about the two characters. It takes more time just sitting and really look at all there is to look at in the pictures, than it does to just read the book.I think this book is a divers book, and my reasons are. First, it uses a male and female character. The both receive equal showing on all pages. This shows gender equity. Second, many of the supporting characters are from different ethnic and cultural groups. Finally it also doesn't force the ideal of nuclear family, you see moms, dads, and grand parents.This book could be use for a classroom meeting when there is an issue of teasing or even with a single student who needs a bit of a self-esteem boast. It's important in such a judgmental society that we teach out children to be Ok with themselves. I think this book does a wonderful job at looking at a serious subject in a silly way. It's been said that if you can learn to laugh at your troubles they don't seem as big. I think this book could help students laugh and learn to love themselves."},{"Title":"I'm Gonna Like Me (rpkg): Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem","review":"This is a terrific book for children, teaching them to like themselves just they way they are without coming off as preachy.

Psychological tests show that: Most people rate themselves in the top quartile of any human capability or activity. In addition, most people marry others who look a lot like them. Even peoples' dogs look a lot like the owners.But there can be some painful years when we notice that some people are taller, run faster, have different hair and eyes, and can do things we can't so well when it seems like . . . well, maybe somebody made a mistake putting us together.A parent's love can help inoculate a child's emotions from those assaults, especially when they begin as taunts from other children. As supportive as you might like to be as a parent, I doubt if you will be able to top what Jamie Lee Curtis and Laura Cornell have put together in this book for Celebrating a Child's Uniqueness!Like the best children's books, the text and illustrations pay equal attention to the perspectives of both sexes. Although there is some sex-typing here, if your youngster relates more to rough-and-tumble and is a girl or nice-and-neat and is a boy . . . there's room to see oneself in this book.As always, I have to praise the details in the illustrations for their extraordinary wit. The boy's bottom bunk contains a box for turning any pet into a Dalmatian-like creature by adding spots. Naturally, this boy is into being a fire fighter. He even uses \\"Cavity Xtinguisher\\" toothpaste in a package that looks like a fire extinguisher.Many children are cowed into wearing whatever the crowd wears. I loved the double-page spread that showed the little girl walking down a runway to applause wearing a nurse's cap, plaid, and lots of flowers while saying, \\"I'm gonna like me wearing flowers and plaid. I have my own style. I don't follow some fad.\\" As you can tell, she's into nursing.A lot of children also find giving the wrong answers in school to be humiliating. This book addresses that by having the boy say, \\"I'm gonna like me when my answer is wrong, like thinking my ruler is ten inches long.\\"Another terrible experience can come on the playground, picking teams. In this book, here's the advice: \\"I'm gonna like me when I don't run so fast. Then they pick teams and I'm chosen last.\\"There's also encouragement for doing good things like returning a lost ring, making a get-well card for a friend, doing chores, running errand, and thanking people for gifts that don't please.The book ends with this conversation starter:\\"I'm gonna like me. I already do! But enough about me--How about YOU?\\"Here's where you get to be the encouraging parent for an attentive child who has been warmed up to receive your love and kind thoughts.

The funds of merchants, bankers, and the Church paid for the manuscripts that revived antiquity.\\" (Pg. 68) He suggests, \\"it was the humanists, not the navigators, who liberated man from dogma, taught him to love life rather than brood about death, and made the European mind free.\\" (Pg. 86)He says, \\"Men are not naturally virtuous, and social order maintains itself precariously amid the open or secret conflict of egos, community itched for taverns, brothels, and gambling halls as outlets for instincts or as sources of gain.\\" (Pg. 151) He adds, \\"such a (moral) revolution is the only one that would mark a real advance in human affairs; and that beside it the bloody overturns of history are transient and ineffectual spectacles, changing anything but man.\\" (Pg. 162)He says dryly, \\"The lives of great men oft remind us that a man's character can be formed after his demise. If a ruler coddles the chroniclers about him they may lift him to posthumous sanctity; if he offends them they may broil his corpse on a spit of venom or roast him to darkest infamy in a pot of ink.\\" (Pg. 391) He asserts, \\"Nowhere are the prejudices of the historian so likely to mislead him as when he seeks to determine the moral level of an age---unless it be in the kindred inquiry into the decline of religious belief.\\" (Pg. 568) He suggests, \\"Enlightenment is of minorities, and emancipation is individual; minds are not freed en masse.\\" (Pg. 569)Although often forgotten in modern times, the Durants' series was once a staple of \\"Book-of-the-Month Club\\" introductory promotions, and widely read.

The only difference between this, and HB1 is that Kate Kray has included people from \\"up north\\" ie \\"KILLER\\" from Liverpool, and also an international flavour with a Kung-Fu champion thrown in for good measure. Again, the 2nd book seems to concentrate more on ensuring the reader that the \\"hard bastard\\" in question is actually a decent person, rather than going into details about the violence the person has seen. I was especially disappointed with the coverage of Tony Lambrianou. For all that he has seen & done in his life, I expected a more detailed account from him.It's a very easy-to-read book (I read cover to cover in 3 hours) which makes it seem even less appealing if you're paying the hardback price imported from the UK.My advice; but the auto-biogs of Roy \\"Pretty Boy\\" Shaw and Lenny \\"the guvnor\\" Mclean instead.

Unfortunately, after the Cat In The Hat spends the whole book rhyming delightfully about baby animals, he then suggests that you can turn your backyard into A \\"Wild baby daycare center\\" (\\"Your mother will not mind at all if you do.\\")It is dangerous to children to suggest they handle wild baby animals, and usually a mistaken kindness (kids can and will find all kinds of orphans who usually aren't), and it is illegal in almost all states to keep native wildlife without a permit.Bonnie Worth's facts are all fine, and her rhymes are devine, but she needs to check on her wildlife ethics.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, as did my husband, and will recommend it to ALL of my married friends. She hit every single nail on the head with all of my issues concerning sex and intimacy in a Christian marriage, helping me to feel that I am not alone or abnormal. Sex for women is a head thing and Sheila teaches you how to retrain your thoughts and emotions to better allow you to not only enjoy that intimacy with your husband, but to also WANT it!!! (something I had just about given up on) Another thing that was great was the way she shows you the men's perspective on sex. It helps a lot just knowing where he is coming from. Plus she gives a special section at the end of each chapter just for the men to read that hits the main points of what you just read (in case he doesn't want to read the whole book). This is a book I don't recommend lending to friends, only because you will want to hold on to it forever and make notes in it and highlite areas and reread it many, many times! This is the first book of hers I have read, but I plan to find To Love, Honor, and Vacuum because of how much I enjoyed reading this one."},{"Title":"Honey, I Don't Have a Headache Tonight: Help for Women Who Want to Feel More In the Mood","review":"Women, if you want to REALLY understand your man's needs and expectations, this book is for you. This well-written tome is intended for women, but as a man, let me tell you, Shiela understands the opposite sex! My wife and I read it together and learned a lot. Shiela ends each chapter with advice for men...I appreciate that.Shiela's writing is crisp; her observations fascinating; her conclusions dead-on. She offers hope to women with imperfect bodies and unpredictable sex drives. The book is tastefully modest but is still direct and to-the-point.I predict that this book will help thousands of couples experience all the joy God intended for them in the bedroom. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Honey, I Don't Have a Headache Tonight: Help for Women Who Want to Feel More In the Mood","review":"I loved this book!

As someone who was truly looking for help or advice, I was very disappointed to find that this book offered neither. Gregoire blames a low sex drive on pornography, abuse, and premarital sex... or a woman's own prickliness and distraction. Suggestions given included ensuring that the surfaces in your bedroom are clear, so you aren't worried about cleaning up while you should be concentrating on pleasing your husband. Oh, you work outside the home? You should consider staying home, lest you damage your husband's self esteem by not allowing him to be the &#34;provider&#34;. (Really?!)As the primary &#34;provider&#34; in my family, I found this downright offensive. To suggest that my ability and work ethic goes against God's intentions for womanhood is ridiculous. And I guarantee it won't jump start my interest in sex.Looking to increase your sex drive for $10? Don't buy this book. Buy a bottle of wine."},{"Title":"Honey, I Don't Have a Headache Tonight: Help for Women Who Want to Feel More In the Mood","review":"Like many couples, my wife and I could use more intimacy in our lives. Kids, work, school, and the bad habits that have built up over the time we've known each other have slowly stripped a great deal of the intimacy from our lives. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand why this is happening, but it takes a shared perception of the problem for a couple to fully address the issues that have brought their marriage to this state.Because my wife is an avid reader, I felt that Honey, I Don't Have a Headache Tonight may be a great way to get on the same page with ideas to improve the intimacy and increase the closeness in our marriage. After reading the few reviews of the book, I figured that while it may have a Christian basis, the lessons the book sought to teach would be more relationship-centric. Instead, the book reads a sermon of Christian extremism and fails to acknowledge many realities of current society outside the Bible belt. While Sheila Wray Gregoire acknowledges and identifies many of the issues that can affect intimacy, her solutions often revolve around the bible which she incessantly cites as proof that one should undertake a given action. This may be fine for people who fully subscribe to her theology, but it is useless to those who are not of the more extreme Christian denominations. As you read through the book, this premise becomes more aggravating as you realize that unless you and your spouse are devout Christians in Sheila's sense of the phrase, the book will hold little for you.The extreme Christian slant on non-marriage issues presented in this book further erodes any sense of perspective or insight on behalf of the author. The thought that the absence of the working dad in the lives of his children leads to homosexuality or the author's view on the use of pornography and masturbation are quick clues to how applicable her advice may be to your situation. I would say that if you are a devout Christian, obey a strict interpretation of the word of God, and can identify with her perspective; Sheila's book may be of service to you. However, for the vast majority of married couples, including moderate Christians, it is hard to swallow her advice because it is predicated on a strict interpretation of the bible that lacks the perspective and understanding of the relationships of the less devout to be of any service to them."},{"Title":"Honey, I Don't Have a Headache Tonight: Help for Women Who Want to Feel More In the Mood","review":"This is a letter I wrote to the author in response to the book, which pretty much covers my response:Hi, Sheila. I've been reading your book, \\"Honey, I Don't Have a Headache Tonight,\\" and I have enjoyed both your advice and your humor. I think you have written a needed and useful book.However, I do have serious concerns with both the content and intention of your chapter on masculinity. My concerns come as both a Christian and as a feminist. As I was reading, I found myself wondering whether the intention of that chapter was really to help the reader have an improved sex life, or if it was to grind axes with feminists and liberals and others who don't align with the right-wing ideology that pervades much contemporary conservative Protestant thinking.There were two passages that I found particularly troubling, especially from a Christian perspective. The first was the ridiculing of Bill Clinton for expressing empathy while lauding Donald Rumsfeld for lashing out with violence. I found myself dumbfounded and deeply upset by that. Which of those responses seems more like Jesus? Which way would we expect Jesus to respond, and which way did he ask that we respond? Without going into an unncessary and technical discussion of why retalitory violence is completely counter to Christian ethics, suffice to say that I cannot image that Jesus would agree with your assessment of those men, in any way.And I had a similar response to your approval of a BBC article that bemoaned curricula that included questions beyond factual recall, with the author arguing that \\"[i]nstead of fact-retention and recall, in which girls and boys are roughly equal, the question now requires empathy, something that females excel in, and at which males are useless.\\" God help us all if that is really the case! I'm just grateful that Jesus was not useless at empathy, and in fact excelled in it, and I am raising my son to excel in empathy, as well. It is certainly not unnatural to him. He will be one year old in two weeks, and he gets upset when another baby begins to cry, or when I am upset. Empathy appears to be natural for him, not something he is useless at, and I can only hope that the empathy he learns in our family and our church can sustain in him when our culture tries to kill it in him, telling him, as your book does, that it is not right for a man to have.The fruits of the spirit are love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness, goodness, faith, kindness, and self-control. While empathy is not explicitly mentioned, it is far easier to imagine it as part of the list than \\"adroitness at factual recall\\" or \\"tendency to lash out violently upon provocation.\\" Those are the traits that Jesus' presence within us provides, whether we are male or female, and yet they look nothing like the masculinity that our culture lauds, or that you laud in the chapter I am discussing. They are the traits that, as wives, sisters, mothers, daughters, and friends, we should seek to encourage and admire in the men around us. In many ways, taking on those traits in a world that demands the exact opposite from men for them to be \\"real men\\" is a greater challenge than avoiding the temptations of sex and lust. And yet, the battle against lust is given so much more attention and validation than the battle to enact the fruits in a culture that asks men to deny those very traits. That is why I cannot help but think that many of your complaints in that chapter have less to do with either a desire to improve marriage relationships or a true contemplation of Christian manhood but rather a desire to grind axes with feminists and liberals and to encourage your readers to adopt right-wing views about gender, regardless of how well they actually conform to the example and teachings of Jesus.I thank God that Jesus not only revealed God's amazing love to us, but also freed us from the shackles of the identities set for us by the \\"principalities and powers,\\" among them the institutions that tell men that they must be violent, quick to anger, aggressive, militant, and without empathy. It is unfortunate that, today, the church--or at least some branches of it--is among the principalities and powers still promulgating those identities.I pray that you take what I have written in the spirit it is intended, from someone who appreciates very much the work you have done and the wonderful advice you've given, but is deeply troubled by one particular section, in which I was left feeling like the spirit of grace and truth so evident in the rest of the book was lacking."},{"Title":"WHISTLEBLOWER","review":"There's usually a reason that a bestselling author's early novels are NOT famous -- they're simply not as good. I've enjoyed most of Tess Gerritsen's other novels, but this one frustrated me with its sappy, bad-Harlequin-romance atmosphere. Although they are supposedly intelligent, mature adults, the two leads behaved like none too bright, naive yo-yos. Granted, there were a few good surprises, but all of the characters were pretty one dimensional. This may be partly due to the book's shorter length (i.e., if you cram in lots of plot developments, something's got to go). I always feel guilty about panning an author's hard work, yet I also want to spare a reader hours of unsatisfying effort. I finished reading this book because I'm stubborn, but I'd advise others to skip it and stick with her later works."},{"Title":"WHISTLEBLOWER","review":"I read &quot;Whistleblower&quot; when it was first published in 1992 and recently picked up my copy again (Yep, it's a keeper). The book is a true thriller, offering a clear glimpse of the suspense she would soon unleash on mainstream readers. At the time, I actually thought it was a little too punishing for category romance, with what happens to Cathy's friend Sarah (that certainly isn't what I wanted to happen after Gerritsen spent a lot of time developing the character and getting us to like her. It only made it more shattering). Still, I think those are the very reason her mainstream fans might like this one too. It's full of shocks and surprises, even ones that are hard to take, because Gerritsen takes no prisoners. The love story is nicely understated and never becomes too swoony. Rather, it's a suspenseful story about government conspiracies and those who dare to tell the truth. As good as--or better--than her more celebrated releases, but at a better price. You can't go wrong."},{"Title":"WHISTLEBLOWER","review":"I have been a fan of Tess Gerritson for a long while and have enjoyed many of her novels over the years (except that awful one set in England where neither the plot nor the characters worked). I really looked forward to reading this latest offering but I am now exceedingly annoyed at having spent a reasonable amount of money on a complete piece of rubbish! The plot was so predictable that all which subsequently occurred was obvious by the end of the second chapter and the writing was so appalling that I had to skim a good proportion of it.

She rushes him to the hospital and then continues on to Sarah's house never realizing the man had actually been injured by a gunshot and not the car accident. In the morning, Cathy finds Sarah dead in the driveway. Victor learns of Sarah's death and realizes the killer thought Sarah was Cathy. Knowing the killer will quickly realize his mistake, Victor seeks out Cathy to warn her about the danger she is in. Cathy and Victor decide to team up to protect themselves and keep evidence of illegal activity between the government and the lab Victor works for out of the wrong hands.Whistleblower is one of Tess Gerristen's earlier books, and, as demonstrated in Whistleblower, she started out with a stronger romance theme in her books than she has now. Cathy and Victor took timeouts at the oddest times to explore their attraction to one another. The romance breaks in the action were often very distracting and just absolutely unbelievable. As the romance continued to develop, it started to get juvenile. There was constant game-playing, testing of each other's feelings, threats of leaving the other behind...you get the idea. Since the book was very short, I would have preferred the romance been minimized and the plot made a little more complex. I'm glad Tess has evolved and is now more focused on the murder/thriller aspect of her writing."},{"Title":"WHISTLEBLOWER","review":"Whistleblower is Tess Gerritsen's 5th stand-alone novel. When Victor Holland runs in front of Cathy Weaver's car on a lonely California highway, she takes him to the local hospital, aware that he seems to be terrified, but unaware that he has been shot. While his ravings seem to be paranoid, the murder of Cathy's close friend, followed by several other murders, has Cathy not just believing Victor, but depending on him for her own safety. What follows is a rollercoaster ride of pursuit and evasion as Cathy and Victor try to prove what he has uncovered without losing their lives.

As I usually do, I hit an online auction site to find book bargains, lots of books for a few dollars. If I was rich I would buy all Kindle versions, but I'm not.In this case I am so glad that it was a bargain. Whistleblower is one of the most frustrating books I have read. I want suspense. I want action. I want intrigue. In this book the two protagonists stop every few feet to make out. Yes, the story is constantly interrupted with \\"romance\\". Not even good romance.I have read three of Gerritsen's other books and love them.

His book convincingly discusses how a terrible trauma affected his family in the past and still affects him today. Utilzing a juxtapositioning of chapters to continuously effect sensibilities, Mr. M shows how the horrors of WWII Poland for Jews are very much a part of first generation Americans' psyches. His emotional angst leads the reader to understand how deeply he was affected by his parent's tragedy, and the concrete steps he took and continues to take to build himself, and more nobly, his community. As a child of Holocaust survivors myself, I understand the pain Mr. M has confronted, yet ultimately it is his very personal journey that leaves uneasy feelings about how few of us in difficult circumstances are motivated to do good by our fellow man.

Also - we always hear about 'cycles of violence' handed down through generations, a story that the nightly news never lets us forget.

In the first piece, EllenSussmanrelates the story of her first trip to a nude beach, a theme revisited later in the book by Elizabeth Asdorian in \\"The Naked and the Wed,\\" an article about the difficulties of seeing the entire wedding party at a beach where clothes are forbidden. Other authors discuss almost everything travel related, from smuggling prescription drugs into the United States to the difficulty using bathrooms in foreign countries to how to respond when airport security in Laos alerts you that your bag is not quite ticking but rather vibrating.The pieces here are mostly magazine fare and a rather mixed lot at that. Several I enjoyed immensely.Tamara Sheward's\\"Pills, Thrills, and Green Around the Gills\\" is an extremely funny account of how not to travel in Laos and what to do if, against all advice, you insist on traveling in a flight on a plane that inspires anything but confidence.Susan Orlean's\\"Lifelike\\" is a fascinating glimpse at taxidermists and the 2003 World Taxidermy Championships. I'm not sure what exactly this article had to do with travel, the ostensible theme of the book, but I found Orlean at her best here as she shares a world far removed from most people's everyday experiences. A third piece worth mentioning is Amy C. Balfour's \\"Just Another Malibu Minnie,\\" an account of the author's participation in a triathlon.In addition to these three, there are other solid pieces worth reading, but I found the collection too uneven to be truly outstanding.

But as they were lent to me I felt compelled to keep reading. I really wish I hadn't. This book was just as dismal as the first two. And another note, these are geared towards women, and as such, I just can't understand the cover. It doesn't bother me per say, but it seems like the kind of missed their audience there.These books are supposed to be short stories from women travelers that range on the funny side. The traveling takes place all over the world, including the USA and to be honest, there were a couple stories that were so mind numbing I didn't even quite catch where they took place in this one. Some of the stories ranged from sharing a bus with a grandma who kept dirty diapers in a suit case, to other stories about buying underwear. Another story mused on the differences between men's and women's vacations. All travel was varied from airplanes, buses, and car travel.All of these writers are supposed to be humorous, but I really didn't find them so. In fact, I don't think I even cracked a smile with this book. A couple of the stories were interesting at the very most, but that was about it. Some of them were completely boring too, like the woman who gets jealous over her husband's GPS in a story that could have been told in one paragraph instead of a few pages. And once again, with this book, most of the stories could have happened anywhere. I guess I don't see the point of travel if all you focus on is your underwear. I guess I'd just rather enjoy the travel part of travel in a travel book.Hopefully I'll manage to stay clear of any other books in this series.

I counted 3 without really looking. Mostly good stories, but not as funny as Laurie Notaro's books. I had high expectations and was very dissapointed, overall."},{"Title":"The Thong Also Rises: Further Misadventures from Funny Women on the Road (Travelers' Tales Guides)","review":"This book isn't great literature, but it is great fun and a quick read. Aimed towards a female audience, it consists of a series of short travel narratives by many different women writers. It also includes some quotes and some short anecdotes (think \\"Laughter Is The Best Medicine\\" from the Reader's Digest.) That means that there is a huge variety of places visited. Some of the authors are well-known names such as Laurie Notaro and Susan Orleans.Stories include:- an \\"oops\\" moment on a nude beach on St. Martin- An American (Drug-Smuggling) Girl - getting prescription medications across the border from Mexico- communicating info about an intimate problem in sign language to a pharmacist in Paris- flying on a rickety old plane in Laos- mistaking an offer of Scottish sausages for a sexual proposition- trying to make amends on Capri for the writer's mom having shoplifted a cheap and obscene little geegaw- family budget-travel in South Dakota- a wardrobe malfunction during a blind date with a sexy Yoga instructor in India- funny mistranslations and an embarrassing medical emergency at a cooking school in Italy- attending the fashion shows in Paris with Mom- the writer's embarrassing mistranslation of her name in China (unrealized until after working there and using it for a year)- attending the World Taxidermy Championships in Springfield, Illinois- a homestay with a Gautemalan family- locking the keys in the car WAY out in the Australian Outback- a nude Valentine's Day event for newlyweds at a couples resort in Jamaica- the adventures of a newbie triathlete in a Malibu competition- the difficulties of riding a camel while wearing thong panties- a coach class ticket that got the writer a private plane- a frightening bus trip through a bandit-controlled region of India- a close call with getting busted for an accidental and unwanted lump of hash in Germany. . . and of course there is the usual component of toilet disasters. These seem to be mandatory for all books of travel humor. But you have to admit they're funny in a juvenile sort of way - and you also have to admit that they do give you important information about travel off the beaten path.Oddly, some of the quotes have nothing whatsoever to do with travel. Often they're about marriage or men. They appear to be just filler. One would think that the editors could have taken the time to find some quotes about travel instead.Also, a few of the stories and quotes are thoughtful and serious, and one essay reads like a steamy romance novel. Some of these are worthy efforts, but what are they doing in a book subtitled \\"Further Misadventures From Funny Women on the Road\\"?But these are minor flaws in a highly entertaining read that is sure to whet your appetite for adventure.(217 pages)Quote from The Thong Also Rises:\\". . . no matter how clueless I was, the people around me knew what they were doing. And no matter how mistrustful I was, they were willing to help me.\\" - Megan Lyles"},{"Title":"The Thong Also Rises: Further Misadventures from Funny Women on the Road (Travelers' Tales Guides)","review":"A humorous collection of travel tales by women writers I picked up because Laurie Notaro is included and I figured she would be among equal talent. She was not. Decent writing and a few chuckles, interesting tales of far off and not-so-far off travels. There's much better beach/summer chick lit out there (like any of Laurie Notaro's works). Grade: C"},{"Title":"The American","review":"In The American, Henry James attempts to convey the differences between the market-driven republicanism of the United States and the monarchical traditions of Old Europe (France in particular). It seems that whenever anyone explores differences, stereotypes precipitate from the mix, and even the careful craft of Henry James is subject to this law of language. Yet one gets the sense that James is aware that presuming to accurately describe actual differences carries with it the risk of proscribing inferred differences. Thus, the novel seems to be more about the act of writing about differences - and not just nineteenth century differences - than anything else.At the end of The American, neither \\"side\\" truly wins or loses in any definite sense, and this becomes emblematic of Modernity - the inability (futility?) inherent in attempting to reconcile past traditions with new ideas. Ezra Pound's mantra, \\"make it new,\\" gave a center to Modernism, and The American shows us that the desire for newness inherently involves negotiations with the past: Those who carry old traditions desire to render their time-worn customs as eternally of the present while those seeking new ideas must remember the ideas of the past so as to break from them. The overwhelming questions remain: When should one drop outdated customs in favor of something new, and how can one recognize traditions worth keeping?"},{"Title":"The American","review":"Christopher Newman (Columbus and New Man) is a successful mid-career retired post-Civil War American industrialist in Paris seeking the best of the best. James creates fascinating characters, but they are somewhat stereotypical from a modern reader's perspective. The novel is a joy to read, even if it is slow to evolve at times. This is an accessable classic novel, without direct intrusions from the author's personal life, art or politics. This is a great work of cultural anthropology, providing insight into the declining post-revolution culture of France and the emerging American leadership class. It contrasts old world tradition, honor, family and politics with New World innocence, commercialism and naivete. The core love story is romantic and touching. James was one of the first to paint a picture of the possible end of civilization. The old world was scheming to hold on to its privileges. The new world had no deeper values than profits, activity, travel, imitation art and mindless pursuit of the best. The rich picture of characters and society does not overcome the final outcome, leaving the reader asking existential questions without answers (or even clues) as to how to live a good life in the modern age."},{"Title":"The American","review":"James hadn't quite reached his top form here. The plot is somewhat melodramatic and improbable and some of the characters (particularly the evil Europeans)are excessively stereotyped. This is,nonetheless, a great novel. The descriptions of France are incredibly vivid, and the writing is so fluent that it is a true pleasure to read, unlike some of the author's later, more mannered productions. In fact, this is probably a good place to start reading James before moving on to his richer, but sometimes more tedious, later works."},{"Title":"The American","review":"The difference between a classic and a modern Pulitzer winning novel - is that a classic absorbs you, seduces you, it is easy to read - although not a light read - and only receives 5 and 4 stars from Amazon reviewers, and nothing in the range of 1 and 2 stars, like most of the current Pulitzer winners receive from many of their miffed readers."},{"Title":"The American","review":"The American by Henry James is a romance for both people who love romances and those who do not. Set in late nineteenth century Paris, it combines a love story with the struggle between a new, wealthy American and an old, traditional French family over the lovely daughter of the family.The story involves Christopher Newman, a wealthy American businessman, during the Paris portion of his European tour. Romance seems be a large part of what he is looking for. The first suggestion that he may have found it occurs in his encounter with the artist, Noemie Nioche. This turns out to be merely a passing fancy. Things get more serious when his American friends, Mr. and Mrs. Tristan put him in contact with an attractive young widow, Claire de Cintre.Madame de Cintre, nee Bellegarde, whose first marriage had been arranged to an elderly nobleman who gave her a title, but little else. Upon meeting Newman, both seem to find what they are looking for in the world of romance. As the story develops it becomes clear that it is sufficient for Newman to win Claire but that he must also win over her family, which consisted of her mother, Madame de Bellegarde and her brother, Urbaine, the Marquis de Bellegarde.The House of Bellegarde was full of pride and tradition, but short of money. As the Bellegardes size up Newman, it becomes obvious that they are weighing the sale of their pride for Newman's money. Ultimately they reach their decision. In their last meeting, Claire informed Newman of that she was to become a nun. Although shocked, Newman could not persuade Claire to break free of her family's rule and breath the free air which comes so naturally to an American.Given one piece of evidence, Newman attempts to recover Claire back through blackmail. When the Bellegardes refuse to submit, Newman destroys his evidence. Up to the very end, the reader is left hoping for the happy ending, but he hopes in vain.For the romantic, this book provides an inspiring love story. For the historian, it provides a glimpse into the life of Nineteenth Century Aristocracy on two continents. For the lover of freedom, it provides a struggle between New World freedom and individuality and Old World tradition and bonds of consanguinity. With something for everyone, The American is a worthwhile read for all."},{"Title":"The American","review":"OK so it takes half the book to get to the story. In typical Henry James fashion you are completely prepared for the action. Unlike Thomas Hardy, whose surroundings tell us of the character of the person it surrounds, James wishes you to know the depth of his characters as seen through the eyes of others. This of course brings on many minor characters that just seem to disappear, but it is a view of a person as if the reader was on the other side of the mirror watching the story unfold. Yes, James is wordy, yes this is not a quick read, but Henry James has a mastery of language and story telling that is rare.&quot;The American&quot; is a wonderful love story that ends as a real life love story might end. Do not expect roses and happily ever after, it is as much a story of an ancient social system as it is of the life of &quot;our hero.&quot; And the thing that seems to get missed is that Henry James actually wrote this as a mystery, not a love story.This is a novel to contemplate and read between the lines. Good verses Evil, Noveau vs Old Money, Right and Wrong, can literature get any better than that?"},{"Title":"The American","review":"A great book. Old World versus New World subtlties. A quiet, stewing story reaches some high points with brilliant ideas of morality and fairness along the way. Virtue versus Tradition, Ambition versus Pride, Status versus Promise. If you appreciate ideas; if you appreciate characters and their circumstances, this book is for you. My favorite line of the book, about old money and old French aristocratic families: \\"Old trees have crooked branches, old houses have queer cracks, old races have odd secrets.\\" You can smell the characters coming off the pages in this book. They come alive. Their weaknesses, their strenghts, their contradictions, their fates. No longer are characters developed, questioned, and identified with, in modern writing, as they are in a Henry James novel. Although James will spend three pages describing a scene in a restaurant, the foundation he lays in terms of characters and mood is unrivaled. One really becomes enthraled in the situation, and eventual outcome. If, for some thoroughly believeable reason, you find the writing to be taxing, and have troubles with the detailed descriptions, please press on. Let yourself absorb what the author is trying to tell you. Your reward will be having read a fine novel."},{"Title":"The American","review":"This book is nuanced and subtle.The main characters are tangibleand compelling. They endure sometimespainful revelations about themselves.James does not allow the obviousclash-of-cultures theme to obscureour inner view of the charactersas they struggle to resolve animpossible situation. Besides, theprose is so fluent and soothing thatthe text alone would make the book hardto put down."},{"Title":"The American","review":"i recommend to everyone to start with the american if they have an interest in henry james, but haven't yet read anything by him. the american isn't so much of the l'art pour l'art movement as his later works, as he was pretty young when he wrote this. nonetheless, this is still a classic. christopher newman can come off as arrogant but throughout the book one enjoys him more and more. the ending is great, with christopher finally being vindicated. for whatever it's worth, i read james' the princess casamassima after this. it's a good follow-up for one who has just been introduced to h. james, although it isn't so much concerned with the old world vs new world theme as is the american."},{"Title":"The American","review":"James can be a long read. But keep in mind the time period in which he is writing and you will easily tackle this novel. This book should be on y our &quot;Must Read List&quot;. Every American should be reading about Christopher Newman.Its easily understandable today as it was over 100 years ago. We often forget our place in the world and fail to see ourselves from the point of view of others.This is the story of an expatriate in a time when America was boldly going forth into a old world, filled with old customs and well worn traditions.Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The American","review":"I had to read The American, a book I have despised since I had to read it. Henry James had great plot ideas and interesting characters but the story is bogged down and becomes boring when he goes on for about five to ten pages on descriptions alone. Nevertheless, James wrote The American with a good intent and this book creatively shows the morals of good vs. evil, deception, love, and forgiving others."},{"Title":"The American","review":"It takes forever to come. I even emailed the owner and said I needed the book ASAP, still took 2 weeks to get to me. If they would have put it in regular mail right away if would have gotten to me within a week. Really disappointed."},{"Title":"The American","review":"dis be one dem extraordinary novels where dey french people get dey comeuppance--dat' fo' shore nah! me, i hates de french people. James hisself referred to dem as &quot;perpetually holding one at arm's length.&quot; i could add lot to dat! James took he revenge on dey frenches in dis book when he make dem: conniving, hypricitaly, utterly vainglorious, pathetically aristocratic, amoral, wicked, vicious, backstabbing, unmitigatedly condescending, etc. etc. Ole James he really-really done nail dem, boy. Christopher Newman=one of da most sypathetic portraits in English/American Literature. dis a pageturner too--you got dat right! you done read dis book, now! even tho someone say James writing like watching, oh, da elephant picking up a pea!"},{"Title":"The American","review":"This book is long, but only because that's how James tells the story. It's like a soup that needs to boil all day, so it's kept on low, but when it's done, it's perfect. The book stays at the pace of &quot;our hero&quot; the American Christopher Newman. A smart, educated, rich, yet easy going, simple, and humane veteran of the Civil War and a self made tycoon, who goes to Europe to see the &quot;treasures and entertain&quot; himself.He becomes entangled in what he thinks is a simple plan for matrimony, but is really truly a great deal larger and more treacherous and terrible than that.We spend a lot of time in Newman's mind, paragraphs of character analaysis are sprung upon us, but nothing seems plodding or slow, nothing feels useless. By the end of the book we find that we think like the character and can only agree with what he does. We react to seemingly big plot twists and events as he does, without reaction, and a logical, common sense train of thought.But don't misunderstand that. For a book that is so polite and the essence of &quot;slow-reaction&quot;, it is heartwrenching and tragic. You will cry, you will wonder, and you will ask yourself questions. Colorful, lifelike, and exuberant characters fight for your attention and your emotions, and we are intensely endeared to them. Emotional scenes speckle the book and are just enough. And the fact that something terrible and evil exists in this story hangs over your head from the beginning. It's hard to guess what happens because James doesn't give us many clues, and the ending may come as a surprise to some people. And without us knowing it, James is comparing American culture to European culture (of the day), and this in of itself is fulfilling.Indeed, James uses every page he has, without wasting any on detailed landscapes and useless banter. 2 pages from the end you have a wrenching heartache, but the last paragraph and page is utterly and supremely satisfying, and you walk away the way Newman walks away, at peace."},{"Title":"The American","review":"I have this friend who hates Henry James. I can't understand it. The style is dated, in that people dont write that way today, but as you get into the book you begin to enjoy the style, as well as the plot, characters, and French/American dual culture shock that still goes on today. (For an update on the theme, look at Le Divorce and Le Mariage by Diane Johnson). I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen to these characters and the description of Paris in the Second Empire were fascinating. If you watch the Masterpiece Theatre version without having read the book, you will be totally confused. They moved events out of sequence all over the place and after about ten minutes I shut off the tape and picked up the book. You have to know the whole story before you watch them throw characters and events at you in the first two scenes that only appear 2/3 of the way through the novel, after a foundation has been laid as to who they are and when and why things happened.I couldnt recommend this more for a good read. The only caution I have is for readers who have never been to France. They may get an extremely negative impression of French people from many of the characters in this book. Go to Paris and you will find the city is wonderful, and so are the French people. These characters are not typical!! They belong to a certain class, and the book does take place 150 years ago. If this book doesnt get you hooked on James, I dont know what will. Try Washington Square and dont miss that movie, with Jennifer Jason Leigh, Albert Finney and Maggie Smith."},{"Title":"The American","review":"This is about a successful American businessman in his thirties who leaves the USA, having made his fortune in copper and railroads, to travel around Europe and to find a wife. He encounters an old friend in the Louvre who takes him home and introduces him to his own interesting wife. Mrs. Tristram takes Christopher happily under her wing, absorbs him into her circle of friends, and tells him of an old friend who'd be just the perfect wife for him - a young and beautiful widowed countess of unimpeachable descent. Christopher meets Claire de Cintr&eacute; and from that moment his one obsession is to marry her.An attractive hero, he possesses remarkable talents. In fact he has pretty well every virtue except exalted antecedents; he is, for example, tall, good-looking, urbane, well-mannered, forthright, intelligent, thoughtful, considerate, persistent, good-natured, generous and rich. At their first meeting he conquers Claire sufficiently to be allowed to continue to visit her, instead of being shown the door. Actually, his dogged audacity is pretty amazing; he simply asks her to marry him after about the fifth meeting, because he wants everything to be above-board. She says No and he promises not to mention the matter for another six months. He then succeeds in making a bargain with her mother and brother, the most rigid and narrow dyed-in-the-wool aristocrats, that they will not stand in his way or say anything against him until she accepts his hand. Marquise and marquis make no secret of their dislike of him (\\"a commercial person\\"), nor of their horror and disgust at the entire proposition. These are two different worlds. Christopher is aware of it but is confident that their differences can be overcome; after all he is very rich and he knows this is important to them. He sees no reason why sensible individuals would not agree in time to a straightforward and sensible offer.Matters seem to proceed well or better than can be expected, and when the six months are up Claire graciously accepts Christopher's proposal. A dramatic turn of events, however, obstructs their happy plans.Henry James is a joy for those who like a sedate plot to unfold slowly, carefully and thoroughly. His psychological observations are minute; his characters drawn with deftest strokes, and one or two lighter subplots fill out the general late-Victorian picture. Bigoted aristocrats, unprincipled upstarts, impulsive young noblemen, impassive secret-keepers, loquacious duchesses, these and many other finely-drawn characters fill the pages of this enthralling story."},{"Title":"The American","review":"Though nothing I've read so far compares to Portrait of a Lady, this novel is up there (with Roderick Hudson, The Bostonians, and What Maisie Knew) with his best work.Yes, it's a page turner with the standard James conventions - the European setting, the culture clashes and faux pas, the decaying nobility with their dark secrets, and wry humor.Very entertaining, and great for a summer read. I heard that Masterpiece Theatre is working on an adaptation."},{"Title":"The American","review":"What does a confident, energetic, single, self-made American millionaire do after amassing a fortune while still in his thirties? In the case of Christopher Newman, the good-natured, optimistic protagonist in Henry James' The American (published 1877), our hero (as James labels him) takes his money and makes on an extended visit to Europe, in search of culture, amusement and excitement to complement his exceedingly practical commercial past. The primary storyline centers on Newman's tireless efforts to marry a French woman, Claire, who is the woman of his dreams. Although the relationship goes passably well at first, despite obvious differences between Newman's straightforward American ways and Claire's aristocratic family, events abruptly take a turn for the worse about two-thirds of the way through the novel. Ultimately, Newman's \\"commercial side\\" is too much for the class-conscious Bellegardes to bear, and Claire is forced to reject Newman and retreat to the confines of a nunnery.For anyone with an interest in understanding the clash of American and European society, values and culture, particularly in the late 19th century, The American is a worthwhile read. While the language and style of the work are at times a bit tedious, James' classic novel succeeds in elevating a common literary theme--man meets woman--onto a higher, more expansive cross-cultural stage. Though a happier resolution may have made for a more popular work of fiction, the realistic, less romanticized ending, with Newman pensive and melancholic and Claire cloistered away and out-of-touch in the nunnery, is exemplary of our universal human condition--a bittersweet affair in which openness and honesty do not necessarily win out over the inevitable prejudices, societal norms and sometimes even ill intentions of others.One element of the story that I was hoping to find but did not was at least an inkling of how Newman, Claire, the Bellegardes or any other character in the novel go about finding a sense of \\"deeper meaning\\" in life. Newman has money but seeks an ideal wife. Claire appears to have the choice of marrying but is really being controlled by her family and ends up seeking solace (and maybe even emotional freedom?) in religion. The Bellegarde family have social status but are too embroiled in internal strife to be content. Beyond his cross-cultural (American versus European) social commentary, could James also be hinting that neither money, nor status, nor family, nor religion can bring us lasting satisfaction? If not any of the above, toward what higher objective should we all--individuals and societies alike---spend our waking hours striving toward?"},{"Title":"The American","review":"Having recently been exposed to European aristocracy, I found reading this book, as an American, irresistible. I disagree with reviewers who say there is no longer tension between French and American ideology as manifest on a daily interactive level. It's still there. Many Americans view the French as rude and cynical (not unlike the reviewer from Jamaica, New York), whilst the French, perhaps rightly, view Americans as hopelessly naive and 'gauche'. As James's book attests, this isn't a recent phenomenon, and the exploration of the roots of it is fascinating. I do agree that much of the conflict stems from class distinction, but James' own interpretative notes indicate an interest in exploring the clash of ideologies, and he chose the aristocracy because it was that facet of European civilization most &quot;entrenched&quot; in the old ways of thinking vis a vis' the new, American viewpoint. The narrative style is smooth. I thought the prose more attractive than that in 'Portrait of a Lady', for instance, which was almost Teutonic in its abhorrence of placing verbs at the beginning stages of the sentences."},{"Title":"The American","review":"Christopher Newman, a wealthy, good-natured Western magnate, has retired to Europe in order to better himself. There he is introduced to Claire de Cintr&eacute; as a representative of his ideal woman. He does prize her, and determines to marry her, though the nobility of her family, the Bellegardes, seems to preclude such a bond. His friendship with her brother and easy democratic feeling make Newman regard himself as &quot;noble&quot; as they, though of course he isn't. It's quite a subtle and clever tale; it's not quite a doomed romance, for there's little indication that Newman and Claire really love each other. She finds him novel and he finds her ideal, but would they make a happy couple? And as the book is told mostly from the viewpoint of Newman, it requires reading between the lines to see just what a bumbler the tall, rich, confident American is when it comes to European social traditions. Finally, there is deep suspense when Newman has the chance to damage the Bellegardes' reputation. James draws the question out masterfully, and provides a very correct, if bittersweet, ending. It's a fine novel of manners, written in skillful, deft prose."},{"Title":"The American","review":"Henry James lived most of his life in Europe. When he was 36 years oldhe wrote a novel about an American millionaire named Chrisopher Newman who was also 36. The novel of manners opens in Paris where Christopher(named for Christopher Columbus) is enjoying his fortune, visiting art galleries and looking for a suitable wife. The Civil War veteran is a non-intellectual who is a version of an innocent abroad. He will join the countless characters in Jamesian fictions who are innocent Americans dealing with the old world culture of European sophistication.Through a friend Mrs. Tristam he meets the Bellegard family. He falls in love with the enigmatic Claire Bellegarde courting her for several months. She agrees and then refuses to wed him. Claire retreats to a nunnery in Paris. Claire had been \\"sold\\" by her family to the rich and old man Cintre but he has died. She is used as a pawn by her evil mother and odious older brother. The reader will learn why she rejects Newman, the secret of the Bellegarde family and gain an appreciate of what society was like in the 1870s in Paris.A secondary plot deals with the young Valentin Bellegarde who fights a duel over a prostitute. He befriends Newman introducing him to his formidable mother and brother.The book is very understandable \\"The American\\" is not like the later James works of\\"The Wings of the Dove, \\"The Ambassadors\\", and \\"The Golden Bowl\\" with their dense prose and convoluted pyschological style of probing the consciousness of the major characters.Henry James was a genius who sought to understand the human heart. In this novel of 1876 the master has produced a fine book. This book is a good introduction to the world of James. Recommended."},{"Title":"The American","review":"Why read Henry James? He can be quite difficult, and his 19th century world was so very different from ours... or was it? This novel, among other things, poses an eternally relevant question: Can money buy everything? Like Edith Wharton, young Henry James was fascinated by the precise effects of wealth, power and social position on interpersonal relationships. He gives us a character, Christopher Newman, who he calls \\"a powerful specimen of an American\\" - a tall, handsome, charming, intelligent self-made businessman of incredible personal wealth. He comes to Europe to find the one thing he hasn't got -- a perfect wife, \\"the best article in the market.\\" He settles in Paris and is befriended by The Tristams, two unhappily married expatriates. The husband is too much of a boor for Newman to tolerate much, but he develops a friendship with Mrs. Tristam, who claims she knows the perfect woman for Newman: a widow from a semi-impoverished aristocratic family. Claire de Cintre is everything Newman is looking for, and he falls in love during a slow courtship consisting of chilly fireside teas with her creepy family, who make it clear that he is a totally undesirable suitor, in spite of his vast wealth. The mere fact that he has had to WORK for his money renders him too \\"vulgar\\" to even consider marrying into a family with the blood of archdukes, no matter how hard up they are. It's seriously strange to even imagine a world where great wealth could be seriously second-guessed in such a way. Yet James seems to suggest there is something laudable in even such extreme snobbery. \\"I must say, to give the Devil his due, there is something rather fine in that...They wanted your money, but they have given you up for an idea.\\" James, an expatriate himself, foresaw the 20th century American Empire and the triumph of pure filthy lucre over corrupt aristocracy, and (also like Edith Wharton) he was ambivalent about it. This is an early James and easier to read, and much less complex, than his later greater novels like \\"Portrait of a Lady\\" and \\"Wings of the Dove.\\" But it's worth the modicum of effort, because the ending of the story hints at his potential for deeper psychological subtlety and ambiguity. Did Mrs. Tristam deliberately set Newman up with a woman she knew was unavailable because she was in love with him herself? And how much did that very unattainability influence Newman's attraction? \\"I don't believe you would have been happy... I wanted very much to see, first, whether such a marriage could actually take place; second, what would happen if it should take place.\\" -- \\"Say I should have been miserable then; it's a misery I should have preferred to any happiness.\\""},{"Title":"The American","review":"If you haven't read this book yet and don't want to know how it ends, then don't read Jim Gallen's review, &quot;A Romance for the Unromantic&quot;.

He is a leader in his field and is loved and well-respected by all who know him or know of him. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants help in teaching people.

It's probably the book setting that enables him to do this as I've not read any of his other works.All-in-all, it's a book that has changed my attitude about teaching and opened up my mind so much that I would call this an essential for any teacher and anyone who will ever teach, which is probably all of us."},{"Title":"Teach Ye Diligently","review":"This book was very helpful and and some good stories in it.

These numerous interviews, when transcribed, were then distributed to all of the contributors as an aid in crafting their individual chapters. This grounding in personal accounts of the musicians under review helps give the book an authoritative quality, albeit one laden with frequent long quotations and, at times, a rather congested prose style. But this is a minor flaw in what is surely a \\"classic\\" in the field of the history of jazz.The 15 chapters, organized by the three cities, are the following:New Orleans1. New Orleans Music by William Russell and Stephen W. Smith2. White New Orleans by Charles Edward Smith3. King Oliver and his Creole Jazz Band by Frederic Ramsey, Jr.Chicago4. Blues by E. Simms Campell5. Louis Armstrong by William Russell6. Bix Beiderbecke by Edward J. Nichols7. The Austin High School Gang by Charles Edward Smith8. Boogie Woogie by William RussellNew York9.

Land of Dreams by Charles Edward Smith14. Hot Collecting by Stephen W. Smith15. Consider the Critics by Roger Pryor DodgeFor this reviewer, one of the strongest essays was William Russell's on Boogie Woogie. While concentrating primarily on some of the best-known pianists of this style including Jimmy Yancey, Meade Lux Lewis, Albert Ammons, \\"Pine Top\\" Smith, \\"Cripple Clarence\\" Lofton,and Pete Johnson, Russell thankfully does not neglect several gifted but often-overlooked boogie woogie pianists, including Montana Taylor, Romeo Nelson,Charlie Spand, and Will Ezell.Among the other highly informative essays are those on the white jazz performers in Chicago collectively known as the Austin High School Gang, the highly praised and copied cornetist, Bix Beiderbecke, as well as excellent descriptions of the jazz styles of Louis Armstrong and his mentor, King Oliver.The book's value to the jazz fan is greatly augmented by the inclusion of 32 pages of black and white photographs of many of the individual musicians and their bands that are covered in detail in this book.The final two chapters, those on what was then known as \\"hot collecting\\" of jazz records and several issues of concern to music critics about jazz and its place in the arts in the late 1930s, will probably be of less interest to most readers today, except as a revealing look into the sort of issues that concerned jazz historians in 1939.Highly recommended for anyone wishing to expand knowledge of the early decades of jazz and its evolution from New Orleans to its later developments in both Chicago and New York City."},{"Title":"Jazzmen","review":"Great book (scarce); pleased to find it; described accurately; nice service; thanks.

He specifically referenced the chapter on editing. I liked Whittaker's writing style and approach. Whittaker covers many, many topics with a good overview and enough depth for understanding, but neither bogs down, nor is too simplistic. The structure of the book is that you can jump around and just read the chapter that interests you at the moment, be it editing, pre-production planning, audio, copyright and legal, etc. That being said, the book was written in 1995, and is beginning to show its age. Missing are discussions of the mini-DV video format and the newer non-linear editing software (e.g. Final Cut Pro 3.)In short, there needs to be an updating. Same goes for the fairly comprehensive bibliography (nothing newer than 1994)- but many of those texts have since been updated and are still in print - so at least it points you in the right direction. Perhaps Whittaker's planning these updates in the next edition. Mindful of that, it's perhaps best to keep the cost down with a used edition. At any rate, the book is a good addition to your video production reference library."},{"Title":"Video Field Production","review":"I just finished an introductory-level course which used this book as its primary text. The school's bookstore wanted $95.00 for this book new, which is already over ten years out of date in a field whose technology is becoming obsolescent at an ever-increasing speed.The other disturbing aspect of this text is its use of improper technical terminology I have never come across in the field nor in related texts on film production. It became so annoying I found myself correcting the text's numerous errors as I read.A glance through the book's glossary will find many key terms (some even highlighted in the text itself) not even mentioned. A perusal of the index reveals the same (however, you WILL find textual references with their given page numbers to almost all of the fifty states as well as many of the major countries of the world!) This kind of indexing reveals a very limited understanding of how a textbook operates as not only an instructual aid but as a future reference tool.The author also feels it necessary to give repeated \\"shout outs\\" to Richard A. Colla, who he claims to be a \\"renowned director\\". I've never heard of him, but Alfred Hitchcock's list of films is relegated to Psycho, North by Northwest, ETC...) Shame...shame..."},{"Title":"City Walks: London: 50 Adventures on Foot (City Walks)","review":"I bought these because I live in London and sometimes I just want to go for a walk. But you do get in a rut: same places, same views.These short walks take you into some of the most lovely areas of London, places outside the tourist attractions. One of our favorites was Holland Park, such a lovely surprise with the gorgeous Kyoto Garden koi pond and the treed lanes. We were often in Notting Hill, but hadn't ever stumbled into this area. This park is SO different from Hyde Park, so much more intimate.If you are coming to London for the first or, especially, for the third or fourth time, pick these up and see parts of London you never dreamed of."},{"Title":"City Walks: London: 50 Adventures on Foot (City Walks)","review":"Taylor uses the tube lines as launching points for these journeys--very smart--and the cards are small enough to so you won't stick out too much as a tourist as you stare at them trying to find your destination. The maps are very specific and though my wife and I didn't try all of the walks, we found the West End walks insightful."},{"Title":"City Walks: London: 50 Adventures on Foot (City Walks)","review":"I brought this set of walks to London and really enjoyed using them. They maps were clear and well-designed and the walks were fun, realistic, and retained a sense of adventure. Also it was a big plus to be able to bring a few cards along for the day, and leave the bulk behind. I hope that someday I can return and do more of the walks. I plan to buy other sets for other cities when I'm lucky enough to do more traveling. They're best put to use if you're going to spend a few days or a week in one region."},{"Title":"City Walks: London: 50 Adventures on Foot (City Walks)","review":"I purchased this for my recent trip to London, and was able to follow around 10 of the 50 walks. The pocket sized maps were easy to follow and helpful in helping you navigate the streets. However, each route, which was on a 4x5 card, was lacking in detail, so I think it would be best used in conjunction with a city guidebook. Afterall, how much detail can you really put into a 4x5 card. In terms of the prescribed routes, some were really great in finding interesting points of the city, while others (like the Sherlock Holmes route) could never have lived up to what I imagined."},{"Title":"City Walks: London: 50 Adventures on Foot (City Walks)","review":"My family and I did a house trade with a London family (a practice I recommend highly, as it gives one the equivalent of a thousand pound a night hotel suite accommodation). This item has separate cards that can be extracted and carried on a walk. I found the art work to be very clear and easily read and followed, carrying a card or two whilst walking is much less of a burden than the usual travel guide, and the cards introduced me to walks in areas I might not otherwise have discovered or tried. Of course, this is not a complete travel guide; it is quite specialized. But it is very good at what it does and is a lot easier to follow than a general map.I left my copy of this item in the house in London, for our exchangers to keep on hand when next they exchange their home. In preparation for my next trip to London (I was born there, and feel attached to the place) I shall buy another copy of this item. I most highly recommend it."},{"Title":"City Walks: London: 50 Adventures on Foot (City Walks)","review":"If you are trying to get a condensed view of London, these cards are great. They start and end at Underground stations which makes it easy to get going. They also don't look like tourist maps, so it's not entirely obvious you are a yank.But I would definitely recommend carrying a good tourist map with you. If you want to deviate from the assigned route on the card, you quickly find yourself \\"off the map\\". It would have been nice to have cues on the card as to how the cards relate (like \\"See card 54\\" on the SW corner of a card).What would also be great is a card or two of tourist tips. For instance: get an Oyster card instead of shelling out for each Underground trip. Take the bus if you can - you'll see a lot more than the dirty tubes of London."},{"Title":"City Walks: London: 50 Adventures on Foot (City Walks)","review":"A brilliant guide to London - some off the beaten track walks to discover different aspects of a wonderful city."},{"Title":"City Walks: London: 50 Adventures on Foot (City Walks)","review":"These are the best cards.

We wanted to see more of London's neighborhoods. Thanks to these walks, we had a much better idea of where we wanted to go.

I'm certain the stork meant to drop me on the other side of the pond. I'm a sucker for guide books for this endlessly fascinating city.This is a unique \\"book\\" of 50 cards suggesting walks in different neighborhoods of London. The 4\\" by 5 1/2\\" cards are sturdy and packaged in an attractive box. One side of the card displays a map of the walk, while the other side gives directions and suggestions of pubs, shops and other attractions. An index card lists the 50 walks and includes an overall map of London indicating their general locations.I'm pretty familiar with London (see my two traveler lists on tripadvisor, In Love with London and London with Kids by LiveSmall,TravelBig), and I was delighted to see many of my favorite places here, like Regent's Canal, Jermyn Street and the South Bank. But there are also lesser known locations that I'd never heard of -- Crouch End and Stoke Newington, for example. Have to go back soon!Of course, you can't fit everything on a small card. I'd suggest taking aLondon A to Zwith you, in case you want to alter the route, or cut it short and find a nearby Tube stop. And certainly, you should have a few more guidebooks, or you'll miss some great spots. For example, the Kew Gardens card makes no mention of the Maids of Honour Tea Room, down the street from the main entrance (there's a sign). It's the only place to get Maids of Honour tarts, made from a secret recipe dating from the time of King Henry VIII, who had a maid-in-waiting to Anne Bolyn make the cakes for him. In the Kew/Richmond area, no mention is made of a lovely old area and river path, Strand on the Green, where pubs have tidal doors to protect them from the rising waters of the Thames. Instead, the following cards direct you to Brixton, Battersea and Kennington, which are hardly must-sees.Still, this is a great package and I'm ready to order the one for New York City (City Walks: New York: 50 Adventures on Foot (City Walks Decks)), even though the stork didn't drop me there either."},{"Title":"Gatherings from Spain","review":"Powerful observations written about the Spanish people, culture, government, it the time of the 1840s, Richard Ford has uncanny ability to observe, understand, analyze, and then put down his observations with wonderful prose, sharp wit, great philosophy, and an obvious love of Spain and things Spanish.As an interesting aside, written at a time when England is very powerful, America young, France despised (Napoleon having been beaten by the British at Waterloo), the writing gives an insight into British culture as they saw themselves at that time.If you love Spain, if you love truly superb travel writing, it is worth working through the obscure references in some passages to be amazed at the truly brilliant writing of Richard Ford. Insights into the Spanish that still hold true today, and universal insights into travel as an art that will always be true, page after page of great reading. I liked it."},{"Title":"Gatherings from Spain","review":"After reading this book, one can learn what a British traveller thought about Spain.

In San Diego we've had the same movie reviewer, Duncan Shepard, for the San Diego Reader for two or three decades. Everyone I know who reads his reviews has cranky things to say about his reviews as his point of view is very distinct. However, the reviews are not useless. Once you learn that most of his 5 star films are something that the typical movie goer would give 2 stars to and his 1 or 2 starred films are sometimes our favorites, then it's a breeze reading his reviews. His point of view has remained true all this time.The same can be said for Kael. Both reviewers are very intelligent and see movies through their own viewing lens. We all have no choice but to see everything from our own point of view. The good news is, Kael keeps her consistent point of view, writes sharply and with some humor and is quite intelligent. As a result, one can learn about films by reading her reviews. The best way to approach this book, least for me, was to immediately read her reviews of films I have seen. Then I got a good idea of her perspective. Where she was coming from became more evident.I am delighted I purchased this book on amazon.com, the best book store around (besides Powell's in Portland but, it's in Portland, though, of course, they do have a website but it ain't the same as seeing all their books in their massive store). Ironically, it's the reviews on amazon.com that really help a person make more informed decisions about books you can't actually thumb through.I don't completely agree with Kael on her evaluations of every film. That's because everyone has their own fingerprint for their distinct tastes in movies, music and art. We are each formed by our upbringing and our experiences and our personal taste. What matters is when a person can efficiently convey an intelligent idea of a film to us with an honest perspective that remains true to her own point of view over the decades. Kael has accomplished this.I look forward to many more opportunities to dive into this thick book to explore the world of film from the late 1920's to the late 1980's. chrisbct@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"What is it about Pauline Kael's reviews that catch us off guard? Maybe it's because she's so much better at evoking a movie--saying what's actually there--that even when we disagree we're forced to reckon with her analysis. Whether or not we share her opinions, she teaches us how to respond to movies with our brains and guts and hearts at once."},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"I fell in love with Pauline Kael's reviews when she wrote that Yoda looked like a wonton."},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"Good condition and timely delivery.

Her wit, obvious love for the craft and identification of both historical and directorial trends make for a good read regardless of whether I intend to see the movie. Sometimes writes a like a girl, though - dead wrong on Blazing Saddles and other \\"guy\\" movies; otherwise, very perceptive about whether a movie is entertaining and spelling out the intended and unintended messages conveyed - read \\"The Searchers\\" review and you'll get an amazing amount of insight into the characters, story and director's intent."},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"Pauline Kael's 5001 NIGHTS AT THE MOVIES is the best short note movie reference book. Kael has the ability both to describe and unload with a paragraph or two, which is the standard length of each movie treated in the volume. Each contains Kael's summary of the main players,the plot, and typically a physical attribute of one of the actors that caught her eye. Never has any critic written so much about how actors walk or talk or carry their arms or fluff their hair or roll their eyes. And, from Kael, it never gets old and once she points it out, you notice that she's right. That's not to say that her opinion of every movie is right. She gets as many wrong as right, but the wonderful thing the conviction with which she writes. Not for the tame of heart, but for movie lovers, a greatresource book."},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"This covers - as you may have guessed - 5001 movies, and her views are clear, intelligent and valuable.

Helpful, entertaining stuff.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"Since this book first came out in the mid 1980s I have gone through no less than four well-thumbed, well-handled editions that have fallen apart from overuse. This is a compendium of all Pauline Kael's shorter reviews from the front of THE NEW YORKER, and it has perhaps given me more pleasure than any other book in my life. By no means exhaustive (Kael even made a gesture towards its ultimate incompleteness by neglecting to comment directly on GONE WITH THE WIND and THE WIZARD OF OZ), the book covers more films than you would imagine, and its always fun to see what Kael saw and what she thought about it. Her aesthetic--simultaneously magisterial and informal, Olympian and fun-loving--has been discussed, critiqued, and even criticized to death; yet there is no getting around the fact that she is not only smarter than most other movie critics but also funnier. Her reviews of works as disparate as \\"The White Cliffs of Dover,\\" \\"The Sound of Music,\\" and the 1951 \\"Show Boat,\\" have given me joy for years. Buy this, and see if you don't have to buy yourself another copy when the first one wears out."},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"My review echoes what a lot of previous reviewers have stated: Pauline Kael makes you THINK about the movies, pure and simple. When you are generally in agreement with her review, you become excited to go back and view the film in question because you want to look anew at certain aspects of it that she has brought to your attention. When you disagree with her, and it is very easy to disagree vehemently with Ms. Kael, you become an advocate for or a prosecutor of the movie she comments on, and this makes the movie-going experience all the more fruitful. Ms. Kael makes a great number of &quot;big&quot; comments about movies, and, because of &quot;5001 Nights&quot;' condensed nature, these opinions are magnified. Most critics narrowly focus on the film they are reviewing, but you feel that Ms. Kael brings a thoroughly historical perspective to each review, and she doesn't shy away from turning a single review into a lesson in comparative film history. Finally, Ms. Kael is notoriously unsentimental when it comes to the movies, and at times the you can feel that she has missed an important, emotion-inducing quality of a film because of this personal and/or stylistic rigidity. Usually, though (but not always!), upon further reflection, you realize that your emotional reaction to the film was actually more ephemeral than you remember, and that this reaction was probably induced more by the dilute but still powerful medium of film itself rather than by any particularly cogent aspect of the individual movie in question. This realization teaches you to value the films that truly &quot;stay with&quot; you more than ever."},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"Reviewing a reviewer is always tricky, especially one as celebrated as the late Pauline Kael (d. 2001). She is famous for her love of some movies, such as Citizen Kane, and her dismissal of other classics, as in her famous review of Star Wars, which she called an \\"epic without a dream.\\" She did like Empire Strikes Back, though, so you have to give her some credit. One could find fault with every critic: I find Kael's preference for Ghosbusters 2 to Ghostbusters, Exorcist II to Exorcist, and Temple of Doom to Raiders of the Lost Ark inexplicable, but so too with Roger Ebert's liking of Van Helsing while trashing Napoleon Dynamite. No critic is perfect. But Kael at times seems such a tough critic that you begin to wonder if she even liked movies all that much. That may seem an odd statement to make, but what else could one wonder when she says Amadeus merely has \\"redeeming qualities\\" or when she gives a tepid review of The Third Man? After reading her slams of such classics as The Searchers or 2001: A Space Odyssey, at times, you wonder if Kael would have preferred to have been a food critic. After all, how many people complain, as she often does, about a movie's \\"texture?\\" And she includes enough literary references to make you also wonder if she would have been better off doing literary criticism. What bothers me most about Kael's book 5001 Nights is not that she prefers De Palma to Kubrick or that she dislikes some movies I like, what bothers me most is when she is glib or vague. The reviews here are usually not very lengthy. Some get only sentence or two. And since she does not have a star-rating system, you are left scratching your head as to whether or not she liked certain films. Nor does she include running times or MPAA ratings. The book, furthermore, contains few reviews from the 1990s, so don't look for the films of QT or Paul Thomas Anderson here, though the book is useful for older movies from the 1930, 40s, and 50s. For film buffs, you must read Kael at some point. But if you read this book, you are apt to be a little disappointed with her--best film critic of all time or not. I prefer Ebert's mid-western brand of criticism. Ebert seems a guy who really, really loves movies. That love comes across loud and clear in his reviews. With Kael you get the feeling that film criticism was often just a way for her to turn a clever phrase, whether or not it had much to do with the movie's good or bad qualities. And in that sense, she was at times the most condescending type of critic."},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"Pauline Kael inaugurated an integrated, non-dogmatic era of film writing.

Fiercely partisan and often deeply spiteful, she has an energy to her writing that is incomparable. Her knowledge of film is, of course, excellent, despite the gentleman below who revealed his own ignorance by dismissing DePalma as a second rate talent. Simply because some people disagree with her, they slag her off as bitter and twisted. But, there are few more generous critics among her peers - consider, for example, her right-on-the-money review of &quot;Mean Streets&quot;.

Her prejudices and oversights are legion. Whole genres and careers are disposed of with little thought or discussion. American film (including most popular Hollywood products) is dismissed out of hand. She thoughtlessly skewers particular film actors whose work and careers have long since been re-evaluated and revitalized by other, more discerning critics (Norma Shearer is a good example). Kael harps on endlessly about the value of obscure European films that are often grainy, grim, technically inept, and a trial to watch. Her whole, 1960's philosophy of &quot;American film sucks, European film is flawless&quot; is outdated and tiresome. She can be witty, but her jokes are often at the expense of true, thoughtful insight and analysis of the films she is critiqueing. If a reader followed her advice whole, he or she would miss out on many of the great moments and performances in film history. Kael has her moments, and, if nothing else, her reviews, pro and con, may lead the reader to seek out and view the films themselves, as well as reading the work of other, more balanced critics of film."},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"I have but four words for anyone thinking of getting this horrible book: Get Roger Ebert's book instead"},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"Is Pauline Kael married?

A disappointment..."},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"This is a very good anthology of Pauline Kael's writings, but capsule reviews are very unsatisfying to those who are familiar with the strengths of her reviews as they were originally written. Kael is known for her flowing, \\"conversational\\" writing style; by chopping many of her reviews into two or three paragraphs, the main reasons for reading her in the first place tend to evaporate. In a typical Kael review, she literally layered opinions on top of opinions. It was not enough for her to simply review a movie--she had to express exactly how the directors and actors had grown (or diminished themselves). One looked forward to reading her because she had such a superb way of relating the film she was writing about to other films, whether by the same director or not, and she could intelligently speculate on how the film tied in to current events or may have been a product of them. She would talk expertly about how many films seemed to evolve out of other less superior ones and then expand due to a director's vision and desire to update a particular theme. Kael focused on what a movie is about--what it is really saying--and her dedication and playfulness was quite infectious (the many reviewers who used her style became known as Paulettes.) For a reference book, \\"5001 Nights At The Movies\\" is fun to look through; it is full of reviews but it is Kael-lite. She didn't call one of her best books \\"Deeper Into Movies\\" for nothing!"},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"As someone who is just beginning to explore the classics, I love being able to see what Pauline Kael thought about many of the most important movies of our time. Since I often agree with her, it helps me save time and money in determining which movies I want to rent (and if not available to rent, buy). All movie titles are in alphabetical order, and there is an index in the back which contains film titles, directors, actors, etc.However, the capsule reviews can occasionally be misleading. From the capsules, I thought Pauline liked (or at least didn't dislike) &quot;8 1/2&quot; by Fellini and &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot; by Resnais. But in her book &quot;I Lost It At The Movies&quot;, the full reviews are a pretty harsh pan.I also wish that she had a &quot;Best Movies&quot; list.

I agree with Pauline Kael's assessments roughly 50% of the time, but I still love reading her. She is always intelligent (even when she is wrong wrong wrong) --- and what a great writer! She manages to be &quot;mean&quot; over and over again without exactly being mean-spirited. And why on earth is a movie reviewer not supposed to have political opinions? I never understand this peculiarly American criticism. Can you review &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; or &quot;Rambo&quot; or &quot;La Chinoise&quot; without venturing into the realm of politics? Probably, but why would you want to? I don't think the type of person who makes this criticism is really looking for a dry, studied dissection of film technique, but perhaps I'm wrong. Anyway, she's no more &quot;political&quot; than any other worthwhile reviewer I can think of. This book is full of buried treasures --- quite a few films in it that I had never even heard of before. It's just a darned entertaining read, too. Every few pages, there is a laugh-out-loud funny turn of phrase. Usually a pretty mean turn of phrase but it's hard to have harsh feelings towards someone who writes, for example, in her review of &quot;Funny Lady&quot;, &quot;The moviemakers weren't just going to make a sequel to 'Funny Girl'---they were going to kill us.&quot; Or, in a review of &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot;, &quot;...so enervated, it's like a vampire movie after the vampires have left.&quot;"},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"Pauline Kael was at her tangy, erudite best in the long-form reviews she wrote for \\"The New Yorker.\\" Nevertheless, these capsule reviews she culled from her longer articles to comprise \\"5001 Nights at the Movies\\" manage to capture the acerbic essence of her style. (There are a few exceptions, such as the bare-bones squib on the Gene Deitch-Jules Feiffer satirical cartoon \\"Munro,\\" so short and bland that I wonder why they bothered to print it.)Kael was the first celebrity film critic, and still the most bracing and fun to read, although she can be extremely annoying when you disagree with her. (I don't understand her enthusiasm for John Boorman's indigestible \\"Excalibur,\\" or her condescending summation of John Ford's masterful \\"The Quiet Man\\" as \\"fearfully Irish and green and hearty,\\" to give two of many examples.) Kael had an encyclopedic knowledge of film technique and history, and she was never afraid to call them the way she saw them. One of her sharpest putdowns was of the Dustin Hoffman-Mia Farrow romantic drama \\"John and Mary\\": \\"Remember when that man in \`The Graduate' told Hoffman to go into plastics? Well, he did when he made this one.\\" And she was no respecter of inflated reputations, as when she took on Alain Resnais' revered \\"Hiroshima, Mon Amour\\": \\"Hushed and hypnotic, it makes you feel so conscious of its artistry that you may feel as if you're in church and need to giggle.\\"Kael excelled at giving readers the exact mood and feel of a movie, and when she was right about a movie, she was very, very right. She puts the finger on Jean Cocteau's \\"Orphee\\": \\"Cocteau's special gift was to raise chic to art.\\" And she was astute enough to call Kurt Russell \\"a star in the world of the mendacious\\" for his much underrated comic con man performance in Robert Zemeckis'\\"Used Cars.\\" She also pinpointed the exact problem with Lawrence Kasdan's Western \\"Silverado\\": \\"The film is so opulent it has a nouveau riche aura about it; it's a counterfeit Western, without the feel of the memorable ones.\\" The book doesn't quite live up to its title--there are 2,800-plus capsule reviews here, not the 5,001 the title would suggest. Nevertheless, they make compulsive reading. Like a giant tub of buttered popcorn, you'll find yourself consuming these reviews till you come to the end."},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"Pauline Kael is fascinating to read, providing you know that you won't necessarily agree with her. In fact, you'll probably become quite irritated with her blindness to the greatness of a film. But Kael is (was) a fantastic reviewer of film, because she never compromises her opinion, she makes you think, and most of all, she obviously loves movies. I say that she makes you think because when she trashes a movie that you may love, (&quot;Star Wars,&quot; &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;) you will start coming up with arguments to her points yourself. Thus, she does what any great critic should do: challenge your opinion of a film, and make you gain a new perspective of what made that film great or terrible. Furthermore, Kael was one of the first major critics to do this. I also said that Kael obviously loved movies. This really comes across when she gives a film a good review. Her praise is, to say the least, glowing. If she thinks that a film is brilliant, she seems almost giddy in her writing. In short, Pauline Kael possesses all the qualities of a great reviewer."},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"Mention the name \\"Pauline Kael\\" and you'll no doubt hear her work spoken in hushed tones and unwavering reverence. Indeed, the late film critic changed the way many writers approached reviewing movies. With the exception of James Agee, most critics prior to Kael's era tended to come off like high-minded Theater Critics slumming through a lower class of show business. Kael loved the movies for what they are- mass entertainment, and embarked on a buoyant writing style that gave the reader a visceral sense of a movie's immediacy with all the five senses she could muster. It was if she were a gourmand savoring each bite and describing the taste to a salivating dinner quest.She was a dazzling writer. However, for me, oddly, there has always been a problem reading Kael. Her style and shtick (she had the jauntiest use for the English language) could sometimes smother out her main focus- the movies. When Kael's criticisms were fired up, you could not get more illuminating when she championed the likes of BONNIE AND CLYDE or picked a fight with a party-pooping film theorist. But other times, whether you agreed with her or not, she could be frustratingly dismissive or obtuse and do mere \\"drive-by's.\\" I felt this way while wading through 5001 NIGHTS AT THE MOVIES. Kael's collection of capsules comments culled from over decades ultimately could be subtitled the \\"Best and Worst of Pauline Kael.\\"When chopped into smaller portions, Kael's reviews tend to read like a pastiche of ersatz thoughts and puns jotted down on pocket paper. She had a maddening inability to take just a few steps back and relive any movie from a different vantage point. Thus, you get the gist of the moment but nothing more expansive as to how a particular movie relates to the pop cultural landscape over time. Case in point is her review for FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE which she opines is \\"exciting, handsomely staged, and campy [?]\\" but writes little else before hitting the exit door. There is nothing about how the second James Bond adventure fits into the series' cannon or how the movie's cold war zeitgeist plays today. Instead we have to make do with her quickly assembled thoughts way back in 1963 that make her work seem uncharacteristically dated and out of touch. Elsewhere, oxymoronic word play pile up like \\"this isn't a good movie but it's compellingly tawdry and nasty,\\" or \\"this isn't much of a movie but it manages to be funny a good part of the time anyway.\\" Again, this was all part of Kael's shtick but if one is a novice and truly wants to use this book as an introduction to the world of movies you'd probably be left scratching your head as to what exactly does the lady mean here?Look, when it comes to literature on the movies, Pauline Kael is a must. But for a readable, on-the-money, and multi-layered take on the movies you'd be better served by Danny Peary's GUIDE FOR THE FILM FANATIC (a personal favorite and sadly out of print) or any of Roger Ebert's yearly guides. These books go a longer distance and with much plainer language."},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"Having read Kael's work for years, I find untenable the assertion that she was favored European &quot;art&quot; film over American cinema. Any perusal of her writings will indicate that she lauded innovative American filmmaking - Scorsese (&quot;Mean Streets&quot;, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;), Coppola (&quot;Godfather I&quot; and &quot;Godfather II&quot;), Altman (&quot;MASH&quot;, &quot;McCabe&quot;, &quot;Nashville&quot;, etc.) and was a discerning and forthright critic of &quot;art&quot; cinema - she does not exactly heap praise on Kubrick, she's rather reserved about Bergman (with some notable exceptions), doesn't have much use for Truffaut between &quot;Jules et Jim&quot; and &quot;Adele H.&quot;, adored Antonioni's &quot;L'Avenntura&quot; but didn't like his other work (especially &quot;Blow-Up&quot;), disliked Fellini's carny-collages, and railied against the pretentious art-house cinema mind games of Resnais's &quot;Hiroshima, Mon Amour&quot; and &quot;Last Year at Marienbrad.&quot; While she does indeed praise many foreign films - and this alone seems enough to make her a snob in some people's eyes - one comes away from her works of directors she liked (Scorsese's 1980s films, Altman's 1980's films, Satyajit Ray's &quot;Distant Thunder&quot;, Bunuel's &quot;The Milky Way&quot;) and praised the works of directors she didn't (Alan Parker's &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot;). Granted, she was often critical of popular favorities (and some of my favorities, too - like &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;) but a critic who kowtows to popular sentiment rather than exercises her own judgement isn't a critic but a publicist.It's ironic that Kael spent most of her life criticizing those &quot;snobs&quot; (like Dwight MacDonald) who refused to acknowledge film as a popular art form - that there could be something aesthetic in a mass art form - and now, people accuse her of the same sort of arrogance. In truth, she was one of the most lucid and analytical film critics of her time. When she dug into a film's themes, a director's motives, an actor's performance, or a cinematographer's color scheme, she could make any subject complusively readable. And she performed the critics' most important function (which is not panning, despite what people may think) -- she helped one see elements and ideas in films that were frequently overlooked or taken for granted and she helped you to see them in new ways. You may have disagreed with her but you walked away from reading her work a sharper film viewer than before. The only flaw with a collection like &quot;5000 Nights&quot; is that all you get are summaries, not the complete reviews, so you can't get a full appreciation of her essayistic skills. For that reason, this book should be complemented with &quot;For Keeps&quot; to round out not only the breadth but depth of her writings"},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"Pauline Kael (critic, author, scholar), is perhaps the most insightful film critic this century. Her book &quot;5001 Nights at the Movies&quot;, though consisting only of short encapsulated reviews, is unparalleled in its witty, sometimes scathing, but ultimately impartial examination of cinema (past &amp; present). Kael, thankfully, did not succumb to popular opinion, chosing to praise or scorn a movie for its artistic quality (or lack there of); she touted films that challenged and invited us to see things another way. This book isn't for the casual moviegoer looking to be pandered to. It is for those of us who still view cinema as an expressive and important art medium, instead of a vehicle for quick-fix, viewer condescension."},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers of the book in that Pauline Kael is always worth reading even when you will not agree with her opinions. It is great to have someone's real opinions rather than some tepid mirror of an imagined contemporary consensus.On the other hand Kael goes well beyond expressing an opinion. It is clear that she has a personal agenda that influences all her writings. This is reflected in her powerful advocacy of the New Hollywood directors of the late 60s to 70s which, no surprise, happens to coincide with her own coming of age (at least as a professional critic). I think it is transparent in her writing but is also overtly made clear by Peter Biskind in his book Easy Riders, Raging Bulls. Indeed she played a significant role in bringing these directors to prominence and if only half the stories related by Biskind are true, she was hardly an impartial or disinterested voice. She was an insider and on her own particular power trip. Thus, in her support of these fantastically self-indulgent group of directors she must also take some responsibility for the big-studio backlash which we still suffer from today, namely big-budget, risk-averse blockbusters dependent for success more on their advertising budgets than true merit.Finally, in common with several of the other reviewers I also would like access to the original full reviews rather than these encapsulated versions. Of course a print version would be far too big. I only have the original edition but am reluctant to put out another twenty-plus dollars just for the 90s update. But I would readily buy a CD/DVD-ROM version especially if it was (i) properly formatted for searching etc and (ii) had the full original reviews."},{"Title":"5001 Nights At the Movies Signed","review":"Pauline Kael did not specialize in capsule reviews, and in her NEW YORKER columns, any film that did not merit much more than one or two paragraphs was literally and figuratively being given 'short shrift.' The reviews in 5001 NIGHTS AND THE MOVIES were either written (kinda) anonymously for the \\"About the Town\\" section or have been largely been edited down from her lengthier reviews to make them more \\"browser friendly.\\" There are upsides and downsides to this approach. Readers still get a flavor for Kael's sharp, quirky writing style, but also get to the heart of her criticism more readily than they would have in the longer format. Yes, you can see almost immediately whether she LOVED IT or HATED IT, but some of the fun in reading Kael's longer reviews lay in following the twists and turns in her arguments. The more you got used to her highly personalized and somewhat rambling writing style, the more you appreciated her insights, which could be wildly enthusiastic, bitingly negative OR (more often than people gave her credit for) understandably mixed.Her writing often seemed like an attempt to reason through why a particular film mattered (implicitly, why it mattered to HER, but also why it might matter to other more or less like-minded souls). But even when she was dismissive of a film, she would often write at considerable length as to why it failed, why it still might be a popular success and why it may or may not matter as a cultural artifact, even if it was an artistic disaster.As some other reviewers have stated: she got you thinking. And even if you vehemently disagreed with her, either in general, or on this or that particular film, that's always a good thing. I remember, in my early 20s, getting excited over the auteur theory debate that was raging(?) a few years prior between Kael and Andrew Sarris. After a bit of reflection, I decided they were both right, in their ways. I'm nothing if not a critical mamby pamby, I guess. But seriously, there was something to be said for the film-as-product-of-an-auteur school and for the film-as-collaboration school. Both critics enhanced my understanding of film, and if that's mamby pamby, so be it.I'm glad to have this handy compendium of Kael's abbreviated writings. As noted, the capsule format makes for great browsing, and for many reviews, a reference for a more extended treatment (when available) is cited, so that researchers and new found fans can, if they choose, dig up a more exhaustive critique. Be advised, however, that many of the anthologies of her full length reviews are currently out of print. They still may be available through out-of-print services and in public libraries.If you like what you find in this volume, don't stop there."},{"Title":"The Children's War","review":"In 1939, Ilse Blumenthal's mother scrapes enough money together to send her 13-year-old daughter to her brother in Morocco. In most books this would be the end of the story, but Ilse's life is not so simple. The small, shy girl has a Jewish father and a \\"pure\\" Aryan mother, and her father is not only Jewish, he's a communist who has rarely been around. In Morocco, her kind uncle becomes the father she has always wanted but this paradise cannot last. As the war develops, Ilse is sent to her father in Paris and so begins her journey to survive a in a world where the most solid ground can turn to quicksand at any minute.In Hamburg, her mother finds work as a nanny for friends of her brother. She forms a bond with Nicolai, a boy her daughter's age. Through Ilse and Nicolai we see the world coming apart and two children forced into roles that a sane universe would never ask them to play. The result is a very suspenseful book where like Ilse and Nicolai, you never know what will happen next.With our fabulous hindsight we often wonder why people-especially Jews-didn't get out of Germany while they could. \\"Children's War\\" brings home the tangle of loyalties, loves, hopefulness, and plain disbelief kept people waiting for things to get better. And then opportunities to leave were cut off even before the war began.I understand from British reviews that this book may be the first of a trilogy. Great. I want to find out how Nicolai and Ilse, if they survive the war, survive the peace."},{"Title":"The Children's War","review":"This book is all the more moving for its lack of sentimentality. While the big picture of the horrors of war and the nature of evil is terrifying, it is very much a story of two young people trying to work out the world around them.Told in alternate chapters from the perspectives of a girl and boy who are at the outset twelve years old, it always leaves you wanting to know more. The characters are wonderfully likeable and the deceptively simple style adeptly captures their changing perspectives as they grow up. The novel is at moments life-affirmingly charming and romantic.Impossible to put down, well-paced, and suspenseful. Not a word wasted. One of the most powerful books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Children's War","review":"In hindsight, war appears to have some sort of order. There is a coherent sequence of battles, a logic to strategies and a presumption that participants understand their roles in war's panorama. Monique Charlesworth reminds us of the terrifying chaos of war in her challenging and instructive novel, \\"The Children's War.\\" As the title promises, her novel delves into the psychological horrors children experience as unwilling victims of war's impersonal evils. Because her protagonists are early adolescents at the onset of World War II, they simply cannot fathom the complex series of variables that have engulfed their parents and compelled these adults to decide courses of behaviors that will indelibly stain their children's lives. Charlesworth writes with dignity, strength and courage; her characters are suffused with an integrity that has been forged out of incomprehensible loss and stunning resolve.Both Ilse and Nicolai, the two youths around whom the narrative of \\"The Children's War\\" pivots, are children in exile. Though Nicolai lives in a comfortable German home, he is emotionally removed from his amoral mother and devastated by his father's absence. His self-induced exile from family presages an even more serious existential alienation from the fascist mentality that has overtaken his country. Sensitive, introspective and doubtful, Nicolai contrasts starkly from the goose-stepping, depersonalized youth that the Nazi regime was in the process of creating.Half-Jewish Ilse repeatedly is torn between her mother and father. The latter, an ideologically pure anti-facist, is aloof and often absent, yet it is with him that Ilse must survive. She would have rather chosen her mother, who in an act of self-sacrifice and love, expatriated her daughter and then, after Ilse was gone, sought to bring her back to Germany so that their fates would be intertwined. Ilse's resiliency is remarkable, all the more so given her innocence and her reluctant absorption into cultures alien to her identity. First in Africa and then in Vichy France, Ilse not only must come to grips with spiritual displacement, but she must survive. After survival comes a search for meaning, one she creates out of valiant acts of rebellion and resistance.Ilse's mother navigates the war years without certainties, a living set of contradictory decisions for which she has had no ethical training, no prior set of experiences through which she could gain understanding. She gives up her daughter in order to save her. She bestows protection and loving care on another family's children while relinquishing her own daughter to an ordeal most adults are incapable of facing. She denies her identity, her past and even her love for her husband in order to live.Chaos and confusion course through \\"The Children's War.\\" Monique Charlesworth never stoops to bromides and tidy resolutions; instead, she compels her readers to confront the harrowing fear and grinding panic children face during the extreme pressures of war. Her characters encounter infidelity, corruption, moral capitulation, defiance, resistance and fading hopes on a daily basis. That they can survive is testimony to the deepest drives humans could have: the need to understand and to act."},{"Title":"The Children's War","review":"This is a great novel that I strongly recommend. It's a coming-of-age story, but it's also a story of World War II. Charlesworth does an excellent job of bringing to life the years of the war from the point of view of two children who turn into teenagers and ultimately adults during the conflict. This is not the war of statesmen and soldiers. It's war as it affects regular kids and regular people--people with little knowledge or understanding of what their leaders are doing. As readers, we can easily feel the confusion, fear, uncertainty, and pain of the protagonists. Ilse, the half-Jewish girl, just wants to be with her mother; Nicolai, the German boy, has no interest in being a Nazi or fighting for the Fuhrer. But war will test them without regard for their hopes or their young age.Charlesworth doesn't shy away from describing some of the horrors of the war. But there's nothing gratuitous here, and Charlesworth stays away from tearjerking scenes. If I have one complaint, it's that the initial setup of the book--the parallel stories of Ilse and Nicolai--is not continued throughout the book. Gradually, we read more and more about Ilse and less about Nicolai. This is really Ilse's story, and some readers will wish that the Nicolai character had been given the same depth as Ilse. By the end of the book, the Nicolai character becomes almost irrelevant. The book could stand on its own just as a story of Ilse. But this is a minor complaint. Overall, the novel is a great read."},{"Title":"The Children's War","review":"In this novel, the author takes several fictional characters and navigates them through the WWII. In many ways, this is a slightly different view of the war as most books (at least that ones that I have read) about the Holocaust. It doesn't really give an overall perspective of how the war progressed in a distinct timeline. Instead, switching between two main character who have vastly different experiences, you only know what they know.These two characters whose lives the book center around are both teenagers, a girl named Ilse and a boy name Nicolai. Ilse has a jewish father and an lutheran mother (I'm purposefully not saying a german mother and jewish father, as her father IS german, he's a german jew). She is sent away for safety, and spends the majority of the book in France in various situations.Nicolai, on the other hand, is the son of a well-off German family. His father is (reluctantly) in the army, and his 1/2 brother is in the SS. He spends the entirety of the book in Hamburg, Germany. His connection to Ilse is through her mother, Lore, who works as his sister's nursemaid.The other thing that I found different about this book is that the author chose to not focus on the jews and their religion. Ilse is 1/2 jewish, but hasn't been raised at all religiously and really knows very little about it. Many of her aquaintances are Jewish, but there is little discussion of the faith. There is less about the persecution of the jews, and more about the lives of everyone who found themselves involved with the war. Through their journeys, Ilse and Nicolai meet up with many different people in different situations. Obviously, they are fiction, but it really does give you a different perspective.Beyond perspective, the book is well-written and rivetting. I found that I didn't immediately get into it, but once I did, I couldn't put it down. It's moving and very real without being corny and overdone. You really care about the characters, while seeing their flaws. Even though we know how the war turned out, you find yourself emotionally invested in these characters."},{"Title":"The Children's War","review":"This is a splendid book, covering many facets of the Nazi rise to power, but told from the viewpoints of the children, both in Germany and France.

This is one of the few Slovene courses available in Englisg, and unfortunately it's not enough.The vocabulary introduced in this course is the main problem. While the average language course in the Colloquial series introduces well over 1000 words, this course is well below 800. Compared to some of the other Colloquial books on Slavic languages, the vocabulary is down by 50%. This means that the learner is left with a very limited vocabulary.The grammar is introduced at a very slow pace. There are obvious advantages to this approach, but at the same time it means that it only touches upon the most basic points, and is likely to leave the learner confused when he approaches actual Slovene.You'd better buy the tapes, because this book does not show the stress of words nor the different pronunciations of the letter 'e'.To sum it all upWhat is good with this book- It is easy to use.- The dialouges are modern and relevantWhat is bad with this book- The grammar is incomplete- The vocabulary introduced is very limitedThis book would not be bad at all as part one of a course in Slovene, or as a short introduction, but it is not a full language course.

I converted the tapes to audio-CD and spend time mimicking the exact style of the different persons speaking in each lesson. This has greatly reduced my accent.

The aim of this review is to illustrate its shortcomings and suggest improvements that could be made.Problem 1 - no accentsThis problem alone is enough to render the book almost useless. In Slovene, any syllable of a word may be stressed. Get it wrong and you may end up saying a completely different word. This is especially evident in the case of the letter 'e', representing different sounds in Slovene. Apart from being stressed or unstressed, it can be an open e or a closed e. It might also be a schwa sound, the sound found in words such as English 'the'. In other words, how will you pronounce the common word 'vecer' (evening)? There are eight(!) options available... And what about the word 'svet'? Is it the Slovene word for 'holy' or for 'advice'? Almost all courses and books on Slovene make use of accents to indicate the pronunciation, since it is impossible to predict. The only two exceptions are this book and Teach Yourself Slovene by the same author. I never thought I'd say a language course in which you will have to guess the pronunciation of each and every word.Problem 2 - Very limited vocabularyThe reviewer Gwilym mentioned how very limited the vocabulary of this course is compared to Colloquial Czech. The same goes for almost all the Colloquial courses on Slavic languages. Colloquial Czech, Colloquial Ukrainian, Colloquial Bulgarian, Colloquial Slovak, Colloquial Russian are all excellent courses with a well-suited vocabulary. Colloquial Serbian is decent enough. Only Colloquial Polish and Colloquial Croatian are a bit off the mark and then Colloquial Slovene that cannot even be compared to the other courses.So only 1 star to this course, that star is for a decent (but not great) explanation of the grammar. Two stars off for the very limited vocabulary and two more for the lack of accents.I'm glad that Routledge offers many excellent courses in Slavic languages and I can only hope that they will one day publish a Slovene course worhty of their reputation."},{"Title":"Colloquial Slovene: A Complete Language Course (Colloquial Series)","review":"And I didn't buy the book (KEEP READING), I just want to help some of you to understand that stressing vowels differently is really not important..as written in few other reviews (low stars ones). it's very easy to attack someone not doing they're job adequately and be blind at the same time.

For this reason, you would expect Colloquial Slovene to be slightly longer than courses for closely related languages, such as Colloquial Serbian or Colloquial Czech, not considerably shorter and with an almost non-existent coverage of the grammar. This is a serious flaw, as you will end this course without the slightest idea about how such a crucial thing as verbal aspect works. If you're familiar with Slavic languges, you know that this means that in practice you won't be able to speak.2. No hints at the pronunciation. It might fall on any syllable on the word and the accent is the only difference between many words. The same goes for long and short vowels and the schwa-sound spelled 'e'. In short, you'll have no clue about how to pronunce the words you learn.3. The vocabulary is shorter than in any other Colloquial course I've seen. Compare it to Colloquial Czech, it's not even a third of that course!Slovene is one of the official languages of the EU and it's a disgrace that there isn't any decent Slovene course in English on the market. Both the Colloquial Slovene and Teach Yourself Slovene have been written by the same author, and I'm sorry to say that she was not suitable for the task. All the errors listed above are found in both books."},{"Title":"Colloquial Slovene: A Complete Language Course (Colloquial Series)","review":"This language course is the best for the Slovene language that I know. The dialogues depict everyday situations and sound very natural.The only little drawback is that there are no indications of pronounciation (accent). Therefor for correct pronouncion the cassettes are a must."},{"Title":"Colloquial Slovene: A Complete Language Course (Colloquial Series)","review":"Many of the texts meant for teaching the Slovene language are difficult to work with. This one is the easiest I have seen, considering that Slovene is a difficult language, on par with Russian."},{"Title":"Nintendo Games Secrets, Volume 2 (Secrets of the Games Series)","review":"There are 4 books in this series and all 4 are worth what little you can purchase them for nowadays. There are 10-15 games covered in-depth in each book and most of them are covered from beginning to end. I've actually emailed the co-author, Zach Meston, and he was actually the workhorse behind this series of books, with DeMaria taking most of the credit. There is actually an interview posted on the web where he discusses this.Anyways, these 4 books are a must for someone trying to beat NES games. They put the Rovin books to shame."},{"Title":"Nintendo Games Secrets, Volume 2 (Secrets of the Games Series)","review":"Amazon.com is advertising the 3rd book, rather than the first one that I ended up buying. However, if you are a retro system fan, it is very much worth your while to find these books. I find them much better than most other hint books on the market. DeMaria has proved himself time and again that he is master of the games. Even more than Jeff Rovin. :p"},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"I own a restaurant in Woodside, CA called Buck's. I bought 50 copies of this great book and sold them at the restaurant. The customers loved it!"},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"I reviewed books for years, including hundreds of \\"coffee table books.\\" This is the all-around best such book I ever saw. Physically, the photos and printing are superb. More significantly, the text is plentiful and wonderful. Most coffee table books have little or no text, much less worth reading. This book is also USEFUL; it includes recipes! A friend of mine, impoverished, still walked across the United States, from Maine to Oregon, largely subsisting on road kill and insects prepared following the guidelines of these recipes.For those of you who are inspired, and live near Santa Monica, California, the Typhoon restaurant on the south side of the field is famous for its superb insect dishes, along with more ordinary Chinese food. Munch on Kung Pao Grubs as you watch the student pilots batter their Cessnas into the tarmac.

Need I say more?"},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"Sensitive folks should be aware that there are a small number of pictures showing breasts and genitalia. This isn't surprising, considering that public nudity is accepted in many cultures.Also, this is not a recipe book in the traditional sense. There are a handful of recipes sprinkled throughout, but it's more of a cultural educational read.The photographs are fantastic, the writing very interesting. I greatly enjoyed this book and happily added it to our collection after a little editing of my own with a black permanent marker. (Yes, I'm one of those sensitive folks.)"},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"this book was a christmas present from a very understanding boyfriend, and is one of my favorite nonfiction books of all time! you get 2 different views on the eating of bugs, and tons of wonderful full color pictures. amazing stuff."},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"First of all, the reader should know that this is not actually a cookbook that will tell you how to prepare and cook your own insects, though a few sample recipes are briefly written out in the text. This book is more of a \\"travel memoir meets anthropological study,\\" about people who consume insects and the countries in which bug-eating is common. Fortunately, the writing is strong and the photographs, of which there are plenty, are fantastic. The writers took 8 years to travel the world, interview people, take great pictures, and learn as much as they could about the practical and cultural aspects of eating bugs; this dedication paid off. The book is handsome and sturdy, loaded with great pictures and yet not so massive as to be mereley a coffee-table conversation piece. I read the book with my young children, who are fascinated by the pictures of insects and the people eating them. At night I read it by myself, amazed by the cultural gems the authors have written about. While the idea of eating bugs was not particularly appealing to me at first, this book inspired me to purchase and try a number of edible insect products(which, conveniently, can be purchased right here on Amazon.com). I am an amateur gourmet cook and traveller, and this book really inspired me to expand both my culinary interests and my travel plans!I truly hope this husband-and-wife team will put out more publications as they really did a fantastic job with this one. It's a keeper in my home library for sure. Should you choose to try eating your own insects, products by Hotlix (made in the USA) are a great place to start."},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"Awesome book! Super photos &amp; text describing the taste of the bugs and the cultures behind the cuisines. For someone who has tried just a few (live Amazonian beetle larvae - tasted like coconut oil; ants - kinda peppery) it was fascinating &amp; just the book I was waiting for.Anyone brave enough to read it should take the next obvious step!Truly the perfect coffee table book."},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"I've watched shows on t.v. showing people eating termites fresh from the grond, grubs in mexico being fried, and scorpions eaten live... i was always apalled by the thought- yet strangely facinated... I bought this book- out of pure curiosity and partially for the gross out factor... but now I'm dying to try a bug!!!! (i won't go near those damn tequilla lollypops- if i don't like the drink- why should i suck on a pop- just to taste the bug inside- it's too torturous) i wish that the photos had been focused better. a lot of the shots looked like the camera had some sort of shutter problem. But the book is marvelous... full of photos and diary like accounts of each adventure... Now if only they had made a documentary... I should make a documentary- just so i can go and taste these dishes!!!!"},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"I bought this for my brother thinking he might find it interesting but ended up reading 1/3 of it before I could wrap it and give it to him!

For the squeamish: This really isn't that graphic so don't worry."},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"This is a great book! In a review I read it said that the book had a picture in every page, and at first I thought that it was an exaggeration, but it isn't! And the pictures are fabulous. It's a very enlightening book, and it provides food for thought. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"A wonderful book that takes an incredibly in depth look into the place of insects in regional diets around the world. Although I bought this book for my 9 year old, who's a very good reader, he hasn't really read much of it. I on the other hand couldn't get enough. The amazing photographs and the conversational tone of the writing makes for a great read. A fascinating book."},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"In addition to the pictures, it is fascinating to see how other people live and what is normal elsewhere."},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"The pictures in the book are amazing, both of people and bugs. I gave this book, in combination with an assortment of edible insects purchased from the Educational Innovations Inc. website, as gifts to several young nieces, nephews & grandchildren. Without exception the gifts were the highlight of the holidays - a chance to gross out friends and family while still educating the unsuspecting recipient.Even the squeamish parents admitted the book was fantastic, on so many levels.Two thumbs up, along with a tarantula & scorpion!!!!"},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"I opened the book and have found it in excellent shape, and I also glanced through the pages and read bits and pieces as I went through it. It is surprising to know how many types of bugs you can eat. It will be kept for future reference. A very good book."},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"This book has always been a big hit with the numerous public school classes that visit our museum. I only have to hold it up to get a reaction, usually a groan, but it sure gets their attention. It also starts discussions and questions even when other parts of the presentation have not. The photos are great and add immensely to the charm of the book.In general Peter Menzel and Faith D'Aluisio have written a book in \\"Man Eating Bugs: The Art and Science of Eating Insects\\" that is largely color photos. But what photos! Each present parts of a story involving the way various cultures employ insects in their cuisine. This brings up a question used by a much earlier author as a book title - \\"Why Not Eat Insects?\\" Many (but by no means all!) species of both insects and arachnids are as edible as the shrimp and crabs we Americans love to consume. We of course have to be cautious (not a good idea to eat cockroaches, despite some \\"reality\\" TV programs!), but there are a number of \\"safe\\" species that have been \\"taste tested\\" so to speak. In addition, we unwittingly consume tons of insects in various agricultural products simply because they pose no health hazard and are nearly impossible to remove.If you have to deal with children in education or if you are just curious about what other cultures eat, this is a great book both to read and just to peruse. I would think that it would find its way to school libraries and to home schoolers lists of resources!"},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"This is one of the most amazing books I've ever read. And I've read a *lot* of books!Peter and Faith's commentary throughout their journey into the delights of bug-eating is intelligent, witty and so enticingly descriptive that you really will feel drawn to savouring deep fried tarantula and stink bug casserole...honestly!The photography is phenomenal, and the intimate insight into cultures other than their own leaves me yearning for more by this couple. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"A feast (or just a snack) of insects sounds almost revolting unless of course you deep fry them or place them in lollipops or my favorite barbecued. Whats not to love about straight from the earth cuisine which is actually considered delicacies in many countries. Menzel demonstrates that every continent gets enjoyment from tasty insect treats. But because Menzel is such an amazing photographer, its hard not to have your skin crawl when you see a girl eating a spider, or women eating grubs (look like albino catepillers), or the vast amounts of scorpions runnng aimlessly around a man's feet. I particularly think the roasted termites were very disturbing since they look like rat size roaches. I dont mean to sound childish, this book is much more then just unique cuisine, its another way that Menzel is making us globally aware of our neighbors. The photography is beautiful and vivid plus the paragraphs speaking of the insects and thier importance makes you feel a little respect for things we usually step on. Menzel is once again a genious and a little offbeat (in the best of ways) with this book."},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"Very well illustrated book but somehow not quite what I was looking for. Very colourful and easy reading though primarily about the authors experiences travelling around the world and descriptive about their environment. However I was hoping for a more informative book with less illustrations and more content whether that is nutritional content or actual information on the measures to breed/catch/prepare the food. All in all a nice overview of entomophagy with illustrations and ideal for younger readers."},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"Can you imagine putting Jon Krakauer, Julia Child, and the guy who wrote Men are From Mars, Women from Venus together in a blender and pouring the result into a book? I can't either, but I think if you could imagine it, it would be kind of like &quot;Man Eating Bugs.&quot; Besides being a feast of 200+ amazing bizarro photos, the book is a convincing demonstration that some people will go to the ends of the earth to eat a tarantula the size of a dinner plate."},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"I saw this book in a nature store a couple of years ago and was immediately captivated by it's gorgeous photography and tasty subject matter. This is the ultimate \\"gross out\\" book for insect-haters and the ultimate insect-enlightenment book for bug-lovers. After reading this book, you'll see why so many other countries utilize insects as a food source and you may even wish that it was more accepted here in the US!(could entomophagy be the answer to many of our health problems?)This book was chock-a-block full of facinating info about other cultures,customs,and cusine,as well as colorful photography and stories! I suggest it to everyone, even the insect-haters :) Maybe they'll develop a \\"taste\\" for it (haha)"},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"A delightful book featuring an eight year on-again off-again survey of...BUGS ON THE DINNER PLATE! The authors search for insect eaters willing to be photographed with their cuisine and share their knowledge. The photos are plentiful and absolutely brilliant.Peter alternates essays with Faith and is consistently more enthusiastic about experiencing every taste: \\"If day-old fried chicken had no bones, hair instead of feathers, and were the size of a newborn sparrow, they might taste like tarantula.\\" Faith only ate a two inch piece of tarantula leg. Peter says Faith is a lightweight. \\"Big deal!\\" says Faith.The South African ladies' lunch group was aghast when they heard about the Chinese, who eat raw scorpions with their stingers and poison sacs removed or stir-fried without the subtraction. \\"I wouldn't eat them,\\" one of them said, as she downed her fried termites. Both groups would probably be repulsed by the New Guinea boys who eat raws grubs or roasted stink bugs for a mid-morning snack - or the Indonesian woman who likes cicada and says, \\"It's better than pig.\\" What constitutes acceptable vs repulsive food seems to be a matter of locale and culture.Obviously, our supermarkets are culturally limited, offering only a narrow slice of what world cuisine offers. The authors provide formal recipes for witchetty grub dip, fried water bugs with plum sauce, scorpion soup, grasshopper tacos, stink bug pate, mealworm spaghetti, and sundried mopane worms. Many simpler recipes may be gleaned from the text.Peter Menzel is an award-winning photographer. Faith D'Aluisio, his wife, is an award winning TV news and documentary producer. The book covers trips to thirteen countries, mostly third-world - definitely a 5-star effort."},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"Excellent full color photography. This could have been more indepth on recipes. There must be a lot more types of edible insects than what is shown here and some step by step meal preparation in full color would really help in rounding out this scratch on the surface edible insects. The book is more of a coffee table conversation piece than a chef's delight but what is presented here gives some insight into cultures and is far superior to any line drawing presentation."},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"I got interested in entomophagy (eating insects)when I found out that cicadas are ediible during the recent \\"invasion\\". I bought this book and was entranced by the beautiful photos, as well as the \\"point-counterpoint\\" comments by the authors, one of whom was considerably more enthusiastic than the other about the whole idea. This is a great glimpse of the eating of insects in almost all cultures except our own, and we're missing something by our squeamishness, believe me!The book is always entertaining and opens a door to a world we may never have considered. Buy it! Read it!"},{"Title":"Man Eating Bugs : The Art and Science of Eating Insects","review":"This is an interesting book, and the pictures are, as one might expect, lovely. Having two writers alternating commentary likewise is an appealing feature.Readers interested in a comprehensive list of edible/eaten insects (and similar little, exoskeletal things) would do well to look elsewhere. I live in one of the countries covered here, and most of the edible insects most often eaten here are not mentioned at all. (For Japan, see \\"Tanoshii Konchu Ryouri\\" [ISBN:978-4828414409], in Japanese only.)Those of use who actually eat insects would like to have seen more information on recipes, preparation, and how to obtain the foodstuffs mentioned here, but anyone else interested in the topic will likely find this book good, though written from (as the writers acknowledge) a strongly Western point of view."},{"Title":"Water for Every Farm","review":"The editor of this book butchered it so atrociously, it would flunk as a high school English assignment. While the information may be useful, extracting a complete idea from the sentence fragments, hopelessly vague grammar, and editor's irrelevant digressions and contentions requires extra labor.

There are few pages on while we where in China shopping, getting your passport, medical exam and consulate appointment, that long plane ride home! Then you flip the book over it's the daugther's turn to add her little part of the story, which is really cute.What is also nice about this book is that each page is also translated in Mandarin on what looks like a red 1 inch ribbon.The illustrations are very simple.

The content of the book is very thorough, concise, and informative. It truly is a Dr. Spock book for the older adult. I loved the sharing of personal experiences; they make one feel that they are not the only one living through this time of life as a caregiver. I also became aware through reading this book, of the importance of caring for self, even if the time needed for this is sparce. The ideas to achieve the time were very helpful. I highly recommend this book to all caregivers and also to all young adults to have to think about what they may need to know as they get older, and perhaps become caregivers."},{"Title":"It Takes More Than Love: A Practical Guide to Taking Care of an Aging Adult","review":"It Takes More Than Love is a great book that opens up a wealth of information to anyone caring for an aging adult or for someone who wants to learn more about the area. This book will help anyone with the day to day care for an aged adult. It will also explain other methods that you may not have thought of on your own. It is extremelly helpful for someone who doesn't know a great deal about caring.This is a wonderful book, including not only information but pictures and diagrams to help reenforce it.

This book covers everything: what to do day-to-day; how to care for yourself, too; how to deal with simple health issues; and how to find support outside your home. The presentation is so accessible--charts, lists, illustrations--so you can go right to the information you need on any given day. It's full of other people's stories, which made me feel like we all go through a lot of the same things. It helps you do what you need to do and at the same time recognize when you're taking on too much, and what to do then. The book also discusses more medical topics (incontinence, falling, foot care, medicines) in a way that's easy to read and makes problems less intimidating. It Takes More than Love will help both the caregiver and the care recipient live better lives."},{"Title":"It Takes More Than Love: A Practical Guide to Taking Care of an Aging Adult","review":"I checked this book out from my local library and found it to be such a wonderful resource that I'd like to purchase a copy to keep and read over.

I like the way the author/teacher takes the reader through the year, with an introduction to the children and some of the problems they may be having at home. As a reader you become closely aquainted with each child and the themes he uses throughout the year. Getting to the main purpose of his book, Ben Mardell goes into detail with each of his themes. He dedicated an entire chapter for each theme and what kind of activities he uses with his children. As he goes through these themes and activities, he also remembers to incorporate the children with problems at home to the theme at hand, and what sort of reactions they have to their new environments. The themes he uses are so original and fun. He makes sure to use themes that not only the children will enjoy, but that he himself will enjoy presenting and working with. There are some things that he decides to do that some of the parents as well as some of the teachers disagree with(the dissecting of a frozen dead squirrel)that he does anyway, and in which the children learn a lot from. I personally enjoyed this book a lot, and found all of his ideas wonderful and so original!"},{"Title":"From Basketball to the Beatles: In Search of Compelling Early Childhood Curriculum","review":"Though this book is about creating meaningful pre-school curricula, readers should not think its creativity and thoughtfulness is limited to classroom prescriptions. It's a carefully crafted philosophy on how children learn and interact with each other and adults. I often think about the chapter on teaching kids about the Beatles, or about preparing kids for group activity as I interact with my child outside of a daycare setting. I gave copies of this book to my child's daycare center, and will evaluate future early childhood education efforts against the standard set by Mardell."},{"Title":"From Basketball to the Beatles: In Search of Compelling Early Childhood Curriculum","review":"This book is perfect for teachers just entering the field. It gives different curriculum ideas, and how Mardell carried them out. What's interesting about the book is that Mardell includes the issue he faced while carrying out the curriculum and how he handled them. The book is mostly based on curriculum but there is a chapter about dealing with children that goes against the rules of the classroom. Mardell seems to speak really fast, so you just have to keep up with him saying a lot of things just on one page. I love this book, I think its a great book to keep in your library if you plan to continue teaching."},{"Title":"From Basketball to the Beatles: In Search of Compelling Early Childhood Curriculum","review":"I borrowed this book from the library at first and fell in love with it! I have my own copy now and I regularly recommend it to colleagues and students. I teach Child Development to people who are either in the classroom with preschoolers or plan to be in the classroom with preschoolers. Most of my students have very little reference to working on long-term projects with young children. Their experiences tend to be more play-based with traditional one-shot art activities in the curriculum. This book gives them a beautiful example of long-term projects in the early childhood classroom and best practices with young children.Ben Mardell writes from the preschool teacher's perspective. Each chapter describes a long-term project that he explores with his preschoolers. He does not plug a particular curriculum like the Project Approach or the Reggio Emilia Approach, although he is clearly influenced by them. He talks about the planning and reflects on how the children respond to what he has provided for him. When you read the book, it is as if you are listening to a close friend and colleague about his work. It is unfortunately rare in this field to find such a detailed description of the process of working with young children and Mardell does this beautifully. I have recommended this book to all of my colleagues and this year I decided to give a copy to each of my Practicum students as a graduation present. If you are interested in young children and how they learn best, be sure to read this book - you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"From Basketball to the Beatles: In Search of Compelling Early Childhood Curriculum","review":"I had the distinct privilege of working with Ben as his teaching assistant a few years ago, and I can say that he created pure magic in the classroom!! The way he works with children and their ideas is very respectful and provocative at the same time. Children are encouraged to try things, to make mistakes, and to learn. It was one of my favourite teaching experiences to date, and I looked forward to all that we did in the classroom every day. I read this book while working with him, and found that the real life experience of working with Ben was very memorable and amazing, as he showed his enthusiasm and dedication in all he did. And the children love him!! I would highly recommend this book to all who are interested in early childhood education, and to all who want to encourage children to do their best learning in the classroom and at home."},{"Title":"From Basketball to the Beatles: In Search of Compelling Early Childhood Curriculum","review":"I am a kingergarten teacher, and I learned so much from this book. It was amazing cover to cover. Every teacher should read this book, this man has the teaching motivation and philosphy that all teachers should have! Teach what you love, create excitement and sucess in your students. Also if you want to learn more about project approach, this is it. I love this book."},{"Title":"From Basketball to the Beatles: In Search of Compelling Early Childhood Curriculum","review":"This is an excellent book about reaching very young children by teaching what one loves.It is only natural that the Beatle reference and title would draw the attention of many. Including the Beatles in the curriculum is a wonderful way of sharing culture; it is a form of cultural enrichment.I know someone in the Midwest who teaches preschool students and has included a unit on the Beatles. Some of the Beatle themed projects have been to make a Yellow Submarine bulletin board; point out which pupils have Beatle haircuts; having the children identify each Beatle and learning Beatle songs. As a major Beatle fan, it is only natural that I would love this and delight in seeing Beatles 101 included in the curriculum."},{"Title":"From Basketball to the Beatles: In Search of Compelling Early Childhood Curriculum","review":"I am a early childhood major so I decided to read this book to come up with new ideas on how to make teaching interesting to young students. Ben Mardell does a great job in writing this book and letting us experience the type of curriculum he, along with his students, discovered. Before reading this book, I was not sure on how to go about teaching young children lessons in life that will stick with them for a long time. I was also afraid seeming boring to them and not getting their attention. Mardell showed me that by incorporating in my curriculum the subjects that I love and the things they love at that age, the school year will benefit them not only at school, but at home. He also has them doing activities that relate to that part of the subject. He not only has them reading and listening, he has them role-playing, singing, dancing, and doing project both in school and on fieldtrips. He seems not only to be their teacher but most importantly, their friend."},{"Title":"From Basketball to the Beatles: In Search of Compelling Early Childhood Curriculum","review":"I am a early childhood major so I decided to read this book to come up with new ideas on how to make teaching interesting to young students.

I like the way the author/teacher takes the reader through the year, with an introduction to the children and some of the problems they may be having at home. As a reader you become closely aquainted with each child and the themes he uses throughout the year. Getting to the main purpose of his book, Ben Mardell goes into detail with each of his themes. He dedicated an entire chapter for each theme and what kind of activities he uses with his children. As he goes through these themes and activities, he also remembers to incorporate the children with problems at home to the theme at hand, and what sort of reactions they have to their new environments. The themes he uses are so original and fun. He makes sure to use themes that not only the children will enjoy, but that he himself will enjoy presenting and working with. There are some things that he decides to do that some of the parents as well as some of the teachers disagree with(the dissecting of a frozen dead squirrel)that he does anyway, and in which the children learn a lot from. I personally enjoyed this book a lot, and found all of his ideas wonderful and so original!"},{"Title":"Here, there, and yonder: Carson & son--a Brinson genealogy","review":"This is a reprint of the book \\"Here, There and Yonder\\" by Robert W Brinson originally published in 1982. Thomas Brinson (b 1610) came to America in the mid 1600s and the book tracks the descendants of his grandson Cason Brinson (ca 1693). Cason came to Pamlico County, NC in the early 1700s. Many of his desendants are still in that area. Some of his descendants were among the first American families to enter Texas about 1821. The book has 900 pages. The author had a heart attack and died before he could do a final check of the publishers draft copy. As a result there are some errors that he would have corrected but all in all this is a great book on the desendants of Cason Brinson."},{"Title":"Dear Friend: Letters Based on the Teachings of G.I.

If you somehow were unaware that this book is just another training manual for the Fellowship sheep-shearing machine, you'd do well to move on to more reputable Fourth Way material. I'm pretty confident the author is not destined to be remembered as another Ouspensky, or even another Bennett or Nicoll, but if at all as a rather dull man who facilitated Robert Burton's appetite for predatory sex."},{"Title":"Rays Of Light","review":"This is a beautiful book of poetry written by my talented aunt and her friend.

So poignant!As a southerner, I could well relate to the fried chicken, the porch swings and the rocking chairs. A very short poem entitled \\"A Pebble\\" held a special message for me. Every family must have a \\"rock.\\"There were many experiences, thoughts and emotions expressed in the poetry in this book.

This book has many of Austen' s early or unfinished writings. Many are incomplete, and therefore incomprehensible, due to the nature of this book. Many of the letters are entertaining. As always, Austen 's writing is full of wit, wisdom, and beauty. I have not finished reading all of the stories, but the letters I have read brought back vivid memories of reading her larger works. Her classic style is always enjoyable to read, and this collection shows the beginnings of that talent. In many of the letters one will find hints of other stories. You will see a bit more into the life of Jane Austen, and notice how her talent grew. Some of these were like the \\"rough draft\\" inspirations for her other books."},{"Title":"Love and freindship,","review":"Ridiculous and melodramatic. Lots of spelling errors.

It is worthy reading it because we can learn how to use a few words to describe a person's character so clear."},{"Title":"Love and freindship,","review":"That Jane, she is such a naughty writer. For those of you who think her the height of Victorian respectability and prudence, delve into the tale where she shows her wickedly funny side.This is a collection of letters, rather than a traditional novel. She wrote this in notebooks prior to becoming an adult and it reads like the 'rough drafts' it probably was. Actually most of the book reads like a really funny Saturday Night Live skit.It is a story told through letters about a young couple in love. Naturally, one of them dies and the other is left to carry on in a cruel and wicked world. Sound sad? Not an all! The entire thing is a parody of the sentimentality that was so popular in the novels of the time. A tongue in cheek classic that was delight from the first page."},{"Title":"Love and freindship,","review":"My book club read this book and most of us liked it.

Non-standard use of spelling and grammar aside (it definitely bothered me at first, but as another reviewer mentioned, there weren't many writing \\"standards\\" at that time so I had to forgive Ms. Austen and move on), this book has become one of my favorites. It is the creative writing of a talented young author with a fine-tuned sense of humor who hasn't yet mastered her gift. I laughed out loud many times, and I recognized some aspects/characteristics/speech of characters who appeared in some of her later novels. It's definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"Love and freindship,","review":"Freindship is how Jane Austen spelled it. She wrote it when she was young and it was not published during her lifetime."},{"Title":"Love and freindship,","review":"When this ebook was first loaded, the title was listed as - \\"Love and Freindship\\". The preface to this work stated they had not corrected the spelling, punctuation or odd capitalization Austen used in these pieces. I have been told the \`i before e' rule was not in place during her time. I am not sure if this is true. She also spells - greif and beleif as such.This is a great collection of the early writings of Jane Austen. As a writer I LOVED reading her rough ramblings. She played with plot lines and character traits. So this title is not so much a full story but many snippets of ideas or writing practice. Many of the shorts contained are rough and unpolished.The first section of Love and Friendship is a funny, rambling tale told through letters. Imagine what a soap opera written by Austen would be like and you'll have it. Once you've read this collection I suggest you tryLady Susan. That one is equally as fun.Love and Friendship is a peek into the working mind of a classic author. We rarely get this opportunity and I encourage you to give these samples a read."},{"Title":"Love and freindship,","review":"This is an early Jane Austen work, written when she was a teenager and unpublished during her lifetime. It's not a great story, but is a good read for serious Austen fans - you can see her experimenting with the ideas and techniques that she would later use to better effect. The book is a romance told in a series of letters, but mocks many of the conventions of romances.My main complaint about this particular edition is the typesetting, which is done with unappealing and difficult to read block print. If you're interested, I would recommend that you start with the (free) Kindle version, or look atLove and Freindship: And Other Early Works of Jane Austen (Classic Reprint), which looks like it was typeset more appealingly."},{"Title":"Love and freindship,","review":"This was...cute. And clever. A collection of the early works of Jane Austen. The Austen fan can see Jane's sharp wit and sense of humor right off the bat. These writings are immature, but impressive for her age. Occasionally the reader catches glimpses of settings or characters that are later used in Austen's 'great' novels.Recommended only for Jane Austen's loyal readers."},{"Title":"Love and freindship,","review":"There's a reason this did not appear during the author's lifetime. It was a juvenile piece, never intended for publication outside the family. It's typically self-conscious and very knowing.

I've had a tough time finding someone else who could do minister's taxes so I decided to try it myself by buying two books; this one, and Zondervan's &quot;Minister's Taxes &amp; Financial Guide.&quot;&quot;Clergy Tax&quot; is far superior in my opinion because it really does literally walk you through step-by-step on the all tax forms in a very simple yet thorough way.Zondervan's book, on the other hand, is why I never did my taxes before -- it gives you theory, and answers some questions in the &quot;Dummies&quot; style, but doesn't ever touch down in the nitty-gritty world of tax forms and what goes where on which form."},{"Title":"Clergy Tax 2001","review":"my husband and i are a clergy couple. the first year of our ordination we hired a professional cpa to file our taxes. after coming across this book in the bookstore, we purchased it, studied it, and soon we were answering the accountant's questions about clergy salaries and taxes. j david epstein has made it so simple to understand our tax return. the work sheets are easy to use and the instructions simple to follow. every question we have had, we have easily found the answer in this book. if you can balance your checkbook, you can fill out your tax return with this book!"},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"I picked this book up a little over a year ago and it has served to open up a whole new world to me. The writing is unpretentious and accessible - unlike the NPR guide. My main criticism of the book is the absence of Sergei Rachmoninoff - this results in the book losing two stars in its rating."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"I bought this book when I started my own &quot;project&quot; to learn about classical music a few years ago. Mr. Goulding's own motivations sounded a lot like my own -- an admitted amateur seeking to explore great music. The book is a dud, though. Mr. Goulding flaunts an almost cynical populism throughout the book. His Top 50 list (and many other lists contained in the book) are arbitrary. His writing style did little to keep my interest and he really makes no attempt to write knowledgeably about the music itself. If you're just getting into classical music and are confused about where to start, try Ted Libbey's &quot;NPR Guide to Building a Classical CD Collection&quot; and the &quot;Rough Guide to Classical Music.&quot; (There's a separate Rough Guide to Opera, which I haven't seen.) These books are written for the curious beginner by people who know about music and know how to write about it, and the authors respect their readers enough not to insult their intelligence. I wonder if Mr. Goulding expected anyone ever to read his book."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"30 reasons you should not buy this book:30. Lists are subjective and probably a waste of time, which is probably why you should not read mine any further but if you do, I hope I help you29. Where is Ockeghem? Ockeghem is a very important Renaissance composer and follower of the also absent Dufay. I guess this author did not put much merit into the Renaissance and pre-Renaissance. I do.28. Three composers from the Russian nationalist school is too much. Mussorgsky is the most substantial composer of the \\"Mighty Five\\" which make up the Russian Nationalist school...Rimsky Korsakov and Borodin are extraneous with regards to this list.27. Carl Nielsen was in the ranking I think. I don't remember which number, but if I'm correct, he does not need to be here. He is a very special symphonist, but he wouldn't crack the top 50 in my view.26. Hindemith is an odd choice to include considering the lack of far greater 20th Century composers such as Schoenberg, Copland and Rachmaninov.25. The ranking of Janacek and Smetana should be reversed, because Janacek who I believe is number 49 in the book accomplished more in almost every genre than the earlier Czech composer.24. I would not put Dvorak at 12 personally. His music is fantastic, but I feel with Brahms being 6 (and Brahms is a far greater composer) that Dvorak should be a little further back.23. Where is Dufay? Dufay is a very import Renaissance composer who developed isorhythm (melodies with asymetrical rhythmic values happening simultaneously). A huge omission.22. Gluck should be in the top 20. As an innovator Gluck would be in the top 10, but his presence in the concert hall today would bring him down to the top 20 instead. He is possibly the greatest opera composer before Mozart AND a huge influence on Mozart.21. Saint-Saens is too high. Saint-Saens is a great composer yes, but he's ranked practically next to other French composers who are certainly much greater: Berlioz and Debussy.20. Telemann was considered the greatest in his own day, but there is no need for him to be listed in the top 50 greatest composers. Certainly Purcell is a Baroque composer whose music has more importance today. Purcell was not included.19. Why is there a comparison between Bruckner and Rachmaninov? The book includes Bruckner and states something in the nature that there was a choice between Bruckner and Rachmaninov and he chose Bruckner. I can't relate these composers since they never met, weren't from the same time, country and sound nothing alike! They should both be included.18. I feel it is important to acknowledge Beethoven as music's greatest composer, more than Bach (who was placed at number 1) or Mozart (who was placed at number 2). It's really splitting hairs when you get to a level of greatness like that, but putting all personal preferences aside, it is true that Beethoven did the most to change and move music to new ground. For that he is the most substantial.17. Tchaikovsky in the top 10? For most newcomers the name Tchaikovsky is even more familiar than Bach. However, Tchaikovsky should not be considered a candidate for the top ten GREATEST composers of music history. He is certainly great, and deserves to be in the book, but the top 10 should be reserved for the strongest and most consistent composers. I love Tchaikovsky's music immensely, but some of it can be very beautiful sounds lacking substance.16. Sibelius is too far back. Sibelius is the greatest composer of the Nationalist movement. I would rank him slightly behind Mahler in terms of sheer greatness. He is probably the second greatest symphonist of the 20th Century, edging out Shostakovich by slim margin in that department.15. Monteverdi not in the top 10? Monteverdi is THE transitional composer between the Renaissance and the Baroque. He is also the most significant composer of Madrigals in the history of the form. Most importantly he is credited with composing the first surviving great opera. Take Tchaikovsky out of the top 10 and put in Monteverdi.14. America where are you? There should be at least one American composer in this book. Maybe America is a late bloomer, but certainly there have been greater American composers than Johann Strauss or Donizetti. I would include Copland or Ives, probably Copland.13. Donizetti? Why is he here. Rossini is the most important Bel Canto composer. Donizetti did write a string of great operas, but he wrote more not so great ones and in most quarters Bellini (a short lived contemporary) is considered far superior. Bellini is not listed and probably does not need to be.12. Is Vaughan Williams the greatest composer England had to offer? He's the only one listed in this book. Certainly, Vaughan Williams is a fantastic composer, but England produced composers of much greater interest: Purcell, Elgar, Byrd and probably Britten to name a few. Elgar should surely be included in this book (which focuses its attention on the Romantics), I believe Purcell would have been a nice edition too. Vaughan Williams did not have to be included.11. Stravinsky is considered the most important musical figure of the 20th Century. Particularly because of his three ballets composed early in the Century. I feel it is unreasonable to not include him in the top ten. Many would rank him above Schumann or Handel, and certainly Tchaikovsky.10. Does this author really know anything about Mahler? First of all Mahler should probably be closer to the top than 17. His symphonies have gained almost as much respect as Beethoven's and in some ways express the pinacle of orchestral writing more than any other works. The thing which concerned me was the author's recommendations of Mahler's works and the way in which he described them. I recall him saying the 1st symphony was beloved for it's understanding of form and structure. My comment on that is that while the 1st may be beloved, its use of symphonic form is extremely loose, and this is not Mahler at his structural best. He also recommended the Song of the Earth, which I agree with entirely. I also agree with the 4th as a recommendation. But what is surprising is the fact that instead of emphasizing Mahler's symphonic writing, the author equally emphasizes his Orchestral song writing...which is great, but hardly an essential part of Mahler's output. The 2nd Symphony and the 9th Symphony should have been recommended in place of Das Knaben Wunderhorn and the Kindertoten Lieder.9. Not a single French composer in the top 20. Being that France has some of the most innovative composers to its credit (Debussy, Berlioz, Machaut, Rameau) I don't see how it's possible to not include a single French composer in the top 20. I would personally include Debussy in the top 10. His harmonic innovations are only rivaled by Wagner's.8. Mendelssohn at number 11? This was a big surprise to me. Mendelssohn may be one of the most well known figures in classical music, and some of his melodies rank with Beethoven's and Wagner's with regards to popularity, BUT in terms of influence and sheer greatness, Mendelssohn does not deserve to be in the top 20, probably not even top 30. His symphonies are performed often, but not extremely well regarded, his violin concerto is one of the most beloved, but his piano concerti are almost unknown, his early chamber music ranks with the best of its time until it was outdone by Schubert and Beethoven a few years later. The Midsummer Night's Dream is good (well the overture is) overall, I think Mendelssohn was put at number 11 because the inexperienced author began writing with previous knowledge of this composer's music.7. How did Johann Strauss make this list? Yes his melodies are well known, but so are Stephen Foster's. Johann Strauss would not make a top 200 greatest composers list written by an experienced listener.6. Bartok is misplaced. I don't recall which number Bartok was placed as I refused to buy the book, but I recalled him being in the high 30s. Bartok is without question, a more significant composer than half the people who made the top 30...Bartok may not be as well known, but is a more serious composer than Mendelssohn, Puccini, even Richard Strauss.5. Machaut? Where is Machaut. The French Medieval composer is often considered the greatest genius of the 14th Century alongside Chaucer. Machaut also established the Mass Proper which is the longest surviving form in music!4. Josquin is not even mentioned!!! In fact Palestrina is the only pre-baroque composer who is ranked. Does this mean the author thinks that music was not great prior to the 17th Century? Certainly for a well-rounded read and collection, one has to acknowledge the greatness of composers prior to Palestrina. Josquin was the most significant composer from the Renaissance prior to Palestrina. In some quarters he is considered more important than the later composer for polyphonic his innovations.3. Schoenberg is not in this book. His music is certainly not for the beginner, but the absense of his name hurts this book's credibility. Schoenberg is probably the third if not fourth most significant composer from the last Century. I would expect his name to appear in a top 30 of any list ranking composers' greatness!2. Borodin was a great Russian composer, but to include him and not Rachmaninov is incredible, considering that Borodin wrote very little (and his greatest work Prince Igor) was not even finished by him. Rachmaninov on the other hand has probably shone to be Russia's second most popular composer after Tchaikovsky. While not as great in terms of innovation as other Russian composers, the omission of his name from this book is incredible. He easily outshines more than 10 composers listed.1. The book is written by someone who admits to having extremely limited knowledge and experience with Classical Music.I believe a more accurate top 50 would read:50. Antonio Vivaldi49. William Byrd48. Johannes Ockeghem47. Bedrich Smetana46. Aaron Copland45. Henry Purcell44. Edvard Grieg43. Gioachino Rossini42. Gabriel Faure41. Carl Maria von Weber40. Camille Saint-Saens39. Leos Janacek38.

It's fine but hardly ideal for classical music novices who know little to nothing going in, and for those who get enthused about reading page upon page of of lists and categorzized works without much of an idea what any of it ultimately sounds like.Not to mention I find his list stifling, assertations like \\"Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven CANNOT be replaced in the top 3\\" laughable, and the obvious bias against post-WWII art music disappointing. Like most intro to classical music books, the author suggests keeping an open mind about 20th century music on the one hand to prevent being accused of a bias, but on the other hand the undertones in the writing suggest anything past the mid-point of the 20th century is no fun to listen to and too bizarre to be taken seriously. Which is an opinion, sure, but not one that should be forced upon novices who deserve the right to make up their own minds without any pre-concieved notions of what kind of classical music is worth their time. I mean, maybe I am the only one who thinks it, but Goulding's inclusion of someone like Bizet on the list for ONE opera and his omission of the likes of Schoenberg, Cage, Xenakis, Varese, Reich, Stockhausen and others was a horrible mistake and a grave underestimation of these composer's influence on the music and musicians who came after."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"How much can I trust an author who does not know the nationalities of the composers? To be correct: Mozart (on the Austrian coins), Haydn, Schubert, Strauss, Mahler, and Bruckner were Austrians. Beethoven and Brahms worked there (Vienna). Sorry, one star."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"A book for newcomers to Classical music, it acquaints you with the subject in several valuable ways. First, the different periods (Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, 20th Century) are defined and broken down. Then, significant artists of every period are defined. Then, the top 50 composers are listed, in order, beginning with Mr. Bach. Each of the 50 artists are then given a biographical sketch, an overview of their life's work, and their most significant works are highlighted. A Collecters Starter Kit follows for each of the 50, containing 5 works that provide good representation of their careers. Obviously, 5 works may seem laughable when considering Mozart, and may seem too much when considering Bizet, so expanded lists of works follow for those composers with a large body of work.Goulding treats this book as a research effort, but his personal views do come through at times (He makes it very clear that Georg Telemann and Antonio Vivaldi would NOT be among his top 50, but remain on list because they are historically important composers. In fact, in the description of Telemann you are greatly encouraged to substitute Sergei Rachmaninoff).The book ends with suggested recordings of each Starter Kit selection. This is very valuable reading prior to taking your next trip to the record store. Whether or not you choose to buy the recommended recordings, this section of the book gives you a good idea of who are the Great conductors and Orchestras, and picking a CD is easier when names like Solti, Karajan, Rubenstein, and Ashkenazy are names familiar to you.Enjoy the journey!"},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"This book makes an excellent addition to the library of any budding classical music aficionado. It is informative and presented in a clear format that gives the reader a foundation for musical exploration as well as logical direction.Much of the early chapters (&quot;The Organization of Sound,&quot; &quot;Setting the Stage&quot;) is written for the rank beginner. I found myself skimming these chapters, as will most readers who already know the differences between melody and harmony, strings and woodwinds, baroque and romantic. A beginner will find it helpful while not dry, and it's well-organized for later reference.The bulk of the book is then given to a discussion of &quot;The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1,000 Greatest Works.&quot; Goulding gives a nutshell biography, with some colorful sidebars, that gives a good overview of the composers' lives, times, influences, strengths, and weaknesses.After the bio is the most valuable part of the book--the greatest works of that composer. Goulding presents a &quot;Starter Kit,&quot; a &quot;Top Ten,&quot; and a &quot;Master Collection&quot; for each of the 50 composers. This allows a classical music newcomer to get the breadth of composers and the depth of a composer that appeals to them. That's what makes this book one that will be a long-time reference work rather than a one-off &quot;beginners only&quot; guide.Most &quot;composer's guides&quot; seem to favor an egalitarian, arbitrary ordering--alphabetical, chronological--rather than passing judgment about the composer's worth. (I guess it's fortunate for the music beginner that one encounters Bach and Beethoven early on in either an alphabetical or chronological ordering!) I find that Goulding's rankings give direction to exploring classical music. By the time the reader is through the top 10 or top 20 in the list they've gotten to know the majority of the most important composers and their most important works.It's easy to quibble with individual rankings--for example, I would place Sibelius (ah, his wonderful Third Symphony!) higher than #28, and there's no way you could convince me that Wagner is a better composer than Haydn or Schubert--but hard to say with a straight face that a beginner should learn Hindemith before Strauss, or Verdi before Bach.Ultimately, there's no ranking that matters, other than one's own. Even that's a difficult proposition. Do I like Bach or Beethoven better? Darned if I know--they both &quot;do it&quot; for me, and (to quote Forrest Gump) that's all I've got to say about that.My fault with the book is that Goulding's Chapter I amounts to an unnecessary justification of his ranking system, rather than diving into musical &quot;required knowledge&quot; and then discussing composers after laying the groundwork. Just note all the reviews more concerned with presentation (i.e., the ranking system) rather than content!He also wastes some ink on some contrived statistics based on his rankings--ranks by nationality, century of birth, etc.--that don't do much of anything that someone who cared about that sort of thing couldn't do for themselves in an Excel spreadsheet in a half hour.Buy this guidebook for its clear direction on where to start listening and how to broaden and deepen one's knowledge, take Goulding's opinions with a grain of salt, and acquire enough experience to form your own opinions."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"I knew next to nothing about classical music, but wanted to add some to my music collection. Browsing through the classical section in stores got overwhelming in a hurry. This book helped me a great deal to narrow down what CDs to look for. It's easy to read and understand, includes bios of the 50 most popular/important composers and which of their works are the most well-known, popular, or historically important. Also some suggestions on CDs to buy for various works. You don't need to read the chapters on musical history or instruments, but they are interesting and informative.This same author has a similar book on opera, too. I'm not as interested in building a collection of opera, but I plan on buying the book just to read and educate myself a little more on opera.Highly recommended as an easy introduction to classical music, or if you're looking to build or expand your classical libary."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"Of all the books I have read on classical music, this one has got to be the most straight forward. Simple to understand for any beginner, it explains, not only some history of the composer, but the most signifigant pieces that composer produced. Thankfully, by the time I read this book, I already knew a great deal about classical music (well music history in general 'cause really there are five different periods reffered to in this book, not just the 'classical' period, those being: Renaissance; Baroque; Classical; Romantic and Twentieth Century). This book shines because it approaches the reader as a human being, knowing full well that not all of us know the meaning of texture and melody, of tone color and form. Phil Goulding is a master at meeting the reader at level, at becoming an equal to the reader. If you are interested in 'Classical' music, than this is an essential book to own, so it can be reffered to on many future occasions. One of my favorite aspects of this book is its ranking of the Top 50 composers of all time, I agree with the Top 3, though not in the order they are in currently: Bach (1); Mozart (2) and Beethoven (3). My list would have Beethoven (1); Mozart and Bach tied in 2nd and Brahms 3rd. Just to let you know. Five out of Five."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"One of the best things in the book occurs before the author really gets going with the list. In the introduction, he describes how he complied the list. And it's great fun. Making value judgements seem an almost endangered species these days. Instead, here the author talks about his largely self-educative experience with classical music - from knowing nothing to becoming competent enough to write this witty book. Thus, if you are beginning a similarly self-taught journey into the intimidating and often confusing world of classical music, this book is a godsend."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"I echo pretty much all the good things said in the positive reviews. Especially Carl Nelson's review, I almost want to repeat that word for word. Note I'm not familiar with some of the other books with a similar purpose, like The NPR Guide or Swafford's Vintage Guide or The Rough Guide or Classical for Dummies or Dubal's Essential Canon, so I don't know if they're better. But I like this book.How Goulding compiled his lists is interesting. He discusses this in early chapters. Basically he was facing retirement after a challenging and accomplished career, and wanted to undertake a project. Rather than take up golf, he decided to pursue his interest in \\"culture\\" and become educated in classical music. But it was difficult to figure out where to start. Since the book he wanted didn't exist, he set about to create it. He used playlists of classical music stations, and catalogs of classical recordings (and perhaps other sources), to determine who the most-played and most-recorded composers were, and which of their works were the most-loved. This method allowed him to produce a \\"ranking\\": almost exactly the way you would rank college basketball teams! It's a completely outside-in approach, and it's very appealing. He doesn't begin with a preconceived idea of who SHOULD be where: he lets broad listening patterns tell him who's where. This reduces the snootiness factor of the book to about zero. It's an incredibly practical approach to what is essentially an impossible task.Of course that was just the starting point for his musical education. He clearly did a lot more research: there is a ton of biographical info on the composers, and anecdotes etc etc in the book; also sections on the instruments and the various genres and so forth. But the heart of the book is the listing (ranking) of composers and the selection of their key works.So: who is this book NOT for?Well, if you're already deeply immersed in the world of \\"permanent music\\", if you're a performer or music student or musicologist or reviewer or whatever, if you grew up with your parents playing opera on the stereo and you have some favorite conductors and violinists etc, this book will just annoy you. The forced ranking system will oppress you, and you'll miss the humor in Goulding's absolutism over his arbitrary divisions. Goulding uses little catch phrases to help \\"place\\" a composer, phrases which might be left over from his first learning efforts; and the way those catch phrases over-simplify will just drive you out of your mind. Frankly, you'll hate the book.The book is for the neophyte who doesn't know much about classical music but would like to learn and start listening. It's designed to address the most basic questions. Where do you start? Who is important? What works of theirs should you look at first? And it does a very nice job of orientation.I would completely ignore the recommended recordings. First, the book is over a decade old to begin with, so some of those recordings may not be available. More importantly, the book is focused on getting you acquainted with the basic repertoire, so it steers very middle-of-the-road in terms of performance and interpretation. It really has nothing to say about excellence in performance or recording. I would rely instead on the Penguin Guide. The two works really complement each other. This one is a \\"top down\\" approach, which places composers in their context and gives you a clue who to start with. The Penguin Guide is a \\"bottom up\\" approach, which discusses the merits of individual recordings and points out wonderful performances. Having two such completely opposite approaches to classical music is very helpful. The Penguin Guide is also a nice antidote to the notion of \\"rankings\\".(Of course a trip to the local library to see check out the CDs they have is cheap & easy.)Flaws?The reviewers who point out that the 20th Century composers don't get enough coverage are completely right. This book will telescope your view a little, focusing almost completely on the 18th-19th centuries while leaving you a little high and dry when it comes to Modern music and Medieval/Renaissance music. It will also leave you with no information about great recitals and concerts etc (but here the Penguin Guide helps out a lot). There is very little about what to listen for in a given work, almost nothing on the author's personal responses to the works. That's a big lack: you'd like to know whether a recommended work sounds haunting or happy, or what makes it important & special. Of course there will always be information like that in the liner notes of whatever CDs you buy: but if you're going off of the author's recommendations, it would be nice to have a sense of what he thinks.I also think the book might be something you'd grow out of. After you've hit Goulding's top 5 or 10 composers or so, you will have started to develop your own tastes and preferences: you'll have an idea what else you want to listen to, and may not need to plow thru the rest of his list. Of course, that's part of the point of an introductory work, to get you to an \\"intermediate\\" stage where you don't need the introduction anymore, so maybe that's not a criticism at all. I also find that even if I go a year or so without looking at the book, sometimes I'll have a question that will take me back to it (\\"Hmm, I wonder which Prokofiev I should check out?\\").Where do you go after this book? Well, most obviously to the music itself! (Let The Penguin Guide help with that.) In terms of books, Swafford's Vintage Guide looks like an interesting next step (I haven't read it). There are also great books of music anecdotes, lives of the great composers, etc. And I have an unconventional recommendation as well: one terrific antidote to the idea of \\"best\\" works and \\"great recordings\\" etc is the work of writer Norman Lebrecht. Check out for example his books The Maestro Myth and Who Killed Classical Music. Fascinating.But this book will definitely get you started, so you can go to the music."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"I bought this book back in 1993 because I always loved classical music but knew very little about it. I cannot say enough good things about Goulding's work. The book is funny and well-written, but more importantly well-thought-out. It is is extremely useful and highly, highly recommended for someone who wants to learn about classical music and build a collection. (FYI: As for the previous comment about Rachmoninoff, he is actually in the book, although not listed as a Top 50 in terms of importance and greatness. Goulding apparently agonized over this decision and includes a very funny section about it.)"},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"'Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1,000 Greatest Works' by Phil G. Goulding is a superb account of the masters who infused our creative culture with immeasurable richness. While we might question the rankings Goulding assigns each composer, because of personal preference, there would be an almost unanimous acceptance of the composers themselves.My favourite is Franz Schubert, and Goulding, in a deliciously revealing biography, finally solves the mystery surrounding the 3rd and 4th movements of Schubert's famous 'Unfinished' 8th Symphony. After months of research at the University of Vienna, Goulding discovered an unpublished letter dated April 6, 1822, from Schubert to his friend, the German poet, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. After weeks of meticulous translating, Goulding was both astonished and gratified. He had the answer that had evaded scholars for years. The translated letter, on page 73, reads:'Dear WolfieLast night occurred a profound event. I was engaged upon the creation of my most ambitious work, my Eighth Symphony. I had taken no solid sustenance or beverage for 72 hours, and my eyes were heavy from fatigue. As I began the 3rd movement, utterly detached from prosaic cogency by some mystical, musical maelstrom, Heidi, my young housekeeper, suddenly burst into the room and said, \\"Herr Schubert, you must rest and take nourishment. Would you like to see my dumplings?\\"Ah, Wolfie, such dumplings I saw!Whereupon the maelstrom calmed, the muse misted and that was it. Kaput.

The author ranks the top 50 composers as well as the top five and top ten works that the uninitiated should try as a starter kit for each composer. He also has a lot of fun with the book by making witty comments along the way, like his opening paragraph on Wagner where he tells us what a despicable human being (and great composer) Wagner was. I was quite unfamiliar with classical music when I bought this book and it has been a tremendous tool for discovering some of the great works by the great composers."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"One of the things I noticed when reading the reviews for this book is that there doesn't seem to be any middle ground in terms of opinion here. People either find it entertaining and educational, or they think Phil Goulding is a short-sighted, pompous jerk who has a lot of nerve trying to shoehorn these men of genius into a stupid list. But, to quote Mr. Goulding himself from the book's introduction, \\"the total population of highly regarded ones [composers] was considerably larger than I had thought. My first goal was to whittle down that number to a reasonable size. Ten was too small, one hundred too large. I settled on fifty.\\" Sounds pretty reasonable to me, and a fair number for a book aimed at neophytes.In any event, I first read this book about ten years ago, when I was beginning to put together a classical music collection. His book was the first on the subject I ran across, so I took a risk and bought it. Honestly, it was a worthwhile purchase. It was an entertaining read and definitely broadened my knowledge of the genre.One of the things I like most about it is that Mr. Goulding, being a journalist and admittedly having no musical background, comes at the subject with an outsider's perspective. He avoids using jargon, assumes the reader knows very little about the topic, and keeps things entertaining. He provides brief biographies of each composer, discusses their historical/musical contexts, and includes illuminating tidbits about his subjects from scholars -- and frequently from other composers as well. Additionally, he provides three musical menus for each composer: a five piece \\"starter kit\\", a \\"top ten\\", and a 25 piece \\"master collection.\\" The starter kits are usually an artist's most prominent works, and the other two lists are useful if one chooses to delve more into that particular composer's catalogue. It's obvious that a great deal of research went into this, and I think the results turned out nicely.Looking back, are there deficiencies? Of course. He has a strong bias for his three favorite composers (Bach/Mozart/Beethoven), an obvious disdain for Wagner, and skips over Thomas Tallis (and several others) entirely. But these shortcomings don't invalidate the book. It's still an entertaining read, and a strong start for anyone wanting to broaden their knowledge of classical music. This book is not the be-all and end-all of classical music scholarship, nor did Goulding mean it to be. It's a first step, and as such, serves its purpose admirably.

It will be better though if the author say more about why he rates it this way at the end of each composer's description. Most music lovers will agree that Bach, Beethoven & Mozart are the three greatest composers. The only thing puzzles me is the Cover of the book. The picture on the cover shows three men: Beethover, ? and Mozart. Everyone will guess the Center one must be Bach---Johann Sebastian Bach, the top one of the rating. I have read many music books and know what JS Bach look like and I recognize the picture in the center is NOT JS Bach, but JC Bach---Johann Christian Bach, a son of JS Bach. Since there is no mention at all about JC Bach in the entire book, I think it is totaly inappropriate & misleading to put JC Bach in the cover. For reference, the picture of Johann Sebastian Bach & Johann Christian Bach can be found in the book: Eyewitness Companions-Classical Music, a DK book, 2005, published by DK Publishing, Inc.

It has obvious appeal- to the neophite totally confused on where to begin, what better way to have the great ones ranked in order of their &quot;greatness&quot; so as to know where to start. But the problem is, once you introduce that vein of thinking into the consciousnes of the avid, eager to learn listener, you automatically condemn him or her to the neverending and frantic fate of comparing and crosscomparing over and over again.I was so busy aguring with myself why Bach should be better then Beethoven or Wagner that I became so swept up in this ranking so as to forget that it's the quality of each indivual piece of music that determines it's worth.There's no reason to debate who was the &quot;greatest&quot;. Everyone should decide that for themsleves, and even if their #1 isn't consider the &quot;greatest&quot;, so what? As long and that music moves them, to each his own. Rather, Goulding preoccupies us with ranking them. To say Bach is #1, to me, is to automatically render any of Mozart's music just slightly inferior to Bach's.This should not be. I realize this wasn't Gouldings intention, but that's what it turns out to be.Aside from the top three, Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, his ranking seems very arbitrary and at times ludicrous. Example- he ranks Vivaldi somewhere in the 30's(I think) but then explains that he doesn't even LIKE Vivaldi very much, and a preferable choice would be Rachmaninoff, and there proceeds to render in two paragraphs his life and top five works. Really, what's the point?And then, even amoung the top three, why rank them?I happen to like Bach the most out of those three as he does, but that doesn't mean Bach is &quot;better&quot; then Mozart or Beethoven, but Goulding had me convinced of that for a long time.I stress again that it is in each persons own judgement to decide their own favorite, and not to negate other composers in the name of rank.If only he had chosen not to rank and instead just appreciate each composer for their own unique qualities and the beauty of their music, this would have turned out far better. The great composers should be ordered chronologically, not ranked. Neophytes should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"There are a lot of books about classical music. This one is unique that it tries to rate them in greatness. However, I did not find the exact definition of Greatness in the book. For what it worth, I just have to assume that it is the Influence of the work to music history and human civilization. I totally agree with author's top 10 list. If there is anything I'd like to change that is the switch of order between Mozart &amp; Beethoven. I think Beethoven's overall influence &amp; caliber of works are above Mozart. The rating from 10 to 20 is debatable. If I have a choice, I will put Berlioz, Bizet, Sibelius &amp; Weber between 10 and 20. This means to bump out perhaps Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Mahler and Richard Strauss. Overall, this is a great book and resource of classical music. The only thing I don't quite understand is that (perhaps I miss something or my memory is getting bad) the picture shown on the cover of the book. They are Bach, Mozart &amp; Beethoven, the Immortals. But I have a hunch that the picture in the middle is not a real Johann Sebastian Bach. He sure looks like Johann Christian Bach!!! If you flip to page 96 to see Bach's picture, you will know what I mean. Christian is the son of Sebastian but he is no match to his father's greatness. I don't mean I am absolute correct. But if somebody really goof the picture of Sebastian, it is going to be a great joke to this great book."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"That is what I have done. I bought the hardcopy back on 1994 and it was just an absolute revelation. I had been keen to tackle the rather daunting realm of classical music for some time but to be honest I did not know where to start, and no framework upon which to build up a working knowledge of what I might like and dislike. I had no idea where Wagner and Strauss and Brahms fit relative to Handel, Bach or Haydn.As soon as I picked up this book and read the introduction I knew I was in the right place. This is a book written from the perspective of someone who loves music, and knows a great deal about it, but never talks down to the neophyte or over their heads. The general text is extremely helpful and humourous and contains a lot more insight than could be expected form an overview type of book. To me music has always had an element of excitement as the thrill of discovery of a new lifelong friend in each 'classic' discovered. Mr Goulding captures that excitement and never allows the weight of expert opinion to weigh down his enjoyment of many pieces derided by familiarity in many other publications. The title itself is a challenge to the refined sensibilities of the music snob who go pale and faint at the audacity of this man. Make no mistake this is a fantastic introduction to a vast range of composers and their work pulled of with wit and authority. To date, I have purchased 6 copies as gifts and without exception all recipients have loved it. Right now I am about to order his book on the Opera"},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"The high marks that this book has received from reviewers really puzzles me. Apart from Goulding's extremely dubious attempt to \\"rank\\" the great composers (an utterly subjective call, if you ask me), the anecdotes and histories of these men are written on an extremely superficial level & the writing style is somewhat amateurish. In fact, the author celebrates his non-expert status; not the most comforting posture if a reader is reading a supposedly authoritative book on a complicated subject.Beethoven is treated in the traditional manner as \\"Thor\\", the angry, deaf genius. OK, sometimes true, but Beethoven's frequent bouts of humor & his fondness for scatological wordplay aren't emphasized. Mozart is portrayed as a supernatural wunderkind; undeniably true in some respects, yet he worked increasingly laboriously on his later masterpieces, and often revised them before being finished. Haydn is pictured as \\"Mr. Sunshine\\", yet his sometimes petty behavior & none-too-nice treatment of his wife are not considered. And Wagner (of course) is portrayed as Evil Incarnate. Wagner's prodigal generosity & his occasional tender behavior towards others is never mentioned. In other words, it seems to me that to pigeonhole the great composers is rather a disservice.Also, this ranking thing really irritates me. Goulding takes the safe way out & ranks Bach as #1, as I suppose most classical commentators would. He then, however, admits that it's quite possible that Beethoven is the champ. Well, personally I much prefer Beethoven, but what do you care? Conversely, why should I care how another person would rank them? Perhaps enjoying the great composers' own individual merits without having them compete by proxy would be a better format. Incidentally, I find Sibelius, Borodin & Shostakovich to be ranked much too low. On the other hand, the unimaginative Mendelssohn & the repetitive Handel have a much too high ranking. I wouldn't have even included Palestrina.I don't mean to jump all over this book, but there are much more responsible intro-to-classical music books out there. The Rough Guide to Classical Music has a much greater selection of composers, the important works are described in greater detail, and there isn't a ridiculous ranking system. Jan Swafford's Guide to Classical Music is more engagingly written & includes many worthwhile composers left out of this book."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"Mr. Goulding's book is a good introduction to classical music. As with all things artistic, there are often differing opinions concerning taste. Mr. Goulding makes one amazing omission. Where is Serge Rachmaninoff? Can there be any doubt that this man is among the top 50 composers ever? This error is not enough to not recommend the book, however. It is enjoyable for the most part."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"I'm hoping to learn to appreciate classical music, not merely to listen and nod, but to understand. As well as I can anyway!I bought this book on accident. I researched books on classical music and decided to buy Jan Swafford's \\"Vintage Guide to Classical Music.\\" Then I procrastinated for a few months, forgot which book I'd selected; when I came back to buy it I didn't look carefully and strangely I confused it with this book!I really liked this book for about two months. It helped me pick out some pieces of music that I hadn't heard of, but that are considered to be great. So I bought some good CDs. But that's all it gave me.To be fair, this book is basically what it claims to be: a list of the 50 greatest composers according to Goulding, and brief biographies of them. It's not as funny as it claims to be, but the biographical information is good enough for starters.There's very, very little commentary on the music, or the styles of music. It says a certain piece of music is great. Then, if you're like me, you listen to it 4-5 times, and think, well, it's ok I guess. And repeat, with a new great piece of music. Would you do a routine like this with anything except classical music?That's where a better introduction to the music would say something about the key works! Hey, listen for counterpoint in the duets! Something like that, at least. But that is a much harder project for the writer.But hey, this book is fun, with a lot of nonsense about listing that's sure to help you if you're having a conversation with people who try to identify the \\"top 5 romantic composers\\" or whatever. But if you want to understand something, anything about the music, you need more than a list.I'm not even a fan of the lists. Is it really sensible that a Faure or Rameau \\"Starter Kit\\" includes 5 pieces of music, the same number as the Mozart \\"Starter Kit?\\" Of course not. A starter kit for one is his \\"Requiem,\\" for the second is \\"Hippolyte et Aricie,\\" and for the third includes probably ten works. Goulding acknowledges that it's ludicrous--which amounts to acknowledging that his starter kits (and the rest of his listing apparati) are not really that helpful. Much better guides exist, not bound by a silly \\"top five\\" and \\"top ten\\" format, to help people start selecting and listening to music.As for the discography--this book is out of date, but so is just about everything else! If you're a beginner like me, buy Naxos whenever possible, unless money really is no object. (200 CDs or so is no mean investment!) My very knowledgeable friends assure me that the quality is great. Their only drawback is that people who shun bargains can look at your CD tower smugly. Fine with me!The main book I'd recommend is Swafford's \\"Vintage Guide to Classical Music.\\"Three other books that I'd recommend ahead of this one are Plotkin's \\"Classical Music 101\\" which really is designed to help you begin to appreciate the music (not so much to fit in at the proverbial cocktail parties), Craig Wright's \\"Listening to Music\\" (the first book I read, and I'm glad it was; it's pricey b/c of the CDs but they're worth it), and Dubal's \\"Essential Canon of Classical Music,\\" which is a much longer and less silly list of major composers and their work, with a few more (but not many) notes on their music. If you're trying to build a library for decoration (i.e. that looks good, even if you don't have any idea who Enescu is), Dubal's is the book for you.Also, if you've never gone to a concert, or couldn't tell an oboe from a cello, don't underestimate the \\"for dummies\\" or \\"complete idiot's guide\\" books. I wasn't in that situation, but if I had been, that's where I'd have started."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"This book succeeds both as an idea and as a text. Let me explain. The author's idea before he began was to put together a one-volume, easily-readable work that would allow a curious adult beginner to enter into, and then to understand and enjoy, the world of classical music. This was a lofty plan. Happily, the book is a triumph.Phil Goulding is one of these people who are smart and charming, but not too show-offy smart and not too adorably cute. So the writing at all times is clear, compact, and interesting. It's an easy and fun read.The book begins by justifying itself: Goulding explains why the format of the book is to discuss, in sequence, who he ranks as the 50 greatest composers of all time. After a few pages of music theory (not too boring, actually), we move on to the composers' profiles. These are great. Introduced by a black-and-white illustration of each master, we get a few paragraphs of biography, then a discussion of the particular artist's genius, some anecdotes, and finally a VERY handy list of what works we might want to listen to from that composer's pen. There are actually three lists: a beginner's list, an intermediate list, and then a be-all, end-all list for completists.That's the long and short of this clever 600-page book. It's definitely not a college textbook, nor treatise on classical music. It is, however, a light, interesting, juicy look at classical music, brimming with fascinating observations and behind-the-scenes factoids. A bit gimmicky, but very enjoyable and useful."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"Some years ago Phil Goulding decided he would get into classical music. He found this a difficult and intimidating process: record store assistants were more ready to discuss the merits of different conductors than dealing with his naive request for \\"the best in classical music.\\" And doing it properly requires some arcane knowledge: Who came first, Mozart or Beethoven? What's the difference between a sonata and a concerto? And just what is \\"the best in classical music,\\" anyway?Some answers are straightforward (Mozart came before Beethoven, though they did overlap; a sonata features one or a few instruments on their own while a concerto accompanies them with an orchestra) and some are not. For example, there is no simple answer to what is the best in classical music. Goulding's answer consists of selecting the 50 greatest composers and 20, 10, and 5 of their best and most representative works. He complicates this by listing the composers in descending order of greatness. That he categorizes them as Immortals, Demigods, Composers of Genius, and Artists of a High Order and insists that Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart are the three and only three Immortals and that dropping the Demigods (numbers 4 through 10) down to Artists of a High Order (numbers 21 through 50) is very bad form shows the somewhat tongue-in-cheek tone he maintains, respectful though never dry or commanding. Another indication is his shorthand reference to each composer: Chopin is \\"Mr. Piano\\", Mussogsky is \\"Most Nationalistic and Most Daring Russian Nationalist.\\"Each composer's section provides a brief biography and description: what he is known for, what he is best at, and what his fellow composers thought of him. Each concludes with the aforemention 5, 10, and 20, referred to respectively as the \\"Starter Kit\\", \\"A Top Ten\\", and \\"The Master Collection.\\"Preceding this core of the book are chapters placing the composers in their time and place and mentioning those who didn't quite make the list, and discussing some of the key concepts of music: rhythm, melody, texture, and so on.The final section maps the \\"Starter Kits\\" to specific recordings. As this book came out in 1992, this is somewhat dated but still helpful. A great recording never becomes less than great even though new rivals may appear.One may argue with this approach. Restricting the best of the best to five works from each composer may be too generous to the lesser ones on the list while discarding worthy entries from the greater. On the other hand, it is likely a better way of producing a representative selection throughout the history and geography of classical music than a smaller number of composers. I found it interesting to learn of composers like Palestrina, Bruckner, Hindemith, and Rameau that a review more focused on the best of the best might have overlooked.I found this a fascinating read on the whole and an excellent \\"bathroom book\\" (one that can be read in bits at a time). Though I got it from the library, I am inclined to buy a copy. I am currently slightly ahead of where Goulding was in his early stages, being somewhat familiar with classical music. However, that's largely limited to my favorites: Beethoven's symphonies, the best of Bach, and a few other works of note, branching out slowly as I hear something I like on the local classical music station. This would provide an excellent guide to expanding my horizons.P.S. Matthew Cline, below, makes some worthy points but grossly misinterprets the author in some areas. This list of top 50 does not represent his personal preference but his estimation of the opinions of experts. Cline says he has issues with anyone who would prefer Telemann to Mussorgsky or Rachmaninov. If he'd actually read Goulding carefully, he would note that in the Telemann section he says, \\"One Telemann concerto grosso a month just about does it for me. For readers who have the same reaction to Telemann, my advice is to strike him from the list and substitute Sergei Rachmaninoff.\\" So Goulding is much closer to Cline's opinion than Cline gives him credit for."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"This is a very informative book on the development of music, the orchestra, instruments, as well as on and about the music of 50 composers chosen by a self-professed amateur after careful review. It is a book to which millions could turn again and again, and is specifically helpful in suggesting particular recordings to buy, and why.The book is also VERY populist - that makes it fun, but it also forces composers into categories then into rankings. I'm sure there are those who would screech at the pinning down of a great composer (e.g., &quot;Mr. X is 3rd best Austrian serialist&quot; or &quot;Mr. Y is France's third best composer in counterpoint&quot;!).

A large part of its charm is the author's admitted non-expertise on the subject; he does not forget that his reader is probably as daunted by it as he once was. The first section of the book is a discussion of musical forms and structures(helpful if you don't know a nocturne from an overture), followed by a brief but useful chronology of the classical music periods. Thereafter begins a profile of 50 composers in order of their greatness, as perceived by Gould. The text and sidebars are lively and humorous enough to be enjoyed even by those who care not one whit about classical music and includes a list of recommended works for those who might.I am not certain why some reviewers were offended that Gould ranked the composers instead of say, listing them alphabetically. Surely these reviewers have at least one private list ranking the greatest of some subject or other; I guess Gould's trespass was in making his list public.Also, one reviewer was displeased that virtually no 20th century composers were among Gould's 50 greatest. I believe this was because A) it can be argued that the music of some 20th century composers has deviated too far from classical models to be considered classical in the traditional sense. And B) this book was meant as a beginner's guide, and recommending Ives or Messiaen to a classical music novice would make as much sense as recommending Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot; to a classic literature novice."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"This is a very informative book on the development of music, the orchestra, instruments, as well as on and about the music of 50 composers chosen by a self-professed amateur after careful review.

It explains the different genres (ie the difference between \\"symphonic\\" and \\"chamber\\" music), explains what separates the Classical and Romantic periods, and so on. It does all this in manner that is both erudite and easily read, reverent but funny. The controversial aspect of this book comes with how Goulding addresses composers. He organizes them into a list of the Top 50, starting at the top with Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, working down to lesser-known but still important composers like Rameau or Janacek. The book then works through the list, giving a nice introduction to each composer that is, by necessity, partly biographical and partly a survey of their most important works and their historical significance. Goulding explains both why the composer is important, why he chose to put them where he did in the list, and often concedes that others might have thought differently and explains the opposing viewpoints.For each composer Goulding provides a few lists of works that are representative of the composer. A \\"Starter Kit\\" - a handful of the most important works that will serve well to acquaint you with the composer; a \\"Top Ten\\" list that expands things further; and finally a \\"Master Collection\\" list that purports to list all the works that any lover of that particular composer would want to know.Let's all admit, as Phil Goulding seems to understand, that books like this which impose LISTS are going to ruffle some feathers. No two classical listeners would come up with the same list of the \\"Top 50 Composers,\\" and Goulding does not pretend that his list reigns supreme. It's simply a useful starting point. In general terms, there's a lot that most people would agree with here: from an academic perspective, at least, Bach, Mozart and Beethoven would qualify as the top three composers for most people. Most would agree that Schumann should be near the front of the list, and Faure, though wonderful and important, is a more minor figure in comparison and belongs further down. Looking at the list I can't think of any glaring omissions, composers who definitely should be there but aren't. So while people could argue endlessly over the finer points - there will always be some weirdo who thinks Bartok should be #1, or that Tchaikovsky was garbage - it presents a fairly undistorted picture with a lot for people to agree on. I have my own quibbles; I know Franck belongs on the list, but I've never cared too much for him and would put him further down. It's also weird that there are no Americans represented; if Copland were included somewhere, I don't believe too many would cry foul. Likewise with the list of works for composers - I would have put Tchaikovsky's 4th Symphony in the Starter Kit, not the 6th. I could go on.But I expected to have these quibbles going into this book, and so should you, if you're an experienced listener. If you get so hung up on these things you dismiss the entire enterprise, well, it's your loss and you have some personality issues to work out, in my blunt opinion. If you're relatively new to classical music, I have no reservations about recommending this book to you - the lists are a good point of departure. Start there, and as you learn and grow, you'll make up your own mind. I disagree with Roger Ebert, who thinks all \\"Top xx\\" lists (of movies or otherwise) are arbitrary, subjective and stupid. The lists in this book are useful, even to someone like me, who has been involved with playing, composing and listening to classical music for almost 20 years now.How are they useful? I'll give an example. I've loved Brahms' 2nd Symphony since I played it in college. The most obvious step for me was to check out his other three symphonies, which I did over the years. I like them (especially 4) but 2 is still a clear favorite. But one day I realized I didn't know much else about Brahms, other than a few piano pieces I'd learned, and I wanted to learn more. This book was the perfect guide. Looking at Goulding's recommended works lists, I plucked out a few other pieces to check out (the Clarinet Quintet and German Requiem). It was much easier than staring at his entire list of works in Wikipedia, and I'd read enough to trust Goulding's suggestions as a well-informed expert of classical music. In a field as vast as classical music, which would take two lifetimes to fully digest, it can help to have someone who knows more than you just say, \\"Hey, listen to THIS, okay? Trust me.\\" And as I said before, as your knowledge of and appreciation for classical music grows, you refine your own judgment, adjust your desires and expectations, etc. You learn and eventually you might not need or appreciate that kind of guidance in some areas, but it's always good to have it available to you, and this book does the job nicely.I recognize the \\"flaws\\" inherent in list-based books like this, but depending how you look at it, those may not be flaws, but just something to brush aside and ignore. In closing I do have to mention what might be my biggest disagreement with the book. He devotes a section to discussing which composers were contenders for the list, or \\"also-rans\\" who didn't make it but still deserve mention and should be known to a serious listener. In the section on Americans (of whom none made the Top 50) he mentions the usual suspects: Copland, Bernstein, Ives...Cage, Reich, Adams... but no Barber? Seriously? It's rather flabbergasting that he would not be mentioned at all. If anything he belongs right alongside Copland and Ives as one of the most important figures in American classical music, and I think most people would agree with that. More than a few would probably put him in the Top 50. Bizarre.Even so, I find the book eminently useful, and flat-out enjoyable to read. Check it out."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"Classical music has a reputation as being within the purview of elitists and snobs, which can deter the 'unsophisticated' from exploring this rich world.Fortunately, Phil Goulding beckons us from ahead, having been an amateur himself with little prior exposure. To make it easier on us, he writes with an easy flair. His reasonings and explanations are cogent without being overpowering; to the contrary, he has quite a bit of fun which he shares with the reader.His &quot;rules&quot; for ranking the composers is tongue-in-cheek and serious at the same time. As a comparison, his rankings are similar to saying Mays and Ruth are the two greatest baseball players ever, and below them you've other greats: Mantle, Gehrig, Dimaggio, etc. He stresses that, rather than the rankings be set in stone, they should be debated and argued. His 'rules' remind the reader that, while it's acceptable to move people within the ranks, serious attention must be made to dropping Dimaggio's name from the 50 greatest ever (to complete the analogy).The writing highlights differences between the different musical eras quite well. Additionally, each composer's history is filled with illuminating facts, odd quirks and bizarre stories. In short, they are humanized in such a way to make their works feel more accessible.All in all, a great primer for the beginner."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"I loved this book.

Goulding is the kind of book on a major artistic genre one wishes would be written about all genres from ballet to sculpture. At the simplest level, it ranks the top fifty all time greatest composers and gives us a listing of their most important works. The author cuts through mountains of musicological mumblings and technical terms to give the non-professional listener what they really need to seek out the most interesting works to buy and listen to. This book has been my guide to buying classical music from the moment I bought it and it has not once left me down.One of the most satisfying things about the book is how the author gives us the same tabular information in so many different ways, to reveal some plain truths about \`classical music'. The two most interesting is how heavily weighted is the list with German and Austrian composers and how many of all composers came from the nineteenth century.I am not a musicologist, although I have listened to works by each and every one of these fifty composers even before buying this book and I at least find the author's rankings to be about as good as any one person can do. I totally agree, for example with the top five, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, and Hayden. I may get some urge to switch Brahms and Shubert at six and seven, but that's nitpicking. Once you get out of the top ten, things are probably a bit more contentious, but every comparison I can think of where you take two names which are 10 ranks apart, such as Hector Berlioz at 21 and Edvard Grieg at 31, and I can find nothing on which to base an argument to reverse those rankings.What is truly remarkable is the absence of composers born in the 20th century. The leading composer working in the 20th century is Stravinsky ranked at 15.The author is a political journalist and I sense that he took up the task of writing this book as a retiremet project. So, he has the benefit of compiling opinions about composers like a political polster who is innocent of their own agenda which may cloud his judgment.Aside from the rankings, the single greatest value of the book will be found in the list of compositions. If nothing else, this validates the value in purchasing multiple copies of certain works which have been considered the very best of their type. For example, I own at least three recorded versions of Bach's Mass in B Minor. And, I agree with the opinion quoted by the author that this may very well be the very best choral work ever written. I can also rest easy with my four copies of Mozart's requiem Mass (the famous unfinished Mass familiar to people who have seen the movie \`Amadeus'). The level to which both works elevate my spirit is unmatched by virtually all lesser works. And, what this does is validate my personal reactions to this music. It verifies for me the fact that many others, all with greater musical credentials than I have felt the same about these works.And, not only does the author recommend specific works, he also cites specific available recordings for many of the works. Unfortunately, as this book was first published 13 years ago, it can become quickly out of date for some of the major works. I suspect, for example, that a new recording of these two choral works by Bach and Mozart are issued each year, so I recommend you use an independent source to verify which are the best performances.The last chapter on \`The Orchestra' is great for people who know nothing about musical instruments of of classical orchestras, but I suspect it may be a bit light for those who played in the high school band or orchestra.My only real regret is that the author supplies no bibliography, although I suspect that many of his sources are probably pretty obscure from specialized journals and not too available. But, I believe the author has done a masterful job of distilling so much artistic opinion down to really useable stuff.Now, if someone could just do the same for novels and stage plays, we would be in business."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"What's good is that it's nice for a book that is approachable and conversationally written to be available to help a beginner. It functions as both a pleasant read and a good source of information for the beginner to figure out what pieces of music are best first-buys by a particular composer. But there's a big caveat here, which is that there are lots of other things that make this book an AWFUL first purchase for a beginner. First of all, no beginner's book should be so offensively and intrusively opinionated insofar as how to \\"rank\\" the composers. Ranking vastly different composers from different eras in terms of their amorphous \\"greatness\\" doesn't make any sense and is not something that a person with much experience with classical music would ever or should ever do. That Goulding admits that he *doesn't* have a whole lot of experience or background with classical music makes his attempt all the less credible. In fact, it's a pointless waste of time and will only pigeonhole a beginner in terms what music you'll be exposed to. Which is another problem here -- the list itself leaves much to be desired. This is a good list of 18th and 19th century composers, and this book should be taken as a survey of ONLY this music (and a few 20th century artists following their lead). This book has incredibly poor coverage of 20th century music and it is not exactly a small minority opinion that much of the greatest work in the classical canon was composed in the 20th century. But, this book would have the beginner believe that there isn't much in the 20th century worth hearing, and even if there was, it still wouldn't be of much value when compared to earlier composers. Personally, I find offensive the notion that someone should be steered in the direction of half of the names in the top 30 instead of Bartok, Ives or Messiaen, (the last two of which didn't even make the list) and I believe that anybody with a solid *comprehensive* grounding in classical music will have the same strong reservations about this book as I. For any beginners who like the book and the music contained within, I say \\"now look deeper.\\" You've only scratched the surface of the great music and composers that are out there."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"After many years away from the subject I decided to re-enter the world of classical music. I needed a good refresher course on building a basic library of CD's, as well as some memory jogging about the entire subject. Mr. Goulding's effort was remarkable in that it reintroduced classical music in a gentle and non-technical or academic manner. His book is easy to read and comprehensive in its coverage. For me it represented a core reference work, and fun at that. I have also used other sources of information on the subject, but I find that I am constantly opening Mr. Goulding's book just to double check other recommendations."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"If you are relatively new to the enjoyment of classical music, this book provides a much appreciated guide to the great composers and their best works. Rather than having to test a huge variety of works, this book gives recommendations as to which works to buy for each composer. If you need a basic sampler of the composers, there is a list of five essential works, ten essential works, etc."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"One of the 20 books that has influenced me most in life. Sure, I'm an amateur who simply wants to get the most ENJOYMENT and INSPIRATION from so-called \\"classical music\\" that I can. It is HERE - as long as you are not a snob. Incidentally, snobs are also a determent to the reverence and true appreciation of great wine. If you ARE a snob, go argue the merits of the various performances, etc. on you tube with the other losers."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"Being a pianist and a lover of Classical Music, I decided I should really do a little more research on the subject, to expand my knowledge of it. It seemed hypocritical to spend so much time immersed in something I had no foundational knowledge of. However, like history, I expected it to be something that, although everyone should know it, was not always interesting to actually learn about. What took me by surprise though was how interesting this book actually was. I found myself wanting to keep reading.Mr. Goulding put forth his information in a clear, non-pretentious manner that was easy for an amateur to understand (particularly if said amateur has a little prior musical knowledge, although this is not essential either.) By reading this book I was able to start identifying key aspects of the different music periods, including what changes the periods made for the music world. I found myself actually able to relate to his description of each composer. I was encouraged to try new things, listen to different styles, to learn to analyse what made each composer unique, and I was able to gain a taste for which composers appealed to me.As a musician, my knowledge of the mechanics and techniques required for each style of music has increased, and as a listener, I have been able to expand my collection, and to learn to appreciate the music more.For anyone out there who, like me, has been wanting to learn a bit more about Classical music but is intimidated by the amount of books available that are large, boring, and filled with big words and jargon - I would definitely recommend this book. Mr. Goulding has created a book that, though packed with information, is also, simply, a good read."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"So far this book has been a very friendly book for those who are not musically oriented people. I'd highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn a little more about classical music and the major composers in history. Love it!"},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"Phil Goulding's \\"Classical Music\\" is a helpful guide to the complex world of music destined to last the ages. It is a subject hard to condense into one volume; yet Goulding does exactly that, providing overviews that define classical music and the orchestra and then a chapter by chapter exploration of the 50 greatest composers and their 1000 greatest works.One can argue Goulding's order (especially so the further down the list you go), the rigidity of his ranking system, his giving short shrift to 20th Century composers (which many others have mentioned in these reviews), his omission of American composers (which no one else seems to have minded but me), and more. One can also shrug at the suggested recordings; since many of the selections have become dated. Even so, this book provides a bird's eye view handbook to classical music for those who wish to listen, learn and appreciate.The biography sections are perhaps the best--with facts and gossipy bits that are funny and enjoyable. There are many placements of composers in the rankings that will tweak the taste of the reader."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"You get a short history of the 50 greatest composers along with recommendations on which pieces of music to purchase. It is very well written. Also, at the beginning of the book the author explains things such as the difference between a sonata and a concerto and many other \\"basics\\". Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"I recommend this book for beginners or even for listeners who want to dig a little bit beyond what they already know of these 50 composers. The book is funny, easy to read and the breakdown of all opus into listen-to-these-pieces-first lists is very helpful, albeit shallow.I find the reviews listed below do present the pros and cons of this book very well. I think this book ought to be seen as a complement to other sources. There are so many classical CDs out there, one does not know where to begin. With a lot of humor, Goulding helps to pick out starter kits for 50 composers. Even if you bought one CD per composer per week, in a year you would have barely scratched the surface anyway. I feel one can get a lot of mileage out of this book.How many albums does it take to get acquainted with say five centuries of music? You have to start somewhere!In my opinion this book is excellent for beginners, but it ought to be complemented with a decent music history book. Personally I already have a few of those, and recently I got my hands on the Rough Guide to Classical Music which takes the classic 'dictionary of composers' approach. That book has a sort of \\"top ten\\" you-should-listen-to-this-first list approach as well, and for beginners lists are good."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The 50 Greatest Composers and Their 1000 Greatest Works","review":"This book presents a wealth of factual information and the author has obviously done a tremendous amount of research on the topic, the problem I have is with the presentation. The author is preoccupied with assigning numerical rankings to the composers and their works and with placing them in a rigid hierarchy: &quot;It is exeedingly bad form to lower any of the seven Demigods to the level of Artists of a High Order, the 21-to-50 group...It is not authorized to drop the 11-to-20 composers from The List. They may be demoted.&quot; This type of mathematical juggling may be appealing to beginners approaching Classical music from the sciences, but not for those intimately involved in the arts. Ultimately Goulding comes across as someone who wishes to classify and systematize the body of classical music rather than someone who appreciates it for it's pure art and beauty."},{"Title":"Spy Wars - Espionage And Canada From Gouzenko To Glasnost","review":"Provides a well-documented, fascinating survey of threats to Canada's national security, from the Gouzenko affair, which triggered the Cold War, to recent cases of terrorism &amp; industrial espionage, which usher in a new age of high-tech spying &amp; sabotage.

The story line flows well from the previous book. I am wondering what is missing, though. It does not compare, in fact to Harry Potter, or even Eragon.

This is the sequal of The Fire Within by Chris D'lacey. When David makes a wish on a wishing dragon called G'reth, things have gotten strange. A mysterious person called aunt Gwenneth comes to visit and David finds himself in danger. I would give this book a 4/5 stars because of the authors description of characters , there mystery in it and it's confusing organization.He described characters very well, for example \\" Aunty Gwenneth snapped her fingers, at once the clouds began to dissolve and the object inside it fell into her hands\\". I could imagine this seen very clearly in my head and just hear the sound of her snapping her fingers, and many more. This develops my understanding so much more for the book because i could see the scenes so clearly in my head.This book was all about mystery. Also the language he used in this book enhanced my understanding and also vocabulary because he didn't make it so complicated that I won't understand what the book is talking about but he made it so that we would understand more of the book. One scene is this book which was very mysterious to me, was when Sophie and aunt Gwenneth were sitting in the room and talking about the death of dragons.There was a lot of confusing organization in this book, which I did not like. Sometimes David was walking on the street and then all the sudden hes somewore in the Arctic. I understand why the author did that though, I think he did that so you know what is going on to the people in the other places but for me it was really confusing.No matter what age you are, you will be enjoying this book!

David could win a trip to the Arctic and do some research with the professor. There are many strange perplexing incidents that occur in the story.

However, I really enjoyed the style and the spirit among the characters. That alone drove me to order (Icefire) and I have to say the story really starts here not in the first book.The Fire within was almost about squirrels, which made it kind of silly for me as an adult reader. But in Icefire you get to know a lot about the dragons and the bears. The plot is much more intense and thrilling, new characters appear and the story broadens a lot.You may notice that many things were mentioned in The Fire Within and you get confused about some names and details but you'll be safe when you continue so don't worry about it."},{"Title":"Icefire (David Rain)","review":"If you like dragons,read this book,if you like odd books,read this book.

I cant wait what awaits David and his friends. In the mean time, Gadzooks says hrrr."},{"Title":"Icefire (David Rain)","review":"Icefire is Chris D'Lacey's second book in the Last Dragon Chronicles, following up on The Fire Within and continuing the story of David, the Pennykettles (Liz and Lucy), and the clay dragons that are much more than they appear. As I mentioned in my review, The Fire Within seems a wholly different construct from the succeeding novels--simpler, more light in tone, feeling a bit younger in terms of target audience. Icefire begins the shift toward older, darker, more complicated storytelling.Dragons play a much larger role in Icefire, as one might expect, and we start to get as sense of the clay dragons as distinct personalities. They still seem to lean a bit young to me in terms of readership, though one in particular faces some more mature, sophisticated moral choices. We learn more about the past history of dragons, the fate of the last dragon's tear and what makes it so powerful. D'Lacey adds another thread to this history by introducing a small group of polar bears who somehow became guardians of the tear and are now taking an active role once again.As David learns more about dragon history and slightly more about Lucy and Liz's involvement with them, the Pennykettles become a bit more complex as characters. Meanwhile, we see another side of Mr. Bacon, the grouchy neighbor, who grows beyond the somewhat cardboard picture of him in The Fire Within. Relationships deepen and the story becomes more complicated with the addition of a new character--Zanna--a goth college student acquaintance of David's who works her way into David and the Pennykettle's lives. Another new character is one of David and Zanna's professors, a man with a mysterious past and a possible link to the polar bears.The character with the largest impact, however, is a long-lived witch named Gwilanna who lusts after the dragon's tear and seemingly will do anything to find it. She is the major reason for the darker tone as she provides an out and out villain. In The Fire Within, the \\"villain\\" was Mr. Bacon, a grumpy neighbor who had a less than charitable view toward animals. Gwilanna is villainy on an entirely different scale: devious, cruel, deceptive, going so far as to manipulating minds and harshly interrogating a poor dragon.Like The Fire Within, Icefire is a quick read, but D'Lacey has done a nice job of complicating plot, deepening characters, expanding story, heightening tension, and raising the stakes. It doesn't have the whimsical charm of the first book, but it balances that loss in a variety of ways, making it a strong second book and one aimed at slightly older readers than the first book-- probably up to age 12 or 13. Recommended.Review addendum by my 9-yr-old sonI'd rank Icefire a strong 4.5. I thought it was more suspenseful, though I would have liked less about the history because I thought it became a little repetitive, especially in later books. I liked that there were more dragons and not so much on squirrels. My favorite part was when the dragon G'reth and the cat Bonnington were working together to get the dragon's scale from Gwillana. The fact that there was a villain made it better. My favorite characters were the same as in the first book: Lucy, David, and the dragons. Zanna, though, was a much more interesting female character than Sophie in book one. She made the book better, especially in the fight with Gwillanna. It was unpredictable (especially the part about Sophie) and kept me on my toes enough to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Icefire (David Rain)","review":"My 10 year old loves this series.

Liz and Lucy Pennykettle make dragons out of clay. David Rain is their tenant and goes to a nearby college. He gets assigned a paper on dragons. When Zanna, David's friend from school, comes over to lend him a book on dragons she quickens an egg. Liz hatchs this egg and Aunty Gwilanna scares him. The baby ends up losing his human features instead of his dragon feattures. When Gwilanna scares him, he runs away. G'reth follows him. David and Zanna go to Dr. Bergstrom's place, he is one of their professors, because they figure out that G'reth took the baby to him. Zanna names the baby dragon Grockle. David finds out the truth about the last dragon from Lorel, one of the nine polar bears that used to rule the Artic long ago. Zanna and David kiss and Sophie, Daivd's girlfriend, walks in on them. David and Sophie go for a walk and Sophie tells him that she's got a new job in Kenya. She'll be gone for three years so she breaks up with him. David and Zanna are going to Canada with Dr. Bergstrom and they ride to the airport together. This book is full of romance, adventure, and evil.Icefire has a lot of romance in it. David goes out with Sophie. Zanna likes David and they pretty much go out at the end of the book. Mr. Bacon likes Gwilanna. Liz and Lucy don't really have relationships. Lucy is just a child. Liz has a son, the baby dragon, and the father is the last living dragon, but they had no relationship because the father was dead before Liz was even born.The book has a lot of adventure in it. David goes to the Artic in his dreams and to Canada in real life. Zanna goes to Canada with him. Liz went to Canada when she was little. There is an adventure behind the last dragon's fire tear, too.There is a little bit of evil in Icefire. Gwilanna is the only evil one. Her potions dragon, Gretel, is kind of evil at first, but then she becomes nice. Gwilanna wanted Liz to hatch the dragon because she wanted it for herself. She lied to Liz by telling her that the baby would loose his dragon feature when he was to really loose his human ones. She kills David and hurts Lucy.Romance, evil, and adventure are all through this book, David has most of the adventures. Gwilanna is the evil one. Romance is in pretty much all of the characters lives.

The Fire Within was not at all what I thought it would be--a story about dragons that come to life--and was instead a tame, cozy (and often boring) tale about a young girl, Lucy, trying to save a squirrel, and a college student, David, who helps her. Icefire continues the story of these characters, but with a focus on the clay dragons David's landlady and Lucy's mother, Liz, makes. It's a lot of fun to see these dragons truly come to life at last, and to find out about their origins and the fate of the \\"real\\" dragons at last. The middle to end of this story is actually quite a page-turner, and it reads very quickly for a 400+ page book.I do, however, find d'Lacey's style to be rather amateur. He doesn't need to keep saying things like \\"In the meantime . . . ,\\" for example, when there's a scene change, and most of the ending is just plain melodramatic. David, as in the first book, seems rather juvenile for his age and is just plain rude much of the time. He shows his dislike for Zanna, a fellow college student, quite openly, and just because she's Goth. Yes, (POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD) David grows to care deeply for Zanna by the end and sees past her appearance, but was it so necessary for him to learn to see \\"past\\" it to begin with? What is so terrible about dressing in the Goth fashion, even if you don't prefer it yourself? Also by the end, Zanna is \\"plainly dressed in blue denim jeans and a gray college sweatshirt,\\" her \\"Gothic makeup . . . gone,\\" and David says, \\" 'Wow, you look amazing.' \\" This just seems offensive to me.Zanna, however, is annoying herself, not because of her appearance, but because of her actions. She repeatedly tries to get David to kiss her, date her, cuddle with her, anything she can, while he already has a girlfriend. Then the girlfriend walks in and Zanna flees, only to have her friends and family protecting her when the \\"horrible\\" guy they've heard about comes looking for her? And David just somehow wants to get the message to her that he wasn't \\"two-timing\\" her? Huh? HE HAD A GIRLFRIEND, and Zanna knew it. If anyone was wrong it was Zanna (and, of course, David, who was certainly not innocent).Anyway, with all this I will probably still read the next book in the series to see what happens, but I may check it out of the library rather than add it to my collection. In the hopes that a pattern may be emerging, perhaps the third story will be a lot better than the second."},{"Title":"Icefire (David Rain)","review":"For a moment after the student had gone, Bergstrom sat back staring at the door. Behind him the snowflakes swirled and landed, making small drifts on the thin-lipped sills. He rolled the talisman through his fingers, rubbing his thumb along the lenght of the shafot as if he was shaping a lump of clay. And then he muted voice, he spoke,\\"Stay close to them. Follow their auma.\\" And what had been amorphous suddenly took shape. And the shape it made was that of a bear.this story takes Place in the Artic the small house of the Pennykettles in #42 Wayward Cresent. Here lives Liz, her 11 year old daugter Lucy, and their tenant, David Rain who has just finished writing the book Snigger and the Nutbeast. David is a smart 21 year old that does not really believe in all the dragon stuff. Lucy is a very naive 11 year old that acts like a 6 year old. And Liz is a widowed landlord that carves dragons out of clay for a job. She also teached david and Lucy About Dragons.After living at the Pennykettles for a while, David becomes acustomed to all of the dragons and the cat Bonington. but when he accidentally brings his classmate Zanna to the house,her auma causes all of the dragons in the house start to go haywire. David now must work together with LIz and Lucy to fight against any evil that comes their way.The Title Ice fire comes from somthing in Liz's past that helps her create all of the dragons.I loved this book! The pacing goes really fast from the very beginning. This book is different than most fantasy books because it has mystical creatures in the real world. The theme would be just like the first book to not judge things by how they look. This book is not in a Christian perspective because they talk about dragons and polar bears having to do with the creation of the world. I rank this book 5 out of five stars and think that any one who loves dragons or fantasy genres should read this book."},{"Title":"Icefire (David Rain)","review":"If you have read The Fire Within, then read this book.

Since their birth I have contemplated homeschooling but have had such negative feedback about it and it's so discouraging. I felt God was really putting this homeschool idea in my mind where everyone else told me I was crazy, unqualified, and that my children would be socially backwards if I dare homeschol them. I found this book by the Grace of God and I am so thankful I did. I cried through half of it because I feel such a connection with the author and her feelings about homeschooling. It took away all the doubt that I had and I am happily homeschooling my son this year for preschool through the Abeka program. I also found many wonderful support groups and a playgroup consisting of over 100 homeschooled children in my area!! This book opened up so many ideas and doors for me. I am so greatful I found this. This is definately the BEST homeschool book I have ever came across and it was written from the heart.

This one's different. The characters are obstinately human, struggling with conflicting motives, giving in to childish impulse, or holding to a principle all out of proportion to its worth. The plot tears along, stuttering and veering enough to keep you off balance. It'll branch into what looks like a quiet eddy of reflection, a little background on the character, which turns out to be a ripping vortex, sucking you down into some new complexity. I don't want to give anything away, here, but there's ample forensic detail, clue-chasing, ironic repartee and squealing tires to please the hard-bitten mystery fan. There's also some rather disturbingly deep character stuff going on which pushes against the boundaries of the 'mystery' label. Don't expect to park it in the bathroom and read it a page a day."},{"Title":"Fulton County Blues: A Mystery Featuring Sunny Childs, P.I","review":"Sunny Childs, a private detective at Atlanta's Peachtree Investigations, knows nothing about her father who died in Vietnam when she was eight years old. Her mother has always been reticent on the subject. Hoping for closure, Sunny travels to the Vietnam Memorial Wall, only to learn that her father's name is conspicuously absent.As Sunny begins her quest to find out what really happened, a friend who served with her father in Nam, allegedly kills himself. The deceased's widow swears that he would never have committed such an act of self destruction because he shied away from guns ever since he left the service. Sunny obtains a list of former GIs who served with her father. She soon realizes that the troops are hiding a several decades old incident that involves the CIA, drug trafficking, and covert operations. If Sunny persists on obtaining the entire truth, she will have to confront the modern day tentacles of the CIA, who have reasons to keep her father's story erased.The war in Nam has been over for more than two decades, but for those who served and those anxiously waiting for news of their loved ones, the anger, resentment, and confusion remain as powerful as it was in the late sixties-early seventies. Many individuals, even some to young to understand what was happening at that time, still struggle with coping from the horror and ultimate uselessness of the effort. With dignity and respect, FULTON COUNTY BLUES looks inside the head of an indirect victim of the war. Readers will agree that Ruth Birmingham has written a compassionate, empathic, and realistic journey.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Fulton County Blues: A Mystery Featuring Sunny Childs, P.I","review":"People who read a lot of contemporary mysteries are certainly well-accustomed by now to story lines in which the scars, physical and emotional, of America's Viet Nam experience are featured prominently. More than a few &quot;hard-boiled&quot; detectives are themselves traumatized Viet Nam veterans (Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch comes to mind), and the variously shady aspects of American involvement in that unfortunate nation, from drug-smuggling to war crimes are shown through the vehicle of crime fiction to have consequences for countless people even decades after American involvement in the war in southeast asia finally ended in the early seventies.In this short but fascinating novel, Ruth Birmingham makes her own contribution to this *corpus* of post-Viet Nam mystery literature through the quest by her protagonist, Sunny Childs, to discover the fate of her long-lost father, who reportedly was killed mysteriously in Viet Nam, and yet his name does not appear on the Washington, D.C., Viet Nam Memorial. Why?The story is imaginative, complex, and sometimes horrifying, and it successfully dredges up a lot of the most painful aspects of the Viet Nam war and its aftermath. Once started, it's a hard book to put down.The only real weakness of the novel is that its basic structure involves Sunny in a series of encounters with Viet Nam vets and other characters who in turn provide their own recollections of the &quot;real story&quot; of what happened in Viet Nam involving Sunny's father. There is something of a &quot;Rashamon&quot; quality to the different perspectives offered by the various characters, and this makes for fascinating reading. However, there is also a certain literary clunkiness to the way that this succession of narratives is set up. Formerly taciturn characters suddenly launch into long and revealing monologues that seem in some cases really contrived. This structural flaw notwithstanding, the book is certainly fascinating and it contains some real historically significant insights regarding the history of American involvement in southeast Asia.Being familiar with the Atlanta setting for the story, I can also vouch for Birmingham's knowledge of that metropolis and its geographical intricacies. Consequently, Atlantans especially will find Ruth Birmingham's work fun to read."},{"Title":"Fulton County Blues: A Mystery Featuring Sunny Childs, P.I","review":"I am not one who typically goes for mysteries. I read about the author, Walter Sorrells (Ruth Birmingham is a pen name) a few weeks ago in the newspaper and purposed to pick up one of his books. I was not disappointed. The mystery revolves around Sunny Childs, a single thirty-something who works for an Atlanta private investigations firm. After a suicide committed by one of her late Father's fellow soldiers, she yearns to find out more about her Father, killed in Vietnam. In addition, she is asked to look into the death of the fellow soldier by his disbelieving widow. The ensuing story unfolds with a complex plot filled with intrigue, deception, lies and attrocities involving the Vietnam era.I highly recommend this book as a good mystery and an excellent dissection of the effect of the past on all of us."},{"Title":"Fulton County Blues: A Mystery Featuring Sunny Childs, P.I","review":"Great.

It definitely challenges all stereotypes from fairys to 'mud men' and it's really good to see a female heroine as well in the form of Captin Holly Short. Whoever said that this book has a bad role model then you really must be retarded ( no offence) because this book is all about the criminal mastermind ,who although is really bad by means of breaking the law, actually has a heart.Through the book you see him change from a heartless criminal vessal to something at least half way to a normal teen.At the bottom of the books there is a code which is so fun to crack although it's a little hard.

The second edition still has all the good material from the first edition about flow analysis and requirements analysis. It also has additional information related to network architectures. The new material on architectures for security and privacy is especially relevant to today's environment.I appreciated the explanations of why a systematic approach to network design is even more relevant today than ever due to the complexity of systems, applications, requirements, and even users who are much more sophisticated than they once were. Network engineers who throw capacity at the problem with little analysis should read the book to understand the risks associated with this &quot;methodology.&quot; As McCabe states, delay may be as important as capacity; and reliability, maintainability, and availability are often more important than overall throughput. Also, a network designer should practice due diligence in developing reproducible solutions that can be proven to meet the project goals.I like the Preparation section at the beginning of each chapter. The author talks about the prerequisites for understanding the material in the chapter and lists books that the reader can check out first to gain the requisite knowledge. The author applied hierarchy (a theme in the book) even to the list of references! This is a better way of doing a bibliography than the linear list at the end of books that you so often see.My only minor complaint is that I never did get used to RMA standing for reliability, maintainability, and availability. Every time I saw the acronym I had to try to remember what it stood for. But that's minor compared to my overall &quot;thumbs-up&quot; reaction to the book."},{"Title":"Airs & Graces (G. K.

Everything I've made from this cookbook has turned out excellent. I also love how you can search by ingredient, even if the ingredient you want to use up is not the main ingredient, unlike most cookbooks. This is key for me, as I usually buy a lot of whatever produce is on sale that week, such as carrots, and then end up frustrated because I don't necessarily want to make a carrot recipe per se. Sometimes I want to use up the last 2 carrots, the last bell pepper, and the last 2 stalks of celery (the staples for any crisper) before buying a new batch. In other words, the index will point you to all recipes where your tail-end ingredient is used. Lesser known produce, such as bok choy, also have recipes (I buy most of my vegetables from Chinatown markets). Also, I'm generally loose with measuring, whether it'sproduce or spices, but nothing has ended up catastrophically.

However, if you feel you would enjoy a criminal investigation drama with some poignant reflections on painful issues like justice, punishment and vengeance in conjunction with the cruellest of crimes, a topic from which most people prefer to walk away, An Eye for an Eye may be a marvellous book for you. The main character - Rabbi Daniel Winter - becomes involved in a case whose starting point is that a girl is brutally murdered by her ex-boyfriend and the murderer gets away with a ridiculous 3-year sentence open to the possibility of a further alleviation. This happens because the murderer uses the services of a totally unscrupulous but very smart defense attorney. The girl's father shoots the murderer out of tremendous pain and despair, but when the attorney is unexpectedly murdered and the farther proclaims his innocence in this case, Rabbi Winter is one of the few who believe him. What I appreciate most about the Rabbi is not helping to solve the third murder itself, but his perseverance and integrity in situations where he challenges the conventionally liberal and maybe \\"politically correct\\" opinion that a death penalty is always wrong and that an \\"eye for an eye\\" revenge is as deplorable as the original crime. Through these arguments a reader can familiarize himself or herself with interesting Talmudic ideas on this topic, presented here without any cheap simplification or dogma.As a citizen of a country whose violent crime rate has multiplied by several hundred percent after abolishing the capital punishment and \\"humanizing\\" the prison system in the early 1990s, I find the book to be very, very compelling."},{"Title":"Eye for an Eye","review":"I got this book on a whim after having read several of Rabbi Telushkin's other works. I have to admit that were I not Jewish, I'd be lost on the point of view expressed in the book in regards to the death penalty, or I'd at least think it rather simplistic. The main character is well developed; the emotions of the father of the murdered girl are well represented, however, the other characters could use some serious development. They were likable enough, but I must admit that likable characters are not what make a good read. I liked the inclusion of a portion of the article written by the main character in the epilogue. I wish that the whole article had been included."},{"Title":"Out of the Air","review":"There is a lot of name-dropping here.

She is one of the great leaders of our time, and the author does a wonderful job of chronicling her life. The most poignant part of the book for me was the chapter about Eleanor Holmes Norton the mother, and how she has raised a daughter who is severely mentally and physically challenged. The daughter, now an adult, still lives with Holmes Norton, who is depicted as being committed to her family, city, and country. I loved the book! - Malcolm"},{"Title":"Fire in My Soul","review":"We have needed a book like this: the story of an incredible woman of color of the twentieth century who has taken advantage of every opportunity to change, fight, modify and transform the culture of repression she found as a descendant of slaves in Washington, D.C.

While she avoids the trap of painting too pretty or too perfect a picture of her subject, including a number of descriptions that are less than flattering, she is at the same time able to clearly allow her respect and admiration for this remarkable woman to come through.The effect is that we see a real life heroine, warts and all, and we find her all the more admirable for this.This is an important book, and I look forward to Dr. Lester's next effort."},{"Title":"Fire in My Soul","review":"I don't usually read political biographies, but this one gave me the hope I was searching for in the face of the depressing political realities of today.

Every voter should as well!"},{"Title":"Fire in My Soul","review":"Joan Steinau Lester and Eleanor Holmes Norton met as college classmates at Antioch College in 1958. They became friends and marched together in civil rights marches in New England. Now forty-five years later, Ms. Steinau Lester, now a journalist/writer reunites with Congresswoman Holmes Norton in writing her biography in Fire In My Soul.Congresswoman Holmes Norton's great grandfather, Richard John Holmes, escaped from Virginia into Washington D.C. to become a free man and elude his former owner. He eventually became one of the few black firemen in the nation's capital and persevered to become a sergeant in the department. He felt a black man was worthy of equal opportunity and it is no surprise she inherited some of her great grandfather's fire for justice. With a legacy such as this, having descended from a strong, middle-class background, it is little wonder that she pursued a career in law that would one day put her in the limelight.Already involved in civil rights activities, the Congresswoman, while a Yale Law School student, went to Mississippi in June 1963 to join the voter registration drive as a SNCC member. Twenty-four hours later Medgar Evers was dead, victim of an assassination and Holmes Norton had to make quick decisions concerning other members who were being falsely arrested. After law school, she obtained a clerkship with Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., the first black district court judge, in Philadelphia. She then met her future husband, Edward Norton, also an attorney, a man who was secure enough to not be threatened by her status or activities.Holmes Norton's status did indeed rise as she ventured further into her profession as an attorney, became more involved with civil and human rights, and eventually going into politics. Her life was not always smooth. Her daughter, Katherine, was born with Down's Syndrome; however, she resisted health specialists advice to institutionalize her when she got older. She was very devoted to her.This reviewer had the opportunity of seeing the Congresswomen twice this year. She is as formidable a presence in person as she is in the media. Her stature commands respect and her sense of belief in pursuing and preserving the rights of human life comes across instantaneously. She is a cheerleader for the people of Washington D.C., who she represents with candor and is respected by them as she respects them. This was a well-written biography of a powerful woman.Dera WilliamsAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Fire in My Soul","review":"This fascinating biography is not only a pager turner, it also an insightful discourse on how to be an agent of change. This book is a MUST READ for anyone who is grappling with issues of how to change policy, whether as an &quot;insider&quot;, &quot;outsider&quot;, or hybrid. It is also an inspirational story of an terrific woman. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Fire in My Soul","review":"Thank you Dr. Holmes and Dr. Lester for this exciting, informative and historical book. I was raised in the South (LA) and experienced many of the conditions described in Fire in My Soul. Remembering my blessings on this journey, I give thanks for all of my past experiences. My parents attempted to sheild me from many of the conditions of the south and in turn I was shielded from much of the history of the Civil Rights Movement of the 60's except for limited TV coverage. Fire in My Soul serves as a personal history lesson for me and is one that I will read more than once. Reading about the personal experiences and the 'inner' workings of the local, state and federal agencies that Dr. Holmes was/is a part of reminded me of many personal experiences in the private sector. Reading Fire in My Soul remeinded me that the absence of compassion for another person is not isolated to any specific location or sector of the nation. Reading the story of one who continues to live her passion for justice offers the encouragement to do what I can where I am for justice."},{"Title":"Fire in My Soul","review":"A fantastic, inspiring book for these times. Civil Rights history comes alive in the Congresswoman's life story. The writing is diligent and refreshing, illustrating Norton's true integrity and commitment to the core values of the United States Constitution.Lester tells the story in a unique fashion. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Fire in My Soul","review":"Fire In My Soul is a fascinating account of how one woman of color experienced and led the nascent Civil Rights, Equal Opportunity, Human Rights and Feminist movements. It is also a powerful insider's look at the personal compromises and trade-offs women, in particular, must make in order to prevail as torch-bearers. Particularly touching is the recounting of Eleanor's childhood where she consistently overrode her intense longing for connection and home with action and organization. This childhood pattern would become the watchword of her life. Also fascinating is the history of her forebears in slavery and her fights at the EEOC. Lester lets us see Eleanor as a whole person, warts and all. It is a fascinating and compelling read and a clear portrayal of what it takes to succeed as a woman in a man's political world. I only wish there were more women like Eleanor to help keep the torch burning!"},{"Title":"Fire in My Soul","review":"A must-read in such trying times. This is a real go-getter; she seems to have been everywhere during the last 4 decades where anything was happening! Her views are strong, clear, consistent and radical. Thanks to Ms. Lester and Ms. Holmes Norton for your perceptive and useful teamwork."},{"Title":"Fire in My Soul","review":"Fire in my Soul is a moving testament to strength and character of Eleanor Holmes Norton. Joan Lester has done a wonderful job of capturing Eleanor the mother, the woman, the politician and the humanitarian. The book is both warm and direct, touching and challenging, empathetic and real. The history lessons as told through the eyes and experiences of Eleanor reminds the reader that while we have accomplished much in our world in terms of equity, justice and peace we still have a lot of work in front of us.Eleanor's work should empower us all, and remind us (in the words of Audre Lorde) that there is no hiearchy of oppression! We are all in the same boat."},{"Title":"Manservant and Maidservant","review":"No one writes novels quite like Ivy Compton-Burnett: they're really more like novelized plays than anything else, and as Diane Johnson notes in her extremely intelligent foreword to this edition, Compton-Burnett's antecedents are more with Oscar Wilde than anyone else, in her love of savage epigrams and wordplay. her novels are almost impossibly stylized: almost all her characters speak in the same style, so small children and uneducated coooks speak with the same level of sophistication as wealthy educated homeowners. Still, for all of its artificiality, you'd be hardpressed to beat MANSERVANT AND MAIDSERVANT as a superior exercise in style. Compton-Burnett's witty and troubling vision of the effect of a wicked Victorian paterfamilias's repentance is exceptionally striking and thought-provoking, and though this novel is not quite up to the level of A HOUSE AND ITS HEAD (also recently reissued by NYRB Press in a stunning paperback edition), it is one of her best works nonetheless."},{"Title":"Manservant and Maidservant","review":"She died in 1969, I see. Back in the 1950's she seemed to be talked about quite a lot among reading people, and I remember myself reading a couple of her novels, as a very innocent 13-year-old, and quite enjoying them even then, whatever level of understanding or the reverse I managed to bring to them. On the back cover of my edition I see the distinguished critic Norman Shrapnel saying 'Of the two candidates for greatness among the comic novelists of our time, Evelyn Waugh and Ivy Compton-Burnett, it is her prospect that seems the more secure.' That, obviously, is not how things have panned out. She seems to be all but overlooked now, and I have greatly enjoyed rediscovering her work and trying to form a fresh view of it.If you will take my advice, don't let your decision whether or not to read this book depend on specific editions or on the commentaries you are likely to encounter. Shrapnel got his prediction badly wrong, but I'd say his estimate of her nowhere near so wrong, although still not quite right. 'Comic' surely does not fit Ivy Compton-Burnett, for instance. Would you call Jane Austen a comic novelist? Ivy Compton-Burnett's mind is darker, but her little ironic darts of commentary are very reminiscent of her great forerunner, and I would even go so far as to say that so is the style of the dialogue. The observations are sharp, they can be very witty, but the total impression is less comic than Chandler, and not at all reminiscent of Waugh to my mind, much less of Wilde.I shall stick with Jane Austen as my point of reference. Both writers were spinsters whose lives were sheltered. Compton-Burnett lived longer, she lived in an era that was starting to be more outspoken, and it would be hard to imagine Jane Austen's personae making serious attempts to murder one another, as happens in this book. However she writes in a circumscribed tone and idiom, and she does not talk about anything of which she has no real experience. The commentators make a bit of a song and dance out of the undoubted fact that Ivy Compton-Burnett's characters do not stir far outside their big houses peopled by an Upstairs/Downstairs cast of masters and servants, and that she gives little or no clue about the precise time in which the action is set. She told them the answer herself, when she said that her imaginative world was set in the period before the first world war; and for good measure this book contains a reference - a single solitary reference - to the Queen. It's not mysterious, it's not timeless, it's all happening around the turn of the 20th century because that is the period the author relates to and understands.It also seems to me that there is a tendency to overdramatise Compton-Burnett and her creations. Her observation is close and her social criticism is incisive, but it is hardly 'savage' or anything of that nature. Indeed there is a real streak, very little noticed, of something dangerously like benevolence in her mental makeup. Pace Mrs Penelope Lively, the central character of Horace Lamb in this book is nothing approaching a tyrant or oppressor, although he is certainly a fussy old skinflint. I recommend Mrs Lively's typically insightful and illuminating essay accompanying the OUP paperback edition, but I would suggest that you will find she goes over the top, as writers about this author for some reason tend to do. There is not a happy ending to the story, there are actually several happy endings plus at least one more that is not as bad as it might have been, although the story of poor Magdalen is enough to bring tears to the eyes of the hardest-bitten novels-reader. The author's real insight is in understanding that conventional happy endings do not put everything right, and observe if you will how Horace's two elder boys put their finger on this point - he may have recanted, repented and what have you, but to them he has just not understood that it all makes no difference.To call the writing stylised would understate the matter. Everyone, but everyone - master and mistress, the Uncle-Vanya-like hanger-on Mortimer, the butler, the cook, the waifs and strays brought into domestic service and most strikingly the illiterate Miss Buchanan - is quite extraordinarily articulate. The idiom of the utterances may not vary much, but the characterisation is sharp and incisive, and this author's characters are both individuals and types, another trait of a great novelist. For me, she is nothing less than that. Don't read too much about her, read her for yourself. I found myself going slowly to start with, because if I missed a line I was liable to have missed a clue or at least an aphorism. I got into my stride after a while, and you may possibly have a similar experience. Quite simply, I think she is brilliant."},{"Title":"Manservant and Maidservant","review":"A huge fan of mid-20th century Brit Lit - Barbara Pym, Muriel Spark, Iris Murdoch, Kingsley Amis and Anthony Powell being among my faves - I had been meaning for years to get to Compton-Burnett. I ordered a used copy which arrived as good as new. The book itself is interesting, still reading it. Lots of family/neighbor drama, complete with busybodies, under-appreciated servants, poor relations and sad little children. Mostly written as dialog but it moves at a pretty fast clip. If you like this kind of thing I say go for it."},{"Title":"Manservant and Maidservant","review":"What is the fuss about this dreadful thing? Why is NYRB bringing another edition of it out instead of leaving it to moulder in the dark, damp corners of libraries unlucky or foolish enough to have it on their shelves?The plot, such as it is, makes perfect sense. A horrible Victorian daddy, cheaper even than Scrooge, makes his family's life so wretched that his rag-clad, blue-cold children make no attempt to save him when they see him heading off to probable death. His wife has left him; his brother and his aunt are dependent on his charity but clearly hate him as much as his children do; when he fails to die and returns from his brush with mortality a changed man, the consensus seems to be, \\"too little too late, bub,\\" and everyone goes on hating him. Even his wife, who comes back for no reason I can discern.Okay. Miss Compton-Burnett is said to be a wonderful writer. I see no evidence of this. She provides no character development, the children's voices are indistinguishable from the adults' voices, the servants are so well-educated that they speak in the same tones and cadences as the family, and no one at all changes in any significant emotional way throughout this book. The one servant who breaks out of service to teach is simply unbelieveable as a character.All in all, I want my money back, and I want someone to introduce a bill on the House floor asking England for reparations to be paid to all who have suffered at the hands of this awful, awful writer, Ivy Compton-Burnett."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"Fallen Skies is a delicately written book full of dark and terrible imagery. The main character of the book is Lily Valance, a naive young singer who longs for fame. Lily catches the eye of WWI vet Stephen Winters, a middle class man who has been scarred beyond belief by his fighting experiences. He determines to marry her, despite the fact she herself is more concerned with singing and the elusive, attractive piano player Charlie. The lives of these three people intertwine, and lead both to tragedy and joy. A word of warning - the story is wonderful, yet some of the images (Stephen's flashbacks from the war) are explicit and brutal. If you are looking for a fascinating read that studiously avoids cliches, then I would definetly reccommend this book!"},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"Where has this book been all my life? I thought I had read everything Ms. Gregory had ever written (including a few books originally not published in the US); then I stumbled upon this book. No need for a plot summary, but suffice it to say that it is an intriguing look at the period just following World War I with excellent character development. She is so gifted at describing period detail (the clothes, the cars, the etiquette and class distinctions, even the sounds in the most compelling way). And what a Plot! It's been a long time since I've read something that I couldn't put down, but this fit the bill. Oh how I yearn for a sequel...."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"Until last week, I had never read a book by Philippa Gregory and didn't see what all the hub-bub was.Now I know.She does an A+ job of drawing readers into the world she's created. I was mesmerized and kept thinking, when I was not reading the book, what was going to happen next?I was surprised at the repressive style of doing--everything--in 1917 America. Making love, raising your children, eating--all was to be done with dignity, meaning with absolutely no emotion. I thought this kind of behavior had ended at the end of the 19th century!I loved the character of Lily and how she went against this all, not with heels-dug-in rebellion, but in her own cheeky yet respectful way. I loved her unashamed adoration for her son even though everyone was telling her to essentially neglect him, except for when it was absolutely necessary for her to see him.Lily's mother in law, Muriel, with whom she lives after marrying Stephen was especially critical of Lily's way of bringing up her grandson. As the story went on, I wondered if it was more of an envy at Lily, that she (Muriel) would never know that kind of relationship with her son, that kind of affection and open heartedness. I liked Muriel and felt compassion for her, mostly because she was a prisoner of the masks of her culture.When I say this book is difficult to read, I mean that Stephen, the sadistic husband to Lily, reminds me a bit--just a bit--of my father when I were growing up. My brother and I never knew from day to day what was going to happen, what kind of mood he'd be in, and we certainly didn't feel cherished and weren't at all glad when he'd stay home.I have to confess that towards the end--no spoilers here!--as Stephen got worse, I had to skip pretty much to the last 5 or so pages. I think I skipped about 30 pages at the end. It was just wearing on me too much to read through the pain, growing isolation, and torture of his inner mind.My only criticism is that the ending is a bit unsatisfying. Maybe this is how the author intended it? I'll say no more so's not to ruin it for readers. I loved this book and recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a mildly depressing story set in post WWI America.I will most definitely be reading much more of Gregory's books!!"},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"I like Phillippa Gregory's books but this one was not one of her best. However, the basic story is entertaining and it does keep your interest fairly well. She looks at British society through the eyes of a lower class girl who is suddenly having to deal with conventions which are uncomfortable and difficult for her to understand. Family secrets tear apart the home. Of course, there is a crisis which is resolved somewhat to the satisfaction of all.Not a bad read but she has done better with her other works."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"It is VERY rare that I don't finish a book. It's even rarer for me to give a book one star, but this was just painful. I've read a few of Philippa Gregory's novels and I absolutely loved them. I was excited to dig into some of her older work, but good grief. This was soooooo sloooooow. And Stephen is beyond unlikeable. I found myself wondering, after his first misstep with Lily, why she would ever have anything to do with him again? She clearly doesn't care for him the way he cares for her...she even told him so! So WHY would she continue seeing him knowing how he feels about her? And why would her super protective mother allow it, even after Lily told her how she felt?I'm extremely annoyed that I shelled out $12.99 for the Kindle edition of this (a book that's 17 years old!!), and it was so bad. I'll definitely still read Ms. Gregory's historical novels as they are incredibly entertaining, but this was just no good for me. I see that a bunch of people really enjoyed this, and I wanted to, but I just couldn't get past the my supreme dislike for Stephen, a main character...not to mention his mute chauffeur Coventry who is incredibly creepy! Yet another turn off for me. While I can't in all good conscience recommend this book, I DO recommend trying her newer novels. Ms. Gregory is really at her best when she's writing historical fiction."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"I looked up Philippa Gregory because she had written the foreword to the re-issued version of Katherine, by Anya Seton. I ordered Fallen Skies because the era in which it is set is of particular interest to me. I was extremely disappointed.While the story itself is not poorly rendered, the characters leave a great deal to be desired. The heroine is shallow, self-centered and unsympathetic. The character the reader initially believes to be the hero is physically and emotionally abusive, mentally unstable and as needy as the heroine. Nor is the hero-by-default someone whom the heroine can ever have a happy relationship. There seems no real goal or point to the story, other than the depiction of a relationship without which all parties would have been better off -- including the reader.I continued reading simply because I kept hoping the unredeemable characters would somehow be redeemed, or at least become somewhat likeable. This never occurred, and the ending was unsatisfying and inconclusive. Fortunately, I read quickly, and I had bought the book, so I finished it, although I was sorely tempted to skip the last quarter of the book and just read the end.Given Gregory's comments about historical fiction versus historical romance in the foreword of Katherine and the disdain in which she appears to hold the latter category of fiction, I expected Fallen Skies would be straight historical fiction without any romance conventions. Even with those expectations, Fallen Skies simply did not fulfil the hopes I had for it.Read this only as an antidote for a Pollyanna case of good humor and optimism."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"I bought this book because the description on the cover made it out to be a great romance novel about love and war. Instead, this book is twisted, dark and just a big let down. The many tragic events in the book are just too extreme and depressing. Not only that, but once you get to the last chapters the ending becomes very predictable and feels as though it was done in a rush because the author already drove the book into such darkness that she needed to find something (no matter how unimaginative) and quick. I would'nt recommend this book to anyone looking for something romanic or uplifting and I don't think that publishers should mislead buyers with their book descriptions."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"Started reading right away. Philippa has a great way of writting about the 1920's. Another definate must read by Philippa Gregory."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"I loved this book and I had difficulty putting it down. I have read many books by this author and this will be a favorite. I am surprised that some did not like the story because it has excellent character development and tension builds throughout the book. Some reviewers did not like the ending but I think it suits the story."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"Lily Valance is young, talented, and excited to be on her way to a career on stage after the war time rationing and gloomy times of her early teen years during WWI. When she meets army captain Stephen Winters, she enjoys the gifts her showers her with and the fancy dinners he takes her to.Stephen, a handsome war hero from a wealthy family, seems an ideal catch, but he is deeply damaged from the war and has become a dangerous man capable of terrible acts. When Lily is forced by circumstance to become involved with him in ways she was not prepared for, she quickly learns his true nature.This was a slightly unusual novel, more of a character study than anything else. While there is some action and major plot points, the majority of the book is examining Stephen, Lily, and the characters that surround them. Where I found myself losing interest a bit is that I didn't like Stephen or Lily much; Stephen for his cruelty, and Lily for her completely unsympathetic views on the war. I don't know that Ms. Gregory intended for us to like any of her characters (her novels don't always have likeable protagonists), but I always find a book a bit more enjoyable if I can root for one of them. This was still an interesting read, and shows clearly that the cost of war doesn't end when the soldiers return from the field."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"This was a fabulously well written book. I couldn't put it down and found myself reading it long after I should have gone to sleep. The characters developed both good and bad qualities, making them very human. Some scenes were \\"predictable\\", but others took me totally by surprise. I'm happy it's in my list because I may want to read it again when I know I can read late into the night."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"This book centers around newlyweds Lily and Stephen Winters. Lily was a chorus girl turned soloist, who lost her mother and her way in life, and married Stephen because she didn't care what happened to herself one way or another. Stephen was a WWI veteran who was more deeply disturbed by the war than he was letting on. His father was recovering from a massive stroke, and his mother was enforcer of society rules, and his chauffeur, Coventry, was his silent best friend, and partner from the war.What was most interesting about this book was getting a look at the dynamic of a rich family living in the 1920s. There were so many spoken and unspoken rules about how daily life should progress and how different people should interact with each other. From mother to son, husband to wife, mother-in-law to daughter-in-law, there were so many rules and regulations that it was easy to see why the Winters family was so unhappy. Through it all, Lily tries to keep herself, and eventually her son happy. Stephen constantly finds ways to dominate and control her, desperate to make her as unhappy as he is. As the book progresses, it becomes more and more obvious how deeply disturbed Stephen was by the war. I really grew to hate him as a character--I felt no pity for him whatsoever. At times it was hard to keep reading the book, because I hated him so much, and I knew he would stop at nothing to destroy Lily's happiness.It's definitely not a tale that glorifies life in the 1920s, and I appreciate how hard it was for women to live back then, privileged or not."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"I am an avid reader and have read many books by this author and enjoyed them. This book was a wonderful story and so well written. Please tell me there is a sequel in the works. I could go on and repeat all that the other readers have stated about the contents of the book but that sort of takes away from the reading. Just to hear from a well read person that the book is worthwhile read is enough,This is one that once you pick it up, its hard to put it down (to even sleep). thanks to the author again for a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"With \\"Fallen Skies,\\" Philippa Gregory once again reminds me of why I love her Historical Fictions. She is an amazing writer, and this particular story had me emotionally invested in no time (Doesn't hurt that I'm an aspiring singer/performer, myself)...I have virtually no knowledge of England in the time just after WWI, and I found myself happily (and entirely) engrossed in the world and the story of Lily, Stephen, Charlie & Coventry throughout the book.It was another book that I wished would have just gone on and on past the last page. :)Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"I have read most of Philippa Gregory's novels and I loved Fallen Skies. The character's are beautifully and tragicaly written."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"I loved this book. An excellent read which had me spellbound from the beginning. A sad time in history, and I am so glad to now understand better the attitude of older people as I was growing up in England at the end of WW2."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"Philippa Gregory is a rather uneven author. When she's good, she's very good; when she's having an off day, she can be very ordinary. This is one of her earlier novels, here reprinted. It's a rather melodramatic thriller revolving around an unsuitable marriage between a music hall singer and a decorated WWI veteran, whose shellshock masks a Dark Secret.The book suffers from thee main flaws. First, it is overly melodramatic. Second, it is predictable. The plot twists and turns are all pretty obvious, the Dark Secret eminently guessable, and the end unsurprising, and from this point of view the suspense falls sadly flat. But the third and most unfortunate fault in it is that none of the characters is particularly engaging. The heroine has nothing much to recommend her. She is immature, has little in her brain box, and marries the villain of the piece for all the wrong reasons. Nor does she really improve as she goes along, so is hard to empathise with her sufferings. Her husband is more complicated; he is unlikeable, but the fact that he is so messed up at least makes him a more interesting character. The second love interest never really emerges from the background, though he is there at the end to help everything come right.Several times when I was reading this book I asked myself why I was bothering and came close to putting it down. I did finish it, but put it straight in the bag for the church op shop, which is probably as telling a review as I can give. I'd have given it two and a half stars if I could have worked out how to split the star, and would only recommend it for diehard fans of the author."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"This is the first Philippa Gregory novel I read and it was so good, I want every single books she has written."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"England, 1920s. Seventeen-year-old Lily Pears goes by the name of Lily Valence, an up and coming nightclub singer. One night, she meets Stephen Winters -- an older man who enjoys her platonic company. Lily hates to talk about the war (WW1), where her father dies, leaving her and her mother to struggle alone. She is reluctant to accept Stephen's marriage proposal at first. After all, she sees him as a friend, not a love interest. But his respectable position and wealth convince her to take the plunge. Through her marriage, she discovers a dark side to Stephen. His respectable family isn't as well-together as they seem. A former soldier at the war, Stephen hides secrets that involve him and his brother, who died at the war -- secrets that only his father, who is ill, and Stephen's friend and driver Coventry know about. What will happen to Lily and Stephen, and could she face the war's aftermath in spite of her best attempts to avoid the subject?Fallen Skies is a reprinted novel, one of Gregory's earliest efforts. You will notice her lack of experience as you read this novel, for it lacks the story and character development of her more recent efforts. This era (1920s) is a favorite of mine, and I enjoy reading novels set during or after the first World War, and Gregory's historical take on it -- in terms of wardrobe, customs and historical references -- is well done. I am satisfied with that part in the story. However, I did not enjoy this as much as I would have liked. Gregory likes dark characters, or characters with shades of grey, but I found Lily to be too spoiled and Stephen too brooding to sympathize with either of them. The secondary characters aren't much better. For the most part, I enjoy complex characters, but somehow I found myself unable to like the ones here. All in all, Fallen Skies is a middling read. If you're interested in reading Gregory's earlier efforts, I'd like to suggest A Respectable Trade because, in spite of some flaws, it is more riveting and the characters are better developed in that book."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"First let me say that I have read several of Gregory's books and I have enjoyed them all immensely. This book is a HUGE exception! Fallen Skies is a horribly depressing book. Granted, any book depicting the trauma experienced by war veterans can have a tendency to be depressing but every aspect of this book was depressing. The story is incredibly slow and tedious and the characters are not likeable at all. Each new chapter contained more death, rape, kidnapping, murder and general unhappiness than the last. If you enjoy stories about husbands who rape their wives, try to murder their own children, stab babies to death and make everyone miserable, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"Gregory is a master story-teller, this engaging novel set in 1920's England shortly after the end of World War I. Stephen Winters is a medaled officer, returned to the bosom of his wealthy family, expected to step into the empty shoes of his brother Christopher, who was killed in the war. Stephen has his own war stories, but never speaks of them, except to his batman and chauffeur, Coventry, his mute companion. Profoundly damaged by his war experiences, the young Winters' heir hides the depths of his emotional wounds, his rages rare but violent. The family home is quiet as the grave, Stephen's father, Rory, felled by a stroke after Christopher's death, his luminous dark eyes unable to communicate from a twisted face and worthless body. Muriel Winters cannot find rapport with her son, the unsaid between them more powerful than any conversation and her nagging guilt at having goaded her second-born into a war that annihilated his already cloudy soul.Singer Lily Valance, only seventeen, is a refreshing antidote to the nightmares that have haunted Stephen since his return. Even the knowledge that she is a chorus girl is assuaged by the purity of her lovely voice and the diligence of a mother who protects her innocent daughter from male admirers. As soon as he sees Lily perform, Stephen knows she is the antidote to his fury and discontent, that Lily will heal the wounds of the past. On the cusp of a successful career, thanks to the efforts of music director and friend, Charlie Smith, Lily's path to success is clear. Suddenly Stephen is everywhere pressing his suit, shadowing Lily's every move. Intimidated by his aggressive courtship, Lily turns to Charlie, who can never make her his wife. But fate intervenes and Lily is forced into life-changing decisions in the midst of unfathomable grief.And there is Stephen, soft-spoken, iron-willed, offering his protection and love. Lily marries her ardent suitor, thrust into a world of strict proprieties, a singing career suddenly inappropriate. And Stephen's panacea is short-lived as reality intrudes on fantasy. As a rigid mother-in-law, compassionate but helpless father-in-law and Stephen's man, the mute Coventry, struggle to adapt to the high spirits of Lily's youthful enthusiasm, the fragile hopes she has for her marriage are exposed as a sham. Lily learns first-hand the terrible cost of war, her marriage battered by upheaval and violence as a helpless Charlie watches from the outside. From love to madness, joy to despair, Gregory's characters grapple with their situations, tentative alliances, demons revealed in a tragic denouement that shatters the night. Gregory writes with a rhythm and style all her own, high drama and dense prose that wounds and expunges, human failings stripped of pretense one by one. But Lily is a survivor, a girl grown to womanhood in the harsh landscape of a deeply troubled marriage: \\"We've got to live no matter how many skies have fallen\\" (DH Lawrence). Luan Gaines/2008."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"I discovered Philippa Gregory within the last year and have now read five of her books, Fallen Skies being the most recent. As always, she has created multi-dimensional characters where it's possible to even feel some sympathy for the &quot;villain&quot; of the piece. The heroine of the book, Lily Vallance, is very much a product of her times when roles for women were quite restrictive. Gregory does a great job of portraying just how much power husbands had over their wives in the early part of the last century. Her husband, World War I vet, Stephen Winters, is a tragic figure although to state he was purely a product of the horrors of the war may not be quite true. His own upbringing and profound sibling rivalry also had to have played a part in the man he became in the trenches of Belgium.The supporting characters of Charlie, Lily's true love, Muriel, Stephen's mother and Coventry, Stephen's chauffeur/best friend are wonderfully written. I especially enjoyed Gregory's constant reference to the food that &quot;Cook&quot; served the family during the rigidly proscribed meal times. She ably described the societal customs of the upper middle class and how Lily constantly chafed at them.This is not a romance novel, by any means, but a fascinating story of what happened to the generation of men who fought in World War I and the impact of this on those left on the home front."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"This book starts out strong, then crawls, gets exciting at about 3/4 of the way through, but leaves many unanswered questions. You can't help but feel sympathy for the main character, Lily, who is married to a man she doesn't love and whose husband's family adheres to the strict formality of upper-class England. Nothing unseeming should ever occur in their household. Ironically, what happens between Lily and her husband is enough to make even the lowliest of English families cringe, if only they knew. The strict upper-class attitudes of the family should be reminiscent of what it must be like for young, innocent girls who marry into certain royal families and are forced to live with the consequences. Overall, several of the characters could have been taken in a much different direction toward the end of the story, if only to give Lily more sympathy and friends. It might also have resolved a few more issues, such as what happens between Lily and her true love, Charlie. This book needs a more satisfying ending!!"},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"I think I have read all of Philippa Gregory's work. Fallen Skies was unique in the structure of the last few chapters in the book. The level of suspense and the finely crafted web of facts and characters all come together for the best who-done-it ending I have ever read. The book would not be characterized by most as a mystery but I couldn't help but marvel at Gregory's expertise and compare her to the best of mystery writers. The historical and social aspects of the story are as good as any she has written, but again, the suspense at the end is brilliant."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"The author is well-known for her historical novels about royal personages, but this book, first published in 1993 and re-issued in 2008, is among her best and is timely in this era of war. It is set in the immediate aftermath of World War I in England. A veteran, a former officer, from an upper-class family is haunted by war nightmares. He falls in love with a pretty, very young music-hall performer, seeing in her naivete the pre-war innocence he misses. The impoverished girl reluctantly marries her rich swain. Gradually, we realize that he suffers secretly from what is now called \\"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\\" and, furthermore, he was not an emotionally-steady person when he went to war. Indeed, the war gave him the opportunity to work off his underlying anger at being the less-beloved of two sons by killing \\"the enemy\\". I can see why some audiences, especially the British, may not have taken to a book that says that some \\"heroes\\" were nothing of the kind. Current readers know that atrocities are not committed only by the other side; we may be shocked and saddened but we are no longer surprised. The fast-moving, dramatic plot deals with the young wife's difficult chore of dealing with her increasingly-demented husband."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"This is a superb historical novel with tragic themes. Phillipa Gregory demonstrates the she can craft such a great story that takes place in the past century. (This book was initially released in 1993. Due to Gregory's popularity, it has been reissued.)The story focuses on the dysfunctional marriage of Lily Valance and Captain Stephen Winters. Stephen was traumatized by his service during World War I. He is clearly suffering from PTSD and other issues. Yet he refuses treatment of any kind and is plagued by nightmares. Lily marries him and she is unaware of his condition until their honeymoon.Before she met Stephen, Lily was an up and coming singer and chorus girl. Due to personal tragedy, Lily ends up marrying Stephen to survive. As she is from the working class and the Winters family is upper class, conflicts naturally occur. Compounded with Stephen's psychological problems and misogynist attitudes and Lily's inexperience, the marriage is immediately plagued by problems. There are continual themes of marital rape. While Gregory is not graphic in her depictions, it is still distressing material.Gregory excels at describing Stephen's remembrances of the war. She also gets into the head of all her characters. The reader understands what makes each character tick. Overall, this book is an indictment of the attitudes of the upper class. When Stephen is observing his wife while she changes their son's diaper, the present day reader understand how warped his sensibilities have become.\\"Stephen gazed at the two of them in a sort of horror: at his son's innocent babyish maleness, and at Lily's confident handle of him. As if she were some kind of red-handed nurse, as if she were not a lady at all. Stephen was appalled that Lily should lower herself to be so intimate with the child. It was worse than servitude, what she chose to do. It was disgraceful that she should do it and feel no shame at being watched.\\"As Lily continues to assert herself, Stephen's mental health and behavior declines. It is inevitable that this marriage will end in tragedy. Gregory keeps us guessing as to who will be harmed the most. The last few chapters kept the tension building beautifully. I highly recommend this book to historical fiction and Phillipa Gregory fans even though it is very dark material."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"I've enjoyed Gregory's Elizabethan-period novels very much, but this, an earlier effort, is one of the best books I've read in years. She takes time, in this novel, to let us know the characters, and care about them, even the antagonistic ones. The pace begins gradually, and gathers momentum as it goes along, until the reader can hardly tear herself away from the book to go to work! A masterful novel of period and character and even social commentary. Fantastic."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"I've read 10+ of Philippa Gregory's historical novels, and enjoyed them all. However, when I was first reading it, I didn't much care about either of the two main characters or what happened to them. They both had plenty of flaws. Just when I would begin to sympathize with one of them, they make another bad decision.I'm updating now since I finished the book yesterday. Once I decided which characters I wanted to root for, I became more engaged in the story.The author crafts several intriguing plot twists, and more than one dark secret is revealed by the end. She kept me riveted for the last few chapters - I literally could not put it down!My overall opinion is that this a very powerful anti-war novel, and provides the reader with a lot of ideas to ponder."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"Before writing my own, I was reading the other readers' reviews and I tend to agree with them overall: it's a good story, plenty of suspense building, and yes, the last few chapters DID keep me rapidly turning pages.But when I got to the last page, I turned it for more... and there WERE no more. That's it?! Rather than \\"ending,\\" it just seemed to stop.Just felt unfinished to me.That's what kept me from giving this book more stars."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"I've read all of Philipa Gregory's novels, and I'm a big fan of her historical fiction, so I thought I'd give this one a try as well. Some of the violent parts of the book were hard to read, but I thought the characters were really well done- even though Stephan was a 'bad guy,' there were times were I felt sorry for him, and could empathize with him. None of the characters were pure evil or perfectly good either. The story started out a little slow, but I soon got caught up in it. I would definitely suggest reading it."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"I am admitted devotee of Phillipa Gregory, having purchaed five of her novels recently from Amazon. \\"Fallen Skies\\" however, set in post World War I England would have appealed to me more were it not dragged out in too much of the same repetitive writing throughout, and an ending that was a foregone conclusion, but like the rest of the book was drawn out unnecessarily."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"I agree with many readers that the book was slow in the beginning. On top of that I did not like any of the characters....not even Charlie. The Winters family was just creepy keeping the stiff upper lip.....and Stephen has major problems including and not limited to selfishness. Lily is selfish also albeit young. But as the book goes on it does get better and I found myself feeling sorry for Lily. She becomes a woman who tries to be true to herself...considering the circumstances. I liked Coventry as he got to know Lily.I did not like the ending though! I thought it to be rather a cop out but on the whole, the description of WW1 and post war were very interesting and informative."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"Gregory at her best. I expected this to be weaker than her more current novels. I have read several of her more recent books and this one (after a somewhat slow start) is as gripping as anything I've ever read. Her attention to detail and her expression of human emotion is irresistable."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"I adore Philippa Gregory's novels and was thrilled to discover one I hadn't read yet when I received my Kindle for Christmas. It was the first thing I ordered! However, it proved to be a huge disappointment: totally lacking in the character development and sense of era recreation that I feel most of us look forward to in her work. Her characters are flat and very one-dimensional and therefore difficult to become involved with or care about. It's as though the author is reporting in print what is being seen through a video recorder set above her characters rather than taking the reader into the action. Dialogue is stilted. And WHAT is going on with that final plot twist that ends the novel? It was almost like the classic ending from the \\"Michael O'Donahue's (SNL Writer) School of How to Write Good\\" satire..\\"Suddenly, everyone is run over by a truck.\\" I was very unhappy I wasted my money."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who gave this book a poor rating. I quit reading it only 1/3 of the way through, because it was going downhill so fast. The lead female character was shallow and weak while the lead male character was manipulative, cruel, and emotionally disturbed. I prefer to read stories with *some* redeeming qualities, and this one failed that litmus test entirely."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"While I cannot find flaw with Gregory's factual account of life in that era, I can certainly find fault with her character development. I found it very hard to be sympathetic to the vapid, self-involved Lily. She comes off as a one dimentional tart, void of any thoughts other than how to further herself in her career as a singer. Same for the selfish, somewhat asinine Stephen, the chap unfortunate enough to believe he fell in love with Lily. It's obvious from the moment these people meet that they will get on like oil and water. The really sad part is that both of these characters are aware of their differences, yet they continue down the path. Thus, the reader is brought into the hell that is a marriage where the married people neither like, nor even really know each other. None of the characters are very likable, not even the \\"good guys\\". As a matter of fact, the only two characters that might appear to be somewhat likable are mutes! I found that the more I read, the less sympathetic I was to this spoiled brat and her war-torn husband. I only finished reading it because I wanted to see just how far they would go with this farce. You could see the big shocker coming a mile away and the secret at the end was no secret - if you paid attention, you knew exactly what happened with the baby.Sad to say, the best part of this book was the end. The story was silly at best, but the writing was good and the account of life in that era was factually sound. Too bad - I really loved Gregory's Tudor history books. But this book is just well-trodden territory with nothing special to set it apart from any other story of a bad marriage."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"This book is offered under \\"historical novels\\", probably because Ms.Gregory has written a number of those. It is well-written, but not what I expected; I liked the unexpected ending, though."},{"Title":"Fallen Skies","review":"The book was very good. It was different from the other books I have read by this author. i would recommend it."},{"Title":"Cosmos Crumbling: American Reform and the Religious Imagination","review":"Robert Abzug's fresh approach to antebellum reform illuminates some of its underlying causes. Abzug explores the antebellum religious imagination, positing that the reformers set about &quot;sacralizing the world&quot;--radically joining Heaven and Earth. In antebellum America, the language of religion, politics and science all reinforced each other. Abzug argues that Lyman Beecher confronted the crisis in New England identity by transferring its spiritual identity as a spiritual Israel to all of America. This sense of mission then drove the evangelical program of reform. Likewise, William Lloyd Garrison re-imagined the basis of American society by advocating a radical egalitarianism--blacks were entitled to all rights of citizenship. Abzug argues that all reforms sprung from the wellspring of religious imagination. Reformers were rethinking church and society. Inspired by their visions, they set out to remake America. Abzug is convincing. My one main criticism is that Abzug did not set American reform in its larger context. Many American reformers were indebted to their European counterparts. What of the European religious imagination? How was it different from the American? Nonetheless, this shortcoming is small given Abzug's deep insight into American reform. I highly recommend this work to students of antebellum reform or American religion."},{"Title":"Cosmos Crumbling: American Reform and the Religious Imagination","review":"Abzug does a good job in compiling lots of information portraying an interesting view on religious reform in the antebellum period. However this book is typical of many in the same category: Abzug is a great historian, but not a very good writer. When reading this book it seems that one must translate every sentence into \\"regular\\" English. Abzug is simply hard to understand. However, it would be suspected that anyone who reads this book has some background in the field of antebellum time period and especially reform in New England in the early-to-mid-19th century.Cosmos Crumbling provides some interesting perspectives, but it's a hard read, and when finished you'll probably still be left wondering what Abzug is trying to say. I read the book twice before I had an idea what his main points were."},{"Title":"If I Ran the Rain Forest: All About Tropical Rain Forests (Cat in the Hat's Learning Library)","review":"My 6 yr old really enjoyed this intro book on rain forests. One of the off-shore excursions on our upcoming cruise is the Costa Rican rain forest and I purchased several books on rain forests to get him familiar with the topic This one was the perfect intro book for him. It was written in classic Seuss rhyming style which was engaging for my son. The illustrations were colorful and eye-catching and the information about rain forests was just enough for a 6yr old to understand and digest. We read it while also listening to a \\"Relax with Tropical Rain Forest\\" audio CD which provided an added dimension to the rain forest learning experience. I plan on reading the other books on rain forests to him but selectively as they contain much more advanced information."},{"Title":"If I Ran the Rain Forest: All About Tropical Rain Forests (Cat in the Hat's Learning Library)","review":"This was purchased for a our local library.

The rhyming style is excellent. This book introduces such concepts as four levels of the rain forest, transpiration, animals in the forest, pollination, and camouflage."},{"Title":"If I Ran the Rain Forest: All About Tropical Rain Forests (Cat in the Hat's Learning Library)","review":"This is the first time I've read a book from the Cat in the Hat Learning Library, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But I wasn't expecting this.The illustrations make it look like the kids and the cat are having an adventure in the rainforest. But they aren't. They're just on a field trip, I guess.The book goes over the four levels of the rainforest and names the different types of animals, plants, and people you would find in a rainforest. The main focus of the book seems to be maintaining the rhyme scheme rather than giving detailed information. At times, clarity is even sacrificed in order to maintain the rhyme. For example, \\"Millions of acres of land every year are cut down...\\" Cutting down land is confusing to a child. Usually trees or plants are cut down.One funny thing was that the cat in the hat says he will give you a prize if you find these six things. Well, he's talking to the kids he is traveling with, not \\"you\\" the reader. So my 5-year-old son jumped in and named the things, then said \\"Where's my prize?\\"So after around 40 pages of naming and discussing rainforest plants, animals, and people, a bulldozer showed up on the second to last page and the animals are running for their lives. On the last page the cat in the hat says \\"Save these trees please!\\" The end. Well, I like the environmental theme, but I had an awful lot of explaining to do when the bulldozer showed up. I think the book should have begun where it ended, because that is where the real story is. I buy books for my kids in the hope that the author can explain and illustrate a topic better than I can.My son only asked me to read this book once, then never picked it up again.I gave the book two stars for the unusual format. The novelty might appeal to some kids."},{"Title":"If I Ran the Rain Forest: All About Tropical Rain Forests (Cat in the Hat's Learning Library)","review":"I love Dr. Seuss. Sadly, this doesn't appear to be his writing. I'm pretty sure his brand name was pimped out to a scientist. There's no excuse for writing this bad. The author has no sense of verse and his writing style has no rythym to it. In fact, some of the ultra-scientific sentences are so long and incomprehensible, your toddler will have no idea what the freak you are talking about, and neither will you. This was clearly written by a scientist, not a true writer. I'm giving it two stars only because the illustrations are nicely done. Rather than this book, you should buy \\"If I Ran the Zoo,\\" which is classic Seuss at his best, flows beautifully, and has many hilarious pages (\\"...in the northwestern corner of east South Dakota\\" makes my family lose it every time.)"},{"Title":"If I Ran the Rain Forest: All About Tropical Rain Forests (Cat in the Hat's Learning Library)","review":"We have several books in this series, and my son loves them all.

Add some over-simplified moralizing which flies over the head of a 4 year old anyway, and you have very poor book.As I read this book, I can almost feel the rumble as the real Dr Seuss turns in his grave- Mercifully my children gravitate towards the \\"Cat in the hat\\", \\"One fish two fish\\", \\"Green eggs and ham\\" and \\"Fox in socks\\" so I don't have to read it too often. The only consolation for me when reading it has been the thought that I will be able to give it a review on Amazon - so here it is.

There are astounding things to learn but I don't think having the Cat rhyme about them conveys the amazing REAL world of the rainforest. Shouldn't the astounding world of the rainforest be enough to recommend itself? This book also doesn't honor Dr. Seuss. Why is somebody trying to copy what essentially can't be copied?: the inventive, outlandish ((and note: OUT of this world and NOT of this world)) characters and word play. I don't like the mix of Seuss' world and the facts of the real world. What next? Will Sponge Bob introduce me to what it is like to go to the dentist? Will Garfield teach us all how to vote? Why have the images and concepts of Dr. Seuss been co-opted?It is right to want to defend the rainforest but our children are supposed to care because a fantasy character wishes them to? I think children have a sense for these things and find the GENUINELY OUTLANDISH to be delightful -- and find the REAL FACTS of the world without garnishment to be fascinating."},{"Title":"The Imperial Middle: Why Americans Can't Think Straight About Class","review":"DeMott's \\"The Imperial Middle: Why Americans Can't Think Straight About Class\\" tackles an important subject; however, though DeMott offers some nice explanations for and readings of contemporary American class issues, he simplifies a little too much.The best thing about this book is that it's an easy read. DeMott's prose is clear and concise, and, unlike some stuffier acadmics, he's not averse to sounding conversational. This might contribute, in part, to what can only be categorized as an overly conversational reliance on mantras that are never adequately explained in their complexity: \\"the myth of classlessness\\" (America's disbelief in class...sort of) and \\"the omni syndrome\\" (the desire of certain people to be everything to everybody...sort of), for example, are explained well at first but then applied everywhere until their edges start to blur.The strongest chapter is DeMott's historiography of autonomy and individualism in American culture; not coincidentally, this is also his most persuasively, historically grounded chapter, covering educational and media-influenced roots to the crisis. He buttresses his case with a fine reading of Oliver North's willful flouting of constitutional law, which, DeMott argues, belied a faith in the man over all else: law, politics, public dialogue.Unfortunatley, though, this welcome shot of history comes two thirds of the way through the book, by which time the reader has already been subject to a flagrant anti-history. The readings of John Hughes's films offered, interesting but one-sided, are a case in point. DeMott looks at \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\" (1987)and \\"Pretty In Pink\\" (1986) but presents the later film first, and then concludes that the two films are identical. (A lot of movie critics at the time, to be fair to DeMott, made the same mistake.) Thus can he claim that Hughes's movies are always about the erosion of class boundaries, supporting the \\"myth of classlessness\\" by subsuming everyone into the \\"Imperial Middle.\\" This is not the case, though, unless you ignore the narrative structure of the films. The endings of the films--intra-class romance vs. the rejection of it--are radically different. Clearly, something was going on in America that could account for such a shift in accepted plotting, but the book doesn't interest itself in this particular historical rupture.This weakness touches as well on a paradox central to his argument. For, while DeMott claims that Americans foster a fantasy of American culture as \\"classless,\\" he repeatedly uses the notion of upward social mobility to support other points. How can a society so ambivalent about the possibility of class be so ardent in their pursuit of rising from one class to another?It's entertaining reading--especially the stories of politicians, like Gore, Dole, and Bush, Sr., trying to make themselves into \\"working men\\"--and often provocative. But, often, \\"The Imperial Middle\\" feels more relentlessly polemical than carefully thoughtful."},{"Title":"DEAD NAMES : THE DARK HISTORY OF THE NECRONOMICON","review":"After twenty-five years, Simon re-emerges with a new work on the Necronomicon.The first section deals with the supposed history behind the Simon Necronomicon's appearance. Is it true? Perhaps, though I doubt Simon was really the model for Corso in THE NINTH GATE. Is it entertaining? Definitely.The second is an argument in favor of the Necronomicon's existence, which critiques its critics, including our book, THE NECRONOMICON FILES. I'd recommend that readers double-check what Simon says against other sources as much as possible. I've already found one talking point that originates in a roleplaying game, and another where the source Simon cites contradicts what he wrote. Even by occult trade paperback standards, the factual content is unimpressive.On a personal note, we are disappointed in Simon's showing, and are seriously considering whether he'll remain our literary arch-nemesis.

He very sucessfully debunks myth of all kinds, real skeptical criticism he recieved that comes out of the same thing as the meaningless superstition that could surround a supposedly nonscientific and \\"spirit based\\" magic book, while showing himself as a primary critic of the sometimes cultic \\"occult\\" scene himself, and a noble key figure in the legitimacy of obscure mystical books.The Dark History centers around his personal experiences with translating a stolen Greek manuscript in New York from the perspective of the best kind of person you might find in any sort of \\"scene\\", the character of the Bookish progressive; not that of the nihilists that destroy the practice of spiritualism and make it condemmed by mainstream society every time it comes to light in human history.In total tandem symmetry to his \\"new age\\" critiques, the second half of the book mostly debunks historical myths about the cultures and place where the Necronomicon originated, very close to the ancient land of Babylon, where present day Iraq stands today. There are also chapters that deal with the myth of the Necronomicon being an invention of HP Lovecraft.It is great for bibliohistorians of the obscure, skeptics of all kinds, and everyone post republican 2000 election. It has a wide appeal beyond what you may think upon buying it, and is very much worth a second read. It serves a purpose beyond the history of the text in question, by providing a great history of the differant submovements that shaped the \\"new age\\" movement with an implied parallel to protestant like detached Christian denominations, which are vividly described. It is a very nice read that is a study in the social construction of knowledge, with universal metaphor abounding ."},{"Title":"DEAD NAMES : THE DARK HISTORY OF THE NECRONOMICON","review":"Why did Simon, after so many years, decide to supplement his earlier works?

I amalso of the Orthodox faith, I was born April, of 1952, and Igrew up and lived only a few blocks away from St. Stephen'sChapel at 144th Street and Hillside Ave. in Queens, a placewhere it is likely the original Necronomicon spent some time.That particular area was a hot bed of UFO activity, and therewere many reports of huge UFO's coming into ground contactat that time around in that area.

I, myself, have never read Lovecraft because I'm one of those \\"truth is stranger than fiction\\" readers (one scholarly book a day!).Anyway besides giving some good insight into the weird counter-intelligence scene that works through religion we also get an excellent analysis of ancient Sumerian religion and its connection to other cultures.The \\"pop science\\" position on Sumeria is that it could not be tied to African-based cultures but I had just browsed a book showing the Elamite as an African-based culture -- Dravidian at least!I just think that white U.S. culture is very myopic and this includes the comments on Taoist magic versus ceremonial magic in this book. Taoists are playful and use all the emotions in their healing.The most poignant part of the book was just the psychic reliving of the psychic armor created in the development of Western monotheism. Professor Brian Fagan's book \\"The Long Summer\\" gives a good detailed analysis of how the Holocene warming period that enabled civilization then led to desertification and wars and this great fear that the Gods would forget humans or that the Gods are destruction.I'm almost willing to through out that the great fear of the Ocean as Tiamat, Leviathan, etc. is some sort of vast \\"reverse psychology\\" somatic dissociation dynamic.Thanks Simon!"},{"Title":"DEAD NAMES : THE DARK HISTORY OF THE NECRONOMICON","review":"Review by Smasher666Excellent book. This book gives great wieght towards the validity of the Necronomicons origin.I was quite amused at Simons witicism in replying to the attacks of doubting Thomas Danharms etc.I was quite surprised to see Simon saying the exact same things word for word which I have been preaching to disciples for a long time. From warrior priest to saving the planet Simon makes it very clear that he is a champion of the light. It is very evident where Simons heart is.He has been recluse for years but not surprising behavior for a priest or Monk to live as a Hermit in search of the light.In the later chapters the master sage gives gems of wisdom for the would be priest.Simon tells us little about himself but what he says paints a picture of a man very concerned about mankind and our planet.Review by Smasher666"},{"Title":"DEAD NAMES : THE DARK HISTORY OF THE NECRONOMICON","review":"The first part of this book is an interesting sidebar to Peter Levenda's Sinister Forces trilogy, particularly the discussion on the \\"Wandering Bishops\\" phenomenon.

Hopefully the money gained by this endeavor was spent well."},{"Title":"DEAD NAMES : THE DARK HISTORY OF THE NECRONOMICON","review":"As someone who writes under a pseudonym, I think the attempts to \\"out\\" the author of this book are impolite. Moreover, they miss the point. Simon may be an individual, a group, one aspect of a human personality or the embodiment of an inhuman one. I do think, however, that this book deserves a wider readership than the \\"Necronomicon\\" label by itself probably attracts.Simon claims to be an ordained priest who came into possession of the manuscript that would later be published as the \\"Simon\\" Necronomicon. Whether you take that book (or even the backstory) seriously, this book is seriously fun. Simon offers a window into a several very odd subcultures. First among these is the community of \\"wandering bishops\\" of Orthodox Christian lineage who collect ordinations like postage stamps and engage in byzantine political intrigues - dealing in old books, fighter jet plans, and telecommunications equipment. According to the author, these bishops are not necessarily holy men. They crave legitimate consecration for the power it bestows, regardless of the sincerity of their religious belief. Some use this power to conduct black masses, others to conduct espionage.Scoff if you want, but the author has a point. To illustrate the occult power of episcopal consecration, Simon recounts the story of two of these bishops, barely 18 at the time, who sought priesthood primarily as a means of avoiding the draft. As freshly-minted clerics in the (also freshly-minted) \\"Slavonic Orthodox Church\\" these kids quickly discovered that ordination brought unexpected benefits: instant credibility, tax free status, and access to political events. They were amazed to discover that their newfound credentials allowed them to sneak past security and straight into Bobby Kennedy's funeral! When they found themselves LEADING the procession from the church, they realized they had stumbled onto something powerful. Like Obi-Wan Kenobi's \\"these are not the droids you're looking for,\\" this is a form of magic. Later, if you believe the author, the same two padawan would also stumble into possession of a Sumerian grimoire that they would repackage as the Necronomicon. The story is goofier than the Thor comic book series of the 1970's - TOO goofy to be entirely fictional.The author also knows a lot about the occult movements of the 1960's in and around New York City and much of the book is a bittersweet memoir of the dawning of the Age of Aquarius. The people involved in the publication of the Necronomicon lived like rock stars and frequently died like them. Their stories deserve to be told and Simon does so with respect.This is (to say the very least) not a book for everyone. But if you are a psychonaut with a sense of humor you will probably dig this. Especially recommended for fans ofSinister Forces-The Nine: A Grimoire of American Political Witchcraft (Sinister Forces). This is, almost, Sinister Forces vol. IV and it contains a lot of biographical detail about Peter Levenda."},{"Title":"DEAD NAMES : THE DARK HISTORY OF THE NECRONOMICON","review":"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK JUST TO READ THE FASCINATING STORIES ABOUT THE LATE, GREAT LARRY \\"Kosmo\\" BARNES. I just ordered this book, and am very much looking forward to reading it (especially having \\"looked inside\\" using amazons \\"search inside\\" feature - looks like a WONDERFUL book!). I was a casual aquantance of Larry Barnes, who called himself \\"Kosmo\\" (a CENTRAL character in this book!!), but he made quite an impression on me, as I'm sure he did on everyone that crossed his path. Larry ran an \\"occult bookstore\\" called \\"Inner Journey\\" in Southern California in the early 1990's, and I would always look foreward to browsing around his store, picking up some oils and incense, and of course my wonderful talks with Larry himself. LITTLE DID I KNOW HOW LUCKY I WAS to have been graced by this man's presence. I will share a few memories here for those who have read this wonderful book, or are thinking of ordering it:Larry had a hardcover copy of the Necronomicon behind the counter under glass. One time I asked him if I could see it, and he said \\"yes\\". He handed it to me, and as I thumbed through it, I saw a photograph of a young girl within the pages. I took the picture and said \\"What is this\\"? - He quickly grabbed the book and put the picture back between the same pages and said \\"it's a containment spell\\".There was a wonderful psychic who worked at \\"Inner Journey\\". One day, I asked about her and he told me that she had died. My response was very much like anyone's would be \\"Oh my God, I'm so sorry, that's HORRIBLE!!!\\" - To which Larry replied in a raised, agitated tone, \\"DON'T SAY THAT !!!! IT'S NOT HORRIBLE!!! IT'S NOT HORRIBLE AT ALL!!! IN FACT, IT'S THE GREATEST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU !!!!!!!!!!\\"Larry once told me about a time back in the late 70's when he was publishing the Necronomicon that he would often see a black car with the licence plate that simply said \\"666\\" on it. He said it had to be a very powerful force to be able to materialize an object like that.Larry told me that the text of the Necronomicon was slightly altered to make it a little more difficult to use, but if someone knew what they were doing, that they would be able to \\"open the gates\\". Shortly after the Iraq/Kuait war, Larry told me that he thinks someone was able to use the Necronomicon to open the gates due to all of the strange things that were happening in the world.I loved the \\"occult oils\\" he would stock in his store. One time I asked him about the oils, and he told me that I should choose the vials that had sat on the shelf the longest, as they would be the most powerful.One day, I went to go to my favorite bookstore, \\"Inner Journey\\", and what I saw inside was very disturbing. There had been a horrible fire. There was a hole burned through the black ceiling with light shining through the top. You could see the charred remains of the inventory inside: tapes still on the rack, grotesquely melted and drooping. There was a note taped to the window with Larry and his wives number that simply said \\"If you need us, call...\\".I never saw Larry again, but I would talk with one of his friends from time to time, who said that he was doing well, and was manufacturing a new type of \\"magnetic healing jewelry\\" or something. Larry died in December of 2001. I hope his wife is OK. I can't wait to read this book so I can once again feel close to Larry. He was quite a being, unlike anybody else I've ever met before, and I hope you've all enjoyed reading this."},{"Title":"DEAD NAMES : THE DARK HISTORY OF THE NECRONOMICON","review":"First off, nowhere in the book does Simon link the events of the assassination of any Kennedy, the Son of Sam murders, the Jonestown Massacre, the murder of John Lennon, the Gulf War, or the 9/11/2001 attacks to the Necronomicon. Anyone who says so made that assumption just from looking at the timeline of personal and historical events, from 1950 to 2006, in the front of the book.I'm glad to see that Dan Harms, if it really is him, has shown in the title of his review that it is clearly biased and therfore, in my opinion, unreliable as an objective viewpoint.This book is nothing more than a history of of the people and the book with references to events that happend around them, not as an inference to some mystical connection, but to give reference to the atmosphere of the times that events took place. Any coincidence is simply that, coincidence."},{"Title":"DEAD NAMES : THE DARK HISTORY OF THE NECRONOMICON","review":".Do you believe that a couple of monks ripped off rare books, one of which happened to be an ancient grimoire with Sumerian roots which Simon translated and published in the late '70s as \\"The Necronomicon\\"?Almost 30 years after, he comes up with more details of what happened back then. The first long, long part of the book is about how he and a friend, in their teens, impersonate Orthodox priests. This does not seem terribly relevant and one fears it was added so the book would have 316 pages instead of 225. Though it is interesting.Then he gets into the story (myth?) of the book's creation. Finally he answers objections.It seems unlikely the story is true. But, hey, I believe in the Great Pumpkin.The greater question to me, is why wait 30 years to tell the story? He's had a spate of publishing within the last 5 years: \\"Papal Magic\\" and \\"Gates of the Necronomicon\\" came out too.\\"The Necronomicon\\" is still in print, three decades on; still available in hard copy at my local Barnes and Noble. If it's a hoax, it is an uncommonly successful one.Either way, \\"Dead Names\\" makes an engaging read."},{"Title":"DEAD NAMES : THE DARK HISTORY OF THE NECRONOMICON","review":"The Necronomicin, Edited by Simon & Publish by AVON BOOKS. Is a dark grimoire written by Abdul Alhazred, also call the Mad Arab. The book can be catalog into three parts. The first is a lenghtwise introduction by the editor Simon. His introduction is very interesting & is necessary. He even includes a pronunciation guide on the incantations & a bibliography. The second part of the book is written by the author Abdul Alhazred & is call the Testimony of the Mad Arab. Here he confess that he lived amongst many different tribes of people throughout Arabia & has learned their history & their magical practices. The third part of the book is a collection of these tribes histories & their magic. The last part of the book is called the Testimony of the Mad Arab Part Two. Here the author writing becomes estrange as if he is deeply troubled & the more we read we learn that he is becoming concern of his well being as if he is sensing a presence that is enclosing in on him. That is the End of the book, Necronomicon. What happen to the author? A few of the tribes he lived among probably did not take kindly to Abdul Alhazred copying their magic down in his own dark grimoire & decided to summon a djinn to tracked after him throughout the desert & properly dispose of him. What is a djinn? An ancient race of beings that existed before people. They have the power to alter or change reality however they desire. The Arabic people believe they still occupy the southern deserts & that explains why those parts of the deserts has been left uninhabited. According to the desciptions written on the last page of the book, it reads like a djinn was using his/her power to alter reality to make Abdul Alhazred protection spells inactive. If you seek to learn more of the djinn race, I suggest purchasing a copy of LYNDON HARDY Master of the Five Magics. The book is not currently being distributed by a publisher, but you can find some used copys right here at amazon.com. What type of magic is found in the Necronomicon? Mostly just two types. The conjuration of Watchers, Elder Gods & Goddesses, & the Ancient Ones the race of djinns serve with loyalty & complete understanding. The creation of magical portals called Gates that the magician can walk through into another world. Do the spells work? Yes! If you be a powerful magician that can use extreme force & desire to make the incantations work for you. This is not a how to guide for beginning magicians or intermediate magicians still developing their power! Is the magical spells found in the Necronomicon dangerous? Every magical spell casted is dangerous because every magical spell casted uses up something of the magician life-force. When that life-force is all gone the magician mind, spirit, & body will become NOTHING! This is why there has always been hundreds of thousands of people practicing magic but seldom few ever become real powerful magicians. Why is some people calling it a fake? Go to the search block, select books & the type in THE CHALDEAN GENESIS by George Smith. You can always use true divination magic to confirm that H.P. LOVECRAFT had access to a Necronomicon before writing those horrid stories. If you still have any doubts about purchasing this book, Necronomicon. I suggest you walk into a museum, look up & behold in awe & amazement the skeleton remains of the Ancient Ones called Dinosaurs. Then you will know what it feels like to be at the bottom of the food chain!

He shows up their sloppy sophomorish scholarship, which was refreshing since Harms and Gonce were so smug and condescending. The reviewer who calls him/herself doms goals, though, is another matter. I don't agree that Simon should have written a book about how other people have used the Necronomicon. That's not really interesting. That kind of thing is so subjective and unverifiable and anyway you can find it all over the place on the Net so what's the point? By publishing the story behind the book Simon did all of us a service. He gave us a weapon to use whenever some other smug Harms-and-Gonce type comes our way and tells us the Simon Necronomicon is a fake. We can point to the newspaper articles and the documents and all the facts in there and challenge the naysayers. I can understand Harms being angry, he was bitch-slapped by Simon in this book. But doms goals? The remark that Simon needed money so he wrote a book is just stupid. All writers write because they need money. I mean Stephen King doesn't write for the Red Cross, right? He writes for his bank account. And no one complains. But all the other reviews by doms goals have been about S&M.; What's that all about? Maybe he/she secretly wishes he/she was bitch-slapped, too?

At times, subjects stray away from an end until another chapter, and the story of the two priests crashing Bobby Kennedy's funeral was superfluous for me because I wanted to get to the bare bones of the subject, which can be found in the second half of the book.however, as stated before, RESEARCH THE NAMES GIVEN.The last chapter is pretty much muckracking towards Harms and Gonce and some passages could have been omitted for tact's sake. But, nonetheless, despite the hard-to-read-writing, the wordy confidence and attacks (however deserving they were!) on Harms and Gonce, Simon makes his point once and for all making this book a worth-while read for those interested in the beginnings of the Necronomicon, and if it is what it is."},{"Title":"DEAD NAMES : THE DARK HISTORY OF THE NECRONOMICON","review":"In response to the last review.

Back in 1973, I met a man named Robert W. Dills. He was a caligrapher.A man named George Scithers hired him to do a faux Arabic Text and it was to pose as THE NECRONOMICON.L.Sprague deCamp wrote a lengthy introduction, claiming the book was written in \\"Duriac\\". At a gathering at Scither's house, after the book had been bound up in a limited edition of 300 + copies, he proudly showed who ever was there the one amusing item he wanted to do: get a copy in the British Museum. Just like it would be in a H.P.Lovecraft story.And there was a title given to it as \\"Al Azif\\". Duriac does not exist, as a language. It is a name of a variety of wheat.The book did well for what it was--just a conversation piece. Dills admited there was a translation of sorts, and it would reveal a laundry list.Go to January 1974. A woman I was dating dragged me off to a science fiction convention, and before the convention was to begin, dragged me off to The Warlock Shop, which involved going to Brooklyn.There in the shop, was the NECRONOMICON, perched on a shelf, surrounded by advertising that subscriptions were being taken for the translation of the book.I asked Herman Slater, \\"Don't you know that's a joke?\\" Herman Slater said, \\"It's not a joke. It's real. And we have lined up someone to do a translation.\\"Thoughout the whole book Simon has written, he never mentions this tome, and this is signifigant, since Herman Slater said \\"It was real\\", and didn't see the joke after it was explained to him.Of course, Simon claims he was a charming interesting man, a claim that goes against all other descriptions of Herman Slater I've ever encountered.Anyway, the book's history in Simon's hands seems to be throwing as many names and issues together and hope they might make some sort of collage impression that something important had been discussed. Tossing Charles Manson and David Berkowitz and other names together that don't tie into the book's history isn't signifigant. And Berkowitz was a Postal Worker, not a cab driver when he was arrested. Get the facts correct if you're going to mention them."},{"Title":"DEAD NAMES : THE DARK HISTORY OF THE NECRONOMICON","review":"I can't believe this book was even written. Considering that Lovecraft INVENTED the Necronomicon for his writings makes EVERYTHING written about this so-called real grimoire completely moot. It's like writing about finding the Emerald City of Oz in the Utah desert. And for those who still believe that the book really existed... you have got to stop deluding yourself and finding laughable ways and theories to prove that it really existed! I have been a Lovecraft fan for over 18 years and own everything he has produced, so of course I picked up the \\"original\\" Simon Necronomicon when it came out. In trade paperback, of course. I mean, how dangerous could it be? It has an ISBN number! And we all know what a joke that book was. So please, if you want entertainment and a damn good read, then read something by Lovecraft. If you want to continue to delude yourself, by all means, read this book and have fun."},{"Title":"DEAD NAMES : THE DARK HISTORY OF THE NECRONOMICON","review":"This is a good companion piece to the Necronomicon as it puts the history and culture of the New York occult/Wicca/Pagan movement in context with the first publishing of this book.

I can tell you its history for free, in one paragraph.In the 1920s and 30s there was a brilliant pulp fiction writer named H. P. Lovecraft. He created his own made up religion, which would come to be known as the \\"Cthulhu Mythos\\", providing a backdrop for a series of short stories which were published in a fantasy magazine called \\"Weird Tales\\". The best and most well known of these stories are \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" and \\"The Dunwich Horror\\", and they center around \\"The Old Ones\\", alien gods/demons of unimaginable power who will one day return to our world and bring about the end of mankind. In the course of creating this entirely made up religion, he created an ancient grimoire which could be used to open the portals between the worlds and bring the Old Ones back. He called it the Necronomicon.There it is. A concise history of the Necronomicon. Anything that claims to be an \\"authentic\\" Necronomicon is just as real as the planet Oz or flesh eating zombies. If you're inclined to believe in these things, either grow up or seek professional help.By the way, Lovecraft is a great writer.

But it's not very well written, with sections just bouncing all over the place in an almost stream-of-consciousness approach. And factually, well, let's just say I wouldn't spend a lot of money betting on this information. Just for starters, Simon claims to be the inspiration for the Johnny Depp character \\"Corso\\" in the film \\"The Ninth Gate\\". He claims this because Polanski, the director of the film, knows him from various connections in New York, etc. The reality, which Simon apparently doesn't know, is that this film is based on the book \\"The Club Dumas\\", by Spanish author Arturo Perez-Reverte. The character, and the entire plot of the movie, comes right out of this book. Which, come to think of it, is a MUCH better book than this one, and highly recommended as a fictional detective story about a valuable tome of occult lore."},{"Title":"DEAD NAMES : THE DARK HISTORY OF THE NECRONOMICON","review":"Yeah, Yeah everyone says its a hoax. People like to deny the truth. This book is one of the most valuable pieces of occult lititure to hit the book stores. It gives an unprecidented history of the occult in the 60's & 70's. If it is such a hoax why does Crowley allude to Sumerian Gods, Why did William s. Burrorghs give it such high regards, why does Kenneth Grant increasitly talk about it? I have been in the Occult and practiced Magick for 25 years and been in the OTO for 22 years. This book is one of the most enlightening books of its time. The reading with an open mind will find a path of iniatition that they will never find in any group workings. This book will show the reader a way that will take him on an astral journey that far exceeds Golden Dawn iniatition, Enochian works, OTO, or even the A.'.A.'.Crowley was very aware of Sumerian Gods and most likely had an idea of the Necromonicans extistance. This books suggests that Jack Parsons may have had a copy of the Necromican as well as Lovecraft himself. Parsons workings will enforce this idea.The book in itself is a fun read for anyone with an interest in the occult just for its historial review. I have read a lot of books on Magick and the occult (in the hundreds, even written one) and this is one of my favorites.Yes, this book and the Necromonicon is hated by the critics. It is despised by armchair magicians. Let the sceptics travel this path. Don't buy into the know-it-all wanta be magicans who give this book a bad review. This book is great! It is a rare classic. Highest recommendations."},{"Title":"DEAD NAMES : THE DARK HISTORY OF THE NECRONOMICON","review":"I just read this book out of curiosity. I had hoped to learn about the necronomicon. All \\"Simon\\" talks about is his own life, or should I say fantasy life. He ends up sounding like an angry child with an \\"I'll show THEM\\" attitude. And there really isn't much history to it. He borrows a lot from books by Robert Anton Wilson and others, calling it his owns life. Very sad. But I'm sure he has already made a pretty penny just based on the shock value of the title. I advise you to save your money for something valid."},{"Title":"An Unfinished Woman: A Memoir","review":"I bought this book after seeing a documentary on Lillian Hellman on PBS. PBS said that Lillian Hellman is the foremost female American playright and movie script writer. She was also sympathetic to or at least a devoted student of the communism of Marx and Engels. During the McArthy era she and her boyfriend, novelist Dashiell Hammett, were forced to testify before the Committee on Un-American Activities.But to focus on her communist sympathies would be a distraction from the rest of her remarkable life. Lillian does not. This memoir is a fascinating mix of travel essay, character portraits, and a biography of her unorthodox youth split between Louisianna and New York.The best written chapters are character portraits of her friends Dorothy Parker and Dashiel Hammett. It is here that you can understand her skills as a playright for she probes the actions of each person and seeks to explain why they behaved as they did. Let interesting a chapters where she just inserts portions of her diary in chronological order.As a Southernor I can understand the relation she had with Sophronia, the black woman who acted as her governess and parent's housekeeper. For in the South the lives of blacks and whites intertwine in a manner that non-Southerners would not understand. Sophronia untangled the problems in Lilians life long after she left the Hellman's employ.Parts of this memoir reads like Getrude Stein's &quot;The Biography of Alice B. Toklas&quot;. There is much name dropping of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Like Hemingway, Lillian joined the fight against facism in Spain. But the Paris-based passages are not so memorable as those of Getrude Stein in part since these literary are art circles were not such a large part of Lillian's life. In fact she preferred the seclusion of her farm to life in the city.Far more noteworthy is Lillian's description of 6 months in the Soviet Union during World War II as a guest of the Soviet government. Lillian was envied by the regular press corps because she travelled to the front lines while they were restricted to their dreary hotel.After reading her memoirs, I doubt I will reads her plays. Since Lillian says hardly anything about them I haven't an idea what they are about. Rather I will continue to plow through the Great Books of the Western Canon--a lifelong pursuit for Lillian as well."},{"Title":"An Unfinished Woman: A Memoir","review":"A life where no living is done is a life not worth living. Like O'Neil, Shaw, Williams and Isben, Lillian Hellman (1905-1984, scriptwriter, playwrite, social and political activist and critic) wrote some of the most enduring and thought-provoking drama for the theatre in the 20th century, and the above 'proverb' could very easily have been her epitaph. An Unfinished Woman (Winner of the 1969 National Book Award for biography/Autobiography), the first memoir in her autobiographical trilogy (the two others being Pentimento: A Book of Portraits and Scoundrel Time), showcases a woman who had a 'steel rod' for a spine, a woman of stark liberty who would not compromise her beliefs nor truckle in the presence of those political, military and literary higher-uppers (Hemmingway is a case-in-point) whom she encountered who expected a cowering reaction due to their 'clout.' But that was something she never offered, for as Lillian Hellman said of herself when asked the question, &quot;What are you made of, Lily?&quot; Her cool response was, &quot;Pickling spice and nothing nice.&quot; This 'confession' of glued-together memories and eloquent journal entries shimmers with quiet, concentrated reflection and introspection. Each chapter gleams and flashes like a beacon, slowly proffering insights into not simply a remarkable life but a frozen portrait of a bygone era - a period of class, dignity, wisdom, self-learning, an endless stream of wonderful things that are presently no more. She hobnobbed with the best and brightest, luminaries like: F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemmingway, William Faulkner, Dorothy Parker, John Hersey, Averell Harriman, and of course, above them all, her truelove and literary confidant, Dashiell Hammett. As a globe-trotting cultural attache' to Russia, France, Germany, and other European lands, she lived and saw intrigue with those of her like mind. She was on the front lines (or very close to them) during World War II. She witnessed bombed out villages and destroyed lives, all the emotional and physical calamities that the horrors of war can funnel forth, broadcasting them for all to hear and imbibe. She participated (with some trepidation) in the PEN (Poets, Playwrites, Essayists and Editors and Novelists) Center Conference, conversing with intellectuals on the pressing issues of the time, but her reluctance was most unequivocal, for intellectual chitchat can, and for her, did quickly evolve into a bombastic mess on hyperbolic, pretentious proportions. She saw B.S., and she saw truth, not hesitating in the least to speak her mind or to write about it. From her reminiscences of her New Orleans girlhood with her beloved caretaker Sophronia, to her shuffling to New York, to her failed marriage and her father's infidelity, Hellman's life only crescendos. With corrosive verve, 'salty' wit and profound insight, Lillian Hellman lets the past truly come alive. In the end, she showed one and all that she was an 'empowered' woman before many thought that could ever be possible."},{"Title":"An Unfinished Woman: A Memoir","review":"Suppose you get sick as a dog for a few days. Nobody knows what's ailing you. So, you buy 25 bananas and scarf them all down. When asked, you say, \\"Oh, bananas are creamy delicious and they go down smooth as velvet.\\" Kind of poetic, but why did you eat them ? Did you get cured ? Yeah, well, the first book of Lillian Hellman's three volume autobiography, AN UNFINISHED WOMAN, bears a close resemblance to this little scenario. It was on the best seller list for months, we are told. It's certainly well-written, I won't deny that. But does it really tell you much about Lillian Hellman ? That's another story.Lillian Hellman came from a German-American background, growing up in both New Orleans and New York. Did she have any Jewish connection ? The book does not tell you. After dropping out of colleges, she got married. She stayed with the guy for seven years, but we learn zilch about him, nor about why she chose him then dropped him. Later, she became famous for writing a number of plays that were highly successful on Broadway. She became a nationally known author. Is there even a single word about how, why, where and when she wrote any of these plays ? No, nothing. In fact, if I hadn't heard of Lillian Hellman over many years, I would have no clue as to why reading this autobiography would be interesting. We learn of her close relationship to two black women, both servants in her home. This reflects the civil rights movement and political trends of the 1960s when she wrote the memoir. I am not sure they played such a central role in her life. She also talks a lot about Dorothy Parker and Dashiell Hammett, with the latter of whom she had a 30-year affair. (She had affairs with a number of other people, but they are not mentioned.) Hellman became a political activist early on and her heart went out to the left. She visited Spain during the Civil War and Russia several times. We get almost nothing of her political convictions; the book is apolitical. She finds the time, though, to show how she didn't have any interest in interviewing Stalin or in travelling with the Red Army. Did she have deep political commitments ? Was she a Communist sympathizer ? Other people say she was, but her beliefs play no role in this strange autobiography. What we get are very impressionistic, humorous, and self-centered portraits of Spain and Russia. Hellman defied the House Un-American Activities Committee but did not go to jail. Perhaps she was blacklisted afterwards, but the book does not tell us. On top of all this, she rarely introduces the people whose names she drops. There is no historical background to anyone and no information on how she knew many of the people either. I fear that this volume will, like O. Henry's stories, become so \`period-specific' in future that the generations to come will not understand much due to lack of familiarity with the times, the people, and the issues. If little vignettes about famous people turn you on, you might like AN UNFINISHED WOMAN. To know Lillian Hellman, you'd better read something else."},{"Title":"An Unfinished Woman: A Memoir","review":"Turns out much of what Lillian Hellman wrote in Pentimento was stolen from another person's life, but still, An Unfinished Woman, for which she won the National Book Award in 1969 (for autobiography) is quite a coup. Political activist, critic, and playwrite, Hellman cut a wide swath thru literary circles during her heyday in the 40s, 50s and 60s. This introspective collection of her journal entries and memories shines with her acerbic brilliance. Her circle of \`friends' included just about all the famous people of her era: Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Dorothy Parker, Faulkner, and of course Dashiell Hammett, her lover, friend, and confidant. This is a personal account of a life lived as if there were no tomorrow, a nearly romantic rendering of the flavor of a special era in this country, and the documentation of feminine empowerment before the word had even been invented."},{"Title":"An Unfinished Woman: A Memoir","review":"Lillian Hellman is one of the most important American women writers and this, her memoir, is a literary feast--witty, poignant, brash, and cynical; but as Hellman once wrote, &quot;Cynicism is an unpleasant way of saying the truth.&quot; I love her plays and I loved this book!--Diana Dell, compiler, Memorable Quotations: American Women Writers of the Past."},{"Title":"An Unfinished Woman: A Memoir","review":"Winner of the National Book Award for best autobiography, An Unfinished Woman candidly chronicles the life of playwright Lillian Hellman, America's leading female dramatist.The majority of this memoir emphasizes Hellman's unique relationship with mystery writer, Dashiell Hammett. She also reflects on her housekeeper, Helen, who was a close friend, as well as her relationship with writer-humorist, Dorothy Parker. Hellman additionally tells us of her trials and tribulations with writers like Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Nathaniel West, and many others. Add to the mix her travels to Russia (twice) and her involvement in the Spanish Civil War --along with her \`Hollywood' stories centered around Samuel Goldwyn and William Wyler -- and we get a delightful, lively, hard-nosed look back to an era when writers seemed to be the embodiment of intellectualism, style, and good sense.Throughout the memoir, Hellman comes across as having an iron-wit and a volatile temper. Her no-nonsense vitality and her passion for moral equity frequently conflicts with those around her. Hellman is most illuminating, though, when she allows us to see her vulnerability. Upon returning to Moscow after twenty-two years, she cries before she even gets off the plane. She writes, \\"I knew that I had taken a whole period of my life and thrown it somewhere, always intending to call for it again, but now that it came time to call, I couldn't remember where I had left it. Did other people do this, drop the past in a used car lot and leave for so long that one couldn't even remember the name of the road?\\"Possibly the best piece in the entire memoir is the chapter devoted to Dashiell Hammett, author of The Maltese Falcon and The Thin Man. Her on-again, off-again relationship with Hammett over thirty years reveals a fascinating homage to her \\"closest, most beloved friend.\\" We are presented with the portrait of a man who was both complex and simple, and a relationship that was both tumultuous and inspiring. Several college text books carry this particular chapter as an example of prime autobiographical writing, and it's easy to see why. Hellman's trademark craftsmanship sculpts mishmash-memories into a compact, flowing character study of a remarkably interesting man.Although Hellman omits significant aspects of her life in An Unfinished Woman, her persecution during the McCarthy era can be found in Scoundrel Time, while details about her numerous plays can be found in Pentimento.Controversy still surrounds the accuracy of Lillian Hellman's memoirs (did she really fabricate autobiographical stories such as 'Julia'? -- included in Pentimento), yet the passages contained in an An Unfinished Woman are nevertheless dynamic and poignant. Hellman writes about issues that seem to obscure mere fact, and the \\"truth\\" she offers has a human commonality which goes beyond the boundaries of simple invention. It's important for those who fervently criticize her to keep in mind Hellman repeatedly tells us that she doesn't trust her memory, and her comments about reviewing one's life -- about the twists and turns of remembrance -- remain the underlying theme in all of her memoirs."},{"Title":"An Unfinished Woman: A Memoir","review":"a very candid, straightforward, refreshing memoir by this very strong, very human, very intelligent woman, artist about her art, relationships, opinions on culture, politics, and her convictions. It is refreshing because this person was very frequently in the center of politics and culture and was quite influential in many aspects, however, her writing is completly without the flare of self inflation or narcissism that I see in so many memoirs these days.

The three triplet girls are revered by their people as the 'Living Trillium'. The Witch is the Princess Haramis (eldest triplet) whose interest in books, learning, magic and the command of power may become her downfall. The Warrior is Kadiya (middle sister) who discovers that she is not as tough as she thinks. The Woman is Anigel (youngest daughter) who is more prone to dancing and clothes. They live in peace for 18 years before trouble strikes at the heart of their family. The sisters are separated and each mus follow a different path to reach their final destination and it may still be longer before they can reunite to destroy the evil sorceror Orogastus. He seems to control Prince Voltrik and is the way to destroy him. Haramis must journey to visit the Archimage and find her talisman (a wand) before accepting a great burden. Kadiya ventures into the lands of the Oddlings, creatures of different races who inhabit the swamps. She must find a sword and accept a different kind of burden. Anigel is captured by Voltrik's son Antar and with the help of a servant escapes. She must draw on strength she didn't know she had to find a circlet and complete her quest. Meanwhile, Antar has fallen in love with this beautiful princess and the more he is forced to pursue and capture her, the more he loves her. Orogastus can see their every move and the sisters grow desperate. How can they defeat one who can counter every plan and thought? Good read. One thing I didn't particularly like was the way the story jumped around. I have a feeling that each writer (there's three) chose a different princess and wrote solely about them. Therefore, sometimes I found myself a litte off-balanced."},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"The trio authors Marion Zimmer Bradley, Julian May, and Andre Norton have created a world so enchanting that I had to read non-stop from beginning to end. Action began from the first page as the triplet sisters are forced to split up and embark on their own journeys, and conquer themselves.The story is fun, beleivable, and full of mystery surrounding the ancient citizens of the planet, the vanished ones. It is fairly easy to read because the authors did not add too much description, or confusing topics, which often take away the pleasure of reading.The charcters came to life for me because their personalities were so human. Also, although I am not a feminist, I enjoyed the fact that the main characters Kadiyah, Haramis, and Anigel are women, which is a good change from many other fantasy stories that have either men as the lead characters or super-strong and unrealistic women running around and beating everyone up, (*cough*Xena-wannabees*cough), excuse me.Black Trillium has all the elements that make an excellent story. The only problem that I had with it is that the ending seemed to be a little slapped together because it was so short.This is when all three sisters confront The bad guy, Orogastus, together for the first time. About two short chapters later, the story ends. This dosen't create any loose ends, but it does take some of the momentum that the story had built up."},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"This book is totally awesome! I mean, I'm 12 and I liked it so much that I read 3 times which is pretty good for me. I usually only read books once, even if they're really good. I just couldn't get sick of this one. I recommend it to anyone and everyone that every loved fantasy, magic and soul-travelling."},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"Review from Roz:I'll admit I wasn't too thrilled with the book at first. The whole first chapter, in which the royal family is beseiged in the Ruwenda Citadel, seemed almost melodramatic to me. I remember reading the first part of the book with a lot of skepticism. I was thinking, &quot;Well, this is okay, but it's just not the best book I've ever read.&quot;However, once I got past the first few chapters, I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN. It's just simply a wonderful story. I think most of the appeal lies in the characters--the three princesses who are so different from each other, the dangerously charming bad guy. The history and the setting are very well-thought out. There is an entire side-culture of the &quot;Oddlings&quot;, the other sentient species on the World of Three Moons. The history of the place is textured--besides the surface story of the princesses' quests, there is a deeper, interesting layer underneath: the mystery of the Vanished Ones who have left their strange technology behind.When you really start to think about it, the plot of this book is a little tired. Some things are a little too cliche or contrived. But the bottom line is: Who Cares? It's an effective, interesting, enjoyable book, and I loved it. The characters are the best part. Well done."},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"This book is truly what introduced me to these superb authors .It's definately one of the best books ever written .Magical ,interesting ,fast moving,it has all the qualities to a good book .I adored the creatures they invented ,the Oddlings ,the tree varts ,the Glismak ,the Skritek ,and everything else .They develope a wondreful feeling that I've barely felt before .

Oh well, you can't always win."},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"Hello Everyone,I am basing my rating on my personal enjoyment and perception of each story, and how well it fits with each of the other four books in the 'Trillium Saga'. I am also not basing my rating by comparing it to other books written by each of the 3 authors' other works (Bradley, Norton, May).For this review/rating, I will not bump any stars off for bad service from Amazon/seller, or for any issues pertaining to the Publisher's presentations of these books.For the record, I think the cover artist and the interior maps illustrator did a great job! FYI: I have never read any other books by Bradley, Norton, or May - either before, or since the five Trilliums, so this is my only reading experience with them.I am outlining the chronology of the 5 novels below, because I have noted many people are somewhat confused or unaware of the series as a quintet, and some have asked what reading order, which book directly sequels this or that one, etc. I do not mean to throw any \\"spoilers\\" out here, so I apologize if anything I say is undesired.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------The series goes like this:1990 - BLACK TRILLIUM - by Marion Zimmer Bradley, Andre Norton, and Julian May (focuses on the lives of the Three Sisters and their efforts to defend Ruwenda from invaders from Labornok and Orgastus) ** {Note: 'Haramis' was M. Z. Bradley's character, 'Kadiya' was Ms. Norton's character, and 'Anigel' was Ms. May's character}. ~ Chronologically is #11992 - BLOOD TRILLIUM - by Julian May (direct sequel: precisely follows the plots and characters of 'Black Trillium', although it begins 12 years later. It follows the storyline of a strange new evil wizard from the far north named \\"Portolanus\\" - who might be Orgastus arisen from the dead? Ms. May uses all 3 sisters nearly equally in the story, along w/ all other key players from the prior novel). ~ Chronologically is #3{{{{{Observation between 'Blood' and 'Golden' --- Although written first, the saga's internal timeline of \\"Blood Trillium\\" takes place after \\"Golden Trillium\\". The issue is that the character growth/development of 'Kadyia' as written by Andre Norton, is not followed-through with in 'Blood'. This is not to say Julian May did anything wrong or wrote badly, it just implies that the 2 authors did not coordinate their character-arcs between these 2 installments}}}}}1993 - GOLDEN TRILLIUM - by Andre Norton (very loose sequel...more of a \\"follow-up\\" to 'Black'; it can be read without reading the first two novels. Ms. Norton mentions the other sisters and events from 'Black Trillium', but this novel is 100% Kadiya's story and what she and her companions do in the time following \\"Black Trillium\\"; written in such a way that it does not contradict what would happen in the (to-be) \\"future chronology\\" of 'Blood Trillium'). ~ Chronologically is #21995 - LADY OF THE TRILLIUM - by Marion Zimmer Bradley (storywise, a long-term \\"in the future\\" follow-up to 'Black Trillium', but not directly a sequel to any of the Trillium novels. Bradley focuses on the latter years of eldest sister Haramis, Archimage of the Land, and her efforts to secure & train a successor. Bradley alludes to events in \\"Black\\", but in such a way that this could be a stand-alone story to read, but it is probably better to have read the others first. This takes place some 150-200 years after the closing of 'Black Trillium', so all the other characters are long-since \\"dead\\"). ~ Chronologically is #51997 - SKY TRILLIUM - by Julian May (direct sequel to \\"Blood Trillium\\"; this book does not make notice of anything which transpired in Ms. Norton's \\"Golden Trillium\\", and obviously, it takes place before \\"Lady of the Trillium\\" thereby rendering zero connection to both of those Trillium entries. This story again hinges on the 3 sisters, and the back-from-the-dead Orgastus, and his dealings with Denby Varcour, Archimage of the Sky. Again, Ms. May makes use of all 3 sisters...even though 'Anigel' was her primary creation/responsibility originally). ~ Chronologically is #4-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Thus, the Publishers and authors never \\"numbered\\" this Trillium Saga series. Functionally, I view it as the 'TRILLIUM TRILOGY' consisting of: 1] \\"Black\\", 2] \\"Blood\\", and 3] \\"Sky\\", with \\"Golden\\" and \\"Lady of...\\" being ancillary/companion pieces which can be read anywhere between the other 3, but most likely are best held until after Black/Blood/Sky.*(Or read thus: Black, Golden, Blood, Sky, Lady of...)My pet-peeve is that \\"Sky Trillium\\" was released by a different publisher, and so does no have the same cover artist or interior illustrator for the maps; it visually doesn't match the other four books. Also, \\"Sky\\" apparently is/was not ever available in the U.S. in hardcover anyway (only Trade PB and standard s/c). You can get the hardcover from sellers in UK or Australia, though it will not be the same cover artwork as the American Dell/Skylark paperback that you'd see stateside.I had never read any of these author's prior to this Trillium Saga, and have not read any of their other works to this date. Obviously I was well-aware of \\"Mists of Avalon\\" and went into the series with a preconceived high regard for these authors, based on their respective reputations. I personally enjoyed Julian May's story-telling the most. I read Black, Blood, and Sky with enjoyment and enthusiasm, while I read 'Golden' and 'Lady of...' more out of curiosity and deference to Bradley/Norton's efforts.Overall assessment: By all means read this whole series!! If you only like Norton or Bradley, then just read their solo Trillium volumes; if you are wanting an epic, whole world, ensemble cast, adventure/fantasy, then start with Blood/Black/Sky.~ Scott T.

I was so wrapeed up in this story, I read it again as soon as I finished the last page. I go back every now and again to re-read this wonderous story. I remeber how I felt trying to grow up. I remeber how this book, even though it was surrounded by fantasy, reminded me of the real world. Three girls, three sisters, each unique taking three very diffrent paths to come to the same end, the same conclusion.

It was a disapointment, but I suppose that if you like to gather ideas, then it was worth it."},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"i love this book so much, it is my favorite book. it's about these three sisters who are given a quest for three magical talismans they find them and banish they evil orogatus from the land to the baren ice.it is better when you read every book in the saga."},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"I was primarily a science fiction fan when I came across this book in the library. After reading it, I was so caught up in the wonder of the characters and the suberb storytelling tht I yearned for more. This was the very first fantasy novel that I read and it made me a hard core fan. Now I realize that the concepts of the three sisters quest as well as the invasion are hardly original, but how was I to know then? I was spellbound by an entirely different world and I loved the innocence and charm of the characters which is lacking in some of the sequels to this book. This book has it all, and altough I have since read better fantasy books, this one will always remain one of the closest o my heart."},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"I thought Black Trillium would be a great book because of the three women authoring it, but I found it to be rather shallow. The plot was okay, but the characters didn't have any depth to them. I found myself begging for a conclusion to a boring story. While it's slightly interesting, Black Trillium is a disappointing novel."},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"A gathering of forces brings these authors together to create a magical fantasy. A hard-to-put-down novel filled with complex personalities, exciting action and an underlying truth about the land and its people. Worth reading."},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"The whole serie i af thrilling experience. Even thoug you know it must be fiction, it seem so real. You can't put i down.Read it or weep.Love Peter from Denmark(an excuse to my spelling"},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"This book was not in the able to be finished category. How did this talent come up with such ordinary junk. Too many cooks in this case, I think.Time after time when the characters did something I would think 'what the hell is up with that'. Not really a good sign. Many useless princesses."},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"\\"Black Trillium\\" is an exercise in mediocrity and cliches. It's got all the elements of formula fantasy. Three spunky princesses, one evil king with an evil sorcerer as his sidekick, an ancient sorceress mentor, bits of technology left over from a vanished civilization, magic doohickies, quests, true love, and a climactic showdown where the good guys win and the bad guys are all killed. I normally try to write longer, more in-depth reviews, but with this book it's simply not worth it. The three authors who produced this are all capable of better work. There's simply no excuse for this book."},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"This book was incrediable!!! I loved every page of it. If you like any three of the authors this is a must read book. It was well written it kept the reader intangled inside the book. Everything was just soooooooooooo good I would recomend this book to any sci-fi reader. you would absoultly love it!!!!"},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"Black Trillium got me started on the Trillium series(now all my fav books). It is written by three authors each a brillant talent. The characters are very in-depth and differ in personality. Haramis is the wise, older, scholar type, Anigel the sweet, timid type, and Kadiya(my fav.) the impetuous, bold, daring, hot-headed type. The plot jump starts at the begining off the book never slowing down or faltering in keeping you interested. It's set in The World of the Three Moons, a world with magic and all the great fantasy stuff we all love.The princess each must find their talisman a peice of the three fold sceptre of power(the only thing that can save there kingdom)and overcome a personal struggle of their own. This book is well written and if I could give it more than 5 stars i would!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"The intriguing plot and wonderfully deep characters made this book hard to put down. By the time I had finished it, it became my favorite book."},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"This book is one of 3 legendarily bad books that forced me to stop reading adult fantasy (the other 2 were Shadowmoon and Cormyr, book I). What a shame because this story had promise. The first chapter of The Black Trillium begins with a bang and promises a great story. But everything that follows is downhill after that. There is hardly anything memorable going on in this book. Even the world the characters live in is boring!The three main characters of The Black Trillium, a triplet of princesses who are sisters, have so much untapped potential. But instead of giving us a thrilling fantasy adventure, we get a very slow-moving story with characters who don't do very much other than mope around in a swamp while in exile.It gets worse! The main villian of this story is an evil wizard who spends most of the book talking to a magic mirror. Worse yet, the wizard can't perform any real magic but has to use a machine to imitate magic spells. Even his magic-mirror is a machine! What a stupid concept! Frank L. Baum can get away with a magicless wizard in The Wizard of Oz. But no modern writer should even fathom such nonsense.I had to force myself to read this book and have regretted it ever since. To sum it all up, I hate this book and compare reading it to being put through Chinese water torture. Slow and painful! I don't know how some people can give this book high reviews. Shame on Zimmer-Bradley, Norten, and Lackey. I expected much, much better from three very accomplished fantasy writers. Easily in my top five of worst books ever!"},{"Title":"The Black Trillium","review":"I couldn't get past the prologue. I'm sure this novel improves but read this first line: \\"In the Eighth Hundred after those of Ruwenda came to rule over the swamp wilderness called the Mazy Mire (though not completely, for they never mastered the intractable Oddlings),...\\" and also on the first page: \\"the bog-trotting little Nyssomu and the closely related but more aloof Uisgu (quite nonhuman and therefore clearly designed by Nature to serve their betters)...\\". When attempting to begin reading any novel (especially the first page), it is essential that the novelist writes with clarity; just look at the names you would have to constantly read throughout this book! Check out the tribes' names: Wyvilo; Glismak; Skritek (also called Drowners) and Vespi! There are just too many ridiculous names to bother with, and this doesn't include place names. I just didn't care after three pages.Sadly, I had been looking for this book for 6 months ( I didn't have the courage to buy it on Amazon) - and for good reason.

Whalen took out all of the mystery of the perfect proposal and broke it down into teachable steps. I was able to identify my subject, market, and provide several reasons the book would sell. Soon, I had a contract for my soon to be released book. \\"Managing the Security of Classified Information and Contracts.\\" I know, I know...It's not the most exciting title, but the truth is, it's something I know a lot about and there are no competing titles and the demand is there.

I was green. I sent said proposal to Cook Publishing while Terry Whalin was the acquisitions editor. He believed my book had merit and brought it before the committee. There, it was voted down.I'm still learning. Now Whalin is no longer with Cook Publishing, and he has written a helpful guidebook called \\"Book Proposals That $ell.\\" I can't help but wonder if I had read his book and implemented the 21 steps before I sent him my book proposal, if by now that proposed book idea would be in print.\\"Book Proposals That $ell\\" has everything I need to polish my book proposal in one book. I read the other books before I wrote my original proposal. You see where it got me. The rejection pile. Now I have practical steps I can use to revamp my book proposal and send it on its way with a prayer. And then I will turn my attention to a second book idea.Before, I had excuses for getting rejection letters. Now I have Whalin's book. No more excuses and I must get back to work."},{"Title":"Book Proposals That Sell: 21 SECRETS TO SPEED YOUR SUCCESS","review":"When I dutifully picked up my new copy of Book Proposals that $ell a few days ago, and knowing that I (a perennial avoider of writing said proposals) really should read this, I admit I thought I'd enjoy it about as much as a handful of vitamins. But this slim volume had more than one surprise in store for me!From the start, author W. Terry Whalin captured my interest. He did this by not only taking the mystique out of how to write an effective non-fiction book proposal for me, but also by giving me numerous telling glimpses into the world of editors and royalty publishing.In the first three chapters, Whalin lays the foundation of why such proposals are necessary. He starts by sharing the story of how one of his projects went from idea to published volume via a proposal. Then he goes on to enlighten us about the current state of affairs in publishing and explains why, given the piles of submissions on editors' desks and the small window of opportunity an unsolicited proposal has with an editor, only the most complete and professionally presented will earn a second look.The 21 chapters that follow deal with the nuts and bolts of proposal writing. Many chapters address elements that must be included (e.g. #1 - Know the topic of your book; #5 - Know your competition; # 7 - Create a dynamic marketing plan etc.). A few chapters also discuss attitudes that foster writing success (e.g.#15 - Build editor relationships; #21 - Always take the attitude of a learner).The chapters are short (about three to five pages) and information-packed. They are interesting, thanks to Whalin's ability to weave personal anecdotes into the instruction:I once received a large manuscript in a note binder...I received an entirely handwritten manuscript (fiction). I found it almost frightening to be holding the single copy of another person's work. [p. 88]He looked at my name tag and, knowing that our house took children's material, he reached into his briefcase, pulled out a bound copy of a manuscript and almost threw it into my hands. \\"You need this manuscript,\\" he said. \\"I read it in the elementary schools and the kids loved it.\\" [p. 110]His information is authoritative because he is no stranger to the writing and publishing world. He has authored over 60 books, written for as many periodicals, and worked as an acquisitions editor in several publishing houses. Though the type of proposal he advocates takes a lot of work, he is persuasive in explaining how each element adds value for the author and editor alike.The book ends with a section of Appendices including samples, a list of other books about proposal writing, a checklist, helpful websites, and more.I read it in a few hours and came away feeling empowered, motivated to give this brand of proposal-writing a try, and asking myself - exactly why have I avoided this for so long?"},{"Title":"Book Proposals That Sell: 21 SECRETS TO SPEED YOUR SUCCESS","review":"What an eye-opener this book is! Terry Whalin has been both a writer and editor for many years, and he shares information about the publishing business that only an insider can know. Number One is that editors prefer a well-written proposal over a completed manuscript. (Surprised? I was!) Brilliant writing alone won't get you a contract. Editors don't have time to read voluminous manuscripts, so they rely on well-crafted proposals. And they receive thousands of proposals each year. You need a proposal that will stand out from all the others, one that says, \\"Read me. Don't put me in the rejection pile.\\" BOOK PROPOSALS THAT SELL gives step-by-step instructions on how to write a proposal and explains the \\"WHY\\" of each individual step.

But what the title, marketing info, and publicity materials don't specify is that the author has a decided bias towards Christian publishing. The info contained in the book certainly applies to a wide variety of books, but the examples that the author includes are taken from the world of right-wing Christianity, including such divisive groups as Focus on the Family and The Promise Keepers. In fact, the sample book proposal in the back of this book comes from the chairman of the Promise Keepers board. I disagree strongly with the agendas of these fringe groups, and resent that I had to buy the book in order to discover the author's bias.Also, for someone who supposedly has spent years in the editing field, Mr. Whalin seems surprisingly unfamiliar with the rules of pronoun reference and agreement. His prose also includes numerous dangling modifiers and faulty comparisons.There are plenty of good books out there on creating book proposals. If you're looking for something with less bias and better grammar, I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Book Proposals That Sell: 21 SECRETS TO SPEED YOUR SUCCESS","review":"This is a collection of short pieces on things that help or hurt your chances for selling a nonfiction book proposal. There are many books on proposals and selling writing, this is one of the more useful ones I have read.The author has published many books, and he is an experienced acquisitions editor. He knows the process, and he is honest and clear about it.Many of the reviews here have criticized the author for imperfections in his writing and grammar. These reviewers are missing the point. This is an author who has published many books. He's quite frank that he doesn't consider himself the finest of writers, and he emphasizes the importance of continuing effort to improve writing skills. So we learn from him that absolute perfection in grammar and brilliant writing style isn't necessary to publish books. Instead, the focus is on writing a decent book on a topic people that people will buy.There have also been a number of remarks about his history in publishing for the Christian market. But this is not a book focused on that market, nor is the author aiming to convert anyone. He simply gives examples from his own experience. The information here is appropriate to any nonfiction topic.The weaknesses of this book are1) There isn't much emphasis on proposal structure - the elements are mentioned, but I would have a hard time getting a concrete idea of how a good proposal should look from this book alone.2) It would help to have more examples, and greater variety.

The book presents a comprehensive guide to writing nonfiction book proposals. If you've completed a novel you want to market, you will also need to write a book proposal; many parts of this book will apply to the fiction writer's book proposal.

A careful reading of this book (and many careful re-readings) will position you to approach the process effectively and proactively.After releasing eight books through four different publishers, we are still \\"beginners\\" in the process.

Terry Whalin speaks with experience from within the trenches. As an author of over 60 books he has been on both sides of the editorial process. The insiders information revealed in this book will help future authors give their craft the respect it needs to be treated as a career not a hobby. By revealing the business perspective from the publishers view, it gives the writer the necessary insight to look at the overall project as a business from the time of creative conception to future marketing. One of the most valuable resources Whalin offers is the depth of explanation in the publishing progression. He details the multitude and time consuming steps involved from first read of a manuscript, through the decision to accept it and the various people up the ladder until the book gets approved into publication. As an author, I found this information of most importance in order to have a clear perception of the timeline necessary and the patience required in order not to make too many calls into the editor's office and make a lasting impression which might not be a positive one. The author of this book is straight forward and honest. He wants potential authors to have the knowledge and the right tools which will give them an edge in a very competitive industry. The bottom line to this book is, the writing business is a business and it should be treated that way.

You think you may even have a book in you. You talk about it with your friends and family, and they tell you it sounds amazing. Now what?Weeks pass. Months go by. Maybe even years. That idea just won't go away! So, finally you sit down at your computer and begin typing it out. You become engrossed in your topic -- swamped in research, personal anecdotes, and fresh twists on age-old issues. You're convinced every publisher will be clamoring for your book.Unfortunately, if you send your masterpiece out without a bodyguard (an agent), it may end up in a tottering pile of manuscripts in the corner of an editor's office. Or worse -- it may not even make it to his desk because a first reader deemed it inappropriate for the publishing house.Never fear. That's where Terry Whalin's book will save you the months and years of heartache as you turn your passion into print. He explains, \\"Many writers focus only on the creative aspects of writing a book and getting it published, but the executives inside a publishing house are business people who want to sell books and turn a profit at the end of the day.

I didn't learn anything from this book that I didn't already know from a few hours of researching on the internet. I bought this after seeing so many positive reviews and was incredibly disappointed. It is heavily biased towards Christian literature and all the examples given are about religious books. The \\"Sample Book Proposal that Sold for a 6 Figure Advance\\" is laughable as something you can use as an example to follow; it is for a book about a new Christian movement called Promise Keepers and it is written by a bishop. The movement is new so there are no competing books and it is by a bishop so of course Christian people are going to buy it! Unfortunately this type of situation isn't going to apply to the other 99.99% of people writing book proposals.

Terry's book not only provides us with valuable detail of how to judge our own manuscripts to ensure they do not land in the rejection pile, his book does something else just as important.Within these pages we vicariously absorb the walls, settings, processes, and committees through a manuscript's entire travel in its search for acceptance of publication. The process is made open and understandable so that as writers, we no longer have to feel that our manuscripts are in some Twilight Zone process of selection. Terry makes us feel like we are traveling with our books throughout the review process.

Terry has some great points to offer through both of these sources, so I took a chance that his book on book proposals would be unique, too.And it is. Unlike so many other books on this subject, Terry comes from both sides of the table. He's a successful author, as well as a former book editor. (He's also now a literary agent.)

Novices can learn a great deal about the business from this book, and I believe writers who've been at it for years will glean new insights, too.Add \\"Book Proposals That Sell\\" to your writer's bookshelf.

I attended a conference for women writers and speakers last August. While there, I purchased this book, even though I already had a proposal completed and ready to present to two editors there at the conference.When my book proposal was rejected, I took out Terry's book, read it, and began to rework my proposal. It took me many hours, but by following Terry's very explicit instructions and example in the appendix, I finally came up with a really good proposal. I just attended the ICRS in Denver, and made my pitch to nine different publishers. Every one of them commented on the thoroughness and excellence of my proposal. Several of the aquisitions editors expressed enthusiasm for my project and indicated definite interest in my book.My chapters hadn't changed all that much from my first proposal attempt. The difference was in the marketing proposal and the focus I now had after working through its rewriting. I know that I could not have come up with such a thorough and professional proposal without the help I received through the content of Book Proposals That Sell.I heartily recommend this book to any author who is trying to get published.

Anders' choices are stunningly good, and his taste in material impeccable. Swanwick, Roberson, and Meaney's contributions may be some of the finest short fiction I've ever read, and the rest of the material held a similar line of quality.Quit reading this and just go buy the book.

I highly recommend this book not only for the content, but also for the reading lists it will help you build."},{"Title":"Live Without a Net","review":"For me the best picks from this volume are those where the authors really get to grips with the idea of a future that has not followed the usual technological route, particularly Di Filippo and Rucker. On the more traditional SFnal front Melko and Del Stone Jr provide more than the bigger names of Brin and Baxter, and Resnick/Kenyon, Hutchinson, Meaney and Stross provide top quality stuff.All in all, an interesting varied collection, and well worth the shelf-space...."},{"Title":"Live Without a Net","review":"This is a spotty collection. The premise -- a world without computers -- is certainly interesting. The antho, sadly, did not live up to its potential.Some of the stories are excellent, thought-provoking, and moving: Alex Irvine's \\"Reformation,\\" Del Stone Jr.'s \\"I Feed the Machine,\\" and John Meaney's \\"The Swastika Bomb.\\" A few were truly dreadful -- loosely related at best and/or more style than substance -- including a couple I couln't even make it through. Most were solid, but still dissapointing, on topic, but not credible as to how or why computers weren't in this world. One, John Grant's \\"No Solace for the Soul in Digitopia,\\" was simply porn with (at its end) a veneer of alternate-universe's clothing.The closest thing to a common thread was biotech of one sort or another replacing some functions of silicon computing, and the inherent differences of the two computing approaches. When done well (about half the time), that made for something to think about."},{"Title":"Live Without a Net","review":"Edited by Lou Anders, the sci-fi anthology Live Without a Net (all never-before-published stories, save one) imagines a variety of sci-fi-tinged worlds, future, past, and, present, in which IT, the Internet, and AI as we conceive of it do not exist. Introducing this limitation is an intriguing concept, and the end result is five or six very good stories, a bit of remarkable crap, and some filler.The best stories are Adam Roberts' \\"New Model Computer,\\" which puts an O. Henry twist on post-Singularity fiction; Michael Swanwick's \\"Smoke and Mirrors,\\" an amusing set of short-shorts featuring the author's retro-Victorian rogues, Darger and Surplus; Charlie Stross' \\"Rogue Farm,\\" David Brin's \\"Reality Check;\\" S. M. Stirling's PKD-style head-scrambler \\"The Crystal Method;\\" John Meaney's \\"The Swastika Bomb,\\" a WWII spy epic in an alternate history of advanced biowarfare; and my pick for the best story of the book, Del Stone Jr's frightening doomsday cult scenario, \\"I Feed The Machine.\\"Unfortunately, most of the rest is unengaging filler or just plain awful. John Grant's \\"No Solace For The Soul In Digitopia\\" consists largely of painfully detailed descriptions of the narrator depositing his seed into his various parallel-Earth wives, and Grant is no better than most sci-fi writers when it comes to sexual matter. The most inexplicable inclusion of the anthology is Alex Irvine's \\"Reformation,\\" which infuses some Islamic mysticism into a straightforward cyberpunk yarn about a hacker/Internet-revolutionary. Irvine's story completely breaks the \\"no Net\\" theme of the book and is terribly out of place. Best left undescribed are \\"Frek and the Grulloo Woods,\\" Paul di Filippo's \\"Clouds and Cold Fires,\\" and Dave Hutchinson's \\"All The News, All Time, From Everywhere.\\"I'd check this book out at a library for the good stories, but hold off on buying it."},{"Title":"Live Without a Net","review":"The premise of this anthology is \\"What would a world without the internet be like?\\" Some are quite entertaining and inventive and others (notably David Brin and John Grant) are just boring. The majority are just readable and not really worth the time to discuss.The Novella by John Meaney is the most complete but that may be because it's the only long story in the book and the length helps alot. Some of the writers seem to think that an abrupt ending (like a song that just stops) is how best to end a short story. IMHO it's not. A couple of the stories are just convoluted musings and go nowhere fast.All in all Harlan Ellison has nothing to fear.Zeb Kantrowitz"},{"Title":"Live Without a Net","review":"Lou Anders edits Live Without A Net, a fine anthology of stories from masters of speculative fiction. 18 short stories diverge from the popular futuristic visions of a cyber-controlled future to consider alternative futures where cyberspace does NOT rule.

Based on this unscientific sample of two (still 67% of the household population), the reaction to the tales will differ depending on the age (and experiences) of the reader. Those ancient baby boomers and fountain of youth older generations know first hand an unwired world of dial phones in which the consumer could choose any color as long as it was black. To that group, the stories will seem like alternate history as it is not much of a stretch to believe that the alternatives might have been viable at one time.

Manji, a crass ronin of eighteenth century Japan, doesn't agree. Cursed to immortal life for prior misdeeds, he must dispatch a thousand evil men to the judgment of the Buddha in order to die himself. Joining a young girl on her quest for vengeance against the rebellious Itto-Ryu sword school, Manji soon has dire need for his twelve blades as he faces a motley assortment of hardened warriors, psychopaths, philosophers and just plain jokers. The thousand-man requirement is met by the painful stroke of give-and-take; and is told in a fashion that puts most modern epics to shame.This, the twelfth compilation released overseas, features the return of Blade's most vicious scoundrel, Shira, a cold-eyed killer capable of unspeakable depravities. At the climax of *Heart of Darkness* (BotI vol. 7), Manji cut off Shira's right arm, putting a kink in the assassin's typical routine of butchery, whoring and all-around reprobate-behavior. Upset but unruffled, Shira has decided that an \`eye for an eye' is an adequate reparation for the loss of his arm; he intends on taking Manji's right appendage in payment and enlists three dim-witted stooges to help him ambush the lazy immortal. But unbeknownst to Shira's death-lust maneuverings, Manji is traveling with Magatsu Taito - a former top-blade warrior of the rogue Itto-ryo sword school - who has a grudge to settle with the serial-killer. . .This \`love/hate-triangle' is perhaps the most desperate fight of the series so far, as Magatsu and Shira cannot resuscitate themselves a la wound-healing bloodworms. With Manji, one always _knows_ he can survive just about any blow short of having his head chopped off; and after the violence-orgy of *The Gathering*, wherein the ronin's immorality was tested to an almost ridiculous limit, Hiroaki Samura decided to shift the conflict-emphasis to the other, \`normal' characters. In *Autumn Frost*, the duel between Magatsu and Shira quickly reaches a dangerous level of piercing-threshold and pain: the tension of the close-quarter combat, coupled with the feverish passions of both hero and antagonist, give the story as a whole a much-needed jolt of unpredictability and potential mortality.I was initially surprised to find that Dark Horse included two issues after *Autumn Frost's* harrowing conclusion, the one-shots \`The Wind and the Heron' and \`Petals on the Wind', which detail the growing relationship of Anotsu and Hisoka Shingyoto. In hindsight, though, I can see why, as this profoundly brief romantic interlude offers a telling contrast to the stonehearted feud of the previous storyarc. . . and when I say brief, I mean brief - events are already transpiring to doom the dreams of these star-crossed lovers.A note on the artwork: Hiroaki Samura's technique can almost be considered the antithesis of mainstream Manga. Instead of the ultra-clean ink-lines and the large eyes/small mouth stereotypes perpetuated in most Japanese comics, Samura favors a sketch-technique to his backgrounds and action sequences, along with [fairly] proportional humanistic characteristics (the ears are a bit large). The detail and craftsmanship are, as always, superb, particularly in the pencil-work and frame-perspective. More importantly, Samura has evolved in his plotting and drafting of combat: no over-reliance of hacked limbs and death-murals here! Instead, the fight-scenes are so visceral and tension-laden that one can almost smell the coppery stench of intermingled blood, dust and sweat; feel the kicks, blows and (multiple) stabbings as our heroes struggle toward their long-awaited culmination. It's a welcome change from *Beasts*' grim assortment of decapitations and limb-loss.Five stars."},{"Title":"Blade of the Immortal, Vol. 12: Autumn Frost","review":"Hiroaki Samura's 'Blade of the Immortal,' set in the late 18th Century, is the story of that adventures of Manji, a swordsman made immortal and Rin, a young woman who seeks revenge against the men of the Itto-ryu, who killed her father, These are led by Anotsu, an unorthodox but deadly fighter himself. At this point in the story Manji and Rin have become separated, as each pursues their own path to Kaga, where Anotsu awaits.Manji has teamed up with another fighter, Magatsu, and the story starts with them swapping adventures on the road. Suddenly an old enemy of both, Shira, appears. Shira is a psychotic with a taste for killing women and the girl Magatsu loved was among his victims. This triggers a free for all battle that occupies the majority of this manga, pitting Manji and Magatsu against Shira and a set of hired killers. As is normal for Samura, the fighting is imaginative and beautifully choreographed, as well as full of Manji's wry sarcasm.We get a short glimpse of Rin before the focus shifts to Anotsu himself, focusing on his decision to accept Hisoka's hand in marriage. This exacerbates the tension over Anotsu's take-over of the sword school where she resides. While this has yet to break out into decisive action, the note of violence hangs over the wedding like a promise, and it is only a matter of time before Anotsu's mettle is tested again.It is interesting that Anotsu, originally introduced as a villain, is gradually being shifted into a more sympathetic role. Samura has spent the time to develop him as a character, and it is impossible not to feel some sympathy for his goals, even if his methods are often cruel. What this will mean in the long run is difficult to foresee, but clearly there are more surprises planned.'Blade of the Immortal' has been a series as exceptional in its way as 'Battle Angel Alita' is in its. In each case, the hero gradually develops from cold fighter to a brilliantly alive human being, dedicated to his companions. Of course, Alita's appeal is more universal, while Manji remains focused on his local problems. Hiroaki Samura uses the vehicle of the story to bring to life the Japan of his times, touching not just on the Samurai class but a wide swath of society. While the extreme violence makes this a story that is not for everyone it is an exemplar of its genre."},{"Title":"Blade of the Immortal, Vol. 12: Autumn Frost","review":"Actually, I am going to rewrite this review a little better seeing as how not many have reviewed it. They take so long to release new novels so this novel will really make you want the next one, but you know it will take another year to release.Magatsu and Shira are ready to go at it. There are quite a few surprises. Namely Shira. Also, Magatsu releases a few surprises as well. The art becomes beautiful.This issue is easily read. Now, BTOI has one problem in the entire series. I don't mind that they flipped the panels, but some panels aren't flipped. Sometimes(rarely) a person will be holding a sword with his left hand, then it will be in his right hand on the next panel. This is often confusing as I sometimes have to read a page a few times to understand. Dark Horse did a great job of translating and flipping it, but if you want to alter a masterpiece you will probably mess up. Past issues have found me lost in some battles as they do occasionaly leave things unflipped which can lead to confusion(namely the battle in \\"On Silent Wings\\" part 2). This issue is wonderfully flipped and I only noticed two mistakes in the issue. One was where Magatsu's sword switched hands, the other was when he, well, I can't tell you. Still, they did a wonderful job of making the battles much easier to read, and very interesting.There are quite a few instances where I was surprised, but none compared to the way Shira is drawn. He is so evil, yet he is done perfectly. A very interesting panel is where he says, \\"Scary, huh. HUH!\\". I cringed when I read that panel and saw how beautifully Shira was drawn. He almost scared me a bit as he is done perfectly. 5 stars for the art.We also get to see some of Rin's travels although they are short. Finally, the issue leaves the reader with 20 or so pages on Anotsu. Interesting in it's own way, but not compared to Magatsu/Shira.This novel was done great. It is a smaller book. It is thick though. That is what counts because the art is simply scaled down a bit. It is basically as thick as HEART OF DARKNESS. You really get a great issue here."},{"Title":"Blade of the Immortal, Vol. 12: Autumn Frost","review":"The editorial review is incorrect in stating that BotI: Autumn Frost collects issues #73-#78, it actually collects issues #73-#80.

If it were not considered by some to be a \\"classic\\" I would never have finished it. After awhile, curiosity pulled me forward through the story, wanting to learn just what were the redeeming literary qualities that have kept this novel alive in the public memory the more than forty years since it was published. Alas, I did not find them. Somewhere past the mid-point, Armah manages to write perceptively and convincingly of the mentality and mechanisms of corruption that afflict so many African nations, and of the envy of those who observe the rich and powerful. The integrity of the principal character, \\"the man,\\" is also clear. Unfortunately the occasional meritorious writing is encased in an envelope of repulsive filth and excessive concentration on bodily fluids and excrement. If this is somehow meant, by reflection, to illuminate the purity and cleanliness of the integrity of the hero, I can only say that Armah exacts a high price from the reader if he expects him to push onward through the muck. I finished this because I'm going to Ghana in a few months and thought I should be familiar with some of Ghana's best-known writers. I'll hope to find some others.

It is the story of a poor man in a material world who, despite the pressures around and within him, is able to maintain a sense of dignity within himself. The author manages to create vivd scenes of filth and vileness throughout the novel but the plot leaves something to be desired. Characters are vague and action begins very late in the text.

I read it for a Western African history class, and although I think it helps to have a rudimentary understanding of Ghana's post-independence history, this novel definitely stands on its own literary merit. &quot;The Man&quot; (as he is referred to) is an honest and introspective individual torn apart by the corruption and greed of his society. This creates conflict between not only him and the majority of the world around him, but also between him and his family. This book speaks volumes of the nature of a society that has been decimated by the repressive rule of an entirely different culture. Ayi Kwei Armah weaves beautiful poetry, intellectual insight, and explicit (and at times repulsive- but that is the desired effect) imagery into his story. The reader can truly feel the struggle and search for balance of the man. Humorous at times, depressing at others, &quot;The Beautyful Ones&quot; is a moving masterpiece. &quot;As he went down a shadow rose up the bottom wall to meet him, and it was his own.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born","review":"Set during the last days of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana's first president and noted exponent of Pan-Africanism, this book chronicles the fortunes and misfortunes of &quot;the man,&quot; the nameless focalizer of Armah's finely crafted novel, who struggles to retain some semblance of integrity, barely surviving in a country where corruption is &quot;the national game.&quot; Intense, introspective, darkly melancholic but never misanthropic, Armah's novel celebrates a strong sense of hope in the midst of savage adversity, the small but not insignifcant victories that enable &quot;the man&quot; to live from day to day -- such existentia Africana is a philosophy forged on the anvil of hard toil and experience."},{"Title":"The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born","review":"Published in 1968, this was Armah's first novel. It depicted corruption and societal breakdown in a newly independent African nation, seen through the eyes of a citizen disillusioned by the materialism and decay he encountered, who found himself struggling to maintain his integrity.The book was based on the experience of Ghanaians in the late 1950s and 1960s under the administration of Kwame Nkrumah. The nation's first leader after independence, he mismanaged the economy and was overthrown two years before the novel's publication. The work's considered to be among the key novels that began to reflect criticism of newly established native African governments following the exhilaration of freedom from colonial rule.Regrettably, I found the first two-thirds of the book to be plodding and often obscure, and the action uninteresting. It took 60 pages, one-third of the novel, to get the main character from a bus to an office to his home, through conversations with a bus driver, a relative, his wife and a teacher. Initially, there was little description of the characters' thoughts other than through dialogue. New characters were introduced abruptly, with little clue as to who they were; for example, the woman named Manaan in Chapter 6. Sixty pages into the book, a nameless, first-person narrator began speaking for half a chapter before dropping out.Too many of these passages went something like this:\\"Question bounces off unheeded as the naked man gets up off the bed, takes a pencil from the top of the bookcase near the bed and sticks it in to mark the page. He puts the book on the case and sits back down on the bed, pushing his back against the head and drawing up his knees.\\"And 40 pages later, this:\\"The naked man stood up on the bed and tried to reach over to the door and take down a pair of trousers hanging on a nail behind it, but at his touch the door swung left and away from him, and he had to jump down and go round to get the trousers. He slipped them on over his naked body and took down a T-shirt from another nail.\\"Many of these passages called to mind the style of the French New Novelists: painstaking description of moment-by-moment action to create a certain atmosphere, combined with a deemphasis of character, background and plot. Maybe this style was considered suitable for conveying the atmosphere of powerlessness. Disliking the style, I found it tedious and hard to appreciate.Closer toward the book's end, more of the main character's thoughts began to be gradually introduced. The last third of the novel, describing an important dinner at the main character's home with a corrupt representative of the regime and the fateful aftermath, was written in a more realistic way and told a more dramatic story, where plot and character came more sharply into focus. The ending seemed appropriate and was far from optimistic.For me, the novel was most memorable for its descriptions of the indignities of the new country: enslaving admiration for those with material wealth, no matter how it was gained; the humiliation and envy of those who lacked it; a dead-end job and the virtual absence of hope or an opportunity to better oneself; corruption and the pressure to join in and trade integrity for scraps, for the sake of one's children. And the ultimate futility of it all, what the author called the \\"horrible cycle of the powerless.\\"The novel was also memorable for its variety of pungent images of filth, which served to communicate both the urban atmosphere and moral decay:\\"Sounds arise and kill all smells as the bus pulls into the dormitory town. Past the big public lavatory the stench claws inward to the throat. Sometimes it is understandable that people spit so much, when all around decaying things push inward and mix all the body's juices with the taste of rot . . . . Hot smell of caked s--- split by afternoon's baking sun, now touched by still evaporating dew. The nostrils, incredibly, are joined in a way that is most horrifying direct to the throat itself and to the entrails right through to their end.\\"Although I found much of the book's style uninteresting until the last third, by the end the writer had managed to convey a strong sense of what life was like, physically and psychologically, under a corrupt regime."},{"Title":"The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born","review":"Armah's book is among the best. Dense and ponderous yet eloquent use of symbolism is what made this book most enjoyable for me. A great introduction to Ghanaian literature, it captures many aspects of life there, past and present, with wonderful adeptness. Utilizing beautiful imagery, the style is very fluid, while leaving diverse impressions. Though the overall tone is something of a justified bitter, this book leaves the sweet aftertaste only fulfilling reading can and a yearning for more of Armah's masterful writing."},{"Title":"The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born","review":"Armah chooses the post independent Ghana as the setting of his novel.It is clear that the author strictly abides by the norms of afro-pessimism.The novel is not one to be recommended to a prospective tourist to Ghana unless one is looking for 'juicy vaginas' or women who change men like pants. The novel is written by a disillusioned writer and onlooker, someone who had been lured by the ideals sold through the promises of better days with the help of socialism.Armah is horrified by the gravity of prevailing decay in his country. He is like a modern Hamlet who is helplessly exclaiming at the extent of the rot-his Ghana is rotten.Political degradation is the tip of the iceberg as social degradation,moral illusion and identity crisis have led the nation to a sort of modern Hades, the population is silently living in Plato's cave-a cave which represents ignorance.This cave reminds me of the teacher's room.He is the enlightened to whom nobody pays heed except the man.The man who appears weak to fight the gnawing corruption can hardly react when the bus conductor spits at him or when his bossy mother in law rebukes him for refusing to 'make the leap', 'to play the national game of Ghana' and to accept the 'gleam'.Along with Koomson he passes through the latrine but cleanses himself in the sea water.Who is tha man who wants to teach us how to live in a corrupt world?Is he the beautiful one?"},{"Title":"The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born","review":"Not any one of Soyinka's or Achebe's books can hold a candle to this particular work by Ayi Kwei Armah. I studied this book for a critical appreciation of Literature course at University in the '80s and until this moment the grating images of corruption and a derelict society that breeds corruption upon itself still erupts vividly in my head. Ayi Kwei Armah succinctly and subtly depicts corruption through his writing with bold imagery and flawless writing.You would pick this book up to read three decades after it was written, and it would still seem like a novel that just came out; it still rings true to this day in many corrupt societies and it is a book that should be up there with the greatest literary giants of our time.T.J.

I didn't quite understand it, all the same it left an impression, and early this year i sought it out. It is an amazing book. Two weeks of careful reading, my copy is left heavily lined and dog-eared.I strongly recommend it to all budding social revolutionaries.It is one lone man's struggle against seemingly inescapable corruption and filth. A \\"settled mind\\"/resolved principles triumphs in the face of hunger, severe poverty, a nagging wife and his own conscience.His stance is eventually justified when the corrupt government along with his much envied politician friend falls.There is a lot of filth- environment, human nature, even language. Nothing is spared. Its easy to get caught up in its general ugliness. This is ironically the beauty of the book and does not rob it of its essence. For those who have not been exposed to widespread corruption, rotteness or had to struggle with \\"doing the right thing\\" and against all the odds, it may seem a \\"sick book\\"."},{"Title":"The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born","review":"I did not know what to expect from this one. As it turns out, it's quite a good literary book, although its tone is poorly represented by its cover; picture instead a dark road strewn with litter, under a cloudy sky, lined by buildings in various stages of collapse, and you'll have a better idea of what to expect.This book is set in Ghana in the 1960s, and is about corruption. It follows the unnamed third-person narrator, a railroad clerk, who is one of the few who refuses to take bribes--which only angers everyone, from the people who see bribing officials as a normal part of doing business, to his family, who are upset that he isn't taking every opportunity to provide them with a better life. From that description you might think the book features some kind of crusader, but \\"the man\\" (as he's referred to throughout) doesn't quite seem to know why he does what he does. No lectures about ideals from him.At any rate, the book mostly follows the man through his daily life, and is heavy on the description; the writing is quite visual, but often repulsive. (I've never seen a book spend so much time in latrines or talking about excrement.) Physical decay serves as a metaphor for moral corruption throughout, to a point that might seem heavy-handed to some readers, but effectively creates a dark and oppressive atmosphere. Meanwhile, this is the sort of book that develops characters through minute details of their daily lives, so while we learn relatively little about them, they feel entirely real.I have not talked about plot, because this book is far to the literary end of the spectrum, with a heavy focus on themes and ideas. Fortunately, the writing is good enough to pull it off. I'm not surprised that many reviewers have encountered this one in university classes; what does surprise me is that it isn't taught more often."},{"Title":"The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born","review":"This book was thoroughly engaging and the scenes described were as clear as I were looking at them with my own eyes.

Curious about this series of blank books, I located one in a Border's store so I could examine it closely, and was sold (though I actually bought several of various styles through Amazon due to the greatly reduced price and wide selection).Just wanted to reassure any curious journal-keepers that this is a very nice book for having paper binding. The surfaces of the front and back plates are silky smooth, taut and very pretty. The spine, being sewn with strings, is tight, yet allows the book to lay completely flat when open. The pages inside are very smooth, practically non-porous grain, and of a medium weight, thick enough for fine-tip pen-and-ink, but too thin for any other medium of drawing or writing element. I'm usually a fan of leather-bound journals because they're sturdier and more aesthetically pleasing to me, but as paper-bound journals go, these are among the nicest I've seen."},{"Title":"Beethoven and his nine symphonies","review":"Sir George Grove (1820 -1900)is best-known as the writer of the original \\"Dictionary of Music and Musicians\\" which, with its many updates and versions over the years, has become the standard English reference work on classical music. In 1896, Grove wrote \\"Beethoven and his Nine Symphonies\\" which, unlike the \\"Dictionary\\" is still read today in the form in which Grove wrote it. I have recently returned to Grove's study as a guide in listening to and reviewing the Beethoven symphonies in the recordings by David Zinman and the Tonhalle Orchester Zurich and have learned a great deal.Grove's book is written in an accessible late-Victorian style. He devotes a chapter to each of the nine symphonies. He begins with a summary of the instrumentation, publication history and early metronome marks of the symphonies. Grove offers material on Beethoven's life at the time each symphony was composed and describes Beethoven's compositional process. He offers information on early performances and on the reception of each work, including a great deal of commentary from the works of later composers.But the highlight of the study is Grove's movement-by-movement analysis of each symphony. It is a difficult skill to write about music in a way that amateurs may follow; and Grove succeeds admirably. He gives the score for the principal themes and highlights of each movement and discusses them in a way that anyone with a basic skill in reading music can follow easily. I used Grove many years ago when I was just coming to the Beethoven symphonies, and I continue to learn from his book. Much of what Grove says is still current in studies of the symphonies. For example, in discussing the Seventh Symphony, Grove aptly describes it as the most romantic of the nine, and he points out how the rhythm of the symphony may be scanned in terms of the meters and \\"feet\\" of poetry. Maynard Solomon has made the same points in detail in his essay on the Seventh Symphony in his recent book \\"Late Beethoven\\".In addition to the musical analyses, Grove writes with great passion about Beethoven and his work. His study is replete with allusions to the works and writings of other composers that illuminate his analysis of Beethoven. He also gives a great deal of biography, some of which must be used with caution as Grove relied on the biographical writings of Anton Schindler about Beethoven. Schindler has been discredited as as source by modern scholars. Grove has a partiality for large-scale romantic performances of Beethoven, and I don't think he would have been overly impressed with the modern Zinman performances that I just heard and greatly enjoyed. For example, his book is full of strictures against performing Beethoven too fast.Grove clearly shares the prevailing Nineteenth Century view that Beethoven was the greatest of all composers in the depth, variety, structure, and moods of his symphonies. Grove's enthusiasm and love for his subject is eloquent. He concludes his book as follows:\\"These great works he did as no one ever did, and probably no one ever will.... Music will advance in richness, scope, and difficulty; but such music as Beethoven's great instrumental works, in which thought, emotion, melody, and romance combine with extraordinary judgment and common sense, and a truly wonderful industry, to make a perfect whole, can hardly any more be written. The time for such an event, such a concurrence of the man and the circumstances, will not again arrive. There can never be a second Beethoven or a second Shakespeare. However much orchestras may improve and execution increase, Beethoven's Symphonies will always remain at the head of music as Shakespeare's plays are at the head of the literature of the modern world.\\"Some readers in the early 21st Century may question Grove's adulation of Beethoven. Be that as it may, Beethoven's symphonies have remained an inspiration to an untold number of listeners, including myself, and will almost certainly remain so. Grove's book remains highly valuable for those wanting to explore in detail the richness of the Beethoven symphonies.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Russia: A Portrait","review":"This book contains seventy-two black and white images of the former Soviet Union taken by Soviet photo jornalist, Lev Poliakov. Most of the photos were take in the 1960's although there are a few from the early 1970's. Most of them are both landscapes and portraits and generally show ordinary people doing ordinary things. My favorite photo of the book shows more than just ordinary activity. It is a 1970 photograph of a bearded man in swim trunks and a towel standing on the the frozen Neva River. The ice has been cut away, and the man is apparently drying himself off after dip in the frigid river. Watching him are three young children bundled up in scarves, hats, and heavy winter clothes. In the backgound of the image can be seen Leningrad's (now St Petersburg's) Winter Palace, Admiralty, and St. Isaac's Cathedral. Since I have two adopted children from Russia, I appreciate the honesty of Poliakov's images. So many books on Russia over emphasize the beautiful palaces, museums, and churches. Poliakov has found beauty in the ordinary and is able to present a more honest image of what was Russia.

The first half could be entitled \\"The Survivalist Guide After the Complete Destruction of the World as We Know It\\" and I shall be certain to take this book with me for reference in the (un)liklihood I ever find myself in a bomb shelter or lost in the woods.The story finally takes a turn halfway through when we are introduced to the inhabitants of this future Earth. The \\"color war\\" has taken a turn and now dark skinned folk are the masters and the light skinned people are the slaves. This new world is explained in detail as well as how the caste system works.Our main characters adapt as best as they can according to their individual personalities. I do not entirely agree that there is nothing to like about Farnham's clan. It is a cross section of the kind of personalities that make up the world: leaders, fighters, followers, cowards, dependants, etc. The strong survive and the weak get sucked into and accept their lot (even learn to like it).The time travel twist is one of the only features that make this title \\"sci-fi\\". Other than that, it can be looked upon as any other interesting work of fiction.If you can muddle through the first half of the book, dense with dialogue and technicalities that will make your head spin, you're in for a good read. This book will make you think and consider how different a world can be if roles were reversed and democracy was no more."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Clearly one of the most controversial novels by Robert A. Heinlein (author of Starship Troopers, Space Cadet, Stranger In A Strange Land, The Puppet Masters, etc.), pushing the envelope of political correctness a quarter of a century before that phrase was coined.A typical American family is plunged into the future in a nuclear attack - bomb shelter and all. Survivalism is just the beginning of this engrossing novel; the strange society they discover in the future challenges the reader's sense of decency and tolerance.A short version of this novel, as cut and revised by Frederik Pohl, appeared in Worlds of If Magazine, 1964. It's easy to see why Pohl censored it; this is the full text. But to call Heinlein racist absurdly ignores his whole body of work - some 30 other novels. This novel explores ideas - including cannibalism; but no one has called the author a cannibal."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I think this is a book that people should read. It might get them thinking about how their worlds can be turned upside down."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I understand the era in which this book was written, so I am not going to blather on about racism or sexism or whatnot. I understand that satire was involved here. I enjoyed the story overall, particularly the survivalist aspects of it and also the last third of the story. It was an interesting look on the human condition and the history of civilization. My only complaint was the dialogue in the first part of the book. Just awful. I was also a little incredulous about how quickly 20-something woman falls into the arms of 60-something man, as well as daughter offering herself up to Daddy. Other than that, a good story with an interesting sci-fi aspect to it. I think it's a good read for those that are fans of the genre."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Great story and premise. Time travel is always a difficult plot to write, but Robert Heinlein does it the best."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I heard about this book from survivalists. I was already familiar with Heinlein's more well known science fiction and had a certain appreciation for some of his retrograde ideas. I was intrigued to know that he had written a &#34;post apocalyptic&#34; work and had kept my eye open for a copy. Eventually I obtained this one from Amazon's used book service, which has really become a favorite of mine.This book suggests a nuclear exchange throwing the bomb-shelter survivors forward a few centuries in time but not place. The book is loaded up with the kinds of details survivalists love about engineering jerry-rigging and how-tos, and defensive preparations and so forth. Its also got the usual Heinlein sex and discipline and authoritarian stuff. It has certain unexpected twists however which make it a more interesting read than many of the other survivalist stuff I have read.I wouldn't rate it at the level of literature but it beats the hell out of most post-apocalyptics for enjoyment in reading. I recommend it to the &#34;preppers&#34; of today wholeheartedly and to Heinlein fans as well."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Another of Heinlein's classics, this one contains elements of both his time travel and alternate universe theories.A tale-twister until the last page.

That is why he has to be hard. He alone is responsible for the fate of humankind (or so he thinks). Where did being nice get him? Nowheresville. His wife Grace is pathetic, and his son Duke is an arrogant, spolied child who needs to grow up in a hurry. No - man up. Which he is incapable of doing, and so he must face the consequences.+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-SPOILER ALERT-+-+-+-+-+-+SPOILER ALERT-+-+-+-+-+-+SPOILER ALERT-+-+-+-+-+|||||||Keep in mind, this family is plunged into a dangerous, crazy world where they hold no cards at all. \\"Abandoned his family\\"? Duke clearly wanted nothing to do with his father - and Grace, his wife, found her own Nirvana - laying around all day with blinders on, drunk to her little heart's content eating all she wanted, growing as enormous as she wanted to and letting someone else worry about it all. Why shouldn't Hugh have a chance at life? Barbara was his fresh start - He lost his only link to the past when he lost Karen. Now he has two of his own young ones to protect and let's be honest, I'd rather shield two innocents from those fiends than try to protect an adult who won't even attempt to save himself. You can't look at this book through modern eyes - You have to look at it 1) from the era in which it was written and 2) from the protagonist's perspective. Yes, what Karen offered to him was wild and immoral and disgusting in the framework of a structured, thriving and decent society, but this was a world turned on its ear and morality shifts. Don't mistake Hugh's agression for arrogance - He had none of that. Duke was the arrogant one, and a weak little snit to boot. Hugh Farnham is a \\"get 'er done\\" type of guy, a free thinker and strong, capable man, and I would want him by my side if this world collapsed. Farnham's Freehold is an incredible book, a thought-provoking book, a wonderful book. One of my favorites by one of my favorite authors, the Grandmaster of science fiction, Robert A. Heinlein. Long may he reign."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Heinlein should have the scientific good sense to distinguish true Darwinism (i. e. the thery of evolution as understood by legitimate science) from the Wagnerian qausi-fascist pop myths about nature being a big Conan slug-fest in which the most brutal destuctive organism wins. It is his perogative to consider right-wing anarchists as &quot;superior&quot; in some sense but it has nothing to do with Darwin's observations about sucessful breeding. The novel is clever, like all of his work, but it is hard for me to appreciate a novelist who has turned himself into such an apologist for violence. For him violence is the nature of life. Peace lovers are fools. And yet it is the industries of peace that provide food and shelter and comfort. Neutral nations that use force only to defend their borders are more secure than vast empires. War only destroys life and makes it less likely that our children and grandchildren will survive."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I'm a big fan of Heinlein in general -- both pre- and post- &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;. I've read nearly all of his novels, and enjoyed them all -- except for this one. I had a problem with how unlikeable the &quot;hero&quot; was and how unrealistic his interactions with the other characters were. Usually I like character motivation and behavior to flow with the plot more realistically, even in fantastic situations like science fiction novels. That didn't really happen for me with this book, though. The &quot;hero&quot; seemed to be there more as a mouthpiece for a political philosophy, and that kind of soapboxing by an author often overshadows the story itself. It certainly did in this case for me. I wouldn't recommend this as your first Heinlein novel."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"If you are only going to read one Robert Heinlein book read this one. If you're only going to read one sci-fi book, read this one.This book has a very moving story and characters so interesting and human it made me cry.The story focuses on Farnham's family. Living on a farm, they survive the 1960s nuclear holocaust trapped in a bomb shelter, only to awaken in an earth reborn anew, then to be abducted and taken to a planet of the apes like civilization. The saga of the family's survival through one disaster after another provides a very moving drama of family and curage.I cannot recomend this book enough.Heinlein's writing really flows beatifully. It's easy to see why he's so popular. It's easy reading with hard emotions."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"This is not one of Heinlein's best works, but it does touch on some interesting viewpoints regarding racism, prejudice, and slavery. In part, many of the attitudes are now rather outdated, which is not to say that these issues don't still exist, but that they are more subtle and invasive in nature.The characters are painfully shallow, but then I've met some painfully shallow people in my lifetime. Also, this is not a work about human nature so much as about exploring one specific set of human dynamics.The story starts off with a cold-war-era family, bigoted and fairly ignorant of it, complete with black family servant. They are thrust into the future unexpectedly, only at first they believe themselves to be the only survivors of a disaster.During this part of the book, Heinlein explores how some people will attempt to hang onto class distinctions past the point where it makes any sense. (We may be the last persons alive, but I still won't marry someone beneath me...) The struggle exists between what is practical and what was considered socially acceptable in the past, and how the two ideas don't always coincide.Then the characters meet 'civilization' as it appears in this books, as blatant slavery, racism, and sexism. Whites have become no more than 'animals' and blacks now rule over them. Thrown into such a rigid caste system, some of the characters easily fall into the beliefs patterned by this new society. The once mild-mannered black servant slowly becomes a bigoted master who justifies his revenge on the white mistress that used to constantly torment him. The former white mistress (who, thoughout the book, is entirely racist and self-centered) falls into the slave-viewpoint of 'freedom is not as important as living a life of ease'.Heinlein then tacks on a watery ending just to keep the reader happy. Worth reading, provided you can keep an emotional distance from the controversial subjects and study some of the lifelike interactions between the characters. That shouldn't be too hard, since the characters aren't very lively thoughout the entire book."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I love this book. It starts with a man who is hen-pecked by his wife and tortured by his son. It ends with that same man being the consumate freedom fighter and survivalist.Farnham goes through several changes that we openly see: party host to bomb shelter manager to prisoner to rebel to freeman. Then there are the other changes we read about but don't realize until they are thought about later: father, widower, master, slave, lover, and even everyman.As with all of Heinlein's books, the story is good. It has enough action to keep one riveted and holds enough future events to kee sci-fi junkies happy. But, it's the way he pulls the reader into the story that makes it more than just a tale. It becomes easy for the average reader to compare himself with Farnham. This is not a superhero but a man who is willing to make choices when they are required. Farnham makes us think about they way we treat others and helps us hope we treat them better in the future."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"This is a fine novel! I'm not sure what these pople are upset about. It seems as though it is the society which he fabricated which seems to turn everyone off... the canibalism etc. I'm not exactly a litterary scholar but I Know when I find somthing that I like. a great book, definitely not one of Heinlein's worst!"},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"This represents a sort of transitional novel for Heinlein - between his early excellent career writing good juvenile science fiction and superior adult science fiction such as &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; to his later career writing unreadable tripe. The rot started with the vastly overrated &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; and continued with this odd and distasteful novel. It maintains enough of the good Heinlein to earn a three star rating - an interesting well realized plot which moves along at a lightning pace. But all of the &quot;good&quot; characters especially Hugh Farnham seem to be all the same person, obviously Heinlein himself, and the bad characters are all straw figures. The Heinlein characters do some obviously silly things which have no basis in reality. If you turn over the rocks of anyone's personality and peer into their psyche and you're going to see some pretty distasteful stuff, but you don't necessarily want to read it.Heinlein regrouped to write the stunning classic &quot;The Moon is A Harsh Mistress&quot; a few years later, but that was the end of the end. This slightly earlier novel is the middle of the end."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"This book was by far the best book i have ever read.

That's pretty much what you get on the cover. The problem is what happens after the bombs start falling.The main character is a 60 year old married father of two, how has an affair with his daughter's friend, portrayed as a 25 year old bimbo, with no personality other than that she gushing over a man more than twice here age. Then even though he's still legally married to his wife, he declares this 25 yr old his wife even though they've known each other for 6 months.So it was hard for me to get into this book, when I didn't care what happened the main characters. The other characters are portrayed as equally detestful.Instead of critically examining what would happen in a post holocaust world, we are transported to a fantasy land, when a bunch of unrealistic stuff that is gross and where cannibalism and slavery are the norm.The only reason that I gave this book two stars instead of one is that it is full of surprises, and the reader is always kept guessing what will happen next."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"This is the only RAH that I actively disliked. Some of his later novels were too weird for me, but reading them was still better than not. As such, I *can't* say I've read it recently. The protagonist bullies his family and associates so much that it brutalizes the reader. (Since his bomb shelter is the only place where they can survive, they don't have a real choice.) The group members that agree with him succeed in the end, the rest see fates worse than death. Fate#1: His weepy, son-smothering wife (OK, I didn't like her much either) ends up in a harem some where. I'm sure she's happier there. Fate#2: His non-heroic son (OK, sort of a wimp) ends up in the same place. No, not an _active_ member, but &quot;physically adjusted&quot; so he can stay there, serve the residents, and see that his mother is treated well. He'll probably be treated better than his father ever treated him. Gayness wasn't mentioned, but this is where *I* see Heinlein's homophobia at its worst. I believe FF was written during the cold war's air raid shelter craze. You can tell that Heinlein is for it, and is quite content for the unprepared to get fried, unless they have rich friends. (OK, given the situation, you *can't* fit any more people into the limited number of shelters, but it's still ugly.)"},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Hugh Farnham has built a bomb shelter, and stocked it with the kind of things he thinks his family will need after the reds drop the big one. He takes a lot of criticism for this from his highly educated lawyer son, who even blames Hugh for the fact that his mother is an alcoholic. But when the bomb hits, everyone becomes a believer and quiet Hugh becomes the leader. Some odd twist carries his bomb shelter into another world, or another time, with no human life it seems.I love the early science fiction novels by Heinlein, I have read some 4 or 5 times over my lifetime. This book was written in the later Heinlein period, and his writing began to get weird for me. Some people probably love it and prefer the later stuff, just my own tastes. I liked the beginning and end of this book, but a huge chunk of the middle turned me off. The book has some weird sexual relationship issues, tons of racial tension, family disputes, alcohol dependency and other issues that took away some of the excitement and danger of a survivalist story. The post-apocalypse world he envisions has a race with technology far beyond ours, yet most of their society is uneducated and not devoted to progress. So you wonder where they got this technology. The characters in the story have little depth and realism, outside of Hugh and his former employee Joe. Or else their personality changes so fast you can't keep up with it. I reread it this year, after having read it last about 20 years ago and still feel the same. i have to say that near the end of the book, it kind of goes back on track and after several chapters of painful reading, the book blossoms again and makes you wish he had spent more time in that part of the story. In fact, the last chapter would be the a great introduction to a sequel. having said all of this, Heinleins's worst books are better than most of his contemporaries books, so don't get me wrong.

The main theme is a nuclear holocaust that sends a small group of people thousands of years into the future where they are forced to struggle for survival in a wilderness. In the course of this theme there are the secondary themes that a nuclear war is good for humanity because it will kill off most of the dullards that don't prepare, incest and humans being bred as cattle, including being butchered and eaten as quality food.Hugh Farnham was a very practical man that paid close attention to the political tensions of the Cold War. In preparation, he built a secure shelter and stocked it with the necessities for survival. One night when his two children, another woman and his black houseboy are there with him and his wife, the alert is sounded of an immediate nuclear attack. They enter the shelter and feel the concussion of the nuclear weapons striking a key facility nearby. However, the last strike feels completely different from the first. After a time they dig themselves out of the shelter to discover they have been transported forward in time and the area is now uninhabited wilderness.This begins their efforts at survival and trying to rebuild a civilization with only six people. Things go well at first, although Hugh has forgotten some things he has stocked enough key items to give them a reasonable chance. Furthermore, Hugh's daughter is pregnant with the child of another man, which will expand their gene pool considerably. After a time, they are discovered by the ruling society of Earth, which had its' origins in the generally undamaged southern hemisphere. It is an unusual society of gilded slavery with a ritualized caste structure. Hugh is not a man meant to be a slave, so while he does very well in his new surroundings, he yearns to chew his way out of his comfortable cage.If you are familiar with Heinlein's other work, you could open this book to almost any position, read a few pages and recognize that it is by Heinlein. His dialog is very distinctive and the positions taken by Hugh are politically clear. There are times when the book meanders and the arguments that occur between Hugh and his son Duke often stretch the limits of believability. It seems clear that Heinlein included this antagonism so that he could express his opinions about the Cold War through them. It is a good book but I found myself reading it in stages, approximately 20-30 pages each sitting."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"War is inevitable so a family and friend move into a fallout shelter for the duration. Due to some quirk they come out in another time after the war has finished off civilization, as we knew it. Now prepare for a different civilization.This book is a classic example of Late Heinlein works as opposed to his early works i.e. \\"Past Through Tomorrow Future History Stories.\\" However as in any discipline the early product is usually more structured and well inside the curve of accepted norms. You can only carry that so far. Then any artist that is to stand out must experiment and take chances beyond the norm. That is what made \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" (be sure to read the full length version) so great. What do you do after that? Die? No you ether stagnate or further define your point. I can not tell you which this book does.

But when the Reds drop the big one right in Uncle Sam's backyard, Hugh and his clan, his house boy and daughter's friend Barbara, gets more than some radioactive fallout. They are transported into a future dimension where the Africans rule and all others are slaves.Flat pros, one-dimensional characters and stiff dialogue keeps this flight of fantasy earthbound. Some might be shocked by its treatment of sexuality in a post apocalyptic world, others by its depiction of racial stereotyping."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I picked this book up in the store because it looked interesting... then didn't put it down again until I'd read the whole thing three times. Heinlein became one of my favorite science fiction authors as a result. A futuristic &quot;What is the world coming to?&quot; type novel that can be likened to &quot;1984&quot;, &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; or &quot;Brave New World&quot;, Heinlein puts his own spin on things, and it's decidedly more human than some of the afore-mentioned books (although I love them all dearly). Intelligent and sometimes downright astounding, the character relationships are much more clearly drawn and developed than in your standard run-of-the-mill pulp sci-fi that gets pumped out by the publishing machine. If you read one Heinlein, this should be it, although I am not knocking &quot;Stranger In A Strange Land&quot;. While I have not found any of RAH's other works to live up to the standard he set for me with this one, I would still highly recommend trying any of his works."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Reading other reviews of FF surprised me by showing RAH &quot;fans&quot; that didn't understand the concept of &quot;lifeboat rules&quot;. In a lifeboat, there has to be one captain who imposes STRICT discipline for the group to maximize its chances for survival. There isn't time for democracy. AFTER the action slowed down, Hugh's &quot;bullying&quot; stopped. Hmmm. . . RAH looks at the REAL bottom line - survival. ALL political and economic ideologies, rights, etc. MUST take a back seat during times when the fertilizer hits the fan. I do not recall RAH saying Hugh bedding Barbara was for the good of the world. He DID say that, given the number of people involved, one more set of genetic material increased the group's chances of survival. IT DID! Even a cursory study of genetics will demonstrate this to be factual."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"As this story opens a family is around the dinner table, father Hugh, mother, Grace, grown son Duke, college student daughter, Karen and her friend Barbara while houseboy Joseph works in the kitchen. Soon tensions within the group appear, Grace has a drinking problem, and father and son are at odds. Before the evening is over these problems are overshadowed by a nuclear attack. Hugh has prepared for this and established a bomb shelter where they weather the attack but when they come out they discover not the devastation they expected but a pristine forest. They cope with surviving in this new environment and just as they seem to adapt they are discovered by the owners of the property.It seems that the blast has sent them to the future, a future where whites are enslaved by blacks. Quickly Hugh grasps that no matter how he attempts to adapt his and his family's future here is bleak. He resolves to escape and discovers that time travel is not necessarily a oneway trip.This book was written in 1964 and is very much of this time. For anyone who does not remember this period it was filled with tension, threats of nuclear and/or conventional war were and had been almost constant throughout the decade. The premise of nuclear attack, and how a family could survive both the attack and the aftermath were very much considered and debated at the time. In addition to these problems the '60's also had other concerns - racial tensions were high, women were beginning to challenge both their traditional roles and marriage, and the youth vs. age conflict that would appear as the hippie movement of the late '60's was beginning. FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD addresses all of these issues and gives the reader plenty to think about - how far would you go to survive for example. Heinlein, as always, manages to provoke thought. He also has an uncanny talent for predicting future developments, the story is set in Mountain Springs which bears a strong resemblence to Colorado Springs. In the book Mountain Springs was a target due to it's nearby missle base, Colorado Springs became NORAD HQ long after this book was written.So what makes this my least favorite? It has all of Heinlein's weaknesses and none of his strenghts. The characters lack the sympathetic traits that Heinlein's characters usually have. Hugh Farnham is in many ways an earlier version of Lazarus Long but lacks his mischievous and endearing traits. Instead of Lazarus' reflection of humanity, 'warts and all', Hugh comes across as overbearing and obnoxious. The other characters never emerge as more than cardboard included in the book only to serve Hugh.While many of Heinlein's works leap into the fantastic it is usually so well done that the reader is happy to go along for the ride. In FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD the reader is drug along hoping that things will improve down the road. For example, the reader is supposed to believe that Barbara is a respectable, intelligent, sensitive young woman but that hours after meeting her friend's father is madly in love with him and beginning an affair with him with his entire family sleeping just a few feet away.If you are new to Heinlein's work begin just about anywhere but here. If you are a fan FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD is interesting for the hints of things to come, as mentioned Hugh is alot like Lazarus, the idea of traveling in time and/or to alternate universes returns in THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST, TIME ENOUGH FOR LOVE and many other works, as the themes of group/open marriage, incest and cannibalism. Happily Heinlein handles these and other controversial subjects much better elsewhere."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I have to agree with many of he previous reviews that the characteres were highly one dimensional and not very likable. Also, the two halves of the book are two wholly distinct and separate story lines. It does not make for a well-designed plot. Ironically, although I would call this poor writing, it does come at a critical point and saves the book. I was just beginning to loose interest in the story when it became a completely different one.What distrubs me most about this book, however, is the reactions of the readers. It appears, to my horror, that there are many people who disliked the book because they saw it as racist, and worse!!!!! many who LIKED it BECAUSE they thought it was racist!We have a bit of confusion here. This is not a racist story, but certainly one which explores the subject. Writing a book ABOUT something does not make the author automatically FOR it. It is possible to study WWII and not be a Nazi. Really.In my opinion the story's greatest merit is the exploration of racial relations and how morals are tied to the structure of a society. My first Heinlein, and I think that was a mistake. It does have the potential to turn off readers. Fortunately I am stubborn and decided to research the author before giving up on him. I think now that the reviews of his other books warrant some more Heinlein reading."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I have read this book several times over the past 15 years and do not recall ever reading that hugh &quot;grabs&quot; barbara and proclaims that &quot;I am going to bed this wench for the good of the human race&quot;. I searched for this passage numerous times and was never able to find it. For those whiners who label this book brutal and insulting, deal with it. War is brutal and insulting, so is racism and nuclear weapons, but they unfortunately do exist. My feelings are that this book shows that hard work and self responsibility are not just nice virtues to have around but are important for the survival of the human race. It also demonstrates that racism in ANY form is inherently wrong and could lead to the fall of western civilization."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Is this science-fiction's most contraversial novel? I'm not sure if I could call it that, there's plenty here to raise eyebrows but I can probably think of three or four SF books that exacted the &quot;contraversial&quot; feeling from me more than this book. It's typical Heinlein and if you just left it at that, longtime Heinlein fans would probably know exactly what I was talking about. For those not so blessed, let me explain then. Heinlein generally takes an idea that's a little on the edgy side (here blacks taking over the world after the whites wipe themselves out) and runs with it, having his characters functioning as little more than mouthpieces arguing his points over and over. If you're into it, you'll forget the lack of extensive plotting and delve into the idea . . . if not then you've got a hard road in front of you. Farnham and his family take cover in a fallout shelter to avoid a nuclear war . . . the resulting war somehow propels them two thousand years into the future where the Chosen race (guess who?) has taken over and all light skinned folks are used as slaves (among other things, but you'll discover that when you read the book) . . . Farnham gets dropped into this and being the practical self made man that he is, adapts himself while thinking of ways to get out, while Joseph, a young black man who worked for him, sees little problem is taking advantage of the situation, while remaining essentially decent (sort of a &quot;shoe is on the other foot thing&quot; but Heinlein wisely stays away from too much of that line of thinking). They are about the most well rounded characters, though Farnham is a typical Heinlein protagonist, always thinking, uses his wits, an unshakeable core of his own morality, stuff like that. Joseph is much the same way. The women fall into two catagories, either simpering useless wimps (Grace) or mindnumbingly devoted sex kittens, smart and loyal. Right. Some of the stuff shown here will definitely make you wonder how much he believed in and how much was pure shock value (and it wouldn't be a Heinlein book without a discussion on sex, this time revolving around incest, but I'll let you discover that one for yourself) but overall it's a swift tale that contains a bunch of ideas that are worth thinking over, mostly how slavery is bad no matter who does it, among other things. Gear yourself up for it before you read it, because he's not going to make it easy, keep your head above water and you'll make it through, it is a strong novel and not one of his absolute best but maybe strong enough to make the second tier of greats."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"This is an entirely plot driven book with one dimensional characters that are, for the most part, unlikable. The core characters are twentieth century citizens who find their lives forever changed by a nuclear holocaust. The plot itself is a relatively simple one.The main protagonist, Hugh Farnham, is a farsighted, twentieth century guy who builds a bomb shelter and stocks it with the necessities of life so as to be prepared in the event that nuclear war erupts. When it does, he, his wife, Grace, son, Duke, and daughter, Karen, as well as her friend, Barbara Wells, and Joseph, Hugh's employee, find themselves saved from destruction but hurled by the nuclear blast into a world two thousand years into the future.The future, however, into which the characters are hurled, is a future in which the world is ruled by dark skinned people. All light skinned people are slaves to their dark skinned masters. Since the Farnhams and Barbara Wells are white, they do not fare too well in this new world order. The only one who comes out on top is Joseph, who happens to be black. He also happens to be the only reasonably likable character in the book.While the future is an interesting one, the novelty of it is undone by the fact that the main characters are so unlikable. Hugh Farnham is nothing more than an insensitive bully and egotist married to a lush, whimsically named Grace. Barbara Wells is a woman who thinks nothing of abusing the hospitality of her hostess, Grace, by sleeping with her husband, Hugh, shortly after meeting him.As luck would have it, Barbara's friend, Karen, also think that it is perfectly fine that her friend should be sleeping with her father, who just happens to be her mother's husband. Though, why Barbara would want to, however, is beyond me. Once in the future, however, Karen, for whatever sick reason, also seems interested in copulating with her father. Meanwhile, her brother, Duke, is nothing more than his drunken mother's enabler, at odds with his father, and a secret racist. The only remotely normal person is Joseph, and even he, too, has his moments.One simply does not care about most of the characters. In terms of plot, however, the author is on firmer ground. The future that the author has created provides a lot of food for thought, as he covers many issues. Incest, cannibalism, race role reversals, women as sex toys, the neutering of males, as well as using some humans as breeders, are all interesting, though somewhat controversial, concepts. While touched upon, however, these issues are never fully explored or realized. Consequently, the plot, which is, at times, quite interesting, finds itself undone by the unlikability factor of its characters."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I found the first half almost unreadable. I put it down, decided to give up, then picked it up again and skimmed through to the second part, where the interesting \\"sci-fi\\" bit took over.Some people have a problem with the perceived racism of the book. It is quite shocking when Duke - a major character - starts spouting his racist views. Even the other white characters congratulate themselves with a cosy smugness that they are \\"liberal\\" as far as racial matters are concerned.For me, the two main problems were Hugh Farnham's character and the terrible SEXISM of the book.Hugh is the most dreadful control freak imaginable. He humiliates his wife and son and demands absolute, unquestioning obedience from everyone. He even goes so far as to threaten physical violence to his wife and to kill Duke. The fact he was so loathsome was why I nearly gave up. He fails to realise that he is at least partly responsible for the way his family has turned out. At the end of the book, he gives up on his \\"first\\" family, and abandons them to their fate. I could totally empathise with the hatred Grace and Duke felt for him. As much as I disliked Duke as a racist he was the only one to stand up to Hugh.The writing is saturated with sexism from the beginning. Even bearing in mind that it was written in 1964, the female characters are weak and dominated by Hugh's monstrous ego. Grace is a pathetic alcoholic and her character flaws are dealt with at length, without challenging that it may well have been her husband who made her like that. Barbara and Karen accept Hugh's tyranny without complaint.The second half of the book is interesting and thought-provoking. The creation of such a dystopian world could perhaps have been dwelt upon more. It is interesting in its treatment of racial stereotypes and the abuse of power, and the depiction of cruelty and injustice is up there with 1984 and The Handmaid's Tale.There is no psychological depth or proper character development, however. I realise these things are sometimes secondary in science fiction, but they do not have to be.Ultimately although the story is interesting (in its second half), the awkward style and dreadful characters spoilt it for me and I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Reading this book I'd equate to playing tennis on a cold, windy, Saturday afternoon: Yeah, it's fun... but you'd probably rather be doing something else, like reading any other Heinlein that isn't so damn dumb. This book is entertaining, yeah... but then again, so is watching the Brady Bunch. But thoughtful? Original? Insightful? No! If you read to be entertained, then you won't be dissapointed. If you read to be challenged, to think deeper about how the underlying theme applies to YOU (i.e.Lucifers Hammer)... then no, you'll come away feeling same as I."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"A good book about a post-apocalyptic future written by a great. The society the Farnham's encounter after a nuclear war is disturbing to say the least. The heros are not always heroic and the ending is somewhat dry. I guess what I mean by Hugh not being that heroic is that he is a cut-and-dry realist. He does what's necessary and will cut loose a family member if the situation requires. It's a \\"top of the food chain\\" type world and Hugh is gonna survive. Good for the average reader. Of course, a must for Heinlein fans.JK"},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I have mixed fillings about this book. For one I really had a good time reading it, as a matter of fact I devoured it in two days. The plot is trite at the beginning and then turns to really tacky as soon as the big one hits. The hero of the story is a nice character, hardly the average type of guy now a days, but a little more popular in the 60s. Building a nuclear shelter is more than plausible during and after the Cuban missile crisis, but the one he built is a little far fetch; the only thing it lack is an operating room who proves to be his undoing later. The author gives no rational explanation for the leap in the future, a society of switched roles between races and very conveniently for the plot, the servant becomes the master and the master the servant. I would have expected a nobler behavior from Joseph towards his previous master but perhaps is the point the author is trying to make. Hugh is a Jack of all trades, and is a shame that in the second part of the book the plot happened in the lower level of the building,. Had it been a tall one, we would have known if he could leap tall buildings in a single bound. All and all, is nice reading."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I really enjoyed this one! It appears to be like on of Heinlein's shorts with little to read inbetween the line's. But this has almost as much depth as Stranger or Cat who walks... This is most definatly a must read, both fun and incitefull."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Hugh Farnham is a blue-collar survivalist who likes to play Bridge. His college-age daughter Karen, her friend Barbara, his lawyer son Duke, his alcoholic wife Grace, and house servant Joe are playing cards at his house the night the bombs hit. Everyone scrambles to safety inside Hugh's modern bomb shelter.As the bombs fall and his wife is passed out, Hugh starts up an affair with his daughter's friend Barbara, right in the shelter. As if Hugh's shallowness and arrogance wasn't enough to turn you against the protagonist, this nauseating little scene will.When the shakes and quakes finally end, the family pours from the shelter to find themselves in an impossible, pristine, clean world. At first glance, it looks like utopia, but then as they settle into a rustic lifestyle they are suddenly set upon by an advanced race, imprisoned, and brought into a vastly different culture as slaves. Somehow, Hugh needs to find a way to break free of the civilization they are trapped in, so that he can be free with Barbara.Of all the Apocalypse Fiction, this book is the worst. The protagonist is so lowbrow, so arrogant, so unlikable, so self-centered, so shallow, so immoral that he simply cannot capture any interest. He's not even a \\"love to hate\\" person.The dialogue is flatly emotionless and yet irritatingly flippant, and Barbara and Hugh's constant prattlings of \\"Darling, Dear, and Beloved\\" do not fit the characters. Neither does Hugh's occasional spouting of words like \\"shall\\" and \\"shan't\\" along with racial diatribes that include heavy use of the \\"N\\" word.There is little emotion from these one-dimensional characters even though they face the death of Hugh's daughter and Barbara's friend Karen, cannibalism, castration (Hugh cared more about his \\"boys\\" than he did his real children), pedophilia, racism, and $exual slavery, they show no more feeling than they would biting into a doughnut.The entire plot-over-plot had a contrived and vapid feeling to it, as if the author himself didn't quite believe his story. And if he doesn't believe, how can he expect the reader to?Overall, there is no depth or flavor in this story at all, other than the ugly aftertaste of a musty trailer park visit in the dusty twilight, as old men drink cheap stinking whiskey and the wind blows over the city dump next door. I recommend avoiding this book."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"It's the 1960s and World War III has started. The release of energy from a nearby atomic bomb explosion hurls the occupants of a bomb shelter into an unknown time and place. The survivors, two men and two women, are left to fend for themselves and build a new life with only the few things they have in the shelter and what they can find in the wilderness. Without giving too much of the plot away, this \`wilderness' is actually the private land of a technologically advanced humanoid race. This book address two distinct, primary themes: wilderness survival in the first half of the book, and personal freedom (and the master-servant relationship) in the second.This is an entertaining read, but it is far from Heinlein's best. There are some glimmers of EH at his best. For example, it is clear that EH thought a great deal about what should and should not be contained in a bomb shelter, and what it would really take to returning to \`living off the land'. Some interesting suppositions for us modern day, high tech, world-wide web connected folks that hopefully we'll never have to actually get serious about. The first half of the book is definitely the stronger of the two sections, however. EH often explores issues related to government, personal responsibility, and the relationship between the government and the governed in his writings, and this book is no exception. In the second half of the book, the protagonists are captured and EH explores the relationship between them (the protagonists) and their somewhat benevolent captors. The issues that EH raises, and the manner in which he raises them, are really facile and cliched, though, not something that most readers are likely to identify with. No profound or eternal insights are ultimately provided, and the story degenerates into a not particularly memorable escape/evasion narrative. A nice twist at the end though.This is a decent, moderately entertaining novel. It certainly lacks the gravitas of EH's finest works. I rate the first half at four stars, the second at two, for an average of three stars. Certainly not a waste of money, although this is not a novel that most readers are likely to read more than once in their life."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"What would happen if, in 1962, Robert Heinlein passed by Malcolm X on a sidewalk in New York, and bought a Muhammad Speaks newspaper from him? And read it? Heinlein, always able to weave a contemporary theme with fantasy, conceived a future world where there is a race caste reversal. Of course, it isn't really a reversal as much as a race substitution, blacks in whiteface, and whites in blackface. Heinlein's premise is that it is human nature, not cultural indoctrination, that results in oppression. Heinlein, like most popular science fiction writers, disdains democracy, and believes that the most ruthless and neurotic tribe always rules. This book was little more than entertaining because Heinlein failed to take the next step and explore whether the oppressed are inevitably doomed to use their oppressors as a template for exercising power. That said, FF was a bold step for the early \`60's, as bold as buying a Muhammad Speaks newspaper from Malcolm X."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"The novel is clever, like all of his work, but it is hard for me to appreciate...

For the good you have a conservative older man who builds a bomb shelter to attempt to save his family from being destroyed in a nuclear war with Russia. The concept is not new although he was writing about it before it became a popular storyline. The bad news is that he begins to discuss 'deviant' sexual behavior, primarily when his adult daughter admits to the main character 'Hugh' that he was welcome to have her sexually. Now he of course declines but the very discussion was repulsive, they were of the belief that the small band of survivors were the only people to survive but still! If you and your daughter were the last 2 people on earth I would hope her virtue would be safe. What kind of mind thinks of such awful things? As a story FREEHOLD was quite good and I recommend it. Just beware that it has some odd mores exhibited within. I do recommend this novel but some of his later works tend to be sexually twisted."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I found this book a revolting example of white guilt I've ever read. Heinlein has a well deserved reputation for being a disciple of Aynn Rand, and a vehement opponent of Christian morality. He manages to mix all of that witches brew with a puky dollop of mostly unearned white guilt.Anyone should feel guilty for the bad things that they have done, but to feel guilty over the actions of your ancestors is assinine, especially if you don't, or haven't benefitted from those actions, and then to hold yourself guilty for the actions of some of the members of your race..too dumb for words.I am pretty tired of the white guilt thing, especially since around 2/3 of the whites who came to America prior to the Revolution did so in chains and were sold and treated with less consideration than that accorded blacks. The Ellis Island wave came to feed the plants and mines of the northern tier states. Ever hear about the national guard using machine guns on striking mine workers when in high school? No?

In the face of mocking by friends and family, Farnham has excavated and stocked a bomb shelter in the back yard of his Colorado mountain home. On the night in which the story opens, Hugh has been using a transistor radio with an earphone to listen to ominous news items out of the Kremlin as he plays bridge with his son, daughter, and daughter's friend. Their game is interrupted by a red alert, and Hugh, the young people, Hugh's wife and his black servant race toward the shelter. As they seal themselves in, thermonuclear weapons buffet them. With the shelter's temperature rising rapidly, his wife in an alcoholic stupor and everyone else sleeping under sedation, Hugh turns to Barbara, his daughter's friend, for a little comfort, but their lovemaking is punctuated by a direct hit from an H-bomb.One would think that the story would end right there, but it does not. Farnham and company survive and emerge, strangely enough, into a pristine wilderness. Heinlein treats us to one more of his well-done survival stories, detailing how the Farnhams stake their claim and improve it by living off the land and farming with the supplies that Farnham has so wisely stocked the shelter with; but that is not the whole of the story; it also deals with questions of marital strife, child rearing, personal integrity, competency, racial relations (most definitely that) and even slavery and cannibalism. Farnham's Freehold might have been told at novella length, but Heinlein deals with quite a few issues here, and fleshes out the post-nuclear wilderness episode in great detail. He takes the time to write movingly of several events and, in the latter third of the book, he describes a whole new society radically different from our own.It bears mention that Heinlein and his wife lived in Colorado Springs at the time and also maintained a bomb shelter under their mountainside home. During the early 1960s, the threat of nuclear war was especially evident, and government brinksmanship and civil defense loomed large in the public mind: Conelrad, public shelters, \`duck and cover,' the Cuban Missile Crisis, Khrushchev saying, \\"We will bury you.\\" True to form, Heinlein holds forth in Farnham's Freehold on issues of consuming importance to him, cleverly clothing it all in fine entertainment. ~~~Beth Ager"},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Farnham's Freehold is #6 on my list of All Time Favorite Science Fiction Novels. Number six. I probably reread this novel about every three years. Heinlein was clearly having a lot of fun while he wrote it, and that shows. Copyright 1964. Structurally, it's cleaner than Stranger in a Strange Land; although it lacks the brilliance of the first half of Stranger.My favorite part is the love story between the old guy and his son's date. I probably like that too much.Nuclear War. Time Travel. Fascinating family dynamics. A future where the power hierarchy is completely restructured.There is some \\"racial stuff\\" going on that will probably piss off people obsessed with political correctness. But I like the way Heinlein handled it.Do you like to play Bridge?@hg47(And yes, I am guilty of stealing from Heinlein's Farnham's Freehold and sticking background bits into one of my own novels. Can I call it \\"tribute?\\")"},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Reading over how polar the reviews here tended to be, I had to revisit my own opinion, and the book came up a notch.Heinlein is one of my favorite authors. As a teen, I was influenced greatly by one concept in 'Starship Troopers': the concept that to have any potential to be a good leader one has to serve first, and not necessarily in the armed forces. Over time, there were many other nuggets of philosophy I've gathered from his novels. Not every concept, mind you, but several. 'Farnham's Freehold' is devoid of anything like that.All in all, I found the book a bit over the top and one dimensional as some here have said. However, looking over all the controversy that continues to this day, and all the varying opinions of the characters, especially the main character, I'd have to call this a success for Heinlein. To cram so much controversy into a thin novel and make it at least passably readable is actually an achievement.My greatest problem with the book has been and is still the ending. Let's get into the leader's mind here: \\"I'm going to send my worst enemy, who is at my mercy, back in time, making him promise to leave me a message telling me he got there and my experiment was a success.\\" Yeah. Most despots would have never even spoken to him, just executed or castrated him and be done with it. As I say, over the top, and a bit contrived."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"In his later years, Heinlein became something of a perv, and you could see it in later works. He still tackled important issues, to be sure - racism is one thing talked about in this book - but then you have Heinlein inserting his free-love attitude into his characters. Not so much as in other books, but it does get annoying to hear about going around nude or polyamory or whatever after you've read many Heinlein books. Other than that, this is a good book, just not one I would recommend as a first book, this is recommended for seasoned Heinlein readers. It's definitely a interesting story about what could happen if the roles of the whites and blacks were reversed and whites were forced to be slaves. I would give this book 3.5 if Amazon let me give out fractioned stars."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Having read this book many years ago and realizing it's significance, I bought this for my Tea Table.

It very successfully displays the turning of the table in th issue of slavery."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Hmmmm.... I am never one to take the hatchet to the Grand Puba of olde tyme sci-fi...That said this was a very confused piece. The story was good around half-way through, detailing a family survival of a nuclear war.Then it turned into a social commentary about black and whites that I found more than a little preachy, and even more than that, just not interesting. I am sure at the time it was scandalous to suggest that negroes were just like us, and if they were in power and kept whites as slaves they would abuse their power just like us. But it isnt too surprising to us unlightened 21st century types. In fact, with the canabalism in the upper ruling negro class, it actually goes a bit beyond anything that I have ever heard of in our own country's slave times. I suppose a case could be made that it is even a touch racist, saying that black owning whites just couldnt keep the animal at bay and had to go to the most basic of horror and eat the whites... I dont know, maybe I just got tired of being preached at and started seeing windmills not there, but I would have like this better if it stopped around halfway."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Through Hugh Farnham's adventures after a nuclear disaster, Heinlein blends genres. He infuses the expected sci-fi with history - real and alternative, and socio-political observations with an aside on rewritten, distorted religious doctrine. Also, there is dark, sometimes humorous parody that can be taken literally; but, to do so would be the reader's error.I re-read a paperback with cover art showing Hugh and Barbara armed and carrying bundles. This artwork is a hint at a significant scene in the story. Like this picture, every scene, theme, and character contributes to a strong discourse on survival in a dystopia, family and national conflicts that have the same disastrous results, and universal human behavior that defies time and place. When this book was published in the \`60s, most Americans had limited exposure to or interest in the world beyond that which immediately affected their own borders. So, the Civil Rights Movement (a discussion mostly between Black and White peoples) and the Cold War (USA capitalists vs. Soviet communists) were largely viewed without their broader context. While the specific racial and ideological divides of that time have been, if not settled, diminished, they have morphed into more expansion multi-ethnic and religious debates. Today's better informed, more worldly readers will see the genius in Heinlein's still relevant fiction.The main characters, which comprise the Farnham family and their guests in the fallout shelter, can be viewed as one-dimensional. There's the drunken, self-absorbed wife, Grace. There's the disrespectful, arrogant, and racist son, Duke. The daughter, Karen and her college friend, Barbara, and the servant, Joe; these three are mostly goody-two-shoes, who unquestionably follow Hugh's orders . And, Hugh, the heroic, forward-thinking, and multi-talented lead, who ensures everyone's survival. I think their lack of complex development is Heinlein's intentional device to better display the characters that are introduced later in a repressive, stagnant society. The roles outside Hugh Farnham's circle show how social strata are developed across cultures and political borders. As one character says to Hugh, \\"There is always a ruling and a serving class.\\" Thus, to read \\"Farnham's Freehold\\" in Black and White is to miss seeing the big picture that may keep humanity making the same mistakes for another 2103 years."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Hugh Farnham expected a nuclear war was coming. Thus he built a bomb shelter while people including his adult son ridiculed him for Farnham's folly. However, as the news begins reporting of the threats of war growing hotter, he persuades his alcoholic wife, their son and, daughter, a friend and Joseph the servant to enter his silo. The bombs are sent while Hugh and his retinue remain safe.When they finally exit the bomb shelter, they have been somehow been forwarded centuries into the future with no other person around as if humanity has become extinct except for their small circle. The group struggles to survive when the descendants of survivors of the apocalypse find them. Except for Joseph, the rest of Farnham's party is held guilty by the color of their skin causing the pandemic holocaust. Hugh knows that for him and his family to survive, they must go back to prevent the bombs from causing the end of the world.This reprint of an engaging 1950s futuristic science fiction tale makes a case against de jure and de facto racism. The story line is fast-paced once the bombs explode and never slows down as Farnham's family is held in contempt. Although the characters are one dimensional stereotypes, readers will enjoy Robert Heinlein's argument against racism.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I have read a few of Heinlein's works and am still on the fence about how I feel about him. The book does have some interesting points; time travel, African ruled future, and some survivalist fiction in the middle. However there were some aspects that I found to be off-putting. I did not care for some of the sexual undertones. It seems like the old guy ending up with the young girl is a favorite of Heinlein's. I could also do without the constant references to card playing. Overall, I felt it was worth reading, but not at the top of my list."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I love Heinlein's early stuff. His later stuff is often preachy with the pacing of molasses in a New England winter. And then there is this.It's the pacing of the early work, with the preaching like quality of the later, and characters I find it hard to believe Heinlein created.None of the characters are really all that believable. They are flat and inconsistant in their behavior. Even the Ayn Rand-esque main protagonist seems poorly thought out and tiresome.The story has many interesting points, and some of the future society ideas are very well done. But the plot that they backdrop is far less interesting. I often wondered where events were coming from. And the ending seemed self-indulgent and disappointing.I love a great deal of RAH's work, but this isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Frankly I am SHOCKED at the poor reviews this book recieves.There are two MINOR complaints I have about this book, one that the son's acceptance of his castration is a little too easy, could have had 2 or 3 sentences that would have made this more believable, either to set him up as a yes man (where he would do anything to get ahead) wich he did not seem to be; or to have him willing to do anything to be with mommy and make her happy (wich he was not when it came to talking about her drug problem etc).The second minor complaint that I have is that I think the sign at the end of the book could have had more impact and shown the moral of the story or what the characters learned through their experiences more. Such as: books for barter was good but it should have listed other things wich would have underlined the story such as labor/work (underlying theme is that labor is virtue and sloth is evil), Training (self improvement is stressed, the value of knowledge), Durable goods (items saved from pre apocolipse = forthought and planning, Items manufactured post apocolipse = labor and skills) etc. Keep the bridge lessons as a insider joke but they could have had something about Be nice or leave- no intolorance will be tolorated etc to underline the anti racism message. I just feel like he diddnt wrap it all up in a nice polished way and that it was a missed oppertunity.Ok now onto the positives.This book is not racist. If you think it is you are completely missing the whole point and I kind of wonder if you really read the whole book. Im going to refute things in list form since there are so many points and they overlap.people have claimed Racism because-1. The Dark skinned overlords are Cannibals.Cannibalism was practiced worldwide in history, and often by caucasians. Look it up in Wikipedia. Not to mention that Cannibalism is sprinkled throughout european mythology. So Yes cannibalism is a metaphor for barbarianism (no pun intended barbary pirates) but that is not nessicarily African or dark skinned barbarism and to assume that they are cannibals BECAUSE they are black is the readers being racist and missing the authors non racist point. He is showing how the Slaves are being treated as livestock. Eating them only drives this point home. Yes its shock value, but frankly its a shock the story needs so that people dont think to themselves \\"hey, true they arent free men (and women) but is it really so bad? The protagonist starts out (when he is captured) thinking \\"Ill just play allong for now...\\" and as things progressively get worse he thinks \\"ok this is bad but I should bide my time\\" untill he see's the furthest extreme wich is the cannibalism that shows how he is not just viewed as chattel but as cattle; thats when he finally thinks \\"I gotta get outta here no matter what happens... death is better than this!\\" We can accept castration as a outrageous but believable cultural norm for this society, why is everyone so outraged that the author chose cannibalism as a plot device? Plain and simple, people have a view of the stereotypical black boogieman cannibal (robinson crusoe, king kong etc) with bone through nose standing around a boiling cauldron of human soup or chasing the poor innocent white explorer with spears or dart guns to eat them. Keep in mind that this could instead be a aligory for a aristocracy that consumes the lower caste using them up completely with no regard for freedom or human life. Think Vlad the impaler or The Bloody countess, instead of the Cannibal bushman and the racist outcry becomes meaningless. PS people read a Modest Proposal by Swift Im sure you will hate it.2. The black people are all Muslim, the book is anti Islam!You need to put this into historical context. This book was published in 1964 the year Malcom x was assasinated. Islam was at that time viewed by many as the religion of the radicalized black extremists. As opposed the ML King message of love the sinner hate the sin of racism, Malcom X had a message of segregation and that White people were inherently oppressive, racist, and evil. The black panthers were predominantly muslim, and much of Africa southern Asia andthe middle east is muslim. It is only natural that the black culture in the story would have a muslim bent. But if you notice the protagonist says repeatedly that they are NOT true muslims, they belong to a bastardization of muslim beliefs and that he himself had read the koran and knew more true phillosophy of Mohhamed than they did and did not think that true muslims would approve of this warped Islam. Also if you read Stranger in a strange land you will see that the Author actually is fond of many religions including Islam and speaks well of it in terms of a idea but that he thinks the people who practice it dont often follow the idea as with all religions. Personally I disagree with the Author, I think all religion is a bad Idea.3.The book uses the N word it must be racist!So did Huckleberry Finn wich was why it was burned. The problem is that where the characters use the N word the author is showing that the character in question is either racist, or its the black character talking about how racist people treated him. So in fact by using the N word the author is in fact pointing out racism, and condemning it. Yes the N word makes me wince, part of me never wants to hear it or read it, but I dont believe in rewriting history to only keep the nice shiny happy bits, if I believed that I would be a holocaust denier. As a white person I especially should understand and condemn racism, and without confronting it how would I understand why it was bad? The (black) character Joseph uses the N word in a sentence where he is saying you (white man protagonist) dont understand what its like to be a black man. Nore will we ever if we dont view the horrific effects of racism. The fact that it makes us wince shows us the bitter medicine is working.4. The black men all rape the white women in the book, showing how the author thinks that Black men are all sex crazed and that white women are more desirable than black women etc. Its perpetuating the stereo type!WRONG! How could you miss that this is DIRECT mirroring of how slaves were treated in the American South? Decreed to be sub-human but raped by their masters and the idea of a mixed child being abhorrant? This doesnt have to do with black men desiring white women, but as slave women being used for sex and treated as sub human. How could you not get that? Also the castration and the studding and eugenics breeding programs were also a part of American slavery. Its all in your history why dont you see it?The same arguement can be applied for the lazy arguement, Slave masters are lazy, slaves were always running around trying to be productive. Drugs being a means of control etc. Its all a satire of history.5. There is no good black character, Joseph character is a uncle tom etc.No he proves that it is power that corrupts not upbringing. Joseph is a important character as he is the one who transforms the most. In the beginning he is a servant in the truest sense of the word, a free man but Bowing scraping and trying not to give offense. At the end he is the wealthy and powerful man who is willing to use people he called friends as cattle, and takes pleasure at retribution to his former \\"oppressors\\" when he gets the upper hand. Heinlein is saying that no one should weild that much power over another man, that even a good man will become a despot given too much control. He also says it when he says that no white man would have been any better if in the same position that the black leader was in.At any rate this is getting long, I appologise, I can understand those who said it did not have a lot of character development or description, thats Heinleins style and some people dont like it. I can even understand people (kids) who found it boring, some people arent really readers when it comes to more challenging material. But please, please please... stop saying its racist."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"After a bomb warning screaming from the Farnham household television, the family, along with their servant and a friend of their daughter's, rush down into their bomb shelter. They wait in fear at the world they will find upon emerging, but when they finally open the shelter, are amazed at the beautiful untouched world around them. After some adventuring, they find that they are in the same place as when they began, but the land remains untouched by human developement. They are seemingly alone in the newly beautiful world and become adapt to being self sufficient. Together, they plan to start a new civilization, until one day they are discovered. Taken and enslaved in the 'new world' where people of colour become the ruling class and the anglo's the slaves, they find that they somehow had been catapulted into the future. This new world is a place where people are born into certain classes, their futures being determined by birth. Much like the world we live in today, the people accept their places willingly and never question their status. Hugh Farnham, however, see's the injustices of this new world and devises a plan of escape. Although I'm not a huge science fiction fan, I really did enjoy 'Farnham's Freehold'. Heinlein weaves a clever little story with this book, and throws in a few neat twists at the end. Covering the issues of race, governing politics, and those of gender, he comes up with a really creative tale that is accessible to a wide audience. It's really worth a read."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I am a sucker for any type of post-apocalytic story. Farnham's Freehold is this type of story. I really liked this book and also disliked it at the same time. Hugh and his family; wife, son, daughter, servant and a friend are caught by a nuclear surprise. They survive in Hugh's shelter; and are catapulted to a world in the future where all 'white' society has been obliterated, and black rule over whites. Slavery, studding, torture, castrating and cannabilism are the norm in this society.These situations are not sensationalized but they are shocking.Problems with book:1. Not much character depth: The most truthful characters are Joseph the servant, and Hugh himself. The other characters are as followed: the drunken wife, a mama's boy, a daddy's girl and a sexy friend of daddy's girl.2. Not scientific. I can buy how Hugh builds a well stocked shelter. I can buy how they got catapulted to the future. I can't buy how only black society survived. Certainly, the Chinese (more technologically advanced than Africa in 1962) or the Japanese would have survived also.3. Disturbingly written. Cannabilism and torturing are disturbing actions. But they way in which it is written seems to be more shocking than the acts themselves.Good points of book:1. Stunningly adroit fable of racism. Slavery has visited every society, including the kinder, gentler and more responsible Masters.2. Use of drug 'Happiness' to keep slaves happy and docile. Very reminscent Huxley's soma. Wise foreshadowing on how some believe illicit drugs are used to keep down the black man and other underclasses.3. They way Hugh and Joseph are written. Hugh is over the top, a man who will do whatever it takes to survive while still having a moral compass. Joseph is everyman who is doing what he must to survive. The roles of Hugh and Joseph have flipped. Although Hugh is a fair and loving boss; Hugh does not even blame Joseph when he is placed in a position of authority.If you read this book as SF you will be slightly disappointed.If you read this book as a satire you will be impressed.If this seems dichotomous, I don't care. I said I was a sucker for post-apocalyptic stories."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I'm giving this one three stars just because there are some interesting speculations in it about the future of a postapocalyptic world (and because I share the lead character's positive view of the United States, as Heinlein clearly does as well). But this one ranks near the bottom of my own list of Heinlein's novels.For one thing, he wrote this one smack in the middle of his Nuclear Rant Period, and he's very heavily into Soapbox Mode here. This was a time in Heinlein's life when he got (let's put it gently) deeply annoyed at anyone who suggested that massive nuclear buildup wasn't the way to handle the alleged Soviet threat, or that maybe surviving a nuclear holocaust might not be such a terrific thing. (Indeed, he built a bomb shelter at his Colorado Springs home -- _before_ Colorado Springs was anywhere near a likely nuclear target; NORAD didn't exist yet.) His surly attitude (not to mention his tub-thumping sermons about the Benefits of Military Service) informs this entire novel.For another -- and it's probably a consequence of the first problem -- _not one_ of the characters in this book is even remotely likeable. Joseph, the 'houseboy', is as close as we come to a decent human being, and even _he_ turns out to be sinister and menacing before we're through. It's hard to take sides between Hugh Farnham and his son Duke; the dad's a jerk and the son's a whiny wuss. Hugh's wife Grace is no prize either, and their daughter Karen -- apparently intended to be sweet and innocent -- just comes across as spoiled. And Barbara never gels as a character at all.For a third thing, even the stuff some readers _like_ about late-period Heinlein isn't well done here. For example, some readers have commented on Heinlein's apparent approval of incest. That shouldn't be news; _all_ of Heinlein's works stand in part for the proposition that moral standards are relative to time and place, and there's quite a bit of (authorially approved) incest in his later works. Nevertheless, _here_ it just doesn't work: in the context of _this_ family (hardly one of Heinlein's freewheeling horny-redheaded-genius open marriages), Karen's remarks to Hugh on the subject just sound out-of-place and weird.This one belongs next to _Expanded Universe_ on the shelf of books that could well have turned me off to Heinlein if I'd started with them. It's not without merit -- again, there's some interesting social commentary and speculative future history, and I can't fault the patriotic intent -- but for my tastes the merits are far outweighed by the flaws."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I recently read Heinlein's Stranger In A Strange Land, liked it, and decided to read some more of RAH's works. So I went to the bookstore looking for The Number of the Beast, the Heinlein I had decided to read. I didn't see it on the shelf, but I did see a book called Farnham's Freehold. As I had never heard of this book before, I took it off and looked at it. The strange cover (as if the title wasn't strange enough) intrigued me, as did the subheading &quot;Science fiction's most controversial novel&quot;. Hmmm... Then I read the summary on the back of the book and decided to buy it. And then I read it.What can I say? I liked the book. But it's not for everyone. It is very light science fiction (but then so are most (all?) of Heinlein's), but the overall story itself is complex. It shows a future world where blacks are the predominant race, and whites are slaves. Lots of other things too; cannibalism, free love (Heinlein for you), racial slurs, and constant reference to women as &quot;sluts&quot;. Etc., etc., etc. However, all this is in here for are reason. This book is more satire, than sci-fi. It is a bit like 1984 or Brave New World at times, like other Heinlein works at others, but in the end, definately in a class of it's own.Don't go into this book expecting to read another Strange In A Strange Land, or Starship Troopers. It's not. It's different. Not something for everyone, but possibly everything for someone."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"This quirky and interesting novel by Heinlein doesn't seem to fit easily in his oeuvre although there are certainly echos of several recurring and important Heinlein themes.One is the idea of the competent man which we see in Hugh, a self made man who has the foresight to build the bomb shelter that saves his family from nuclear holocaust. Ever since the early short story \\"By His Bootstraps,\\" Heinlein was a pioneer in writing about time travel. Heinlein was one of the first sci-fi writers to discuss in detail time travel paradoxes. And the idea that the future will be dramatically different from the present in various unsavory ways--especially in the development of corrupt, oppressive, right wing societies--can certainly be seen here. This story adds a few more unpleasant ideas in that slavery and cannibalism are common. The dark side of human nature and society often takes front and center in Heinlein novels although this is another aspect that can be off-putting to some readers.Heinlein also loves throwing political and social curveballs which we see here in the fact that the ethnic class structure of American society gets turned upside down, with blacks now being the rulers and whites the underclass. In fact, the whites are slaves and food animals, truly a very dark future dystopia even for Heinlein.Another odd feature of this novel is that none of the main characters are very likable, as other writers here have observed. Heinlein could write some of the best villains in science fiction, but his main characters were usually at least somewhat appealing even if a bit unconventional, hard boiled and stubborn. Not to mention allergic to authority figures. But Heinlein's vision of the future got darker as he got toward the end of his career (such as in his novel, Friday, in which I discuss this idea at length in my review, incidentally).Overall, though, this is a worthwhile Heinlein story despite some ideas and situations that might be off-putting to some people not familiar with Heinlein's work and his ability to imagine very trenchant, dystopian futures."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"The first time I read Farnham's Freehold, I was too young for it and just tolerated it. As I matured, the novel seemed to get better, because I better understood some of the things Heinlein was saying and doing.I think most folks today will get turned off by this story. However, it actually is good writing. Some of the points about reverse racism are telling. Actually, the book is more about several kinds of prejudice. Goodness knows that there was a lot of prejudice in the 1940s and 1950s. Some of the other reviewers have pointed to most of what seems to be happening. However, Heinlein's story does have more than one level and appearances can be decieving.This novel, still (many years later), is not as good as Heinlein's better works. If you are new to Heinlein, start with one of his juveniles."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I won't bother repeating the plot of the book, as many others have already done so.I have read most of Robert Heinlein's books, and although Farnum's Freehold is far from his best it is memorable with typical several typical Heinlein characters. The father is the self sufficient, thinking \\"hero\\" who does not have to be perfect, the mother a traditionalist with no original thoughts, the friend a younger, female match for the father, etc.This book is from the early 1960's, and should be judged for the time it is written. I have the advantage of having read the book closer to its original publication date. Many of the ideas were new at the time - the idea of the reverse slave society, the time travel due to some extreme event - these are all being done again and again by current authors (think some of Turtledove's stories, and Flint's \\"1632\\" and its sequels). They might seem hackneyed now, but let's remember who came first.Many think of Heinlein as sexist, but little could be further from the truth. His frequent use of strong female characters was way ahead of its time, both in and out of science fiction. Yes, he shows some of the stereotypical weak female characters - but usually as the antithesis of his strong, female heroines."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"That's what I told the guy who gave me this book by the time I got to chapter three. And it only went downhill from there.Conceptually it's a good story. A fairly average household of that time, plus one guest, live through a nuclear attack and end up in a very foreign world. You can get the gist of the story from other reviews.The problem with the book is two-fold.Firstly, the characters all fall nicely into various stereotypes and they carry out those stereotypes perfectly. When different situations come up, they all act exactly as they would be expected to from the very beginning of the book. I'm not even sure that Hugh Farnham would have been seen as a mold breaker because there were certainly plenty of non-racist White men at that time.Secondly, I take issue with certain aspects of the future world. I don't want to go into details because I want you to have the same shock I had when reading it. But I will say this, certain things are too convenient, certain things are blatantly unnecessary, and one conversation in particular between Joe and Hugh is completely unrealistic.That said, the book is worth reading because the situations that this group of people perpetually end up in are completely unexpected even though their reactions to them are."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Robert Heinlein has his fans--of which I'm becoming--and is obviously considered a legendary writer, but sometimes even a \\"legend\\" has some bad books, or at least, books that have had potential.\\"The Door Through Summer\\" was a book that had a definitive goal and obstacles, where some of the books by Heinlein are just people going through the motions with no clear goal, until maybe the final third where there is a plot the protagonist has to face until he or she realizes some life-changing matter. (Note: These are books I obviously don't see myself returning to).\\"Farnham's Freehold\\" wasn't a book to have a definitive goal, I discovered after reading it, but it did offer some ideas that I found intriguing, which initially drew me to the novel. That idea is a planet that has a majority of \\"people of color\\" (i.e. of African descent). Hugh, the Caucasian hero, also doubles as the audience as he is thrust into \\"foreign\\" world he isn't used to, {coming from the racially charged 1960s). For most of the book, it's about Hugh and his family, their squabbles, and it's not until their discovery of a different world that a plot to escape (in the final third of the novel) hits. And, it's not necessarily that big of an obstacle, since they are let free anyhow to go back to a time where they are comfortable.Of note, this world is devoid of any Asians, specifically Chinese. The reason for this is the generalization that their skin is \\"white,\\" which in turn generalizes all Asians, since there are different shades of Asians...and not all Asians are from China. The \\"Asians\\" were killed off in the initial battle that led up to the predominant black/white civilizations. Interestingly, Hindu individuals, in Heinlein's story, are considered closer to \\"black\\" due to their skin tone--again, generalizations--since Hindus are Asian, and even \\"black\\" people have different shades.The world is devoid of anyone who is non-white Hispanic/Latino, or Native American. All we know is that there is a black civilization over a white subclass, and the black leader is a cannibal...eating teenage white girls.There are no dimensions to the black ruling class Hugh and his family meet. Heinlein could have pushed further with this world, as we really don't learn much or care by the end of the novel.** out of *****"},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"This book was really hard me to get through I don't know about the rest of you. This book is a fine illistation of how well some of Heinlein's idea have transfered over into the 21st century (moon is a harsh mistress).Others simply have not (Farnham's Freehold). I really didn't like where the book wound up for the vast majority reads like a sort of Turner Diaries in reverse only this time with the black men on top but than suddenly at the end of the book the main charecters are suddenly forgiven all of their transgresions and its back to square one. In the end the book really doesn't make any kind of sense and too otp it all off the book is almost drianed of the author's usual good humor and wit. Therefore it was really no fun for me too read.Overall-The author wrote this book for two reasons Either he was trying to make a vast social statment to white people about the shoe being on the other foot someday and that us white poeple had to change our ways.Or he just really hated black people I honestly don't know. I do know that nothing in this book inspires me to read it over and over agian ike I have done for practically all of Heinlein's other works that I have read."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Normally I don't like rating a book based on &quot;I liked it&quot; or &quot;I didn't like it,&quot; but in this case I made an exception. All the pieces of a good book are there, but they don't come together.It's the story of a man and his family (plus a couple more along for the ride) who are vaulted into the future by a nuclear blast. In this future, dark skin = superiority (i.e. black africans, dark Indians, etc.) and light skin automatically makes you a member of the servant/slave class. Back in the mid-60's, this would have been an uncomfortable (and/or controversial) setup. This aspect kept my interest, but when you strip away the controversy value, there's little left to recommend this book.Hugh, the main character (and patriach of the family) seems to alternate between extreme (at the time) liberalism and right-wing militarism, as required by the plot. The other characters are barely developed at all. The science is never explained (although, that's not the point of the book, so it's probably better that way).Overall, I'd have to say I'm dissappointed. Certainly, this is a better book than many of his juvenile novels, but it's far inferior to his other adult works, in my opinion, and hence the 2-star rating."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"First half: A family plus a few extras go into a bomb shelter and are saved from armeggedon. But when they emerge from the shelter they find themselves in a strange land with no other people. Not sure where they are, they begin to form a civilization and set upon the road to the propegation of the species.Second Half (and just when I was getting into the first half): some \\"Chosen Ones\\" of a futuristic civilization show up and make them all slaves, with the exception of the black man, because he is a \\"Chosen One\\" too. (based on his skin color) Now the story is about a man trying to rescue his family from opressors.I liked the first half, and the second was ok, but they don't work that well together. For me, this is sort of typical of Heinlein. For a comparison, check out \\"Stranger in a Strange Land.\\" Starts out one story and changes completely. Of course Heinlein also uses the book as a platform to preach his societal ideals, which could be called his trademark. And, for good measure he throws in some cannabalism. (This is another good comparison to \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", in which Heinlein basically endorses cannabalism.) For me, its 3 stars, not his best but not a bad read either."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Farnham's Freehold (1964) is a standalone SF novel. It is initially set in the Cold War era.In this novel, Hubert Farnham is a former Navy man and a jack of all trades. Hugh is married to Grace and has two children. He has become wealthy through his own efforts.Grace Farnham is Hubert's wife and the mother of Duke and Karen. She is a homemaker, but enjoys the wealth of her husband. She has become a lush.Barbara Wells is an unhappily married woman. She is a student at the same university as Karen.Joseph is a servant in the Farnham household. He mostly takes care of Grace, but is also the handyman.In this story, Karen has brought Barbara home with her for a visit. Duke is also dining with his parents that evening. During the meal, Duke accuses his father of frightening Grace by listening to an emergency band radio. Barbara sides with Hugh and mentions that she has a survival kit in her car.After the meal, everyone but Grace sits down to an evening of bridge. But their casual evening is interrupted by a nuclear attack. Hugh sends everybody downstairs to the bomb shelter. Then a nuclear bomb hits nearby.A battery operated radio on the wall is knocked out of its fixture and is broken to pieces. Hugh mentions that another radio is available in the supplies. Duke demands that it be unpacked so that they can hear the emergency bands.Hugh refuses, but Duke persists. Hugh tells Duke that the party is operating under lifeboat rules, meaning Hugh is Boss. Then Hugh tells Duke that he can leave if he cannot abide by Hugh's rules. Duke agrees to cooperate, but does not agree to obey Hugh's order.Hugh calls a condition seven and Joseph gets out a submachine gun. He points it a Duke and waits for Hugh to give the order to shoot. Duke is convinced that Hugh would have him shot, so he agrees to obey.Hugh points out that promises made under duress are not binding. So he asks for Duke's parole. Duke agrees to the parole and Hugh gives him an automatic pistol. Duke gives it back.Some uncomfortable time later, another nuke goes off further away. Their attempts to receive anything on the other radio are futile. Then still another nuke goes off, seeming right over their heads.For some reason, the shelter is cooling off. Apparently the firestorm had died down. They try to go out the main door, but it is sprung. So they use the escape tunnel.The area around the shelter is virgin forest. They shoot a deer close to the shelter. The water from a nearby creek is not radioactive.This tale puts the Farnham party into pioneer mode. They start a garden and even level the shelter. Then the natives appear.According to the introduction, this story is a satire. I originally read it as a straight adventure story with sophisticated side issues. It was written shortly after the Cuban Missile Crisis, so the story was appropriate for that timeframe.The issue of survivors of a nuclear armageddon coming from the southern hemisphere appeared reasonable. Even the slavery of white people by the darker Southerners seemed likely given the death counts within the northern hemisphere. The cannibalism situation was not out of line in any culture, including that of the author.Like all stories by the author, the characters are human. The good characters have some bad in them and even the bad characters have some good in them. Characters are always capable of doing the unexpected.But Heinlein never limits his novels to one story. There are other themes lurking within the background. Virtually every novel and many of the short stories contain a distorted reflection of our own culture.This story also presents a heavy handed message of preparation for all obvious dangers. Take out reasonable insurance for all known risks. Farnham built a shelter because the obvious risk of nuclear war. Even though it would not protected them against a direct hit, it could have saved them from a lesser blast.Highly recommended for Heinlein fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of survival planning, cultural conflicts, and persevering humans. Read and enjoy!-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I certainly cannot place this work at the top of this author's best list, but dispite the warts, the read is good and the story will certainly stick with you. Much of the work, depending upon your point of view, is pretty much politically incorrect for this day and age. Heinlein is certainly grinding some axes here, there is no doubt about that. There are some aspects of the book that you could call offensive, i.e. incest, cannabalism, racism, et al. This coupled with the fact that not one of the characters in the book is even remotely likable, could turn some readers off. That being said though, this work is a necessary read for those exploring Heinlein's work. I feel you have to consider the time frame it was written in and the mind set of the author at the time it was written. The story will cerainly stick with you and make an impression. Isn't that what good story telling is all about? I do recommend you read some of this author's other work first though and not judge his ability completely by this offering."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"This book was a quick paced, fast read, but not Heinlein's best. The main characters aren't particularly likeable. Hugh Farnham is an arrogant, bellicose bully, his wife is a middle aged idle lush, son Duke is an equally arrogant, racist mama's boy, and little Karen wants to make Daddy her partner for procreation. Barbara is somewhat likeable, although she comes off a bit trampy, and the houseboy Joseph is about the most decent guy in the household/fallout shelter. The basic plot of the book is that nuclear war between the USA/USSR destroys most of the population in the Northern Hemisphere. Over generations, the darker skinned races of Africa and South Asia gain power, creating a matrilineal society where whites and lighter skinned races are slaves. RAH made some keen observations in this book, the one I liked was a reference to black peasants and small farmers known as &quot;poor black trash&quot;. Just as &quot;poor white trash&quot; were in economic competition with slaves and black freedmen in the antebellum/Jim Crow South, so poor black farmers compete economically with white slaves in this future. This book was written in the 1960s, at the height of the Cold War. Reading books such as this and &quot;Tramp Royale&quot;, it becomes clear that Heinlein was always a man of his time. This was an enjoyable book, would have liked it better if the main characters weren't as repugnant."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"This and Glory Road were the last two Heinlein novels I really liked. Afterwards Heinlein changed his style and many would agree not for the better. One problem with this book is that it does not flow as well as his earlier works partly because Heinlein takes up too many pages with thinly disguised preaching about society and how it should be run. Bear in mind that Heinlein was essentially of the Campbell school of thought about science fiction: take an idea and derive its logical conclusions and consequences and present them in story form. But no matter how one tries, when the subject is about economics, society, and people rather than about physics, chemistry, and engineering, personal opinion and bias is bound to creep in. The bias in this book shows very clearly that Heinlein, although progressive in some areas of thought, was definitely a prisoner of his time in others."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"It's hard to like Hugh Farnharm. He drives his wife to alcoholism, turns his son into a mortal enemy, and impregnates the only woman available to that son in the apocolyptic future. He conveniently gets rid of his old family to start a new one with a much younger woman. His son Duke, however, is a good and moral man, despite often being wrong, but he's wishywashy. It's clear that Duke gets shafted, but it's only because he fails to act. There is a time when Hugh tells Duke that his best option might be to shoot Hugh in the back. It's too bad Duke didn't do it. Hugh Farnham deserved it."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I don't even know where to begin or how to describe this book.

Even now, this book is full of shocks and surprises. When it first came out, it was a shot heard round the world. Some people see it a protest against the arms race. Others say its more about the early civil rights movement. I think both of things are true, but most of all its great storytelling. Farnham's freehold starts out slow for all of fifteen pages and then you know what hits the fan. Then the book takes three or four wild turns, all of which are hold perfectly to the logic of the story. What's best is that the good guys are a little bad and the worst bad guys are a lot of good if you look through their eyes. This book is Heinlein's best even if its overshadowed by more popular titles."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Farnham's Freehold...What can I Say? Over the decades,I've read almost the entirety of Heinlein's work,but This one put me off like no other. The basic concept for this book is pretty much Heinlein writing himself into a book as the title character. If you've ever read anything about or of Heinlein,you'll see what I mean. Farnham's attitudes and opinions are Heinlein's. It's funny he didn't title it \\"Heinlein's Freehold\\".From Farnham threatening to kill his son if he didn't kiss his ring and declare him to be lord and master,to Farnham throwing his wife away and taking up with-what would amount to in this case-a Kid,the story goes downhill from there. It's a shame that one of them didn't get a hold of a gun and put a bullet in his head. People can pontificate and muse over the \\"deep social message\\" etc,but,for all sakes and purposes,this abomination,such as it is,is pretty much rubbish and should never have seen the light of print. Apparently,at the time and day when he wrote this,Heinlein's rep and selling power were at such a high point,the editors didn't Dare refuse this \\"thing\\" and tell him what they really thought about it. Again,the triumph of the all-mighty dollar tops them all. Heinlein had So many Other Great novels under his belt-it's a pity he saw fit to publish This sputum and blemish his name as one of the Science Fiction Masters of the Golden Age."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"WHEN I READ THIS BOOK MANY YEARS AGO, I THOUGH IT WAS 2ND RATE HEINLEIN.AFTER THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11TH, I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE DECADES AHEAD OF ITSELF.IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY WE SHOULD BE SCARED, READ THIS."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"What a great writer and what an awful book. It defies belief that this book was ever reprinted let alone let into the light of print when first printed.

His disdain is evident, and it reveals a horrific story that could most certainly come true in our time. Those of you who doubt the fragility of peace in the world today are absolutely blind. One madman in the wrong place at the wrong time ... could lead to worldwide nuclear war. This well written and concise book documents what could well be our future as Americans: slaves to the african horde that rises up after a nuclear war destroys the western world."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"I am so surprised that this book ever got printed. At the beginning of the book, there is a part where a girl falls for the neighbor's dad..in a matter of a few hours after being trapped inside their shelter, she professes her love for him and he does for her in a manner that two 8th graders would. For Heinlein to harvest this story beyond the first chapter is confusing and at the same time laughable. The story zips along as if it is contrived of paper dolls and cartoon images. Not a good one, my friends. Not entertaining for a sophisticated reader. I think perhaps a 12 year old might be entertained. But my gosh,...please mom, steer your children onto something with a little meat on its bones."},{"Title":"Farnham's Freehold","review":"Heinlein wrote some significant books, but tends to preach. Everything worth saying Heinlein said in his early work, concluding with &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;. His early work is interesting and sometimes charming (cf &quot;The Star Beast&quot;). Heinlein is one of the greats of Sci Fi, but would have been more so if he had not written anything after &quot;Stranger&quot;. His later work is not worth reading and this goes in particular for FF. Hope it stays out of print."},{"Title":"The Giant Surprise: A Narnia Story","review":"I don't agree with the negative reviews posted here. Yes, it's not Narnia. Yes, it's not written by C.S. Lewis. I've never read any of the C.S. Lewis books, so I don't have any preconceptions. All I know is that my 4 year old son asks for this book quite often. He definitely likes it; It's maybe not one of his *top* favorites (we've lots of books to choose from), but it's one he regularly requests (several times a week). The illustrations are great. The story is not predictable (as another post suggested). And frankly I enjoy reading it to my son.\\"I like it\\" = 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Giant Surprise: A Narnia Story","review":"My brother got this book for me for my birthday. My family all likes Narnia, and we couldn't wait to see the movie. I like the Narnia storyline, but the big books are too hard for me. But I saw the old movies, and this book had people from the Silver Chare. This book was pretty funny, because Puddleglum's in it. I think little kids who think the big books are too hard should first start with something like The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and then read this."},{"Title":"The Giant Surprise: A Narnia Story","review":"A delightfully written and illustrated story that brings the wonder of Narnia to the young and young at heart. Puddleglum is a Marsh-Wiggle and Lally a young Wigglet who live in the marsh. When their two marsh mice friends are captured by giants they have to figure out how to rescue them. Beautifully illustrated and with a solid storyline, The Giant Surprise is a a recommended read."},{"Title":"The Giant Surprise: A Narnia Story","review":"Narnia without CS Lewis? A Narnain story without the complex themes Lewis wove in the Chronicles. Rubbish!One reviewer wrote this:\\"I suppose that what would bother Lewis (and what should bother us) is not that the book isn't \\"Christian,\\" but that it isn't any good.

Here is one of these new adventures! Whimsical illustrations sure to entrance any child combined with an adventure involving large giants with not so large brains will be a hit with some. In my case, I give this title two stars - because it is *NOT* written by CS Lewis. Inspired by, yes, but authored, heavens no. Concerning Hiawyn Oram, of her I've never heard. But people have heard of Narnia. At least this site lists her as the author, unlike Zondervan.Someone's making money on Lewis's genius.A similar situation would be if titles started to hit the 4-10 kids market featuring Bilbo Baggins in other kid friendly adventures. Maybe even Choose Your Own Adventure books for the 11-14 year olds taking place in Middle Earth. Just think, the market is ripe for these items! I type sarcastically.I'm a Narnia purist; this title adds to the Narnia cannon something that, as far as I'm concerned ended with \\"Further Up and Further In\\" and \\"Farewell to the Shadowlands\\" (see The Last Battle, last 2 chapters)."},{"Title":"The Giant Surprise: A Narnia Story","review":"I bought this book in the hopes that it was as well written as the author's other book The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.

At best, it's cute and the illustrations are pretty. At worst, the story is rather silly and nothing special.My children are young -- ages 2, 4 and 6 -- and they're big on hearing the stories they love read to them over and over again.

Perhaps I come by it naturally, but I digress.I was searching for more of the same kind of books because I know there is a series. My father read them to me and my brothers when I was young... but not when I was 5 or 6. I find it interesting the criticisms of book that speak of \\"Narnia without C.S. Lewis!\\" and \\"lacking the complex themes\\" and \\"a branding abomination\\" is really quite laughable. I mean, it is, afterall a children's book. If you want the Christian themes and the pure Narnia story, then buy the book written by C.S. Lewis! I think it's a great fit for my children. I believe the themes in the original story are far too mature and grown-up for my kids. I suspect it will be a great introduction to the series when I read it to them down the road."},{"Title":"The Meat Buyers Guide","review":"As a professional personal chef, it is important that I can identify multiple cuts of meat. This book has been and continues to be an invaluable resource for me. It is in my opinion that those who are chefs, students, or somewhere in back of the house operations need to have this book upon their shelves and take the time to read it or review it when deciding on types and cuts of meat when purchasing."},{"Title":"Roman Aristocratic Parties and Families","review":"Despite being a republic with democratic institutions, Roman society was comprised mainly of a caste system divided between patricians and plebeians. Although the patrician class was a hereditary nobility, each class who had at least one consular ancestor were collectively treated as nobles (nobiles.) Family ancestry and ancestral worship were therefore very important in Ancient Rome. Roman families were also extended and paternal authority was omnipotent over family affairs. A Roman father patriarch of the family had supreme authority over all matters affecting his extended family(patria potestas.) A Roman aristocrat's duty was to bring honor to his family by achieving political and/or military fame. Although it wasn't the sole determinant, one's patrician or noble ancestry could carry immense influence in the coveting of political office or swaying public opinion in the forum. It was for no small reason that Julius Caesar claimed to be a descendant of Aeneas and so from the godess Venus.After 70 years, Munzer is still one of the leading authorities in the study of Roman history and politics. Thanks to his contributions, historians have been able to better understand the political changes and upheavals of the Roman republic and early empire that resulted from family feuds and alliances. Munzer carefully researched historical texts and other sources to trace the family trees of several important families such as the Metelli, Claudii, etc., to study how they affected the politics of their time.I wouldn't recommend this work as an introductory text on Roman history as its depth and scope would already require some advanced knowledge of the subject. This book is, however, a must for anyone who seeks to have a thorough understanding of Roman history and its institutions. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Roman Aristocratic Parties and Families","review":"This book was first published in 1920 and made a revolution. F.Munzer is one of the contibutors of the Real Encyclopaedie of Pauly-Wissowa in which he has wrote about 5000 entries of Roman names. His books marks the debut of prosopography, a technique who use roman nomenclature to study the aristocracy and find evolution in institutions, alliances between parties and who really rules Rome. His book is a reference for all student who is interest in roman Republic. The translation 79 years later tells you why."},{"Title":"Roman Aristocratic Parties and Families","review":"The new Republic's \\"'parties' were formed by the great gentes [clans], patrician as well as plebian , and their coalitions with other 'clans'...

I recently took the June 01 Physics SAT II, and I now reflect. This book does cover most topics in detail; however, it fails to provide accurate model exams. Because the College Board has never released any copies of SAT II physics exams, Barrons was forced to put together the tests and the book blindly. Anyway, I read this book three times thoroughly and I have an A average in physics at school. This book is a big disappointment for this subject test.In fact, I went to [a store] the next day to see if any other prep book had an accurate model exam. Guess what? I found the Princeton Review book so accurate that it had about 14 similar questions from the test. So, buyers beware. Don't buy this book because you'll just screw up a SAT score.

Some answers to the practice tests are also wrong and badly explained.

On the test, you are not even allowed a calculator, and almost every single question is conceptual. This book also gives you an evaluation of &quot;good&quot; or &quot;fair&quot;; it doesn't even have conversion tables of raw scores to the 800 point scale so you can evaluate yourself.

The book gave irrelevant facts and examples that will only cause confusion. The best way to study for this test is to take AP Physics B and prepare for the AP exam. Take the test in either May or June when the AP exam is given. The people who write the AP also write the SAT II; the tests are identical. Get the &quot;Real SAT II's&quot; and go over the questions in it. Also, get as much information on the AP questions and go over those. If you comprehend the stuff on these tests then you will be fine. By the way, hurry when you take the test. It is fast, rush through it.

When reading the book, if u already know some physics, u will find that they cut out a lot of important stuff and the topics r not organized properly in the book. If u want to score high and go into some elite but expensive university, I urge u not to buy this book; even reading this wasteful editorial is more useful than reading the book.

I took introductory physics this year (I'm in high school) and I have a B+ average so I was expecting a decent grade. The questions they ask you in this book are NOT the questions you see on the test. They are much harder and involve more problem solving... the thing is, on the real test, it is mostly conceptual, with very little problem solving (thus, you are not allowed to use a calculator). I ended up not being very familiar with the questions they asked and I got a 580, which I'm very disappointed with (and it's kind of pathetic considering I took physics for a whole year!). There are tricks to EVERY SAT TEST. Most of the other books tell you what to look for and how to eliminate answers, etc. This book expects you to learn information, which is pretty darn impossible, even if you have taken a physics course.

The casting of the characters was terrific (with the exception of Chloe-she sounds angry ALL THE TIME!) and the music was haunting! I would also recommend the regular book version on cd, as those are good too. Like a previous reviewer had so accurately observed, these are like the old time radio dramas! The Left Behind books really brings the whole time surrounding the rapture to a higher level of understanding. You really feel connected to the characters.

Reminded me of what happened earlier on in the series (I had already read the books); passed the time on my 7 hour drive to see my sister. (This set must have taken 5 hours.)CONS: The characters are portrayed like real jerks at first (vs. the book &amp; movie in which they seemed more &quot;everyday&quot;). The &quot;acting&quot; is sometimes very poor (some of Steve Plank's lines were terrible). The music adds to the interest but it is way too loud compared to the volume of the voices.

It's too bad the same couldn't be said for Cloud Ten Pictures' film versions of the first two books, never mind the fact that they weren't coming out as fast as I would have wanted for them to come out.This adaptation of the first book, Left Behind, is pretty good, though I noticed that there's some voice recycling going on -- particularly with the voices of Mac McCullum and Tsion Ben-Judah appearing on different characters in the first book.(Mac's voice would later be used on President Fitzgerald's aide in Tribulation Force.)

Some voices are so low you can't hear them and some are so loud that you have to turn the volume down.

Some people know of this and know what they must do to protect thmselves and others, but some of the others dont want protection. There is a lot of suspense and subplots and over-the-top action.

While I'm willing to suspend disbelief and accept that the Rapture is just as likely as any other fantasy, this book makes little effort to truly explore a world in which god kidnaps all the children and holds them hostage in order to compel those &quot;Left Behind&quot; to convert. Instead, it consists mostly of several long speeches intended to convince the reader that &quot;time's a wastin'&quot; and that he/she better get good with god or else.Not surprisingly for a book from the christian right, the writing is virtually unreadable. Unable to achieve sufficient coherence to create actual chapters, the authors instead present one short scene (two, three or four paragraphs) after another with virtually no attempt at continuity. These short scenes are occasionally and dreadfully interrupted with long-winded attempts at proselytization by the main characters or by cheesy speculation about what will happen next.The characters themselves are thin as bible pages - Rayford Steele, the flawed but-guilty-about-it airline pilot, Buck Williams, so-named because he &quot;bucks&quot; the system, Hattie, the flaky stewardess, Chloe, the rebellious college student. But one of my biggest objections is that none of the books in the series appear to be able to be read by themselves as complete novels. The first has no climax much less a resolution but instead ends in virtual mid-thought, I suppose in an effort to create a cliff-hanger effect. Even christians should be able to see the blatant commercialism at work in this tactic. After all, the authors have 12 more books in the series to sell.It is extremely interesting that the main characters are all clearly Anglo-Saxons. Indeed, I don't think any of the protagonists are &quot;people of color.&quot; Again, this is not surprising given the treatment the authors give the Jews. The most prominent Jew is aligned with the anti-christ and references to the &quot;blood libel&quot; form a subtext of the novel.The authors work through all of the political issues of the christian right including abortion, feminism, world government, and adultery. It could easily be argued that their treatment of these issues is the only reason they set pen to paper. ...I would have awarded zero stars had that been an option."},{"Title":"The Fine Line: A Bible Study on Body, Soul and Spirit","review":"\\"What is the difference between the soul and the spirit?\\"\\"For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than a two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit...\\" (Hebrews 4:12)Every human being is formed by God as a trinity of spirit, soul and body. It is very easy to discern the realm of the body, for God gave us five senses which relate to it and understand it. Unfortunately, there is little understanding of the difference between the soul and the spirit for it cannot be discerned by the five senses. Spiritual things must be spiritually discerned and sadly, there is not much awareness that this confusion exists in the Body of Christ.For those who hunger and thirst after purity of heart and the righteousness of Jesus Christ to be made manifest in their lives, this book comes with the Bread of Life and Living Waters: the Word of God.

However, a friend of mine recently called me and asked me how to do a few less ordinary things in SPSS. After spending some time on the phone with him I decided to look back at these books and suggest/give one to my friend.I think the \\"SPSS Survival Manual\\" by Julie Pallant is somewhat of an easier read for the graduate student or market researcher who wants to quickly look up a certain how-to topic for SPSS.\\"Discovering Statistics Using SPSS for Windows\\" by Andy Field, on the other hand goes into more detail on the statistics behind the techniques in SPSS. This one reads a little more like a text book though and can be a bit dry/technical unless this is your thing.I tested the two by seeing which would do a better job of explaining how to conduct a Factor Analysis (PCA) in SPSS. \\"Discovering Statistics...\\" by Andy Field would have lost my friend right away, and by page three or four is listing formulas and quadrant plots. \\"SPSS Survival Manual\\" by Pallant on the other hand got into the \`how to' part rather quickly with clear to follow examples.If you're like my friend/more into getting it done quickly and correctly without getting bogged down with the academic detail, then definitely purchase the \\"SPSS Survival Manual\\".If on the other hand you're not scared of a little extra math/statistics and have the extra time, you may want to think about \\"Discovering Statistics\\".However, for the hard core multivariate analytics people, neither of these books will due. I would suggest something like \\"Multivariate Data Analysis\\" by Hair, Anderson, Tatham, & Black.

You don't have to be a stats major to be able to gainfully master SPSS. It does the computational heavy lifting. The point of this book is to learn the broad meaning of these concepts and how to interpret the results SPSS returns.The \\"Survival Manual\\" part of the title refers to what Pallant considers to be the salient features that you should learn.

Without this book I would not be graduating with a doctoral degree."},{"Title":"SPSS Survival Manual","review":"When I purchased this book, I expected it to be a user-guide to the rather user-unfriendly SPSS. It's both more and less than that: more, because it includes a fair amount of basic statistics, such that it tries to help you understand what you are doing; less, because it does not cover many of SPSS's non-basic features. It is aptly entitled a Survival Guide, because it seems to be designed as a textbook for a basic statistics lab, to help the intimidated student use SPSS intelligently. I purchased it because I was assigned to teach a research methods class in social psychology, and it had been a while since I had used even some of SPSS basic functions (and those in version 8). I was a little disappointed that it did not explore SPSS more, but I did find it very useful in helping me help my students: it reminded me to articulate things I did intuitively and it showed me some little things that I had not known before."},{"Title":"SPSS Survival Manual","review":"I read this book with reluctance because seems out of date - it is for version 12.0 (2nd edition of the book). Many people I met asked me my opinion as a statistics software trainer, who often teaches SPSS. I have skimmed it many times, but on my first full read, I was impressed. The version was not a distraction, as the core topics addressed have not changed. It does, however, make use of a couple of new features in 12.0 (version 15.0 was released in fall 2006).This book knows its audience - undergraduates who are trying to survive a SPSS lab with a small chance of ever seeing Statistics again. This is not to slight the book in anyway. The title and description make this explicit. For the vast majority of university students one required course is all they will see.As a result, the author wisely spends a number of chapters on setting up SPSS on the assumption that one will be typing from a survey in a university setting. This is done carefully and I am sure that the author wins the loyalty of her readers in these pages. Then, there are about 50 pages on descriptive statistics, and 150 pages on multivariate. The emphasis is clearly on the basics: the fundamentals often get more pages then advanced techniques. This is as it should be. Also, do not use this book to explain all the choices, and all the output in each technique. If you need this - and some do - buy Andy Field's Discovering Statistics Using SPSS. Field's book is also the better choice if this is the first of several statistics courses for you.Discovering Statistics Using SPSS (Introducing Statistical Methods S.)

I used various editions of the Manual in teaching a graduate-level course intended to introduce quantitative research methods to students in a variety of social and behavioral sciences, and found that -- wonder of wonders! -- I could devote almost all my instructional time to presenting material pertaining to the substance of the course, while spending very little time on discussion of computer conventions.The students who enrolled in the class did so, with rare exceptions, under duress because it was a requirement for completing their master's degree programs. While they were generally capable, almost none had an interest in data analysis or related computer applications. A few were genuinely math phobic, but most were just not interested, preferring to devote their in-class and study time to material intrinsic to their disciplines, whether they be nursing, journalism, kinesiology, sports management, educational administration, or one of a fairly large number of other majors. Nevertheless, the SPSS Survival Manual enabled them to undertake credible analyses of informative data sets with remarkably little difficulty.The SPSS Survival Manual is correctly construed as a self-instructional tool, even for students who are indifferent to quantitative methods and their applications. In fact, since the Manual takes data analysis from the forbidding domain of the alien and unfathomable and enables students to show themselves that quantitative methods may have interesting applications in their fields of study, it seems perfectly reasonable to argue that the Manual generates interest in data analysis where none existed.The SPSS Survival Manual is quite rare in that it can be correctly construed as a self-instructional tool, even for students who once lived in dread of quantitative research, putting off research methods courses as long as possible. During more than two decades of teaching master's-level students material that they really were not keen on learning, the Manual proved to be one of the most useful instructional tools that I found. It lives up to its billing,and has been instrumental in the completion of a lost of master's theses and projects that otherwise would have gone unfinished or would have taken a very different form."},{"Title":"SPSS Survival Manual","review":"I've gone through a dozen or so books to help me with my PhD research, and this has been the most help.

All that is missing are the air temperature, smells, and eerie silence that the real thing offers. The CD will not replace being there, but it is a good pre-trip teaser or post trip souvenir. My only complaints are that the interface is a bit clumsey, and panning is a bit slow and jerky. These are more a problem with the state of the technology than anything else. A fast computer helps. In spite of these shortcomings, I think the CD is a good buy. Besides all the photos, there are many books and articles, the details of which can be seen at the inyopro.com website.

Nijinsky was an incredible dancer, performer, choreographer for the world-famous Ballet Russes of Sergei Diaghilev. Nijinsky was a beautiful, complex man who attracted both men and women with his other-worldly talent of dance. He became engaged with Romola, who was a Hungarian aristocrat and fellow dancer, and in the beginning of their relationship they didn't even speak the same language! Diaghilev, stung by Nijinsky's choice, and probably furious about losing control of his favorite dancer, later fired Nijinsky. The start of World War I complicated ballet tours and travel, and Nijinsky began a spiral into mental illness. One can only admire the steadfast support and constant physical and mental care that Romola gave Nijinsky for the remainder of his life, being very mentally fragile. As a footnote, the great L&eacute;onide Massine replaced Nijinsky at the Ballet Russes, and can be seen as the shoe maker in the classic 1948 film \\"The Red Shoes.\\""},{"Title":"Nijinsky","review":"With the tumultuous background of the Diaghilev Ballets Russes begins this story of the obsessive love of a young would-be dancer for the great Vaslav Nijinsky.

BUT, Mr. Burman has a bundle of contemporary sources, French, Latin, and Arabic sources, that really give this handy little book a surprising amount of depth for being &quot;cursory&quot;.An excellent complement to a study of the Order, or of the Crusades, or of medieval history in general."},{"Title":"The Templars, Knights of God: The Rise and Fall of the Knights Templars","review":"&quot;The Templars&quot; doesn't purport to be, and isn't, an exhaustive study of the most intriguing of the Crusader-era military orders. The book is targeted towards the reader who wants a concise overview of the order, without bogging down in discussions of modern-day conspiracy theory or the allegations of witchcraft which eventually doomed the Knights. The book is refreshingly sober in this respect, and, as such, gets a generally good rating from me. Indeed, the Holy Grail is mentioned only in passing, and, if you're looking for fuel for that particular fire, you'll have to look elsewhere.However, although a chapter was devoted to the part of Templar history which most appealed to me--namely, the Order's development in Western Europe into a massive multinational proto-banking institution--it still left me wanting more explanation in that regard. The reasons behind this phenomenon are examined only cursorily by the book, and are, perhaps, not realistically within the scope of a work this size.Despite this shortcoming, the author makes effective use of a number of contemporary chroniclers, both Crusader and anti-Crusader, to bolster his thesis--that the Templars' downfall was brought about through a fundamental lack of political &quot;situational awareness&quot; among their leaders that eventually left them vulnerable to Philip the Fair's probably-spurious accusations of heresy. Their undoubted influence among the popes of the 12th and 13th centuries no doubt contributed to their becoming a natural target and tool in Philip's plans to gain control of the papacy (which, indeed, moved to Avignon around the time of the Order's suppression). I think any scholar will find this work an interesting, concise summary."},{"Title":"The Templars, Knights of God: The Rise and Fall of the Knights Templars","review":"If you want to read an extended dissertation on the Templars - then this is worth a look. The only criticism I have is that it is too conservative and skims over the extensive myths surrounding the Templars. Although it seems well researched - it almost totally ignores the more esoteric tales of the knights. If you want to read about the knights, the grail and mysticism.....then look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Templars, Knights of God: The Rise and Fall of the Knights Templars","review":"This is one of the better written general overviews of the Templars and suffers as a result -- if you do not know that much about the Templars before you read this book, then the thematic style of the book may throw you off. In addition it tends to be rather dense at times and assumes a broad knowledge of both the crusades and broad thematic elements of the two-hundred-year history of the Templars.The book is organised around a rough centre of chronological and thematic elements. At times the thematics dominates and if you are new to the whole study of the templars you find yourself shaking your head and wondering who is doing what, where... On the last point, more maps would help, but as usual in most books, good maps, and lots of them, are lacking.The style is slightly academic and the bibliography is worth the read. A good read. In addition there is a lot of rather interesting broad elements on the financial background of the Templars and their unique and rather banal role in money lending."},{"Title":"The Templars, Knights of God: The Rise and Fall of the Knights Templars","review":"I picked up this book with some hesitation, because it was issued by a publisher that seems to cater to conspiracy theorists. Destiny (Inner Traditions) does. However, there are two kinds of nutball publishers: the complete loons, and, as in the case of Destiny, the cranks who also avail themselves of rational scholarship when available.Edward Burman's \\"The Templars\\" is the sort of text that would be on the reading list of a good undergraduate history course: 200 pages, solid command of the best secondary sources, familiarity with the important primary documents, an assumption of some minimal knowledge of the background of the period. Just right for HI 340, History of Medieval Europe in the Levant, say.There are several themes: The Templars were the first, though still premodern, international organization aside from the Church, directly chartered by the pope; they (and the Hospitallers, which was a bigger organization), created the warrior-monk concept in the West; though famous for courage, militarily they were inept; somehow (the records do not reveal the details) they helped to create modern financial systems.The bankers must have been educated, but Burman faults the leadership for illiteracy and ignorance, which contributed to military defeat and, at the end of two centuries, political suppression.It was the lurid charges engineered by Philip the Fair that kept the Templars alive in the imagination, in ways the Hospitallers and even more, the Teutonic Knights, were not. Although Burman does not say so, whatever crimes and errors the Templars got involved in -- Burman convicts them primarily of pride and avarice -- they were choir boys compared with the Teutonic Knights.Charges of avarice from the Church will generate the ol' horselaugh from a modern secularist. The whole career of the Templars and their enemies was sordid in the extreme. The notion that they had occult powers or that they secretly survive to run the world today can safely be left to the tinfoil beanie crowd, but even after 700 years, some events in the history of the Templars resonate today:1. The promise of martyrdom. They didn't expect 72 virgins (as monks, they didn't expect sex with women, period), but they did expect celestial crowns.2. The massacres and faith-breaking, by the Moslems and the Christians.3. The Templars ability to get around international (that is, Church) sanctions, in their case, the sin of usury. (It would take another, thicker volume, and more documentation than seems to exist, to decide whether in fact they were usurers.)4. The value of seapower in Middle Eastern conflicts.One point Burman fails to make screams out to the reader. Burman spends a good deal of scarce space wondering exactly what factors led to the suppression of the Templars. There were several, but in the long view of European history, the confiscation of private wealth by the state has been a constant theme. The Templars were among the first, but the habit lived into the 20th century with the Nazi plundering of the Jews and into the 21st with the Russian plundering of the owners of Yukos."},{"Title":"The Templars, Knights of God: The Rise and Fall of the Knights Templars","review":"This book covers the KNOWN Templars, from their humble beginnings to their violent demise.

Although Burman does a good job of detailing the Temple's origin and financial workings, insufficient attention and detail is given to the Order's territorial holdings in the Holy Land, their military involvement, rivalry with the Hospital and political dealings with the various Christian rulers. The biggest, unforgivable shortcoming is the absence of any maps in the book.

This is a book you can enjoy reading just for the insights on moviemaking, even if screenwriting isn't your thing. Epstein doesn't really blow away a lot of major sacred screenwriting cows here, but he does offer a lot of very practical, very realistic advice about writing and selling screenplays. He displays an insight not usually found in most books like what \\"The dialogue is flat\\" REALLY means.One of my favorite comments is when he talks about backstory in action films, pointing out that you progressively decrease the dialogue and \\"increase the whammies.\\" As for recommending screenwriting books, he says \\"Stop reading and get writing!\\" Excellent advice!"},{"Title":"Crafty Screenwriting: Writing Movies That Get Made","review":"For any writer out there it isn't a mystery how many screenwriting, writing and writing for the screen books exist in the world today (please note my redundancy had a point).Reading one book is usually like reading them all. The same message, means and delivery - mechanical, trite and simplistically frustrating as we all know writing isn't easy - on the page is only 1/5 of the battle.4/5 of the battle comes once the screenplay has been written and for those of us who don't have a dad, uncle, aunt, sister, cousin or best friend \\"since we were three\\" in Hollywood our perceptions on that ratio may be less than what we would like to admit.It is refreshing then to find a book that not only covers that 4/5, but does it in a way that allows the reader not to be overwhelmed by clearly such overwhelming odds and circumstances. Crafty Screenwriting is actually an exterior title, because the book goes much deeper than that to explore the world of screenwriting, on the page, off, before, during and after the process. What exists, what doesn't, what to do, what not, how to do it, how not, etc ...Anyone looking to read a book simply about how to write a screenplay, look elsewhere - you aren't ready for this level yet.

It fits in nicely with my screenwriting library. screenwriting is a big chore for us common folk and this book makes things easier."},{"Title":"Crafty Screenwriting: Writing Movies That Get Made","review":"CRAFTY SCREENWRITING is an outstanding book for screenwriters!Like many screenwriters, I've read dozens of screenwriting books, always looking for more information and anything that will help me to become a better screenwriter. Over the last decade, I've read them all; Syd Field's books, McKee's STORY, Trottier's BIBLE, Froug, Walter, Hunter, etc.CRAFTY SCREENWRITING stands out because it is written from a writer's point of view. What I mean by that is, most screenwriting books are written from a teacher's viewpoint. They take movies and analyze them and tell you what works and what doesn't. They can be quite valuable.But, CRAFTY SCREENWRITING takes you through the process as a writer, from the initial idea and through the first draft. It's very, very helpful and reminds you what you should be doing when you're WRITING, not what you should be doing when you're watching other movies. It's what you should be reading DURING the screenwriter process. The only book I've found that can compare to CRAFTY SCREENWRITING in that regard is a small self-published book called the SECRETS OF ACTION SCREENWRITING by Bill Martell (if you can get a hold of it, buy that too, no matter what genre you write in).This book also helps screenwriters focus on the important realities of becoming a working screenwriter and Epstein is an expert on this. Not only is he a produced writer himself, but he's also worked as a development exec who has actually purchased other people's screenplays (including some famous writers' works before they were famous).I give this book five stars because it is THE best screenwriting book I've read in the past few years. The only negative thing I can say about it is that I personally didn't agree with his theory on how characters should be created, but his actual advice on what makes a good character was still extremely valuable.I don't do many of these reviews (if you've got nothing nice to say...), but CRAFTY SCREENWRITING definitely rises to the top of the overcrowded subject of screenwriting advice books."},{"Title":"Crafty Screenwriting: Writing Movies That Get Made","review":"First off, I think this is a very good screenwriting book. Since I've read several others, I can't help but compare.If you're looking for your first screenwriting book, I don't think this is it. An absolute amateur who is still trying to figure out how to set their margins and has never heard of a \\"hook\\", would be better served beginning with David Trottier's Screenwriter's Bible.That said, if you're already doing some writing and need a little refresher, something to remind you of some of the details we all forget while writing, or something to inspire, then this is an excellent book. Often when reading a book like this, you'll think back to your own work and say to yourself, \\"Oh, that's why that scene didn't work, or that's why that character doesn't ring true, or Dang it, no wonder I can't get anywhere with the heart of my screenplay.One major quibble I have with Epstein is his insistence on talking your story out with everyone and their brother before committing anything to paper. Being a good sport, I tried this with my current screenplay.Quoth the reviewer, Nevermore.He says he's just trying to save us a lot of trouble and writing, but for many of us, I think, the process of writing it out is what gives us the mojo to get a 115 pages written. I can't just talk this out, personally. I have to just type. If I find an unrecoverable plot hole that way, then, yes, maybe I've spent some time, but such time isn't necessarily wasted. I've been practicing, and every typed word counts.Now, of course, if you're collaborating, or working on a writing staff, well, that's a very different thing. But when you're working on a spec script, you've got to trust your process and learn to use it front to back. Don't spend your passion telling your story so often you get tired of it. Just write, and let others read. Yeah, it'll take time, but as you learn to listen and kill your darlings, you'll come up with a script that is still very much yours, but still has that fire in the belly.In closing, please don't toss away this book on that account. I've simply needed to get that off my chest for awhile. This book is still loaded with great advice and no small amount of inspiration, and is worth having on the shelf."},{"Title":"Crafty Screenwriting: Writing Movies That Get Made","review":"I'm completely new to the \\"craft\\" of screenwriting, and I think there's nothing wrong with a book that starts at square one for people like me. I think the book is well-written, and it seems to have been carefully proofread and edited (you'd be surprised by the mistakes I've found in other books). I like how Epstein talks about both the business side of writing and selling screenplays as well as the actual skills and strategies you need to write them. I need to know about both. He makes his points clearly and concisely - he doesn't use five pages to say something that can be said on one page. Makes for a quicker read, without sacrificing information.Specifically, Epstein covers these topics:1. Coming up with a \\"Hook,\\" an exciting idea that can grab the attention of both show business people and audiences.2. Working out your Plot.3. Developing your Characters.4. Writing Action into your scenes.5. Crafting appropriate screenplay Dialogue.6. Understanding different movie Genres.7. Getting writing Help as you learn to improve your scripts.8. Rewriting and rewriting until you get a great script.9. Getting your script made into a movie by working with agents, development execs, producers, and the general business of Hollywood.I read a criticism on one of the previous reviews that pretty much disparages Epstein for only having one writing credit in movies. I don't know what that person's copy of Crafty Screenwriting says, but the cover of my copy reads, \\"A development executive's real-world approach...\\" In other words, Epstein never claims you should listen to him because he's a super-accomplished writer with many credits. But he is a development executive. And it's very important to know how development executives think and what they want to see in screenplays. So I think his opinion is valuable.When I first decided to pursue screenwriting, I thought I had the right idea of how I should proceed and how show business worked. Turns out I was wrong on both counts! If you're just starting out, and you want to know the basics of the business of movie development and the foundations of screenwriting theory, I absolutely recommend this book.

In doing so, the writer is challenged to examine the story, improve upon it, and be able to write it appealingly so that an audience would sit through it in the theater. _Crafty Screenwriting_ not only makes the writing process manageable and approachable, but it carefully details the function, marketability, and success of a good screenplay."},{"Title":"Crafty Screenwriting: Writing Movies That Get Made","review":"The best book on screenwriting I've ever read, and unfortunately, I've read a few.I am not a Hollywood big shot, but I know bad writing when I see it, and badly written describes most screenwriting books.

His way is better, he promises.On Mr. Epstein's web site he offers to critique scripts for nearly $500 each, saying \\"That's what it costs me not to write.\\" This is an outrageous and doubtful claim.This book is the worst of a large crop of screenwriting books. Mr. Epstein can't even get the names of the movies and their characters right--it was THREE DAYS of the Condor, and Louise was played by Susan Sarandon, not Geena Davis.Spend your money on Syd Field, Lew Hunter, Linda Seger--or anyone else.

This book isn't so much about theory, or art, it's about what has to be done to write a screenplay that will be SOLD. Epstein doesn't ask screenwriters to abandon their art, just to adapt it in subtle little ways to make it suit the marketplace.I, myself, found the sections on \\"genre\\" especially helpful, as it cleared up the problems I was having with a particular script, one that had been close to a deal several times.And now, I have to go back and fix those problems, but now I know what exactly what they are.

(Might not get made, mind you, but it'll definitely increase your chances.)Best advice in the book? Don't write a word until you've got a hook - and even then don't write a word until you've talked your story through again and again. Brilliant stuff. And funny too."},{"Title":"Crafty Screenwriting: Writing Movies That Get Made","review":"I stumbled upon a website article by Alex Epstein where he was about to reveal what was needed to create a winning script, and was intrigued. I bought his book to find his answer - hook. I eagerly read on...Only to find the same old information given in other screenwriting books, and often uninspired information (if you need this book to tell you how/where to find subject matter to write about, then give up the screenwriting game now). Overall, if I didn't have a clue where to begin as a screenwriter, this book might be useful. But be forewarned, Epstein does a lot of telling you what you should do, and very little of how to do it.To his credit, Epstein's cynical voice makes for an entertaining read. Also, his section regarding the decoding of development execs notes was interesting.If you have experience writing screenplays on any level higher than 101 and are looking for the smallest edge to help your work get noticed in a crowded marketplace, then you might not get a lot out of this book.

I've read Trottier, Field and Walter-all of whom are very informative. This book goes farther than any of them. Epstein delivers more current and common sense application of the art form than I was able to see from the afore-mentioned authors. The emphasis on &quot;The Hook&quot; is worth the price of the book alone. Epstein has the ability to force you to really focus on the most important aspect of writing a story that SELLS. As he says, &quot;what good is a screenplay unless it gets produced?&quot; From writing the very difficult query letter to formatting your story, this book covers too many things to list here. Check it out! I encourage all aspiring screenwriters to find this gem and absorb the information. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Crafty Screenwriting: Writing Movies That Get Made","review":"Alex Epstein has written a book from the standpoint of a man who has been at both sides of the table - a scriptwriter and a development executive who spends time reading scripts. Using the experiences, he builds a solid, yet a very pleasant to read composition of succinct pieces of advice on how to write a screenplay that will get made.Many people in the screenwriting biz seem to be in love with phrases. From writing gurus (&quot;A good screenplay is a screenplay that doesn't waste our time&quot;, &quot;Tell the story that has to be told&quot;) to folks who read and evaluate screenplays (&quot;It's episodic&quot;, &quot;We don't know enough about your hero&quot;). The catch with all phrases is - they're not useful to a writer. This book goes beyond those common idioms, avoids clich&eacute;s, and tells you EXACTLY what you need to know.E.g. &quot;Hook (a.k.a. High Concept)&quot; - all around the Internet you can find a definition: &quot;A premise that can be depicted in a sentence or two&quot;. But even such a structurally complex movie as &quot;Magnolia&quot; can be caught in one sentence; so again, the popular phrase is not telling us much. Going deeper from the evident confusion, Epstein successfully analyzes the entire &quot;High Concept&quot; problem by telling us what a good hook really is, why it is the most important part of the script, how to come up with a valid one, and finally - how to check out the quality of a chosen concept before you waste 6 months writing the script that won't get read, let alone get made.Combining humor with practical examples, the author finds the best path to the essence of all critical screenplay elements (structure, point of view, pacing, dialogues...) and makes them clear and easily comprehensible.Along with the abovementioned, the book shows an equally significant blueprint of the working principles of Hollywood selling&amp;buying script system."},{"Title":"Crafty Screenwriting: Writing Movies That Get Made","review":"It's show business, folks. And in Alex Epstein's book, \\"Crafty Screenwriting\\" the emphasis is on the word business. As someone who has been a development executive, Epstein reminds writers of the bigger picture: a screenplay is just one element in a deal. The screenplay doesn't get made until a lot of other elements come together in a package that includes a producer, a director and the star and serious money. He urges the aspiring screenwriter to write his story with the goal of making it an effective selling tool, a catalyst to getting a deal done. Otherwise the chances of the script actually seeing the projector light in the darkness of a movie theater are slim to none.And how to make the script an effective sales tool? First, says Epstein, it needs a great hook. A hook is the concept of the story in a nutshell that grabs attention and makes people want to know how it turns out. The marketing people come up with hooks called taglines to grab your attention when a movie is released. You need to come up with a hook to grab the attention of a Hollywood player to get the movie made.Quite bluntly, Epstein says, \\"If your story does not have a hook, you are probably wasting your time writing the screenplay.\\"So, how to come up with a hook? Epstein offers some suggestions, but like everything else in the creative process, there is no sure-fire formula. After the hook he discusses the title - \\"Your title is the most important phrase in your entire script\\", the pitch, the query letter. At the end of the book is a chapter on getting an agent, getting copyright protetion for your work plus two appendices, one a sample option deal, the other a sample of screenplay pages properly formatted.The bulk of the book is devoted to discussing the nuts and bolts of writing: plot, characters, action, dialogue, etc. Along the way he tilts at a few windmills; one section is titled \\"The Myth of the Three-Act Structure.\\"Does Epstein have any new gems of insight about them that haven't been revealed in a dozen other books? Not really, but if I had to recommend books on the particular topics of character, action and dialogue, this book would make my short list. Because he discusses the tried and true clearly and succintly with occasional twists of thought and turns of phrase that cast the tried and true in a new light in this reader's mind. And throughout his discussion, he never loses sight of the goal: punching up the script to make it a more marketable property. As the subtitle of the book says: \\"Writing Movies That Get Made\\" -- not just written.If you're interested in writing scripts as vessels in which to pour your heart, your soul, your unappreciated genius, the ultimate truth of being that only you comprehend -- this book isn't for you. But if you subscribe to the notion that screenwriting is a business as well as a craft, then this is a book you will profit from."},{"Title":"Crafty Screenwriting: Writing Movies That Get Made","review":"I'm an aspiring writer for movies. I ordered every book I could find. Crafty Screenwriting, was the only one I found as a tool. All the other books, jump around describing the pitfalls on using the tool.

I would highly suggest this book to anyone even remotely considering writing anything.Chris Smith"},{"Title":"Crafty Screenwriting: Writing Movies That Get Made","review":"Mr. Epstein has written the most practical screenwritng book I have ever read. And I\\"ve read all the so called 'top 15-20'. Plain language, to the point, no film school B.

A writer's job would be so much easier."},{"Title":"Crafty Screenwriting: Writing Movies That Get Made","review":"I think this is a fabulous book. I've done some professional script coverage and I've also read almost every book on screenwriting available. After reading Alex Epstein's &quot;Crafty Screenwriting,&quot; I couldn't help but wish that every writer of film or television scripts would heed his sound advice and avoid making the typical mistakes that annoy us readers and film fans. :-) The layout is straightforward and easy to navigate, his writing style accessible. It's just sensible advice and serves not only as a great introduction for a beginning writer, but also as a reminder to experienced writers who still lapse into some lazy writing behaviors at times. I highly recommend this book, no matter how many tomes you've read on the craft of writing. It's one I've now recommended to several friends."},{"Title":"Crafty Screenwriting: Writing Movies That Get Made","review":"Unlike some other how-to screenwriting authors out there, Epstein has the credits and the experience -- as a writer and a former development executive -- to back up his advice. As a reader, he knows what it's going to take to get past the seemingly impenetrable gates of Hollywood. As a writer, he knows how to approach screenwriting as something one does for a living -- a craft instead of an art (hence the dorky but appropriately suggestive title) -- without losing the joy of making up stories for a living.At the core of \\"Crafty Screenwriting\\" is the concept that unless you are connected (e.g., Nicole Kidman's favorite cousin), you're going to need a great HOOK to get your screenplay read by someone who might pay for it. A hook is the concept of the picture, briefly stated. \\"What if a fisherman caught a mermaid?\\", for example, is the hook for \\"Splash.\\" Although a good hook doesn't guarantee a good screenplay or a good film, it's the hook that's going to get your screenplay read. Epstein is such a firm believer in the importance of the hook that he has queried with nothing but a concept -- suggesting in his query letter that he already has the finished screenplay -- just to see how well the idea is received. Only then, after learning there is sufficient interest, does he sit down to write the piece. As strange as that sounds, \\"Crafty Screenwriting\\" thoughtfully and logically explains how useful that strategy might be.There's plenty of steak here beyond the sizzle of Epstein's marketing concepts, touching on plot, character, dialogue, and all the essential elements of screenplay storytelling. If \\"Crafty Screenwriting\\" sounds too commercial for your taste, think about why you write screenplays. If all you want to do is tell stories on paper, screenplays are the wrong medium. Other than aspiring screenwriters, who sits down to read a screenplay for fun? If you're writing screenplays, you're doing it with the hope of seeing one or more of them on the big screen. Epstein's book is loaded with great advice on how to get your work closer to that goal."},{"Title":"Crafty Screenwriting: Writing Movies That Get Made","review":"This book is one of the easiest reading how-to books I've seen.

He covers all the bases and sheds light on how tough the business is, how to expect rejection, and at the same time, not to give up or lose faith in a product you believe in. It's also nice to hear that rewrite, rewrite, rewrite is all a part of the brutal process. Just knowing that makes the hill climb a bit more palatable. This book should never be out of arms reach.

This book does not disappoint. The way Mark Graham melds actual history with a deep mystery is superb. This book is not for the faint of heart. If you really don't want to know what life was like in the late 1800's in Philedelphia, don't read this book. If you can't face the racism and rampant corruption in civic positions that occurred then, also don't read this book. This book is meant to make us feel uncomfortable in our complacency. This book has it all, racial tension, corruption, murder, phsycotic criminals, and even a little love mixed in. McCleary is a tough, but honest cop with a uniquely human and vulnerable side. He has to face his own demons as he deals with real-life ones. This is a great series.Some of the grammar and English is not of the highest order, but I found that I did not mind and the story helped me overlook this."},{"Title":"The Resurrectionist (Old Philadelphia Mystery Series)","review":"Some writers do a lot of research and then stop the story to show us how much they've learned.

The author vividly recreates the politics, corruption and racial tension of the 1870's, and the mystery he spins flows at a good pace. Philadelphia policeman Wilton McCleary, a Union veteren who survived the Andersonville prison camp, wrestles throughout the book with significant personal ethical issues - and Graham's framing of those issues - theological, racial, social and McClearly's own role in the corrupt Philadelphia police depatment - gives the character depth. I look forward to reading more of McCleary's struggles."},{"Title":"The Resurrectionist (Old Philadelphia Mystery Series)","review":"Wilton McCleary returns in a tale of corruption, vice and power set in the gaslight noir of late-19th Century Philadelphia. Those who followed Detective McCleary's first case in Mr. Graham's debut novel, THE KILLING BREED, will delight in reading about the case that earned Wilton his promotion to detective, while those meeting McCleary for the first time will want to read more about his career after the case of THE RESURRECTIONIST.In his second novel, Mr. Graham reintroduces Wilton McCleary by way of flashback, taking the reader back in time to McCleary's tenure as a beat cop on the Philadelphia Police force. During a mayoral election year rife with political intrigue and racial turmoil, McCleary takes the thankless job of investigating the murder of a black prostitute, and during the course of his investigation, becomes involved with an African American medical student. Stonewalled from the beginning by the police department and the bigotry of the Reconstruction Era, McCleary must fight hard against both to carry on his investigation and relationship. The price of winning, however, grows ever more costly as the stalwart Andersonville survivor unearths deep-rooted racism and a wealth of corruption whose evil has permeated the police department, the mayor's office and the medical establishment, and will attempt to pollute the heart of the woman he loves.THE RESURRECTIONIST firmly establishes Mr. Graham's reputation as an authentic recreator of late 19th Century Philadelphia, and creator of a bold, new brand of detective fiction. As in THE KILLING BREED, the pages of Mr. Graham's newest work take the reader on a sordid tour of Philadelphia's corrupt underworld, and still manage to capture the alluring charm of a by-gone era. McCleary's humane demeanor is juxtaposed against terse Chandler-like dialogue and description to create a well-paced mystery that reads in the tradition of hard-boiled fiction, but brings to the story a rich, realistic and literary sense of character aesthetic. Mr. Graham's characters, some as compelling as Beowulf, others as repellent as Dostoevski's Underground Man, propel the unfolding mystery at a steady pace, and hold the reader's attention long enough to complete the novel in one sitting. THE RESURRECTIONIST finds both Mr. Graham and Wilton McCleary in full form, and will prove an enjoyable read for mystery and literary connoisseurs alike.- S.D. PETERS"},{"Title":"The Resurrectionist (Old Philadelphia Mystery Series)","review":"After reading &quot;The Killing Breed&quot; starring Wilton McCleary a few months ago, I waited anxiously for the next installment and worried it would not match the first. I need not have worried. &quot;The Resurrectionist&quot; is one of the best historical mysteries I've ever read. I love period detail, especially when one gets the sense the detail is well researched and factual. Add into the mix a very human, moral, sensitive, somewhat tortured detective and his battle with his own conscience and emotions as well as the &quot;establishment&quot; and biases of the time, written so well that one feels that one is actually reading Wilton McCleary's diary. Perhaps my only complaint might be that the story ended. I suspect I'll read it again--and once more await the next installment with anticipation. I feel Mark Graham's work is worthy of hardcover and more notice--although I really don't mind paying paperback prices."},{"Title":"The Resurrectionist (Old Philadelphia Mystery Series)","review":"Mark Graham has done a great job with character development and historical research. I found this to be a fascinating look at racial/sexual politics during the post civil war era. It was a great read, but I was disappointed that the well rounded female lead was shown as stereotypically weak in the end."},{"Title":"The Resurrectionist (Old Philadelphia Mystery Series)","review":"I think Mark Graham is a terrific writer. His protagonist, Wilton McCleary, is an introspective policeman in 1871; a veteran of the Civil War with major issues, he is nonetheless a rather rare thing -- an uncorrupted representative of the law, often at odds with his fellow officers as much as his perpetrators, who are violent predators. These books aren't for those with a weak stomach, but they do have delightful philosophical opinings by our protagonist -- a rare treat in mystery fiction. Of the three books (The Killing Breed, The Resurrectionist and The Black Maria), I liked this one the least, but still enjoyed it enough to give it 5 stars, if for no other reason than that it informs the final book in the triad, which is terrific.Great historical mystery series."},{"Title":"Conversations With Neil's Brain.

Yet he did not despair or advocate \\"more government\\" as a solution. Rather, he argued compelling that the church must play a central role in restoring social order. Indeed, Rauschenbusch alleged that Christianity's future depended on its capacity to restore social harmony and to persuade businesses to feed the masses, not just cater to elites. Rauschenbusch extolled the value of community, \\"gemeinschaft, \\" and excoriated \\"gesellschaft, \\" an atomized, anonymous, individualistic society in which people are consumed by materialism and personal gain.Rauschenbusch envisioned a Christian ethic that pervaded the social and economic lives of Americans. He blended ancient Christian thought with the new tools of social science, in order to identify and solve the \\"social crisis,\\" arguing that \\"communism\\" (as he used the term) was fully consistent with Christianity. Rauschenbusch's burden was to show the people where, how, and why Christianity could help them.Rauschenbusch was a seventh generation Lutheran minister, whose father emigrated to American from Germany in the 1850s.

A new light on life. A little hard to imagine at times but a new way to look at things."},{"Title":"Beyond Reality: Evidence of Parallel Universes","review":"I bought this book 6 years ago, when I thought that it was a book containing science researching person's newest thinking, speculations, and facts, concerning the ideas about parallel universes. This which mostly either is the thinking about universes equal to our universe but being outside \\"the bobble\\" of our universe, or the speculation about parallel universes being at the same position as our universe. But after reading the book I was highly disappointed.I bought the book after in Amazon having looked into it, and among other seen mentioned Dr. Raymond Moody (whose books I previously had been reading with the highest interest), and besides in the start of each of the chapters seeing wise quotation from many well-known science persons.Ever since back in the 1960s, when I was teenager, I've have read many books and magazines about the universe, and by now owing 200 books concerning this. And as a parallel to this, even have been reading more books concerning for example, UFOs, aliens, ghosts, old cultures, philosophy, psychology, hypnosis, the brain, and so on.On side 21 starts the chapter 2, having the title \\"Several Types of Parallel Universes\\", and Kaehr, as she states, here tells about 4 types of universes. The writing is a mixture which makes the philosophy and thinking unclear. For the number 1 type of universe - being compared to sitting by a table without having the possibility to see the legs - is a mixture of 2 thinking. First when talking about no possibility to look trough the table it's the parallel to when we talk about what's outside the surface of \\"the bobble\\" of our universe. But then writing that we by us have our legs, which is part of us and thereby knowing the position, then it's the thinking witch come in the writing concerning the case number 3, where we are thinking on the new parallel worlds starting at each new changing action but still at the same position. And here we are thinking about having a parallel world where Hitler did not lose the war, and one where Genghis Khan is still a live, and a world where you are the states president, and so on. And in connection to this idea of worlds being at the same position we normal are thinking on the emptiness and room inside the atomsIn the case 2 she writes about, what I mentioned in the start, the worlds outside our \\"bobble\\", which we in many books se illustrated in drawings showing an endless number of balls swimming around in an endless vacuum. And where during all the time new bobbles, starts living and old dies and disappear.When she start writing about the case 4, from Max Tegman, and mention mathematic, I for example find the writing in P.W.Atkins book \\"The Creation\\", from 1981 (which I read I 1983), more speculative, clear, and interesting. Among other Atkins writers: \\"Maybe universes sometimes after the Big Bang starts living with only having the dimension 2 , and then through out the existence have no life on the planets. And then first after many Big Bangs starts to exist in the 3 dimensions, as our universe\\". Concerning these dimensions, we here only looked at the geometrical part, that is for the dimension 3 being: 1x, 1y, 1z. Where normally concerning our universe we are talking about 4 dimensions as we also are including time. But where science actually, for our universe, are talking about and calculating with the dimension 11 or 12.And in the same chapter the famous Heisenberg Uncertainly Principle is used to prove that parallel universes are a reality. Without doubt Heisenberg would be shaking his head if he was reading this. Because his law only tells us that the more precisely we are measuring a particles behavior (or other objects), the more we will be disturbing it and thereby getting more failure (more imprecise) in the result.But concerning the problem about without the use of time to get from one position to another, we by telepathy are talking about that it don't take time for messages to travel from brain to brains. As Newton thought that light didn't use time, but then Roemer later found it to be that light had the traveling speed of 180.000 km/sec, where we now knows that it's nearly 300.000 km/sec, (299,967.2. ....).To me much of the writing in the book is misleading. For example on the side 30 it's written that Stephen Hawking, who together with Roger Penrose came with the conclusion that universe are born by a Big Bang, and that now: \\"...he is currently working to disprove his own theory\\". So this should tell us that he no longer believes in the Big Bang? But then in the following text it's written that he now is thinking in parallel universes and not that the expansion will stop and then starts going back and finishing in a crunch, with every things ending in nearly nothing, or nothing. But in this there is more thinking, many ideas, as for example whether if there did not exist anything at all before the actual Big Bang, by which our universe came to existence. Or where Hoyle, he who 60 years ago came with the word Big Bang, for example was thinking in a constant existing universe which on the surface of the bobble is wearing out but at the same time, in the center, is reborn. But for Hawking the speculation problem is that we now know that our universe now is expanding with increasing speed, where we first was thinking, as for a canon ball or an explosion, that the speed vas slowing down the longer the particle have come from the starting point. But as by Atkins thinking we maybe have, and have had, physical different kind of universes, so maybe we previously have had other kind of universes, and that the our universe is the first on this place that don't end in a crunch. Beside, among other, we also knows that our universe have had different expansion speeds, as it shortly after the Big Bang suddenly, for at short time, started expanding with a speed being much higher than the speed of light. And where we always are talking about the speed of light being the maximum possibly speed, and fitting to Einstein's formula.So I don't think that Hawkins is trying to disprove his Big Bang theory, rather that he is making research to find out if there are some chances to make in the ideas and formulas. Just like when Einstein first made his famous formula, and in this had put in an appendage because at that time it was thought that the universe not was expanding. And when it then was discovered that the universe is expanding it only was to throw away this appendage, and the formula was still fine.In most of the book we are getting stories and experiences from person being in trance or during hypnoses, and their \\"visiting other universes\\". But I find it more correct when Moody for example writes that his experiences with the patients don't prove that we will be living again when we have died, as it only have been up to 10 minutes we have in cases where people have been declared dead and then waked up again. And then could tell what they had been seeing while they were \\"dead\\". And neither is Moody talking about parallel worlds from where the psychical sick Vietnam War soldiers, during hypnosis are having contacts with their dead soldier friends.And for example in one of the many hypnoses cases I during years have been reading, there is one with a women who during the hypnoses are talking about what she is seeing in a fair. And after having been waked up again it showed up that she newer with her own eyes had seen this fair, because that day when the fair came to the outside place where she later lived, she not yet was born. But it showed up that her mother visited this fair because at this outside place in USA, only once a year this fair came to the city, and her mother therefore went to it, even though she was highly pregnant. The next day she gave birth to the actual girl. So the mother to the women in trance had seen what se was telling about. So were the hypnosis women at the place she describe and tell about? And what is the different between this case and telepathy? So by all this we still don't have any proof on the existence of parallel worlds.Beside we for example also have the case concerning the famous escape artist Houdine. When he was living he with a close friend made the agreement stating which message that the person who first died after his dead should \\"deliver-make\\" to the other. So that the living person thereby would learn that there also was a life, in another world, after we have died in our world. Houdine died first, but his friend newer got any message.And as one more remark, parallel to the dreams, hypnosis, and so on, and thereby visiting other worlds, which I don't think actual is done. I by myself have tried something equal, but I don't think that I then left the Earth for a vacation. But back in 1974 I was involved in an accident by which I was blacked out and had fracture of the skull, so that I lost the hearing for one of the ears. One morning I waked up and recognized that I was lying in a hospital (for the 16th time after accidents and so on lying in hospital) and I then learned that I after an accident on a motorcycle now had been here for 12 days! But I also learned that I during these 12 days had been talking with the nurses, doctor and visiting friends. That is, talking as people normal do about every things. But I have newer from my brain, memory, in my now living got back what was going on during these 12 days of my life. So to me I then was in another world, even though I actually was at a particular position on out earth, and talking with people who at the same time was at the same point. So I can not have been in another world, even though it to me looks like I during these 12 days have been living another life in another world. But actual I newer left the earth, and the persons I talked with was here in our world. Sometimes people are speculating if schizophrenia actual are living in a parallel word.But if it comes to thinking about other worlds, I find it much more speculative to thing about Black Holes, and that maybe trough Black Holes we can get connection to \\"people\\" living in parallel worlds, first maybe by the use of radio, as some research persons are talking about.But again, to me this book is very misleading concerning today thinking about parallel worlds, and especially by claiming that we now know that parallel universes exist."},{"Title":"Beyond Reality: Evidence of Parallel Universes","review":"This book is a piece of literary trash.

I had to read another book (Aquinas for Armchair Theologians) to find out why.Strathern is less interested in revealing Aquinas' philosophy than in reviling his theology. Strathern outlines Aquinas' life, discusses Aquinas' philosophical errors, and ridicules Aquinas' theology. Along the way, he succeeds in ignoring almost every important contribution Aquinas made to the history of Western thought. E.g., Aquinas' profound effect on the thought of Martin Luther King, Jr., helped shape the American Civil Rights movement. But why write about that when you can lampoon Aquinas for making philosophical arguments in support of Christianity?In the last paragraph of his afterword Strathern celebrates Descartes' dictum \\"cogito ergo sum\\" because with it, modern philosophy had begun and the cobwebs of Aquinas' teachings were \\"swept away forever.\\" A reading of Descartes' \\"Discourse on Method\\" reveals that Descartes reasoned from \\"cogito ergo sum\\" to the existence of God. Far from \\"sweeping away\\" Aquinas' cobwebs, Descartes seems to be very much entangled in them. The belief that reason could provide a pathway to God was not original to Descartes, Aquinas thought of it a few centuries before Descartes' time. There are still enough of Aquinas' cobwebs around for Martin Luther King, Jr., to have quoted Aquinas in his \\"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\\" and for George Bush, Sr., to have patterned his speech justifying Desert Storm after Aquinas' model for the just war.Almost everything about modern thought is influenced by Thomas Aquinas, from Greenpeace to the World Court.

I had just finished G.K. Chesterton's book on Aquinas. Chesterton is a marvelous writer, but being a devout Catholic, he assumed the reader would know Aquinas' philosophy. I picked up this book to learn more. I didn't. Strathern constantly sacrificed his point for the sake of cruel witticisms. Other than a bit of history about Aquinas' life, I came away with the impression that Strathern: (a) considers Catholics beneath contempt: (b) believes the people of Medieval times have nothing to say to us (c) is so embittered toward Christianity that he can scarcely bear to credit it with any good. More than anything, this book irritated me because it never gives the basic points of Aquinas' philosophy. Even when granting Aquinas' intellect reluctant praise, Strathern doesn't elaborate on why Thomas was brilliant. I agree with the other reviewer who wondered if Strathern had even read Thomas Aquinas. If all the books in the series are this bad, I won't waste my time."},{"Title":"Thomas Aquinas in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes)","review":"This book is very readable, occasionally witty, and author Paul Strathern sometimes makes interesting philosophical comments. But the humor often borders on ridicule (at one point he says that anyone who doubts the veracity of Thomas' theology, &quot;courts instant excommunication and the prospect of an afterlife in a third-world-style region devoid of modern domestic conveniences&quot;, p.8). Also, the contemporary significance of medieval philosophy in general and that of Thomas in particular escapes Strathern. He makes the outrageous claim, for instance, that the SUMMA THEOLOGICA, &quot;attracts virtually no interest today, except among Catholics, who have to study it because it contains the truth about philosophy&quot; (p. 62)(this, incidently, is another example of Strathern's humor as borderline ridicule). The SUMMA today attracts considerable genuine attention, not only from Catholics, but from many non-Catholic philosophers as well. Strathern's book is peppered with other highly questionable claims about the value of Thomas' philosophy. Sometimes, however, Strathern mentions the positive significance of Thomas for the advancement of philosophy and theology, but over all, he does not seem to understand the depth of that significance.

Aquinas had a major role in Catholic history as well as in philosophy. He also is an interesting person. For one thing, he had a fascinating mystical experience near the end of his life, after which he lost all interest in philosophy.

And the fanciful illustrations that always accompany her work, done by Hugh Gray Lieber, are amusing and informative.Infinity: Beyond the Beyond the Beyond presents an account of how mathematics has learned to deal with the infinite, primarily through the work of Georg Cantor. Controversial at first, Cantor's set theory and transfinite arithmetic are now part of the foundations of modern mathematics. Perhaps the most startling idea to be had from this book is that infinite sets are not all the same size.I have before me a copy of the 1953 original, as well as the 2007 abridgement. Aside from the fact that the older book is a hardcover, the abridgement is the better book. The editor, Barry Mazur, a mathematician at Harvard, has removed the dated, nonmathematical introductory material and the chapters on calculus. This book is now a superb layman's guide to the mathematics of transfinities.If you would like more biography and less mathematics, you might tryThe Mystery of the Aleph: Mathematics, the Kabbalah, and the Search for Infinity, by Amir D.

Dauben, Scientific American, June 1983; and \\"Non-Cantorian Set Theory,\\" by Paul J. Cohen and Reuben Hersh, Scientific American, December 1967.Note: In 1900, David Hilbert put forth a list of the 23 most important unsolved problems in mathematics. At the head of the list was Cantor's continuum hypothesis. The problem was still open when the Liebers wrote their book. In 1963, Stanford University mathematician Paul Cohen, extending work of Kurt Godel, proved that the continuum hypothesis is actually independent of the generally accepted axioms of set theory, and earned the Fields medal for it."},{"Title":"Infinity: Beyond the Beyond the Beyond (Illustrated)","review":"This is a great book.

It is clear that Kim uses poetry simply as a vehicle to convey his religious bigotry and unpleasent political views. I would steer well clear of this one."},{"Title":"Going the Distance: A Poetry Collection","review":"This book of poems is powerful and moving because it combines emotional themes -- like love and 9/11. I purchased this book because of the new movie that's coming out on 9/11. I had forgotten how I felt after 9/11. This book brought memories of my feelings back. I like the fact that the poet combined poems of love with poems of reflection about 9/11. That's like life. It's never monolithic."},{"Title":"Going the Distance: A Poetry Collection","review":"This book is simply incredible. It captures the hopes and fears of Americans post-9/11. You can experience what Americans experienced. You can dive into the thinking of many Americans. What's more, this book contain love poems that are wonderful. It shows that despite the tragedies that assailed Americans, Americans urged on. I understand the poet as including love poems alongside 9/11 poems in this vein. And that's how many Americans were. Americans were saddened but were strong as well. Love poems in this book can be shared with loved ones. As the focus is on love across wide distances, those having long-distance relationships may particularly like them."},{"Title":"Going the Distance: A Poetry Collection","review":"This collection of poems written by Kim is a complete joke. I find it amazing that one could have the audacity to write such rubbish and publish it as poetry. I've read many of the poems and found them to consist of little more than a few poorly constructed sentences. I often found the material very confusing e.g. In one poem he talks about the responsibility of the Islamic terrorists for 9/11 and then goes on to say that the Jews were responsible.Kim's work comes across as 'amateurish'. Given the amazing lack of quality, I can only assume that the book was not edited and the author simply published it himself.I concur with most of the other reviewers, who say that the content of some poems could cause offence to readers, especially those who were affected by 9/11.This book consists of little more than a series of inane rants from an embittered old man - please avoid."},{"Title":"Going the Distance: A Poetry Collection","review":"If one looks past the author's unpleasant politics and his paranoid hatred of Jews, one finds simply the worst poetry imaginable.

The attempted use of metaphors failed in every respect and the language used was no better than that of a five year old child.

I was sadly let down by the thinly veiled messages encouraging vengence and violence. Some of the poems portrayed the view that the Jews were in some way responsible for 9/11. This idea is highly offensive to both Christians (my faith) and Jews; we all know who was responsible for these atrocities - Osama Bin Ladin and his evil terrorist organisation Al Queda, who seek to achieve Islamic domination of the world by coercion and brute force.The standard of poetry was of the lowest order i.e. it would not look out of place in a kindergarten run by religious extremists.Avoid these poems at all costs as they are likely to cause a great deal of offense, especially if you knew someone who was killed on 9/11. There are plenty of good poetry books giving hope to the sufferers of 9/11 and this is certainly not one of them."},{"Title":"Going the Distance: A Poetry Collection","review":"This is the worst poetry I've ever read. Kim seems not to have a clue about what good poetry entails. The style of writing is monotonous, rather like that of a boring old man, who rants and raves about inane topics. The poems are awkward to read in that they do not flow well. I found some of the content nonsensical e.g. one of the poems suggested that the Jews were responsible for 9/11. We all know that it was Muslim fundamentalists lead by Osama Bin Laden, who carried out the atrocities of 9/11. The quality of the poetry is so low that unless you are looking for a joke birthday present for someone, I wouldn't purchase this book."},{"Title":"Going the Distance: A Poetry Collection","review":"Having purchased and read these so-called poems, I must say that this is the worst poetry I've ever read. The style of writing was more akin to what you would see in a badly written tabloid editorial section e.g. would you call this poetry?\\"After much consideration, we (Al Queda) attackedNot because we wanted to kill innocent peopleThe innocent are the ones we want to protectHaving made mistake in the region in the pastRaises questions, but not against our right to defend ourselvesAnother American will die tomorrow because of anthrax.\\"Given that this book was written with aim of comforting and guiding the sufferers of 9/11, I think the aforementioned example would cause great offence. The message contained within the passage suggests that Al Queda were not interested in killing innocent people. I think most readers would agree that the hijackers, who flew the planes into the twin towers and the Pentagon knew that they would kill many innocent people. The last three lines in the example are rather confused. Is he talking about Al Queda or America?This example is typical of the poetry throughout the book. Most readers will find confusing and contradictory messages, which could be offensive. These poems are best avoided."},{"Title":"Going the Distance: A Poetry Collection","review":"I was really let down by these poems. The poems had some rather nasty political undertones e.g. some of the poems seem to suggest that the blame for the 9/11 atrocities lay with the Jews. Anti-Semitism seems to be prevalent in Kim's poetry and this book is no different. Whilst I find the attitude of some Orthodox Jews annoying, I don't believe that Kim's poetry is going to make them change their ways etc. Kim has a propensity for drawing conclusions based on circumstantial evidence. A few of Kim's poems are contradictory and contain mixed messages.The standard of the poetry is rather low and I believe that Kim maybe an amateur poet just starting out on his writing career. If this is the standard to be expected from his work, I hold out very little hope for his career as a writer."},{"Title":"Going the Distance: A Poetry Collection","review":"This is one of the worst poetry books I've ever read. I was stunned by the ineptitude of the author in writing these poems.As I started to read the poems, I found myself becoming increasingly frustrated.

The author, Kim, appears to be clueless when it comes to selecting the ingredients required for good poetry.I concur with the other reviewers, who condemn the vile political views portrayed by Kim's poems. I would say that most readers would find it difficult not to be offended by them however extreme their views may be.This collection of poems can be summed up as a pile of rubbish."},{"Title":"Going the Distance: A Poetry Collection","review":"'Going the Distance' is an appalling collection of poems. The poetry reads as if a mentally deficient individual wrote it. The 'hidden' political messages portrayed by these poems are the most unpleasant imaginable.A common theme is the idea that the Jews were in someway responsible for the 9/11 atrocities. This recurrent suggestion is absolute nonsense and most readers will find it offensive, as they know that it was Islamic fundamentalist who carried out the attacks.Some of the poems seek to inspire the American people to take revenge by using weapons of mass destruction against Israel and the 'axis of evil'. Whilst most Americans will agree that it is important to strike back at those states responsible for harbouring the 9/11 terrorists i.e. the axis of evil, I don't think they would be too happy at using nuclear weapons against Israel, a nation that is one of America's strongest allies in the war on terror.This book certainly gives a distorted view of 9/11 and how people in America feel about this appalling tragedy. I feel this is one of many books in Kim's crusade to convert the world to Evangelical Christianity."},{"Title":"Going the Distance: A Poetry Collection","review":"When I started to read through the poems, I was struck by how poorly written they were. I was amazed at how the author could get such material published as poetry.The most abhorrent aspect of these poems was the conveyance of unsavoury political views e.g. the idea that the Jews were responsible for 9/11. Some of the poems condoned the actions of the 9/11 hijackers and tried to convince the reader that the recriminations lie with Israel. This view is likely to offend most of the readership, be they Christian, Jewish or Muslim.I concur with most of the reviewers on this website, who say that the poetry was dull and uninspiring. Furthermore, I would say that the quality of English was so low that many of the poems failed to make sense. There were a large number of instances where Kim contradicts himself resulting in the reader becoming incredulous as to what his point is.The author clearly has a lot to learn when it comes to writing poetry; perhaps he should give up and concentrate on his Ph.

Some of the messages conveyed within these poems were deeply disturbing i.e. they emphasised the need for revenge. A few of the poems represented the extreme minority anti-Semitic view that the Jews were responsible for the 9/11 tragedy (due to their policies regarding Palestine). I was disappointed that so few of the poems contained messages stating the need for peace and the avoidance of brute force in sorting out disputes.I would advise readers to avoid this book because many of the poems may cause offence."},{"Title":"Going the Distance: A Poetry Collection","review":"I like Kim as a poet and try to read all of his poems.

A poetic reflection on Kim's anti-Semitism and support for Islamic extremism.A new theory for the cause of 9/11 has arisen. It is thought that Christian Kim colluded with Osama Bin Laden in the planning and preparation of 9/11. When one considers Kim's bitter resentment of the Jews, one can see why he would want to help Osama out. Kim has spoken out against the apparent growth of Jewish power in America and the potential for an Islamic backlash. It is thought that Kim was becoming more and more frustrated given that his vast array of anti-Semitic books were not doing enough to incite Muslims to attack America. One can 'reasonably' envisage Christian collaborating with Osama Bin Laden to ensure that an attack takes place. It is possible that Kim hoped for political change as a result of the 9/11 attacks. Kim may have felt that America would change its policy towards Israel and the Middle East, and start a program of deportation and repatriation for Jews living in the U.S.The above conspiracy theory is almost as ridiculous as the one given by Christian Kim in one of his poems i.e. Jews were responsible for 9/11.I advise all prospective readers' to avoid this silly and potentially offensive book."},{"Title":"Going the Distance: A Poetry Collection","review":"This has got to be the worst poetry book I've ever read.

I feel this book, written by Kim, is a typical American colonialist response to the tragedy of 9/11. The 9/11 attacks are a direct consequence of the colonialist policies of the United States.

This theory for the causation of these attacks is totally asinine because all the evidence points to radical Islamic terror groups e.g. Al Queda. It appears to me that the author is trying to justify the persecution of a group of people, namely the Jews, by making frivolous and vexatious claims against them.

Through his poems Kim seeks to inflame tensions and encourage acts of vengeance such as the 'carpet bombing' of civilian areas of Afghanistan. It is clear from these poems that Kim supports the idea of American domination of the world. American colonialism really is terrible in every aspect. The Americans use highly influential natives in their colonies e.g. Iraqi administration to control the local population while they plunder the local resources such as oil. They used the frivolous and vexatious claim that Iraq was harbouring weapons of mass destruction to justify an illegal invasion, where tens of thousands of innocent civilians were murdered. American soldiers have been known to rape the local women (Vietnam) and torture the non-combatant males on the pretence that they are working as enemy agents.

It is also an examinination of the social interactions of the upper class on a Carribean resort island but isn't really done as well as Ian Fleming who set several early Bond adventures there.

It's physically based in the traditions of Niven, Asimov, or even Walter Jon William's recent (excellent) Praxis series. This is not surprising considering the educational backgrounds of the authors (one works as a plasma phycisist and the other is clearly well-grounded).The game system is streamlined to the point where the only roll the players will be making is the 1d100 check. This is used for skill success, to-hit, damage (with a positive modifier for weapon type), starship combat, etc. It's fast, simple, and uniform. Bravo.Characters are generated with a life-path system that takes you through one year at a time and gives either a roll on the appropriate skill table or, if the non-random construction rules are in use, lets you choose which skill you acquired from your exploits. In practice this is designed to give you a sense of familiarity with your character before using him or her in actual play.StarCluster is rich with \\"arcana\\"--the 'stuff' that exists in the SC universe. There are dozens of weapons from varying levels of technology, several starships (with deck plans--and good ones!), and a variety of psionic abilities, alien races, and potential backgrounds to choose from. The universe itself is also nicely laid out: a good deal is defined (to give you traction on the universe) and a lot is left wide open.StarCluster's combat is moderately abstract (a combat turn may have many 'actions' in it that are not spelled out) and, despite the high-tech trappings, not all that lethal (this is not hard to adjust if you want a high death-rate game, however). There is essentially a roll for initative (modified by some simple strategic decisions), a roll to hit, and a roll for damage. In practice it plays as fast as players can roll their dice while leaving the door open for some decision making. I wouldn't suggest it for people who play extensively with minatures--on the other hand, if you, for example, play online, the only thing that's faster is a single roll for the entire combat (or some similar extremely-abstract method).There's a lot of 'cool' in StarCluster. One place it really shines (in my opinion) is the art-work. Clash (the primary author) is an excellent painter and has an amazing feel for the 'look' of the universe. It's ever-so-slightly retro while still being firmly real and plenty futuristic. It's hard to explain but I think he's done a great job.The game also has a ton of support, mostly as inexpensive but well puttogether PDF's available from the main site. Additionally, the StarCluster rules-set is Flyingmice's 'house system.' A version of it is used for other games (from the horror book Blood Games to some other RPG's that are set in the StarCluster universe but at a generally lower level of technology). If you like it, it'll give you an excellent doorway into those books as well!-M.[Disclosure: I have never met or spoken with the author although we have discussed roleplaying and StarCluster over IRC and the Internet. ]"},{"Title":"StarCluster 2E RPG","review":"StarCluster2 (from here on \\"SC2\\")is a Sci-Fi RPG with a great concept and setting. The book though is heavily flawed in it's layout and explanation of rules.The basic concept of SC2 is that the people of Earth find out that the world will be destroyed in 300 years. Then the mad rush to get everyone out begins by transporting people in sub-light ships to the cluster. The problem is that the ships are so slow that they actually have less than 300 years to evacuate and get out to the area of destruction. They then begin to send on the younger people because the elderly will die of old age long before they can get to the cluster.Once they arrive in the cluster and begin to settle the area they come in contact with other humanoid races. It turns out that these \\"aliens\\" are actually humans that were taken form earth and moved to the cluster by a highly advanced alien race so long ago that they have evolved. while they resemble human they have mutation that have helped them adapt to their new home.The cluster also has true aliens that pose threats and others like the Guaru who are allies to humankind.While i like the setting and the basic premise of SC2, I should also comment on it's short fallings.First the layout is not good. The section on character creation that contains all the tables with the education paths and careers wastes space. If the tables were more tightly formatted and empty spaces not left on the lower parts of the page, the book would have a lower page count or contain more setting info (SC2s strength). Overall could be more space efficient and leave less \\"open\\" spaces.Second the while the system is playable(if you like the BRP system for CoC you will like this) it is not very well explained. Even and a player who has played a lot of RPGs might have some difficulties understanding the rules as written. The biggest problem is the fact that there is no place in the book that actually tells you in plain english how to resolve an attack or how armor is used.Overall well worth a look for the setting info and overall good concept.

Phillip Keller","review":"Animal lovers will enjoy Lass, a gentle tale of how one rancher learned more about God through his sheepdog. Based on Phillip Keller's bestselling, biographical Lessons from a Sheepdog, the picture book by Roland Gebauer begins with Keller deciding he's going to raise sheep. In his search for a good sheepdog, he comes across a border collie named Lassie who is angry and vicious. Although she seems a strange choice, Keller is drawn to her. He thinks the dog just needs a second chance. And with a new chance comes a new name: Lass.At first, Lass growls and runs away from Keller, but slowly, he gains the dog's trust. Soon she's an excellent sheep dog and companion. Along the way, both Lass and Keller learn lessons. For example, one day Lass leaves the sheep and chases some crows.\\"Lass always knew when Mr. Keller was disappointed. She felt guilty for her bad behavior and hung her head in shame as he scolded her for disobeying. Mr. Keller didn't enjoy disciplining Lass. It was a difficult time for both of them, but it had to be done. Lass had to be corrected so that next time she would remember to stay with the sheep.\\"Later, after Keller sends Lass on a particularly difficult task, he wonders:\\"Am I willing to go where the Lord send me, no matter how hard it seems? Am I as happy and eager to obey God's commands as Lass is to carry out mine?\\"The last two pages of the book offer discussion questions for children and their parents or teachersWhat I Like: The illustrations by Cheri Bladholm are exquisite - loose and expressionistic, in rich tones. The story itself is well told, too, and although the lessons Keller learned from Lass are clear to readers, the book isn't preachy or boring. My 5 year old loves this story, and so do I.What I Dislike: Nothing.

The state of one's health is deeply affected by the state of one's glands because the nerve-gland areas in the body are also centers of vital mind powers.How one uses the mind powers located in the gland-nerve areas affects one's health for the worse or the better. And this book was published in 1967, long before the \\"chakras\\" became so popular! Occult philosophy has long recognised that there are seven mind powers located in seven vital nerve centers (the chakras). These 12 powers discussed by Cathereine Ponder simply embrace and expand these 7 natural powers into 12 divinely mental powers, making them easier to understand and use.The 12 healing forces discussed are those of Faith, Strength, Judgement, Love, Power,Imaging, Understanding, Will, Order, Zeal, Elimination and Eternal Life and many healing affirmations are provided for each.

Volume 9 (Full Metal Panic! (Novels)) (v. 9)","review":"This is the final volume in the Full Metal Panic manga which brings it right up to the point where the first anime ended. Gauron has gained control of the Danaan and holds Tessa and Chidori's lives in his clutches. One false move and he won't hesitate to kill them. While Gauron knows that both of the girls are \\"Whispered\\" he has no idea that they can communicate telepathically. The girls hatch a desperate plan to take back control of the ship. Meanwhile, the Danaan's crew are virtual prisoners, locked by Gauron in the hangar, and he's thinking about cutting off their oxygen! Only Sousuke and Kurtz have gotten out and set out to rescue Tessa and Chidori, but they'll have to contend with some of the crew that turned traitor and now serve Gauron.If you've already seen the Full Metal Panic anime series, there's really nothing new here. But that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of seeing a different interpretation of the same material. Retsu Tateo's art is spot-on and she has handled the mix of humor and action quite elegantly throughout the entire series. Most of volume 9 is missing comedy but the artist does a good job of conveying the energy and suspense leading up to the final battle between Sosuke and Gauron. The manga does a better job of conveying the affection between Sosuke and Chidori than the anime did. I'm sad to see this series end."},{"Title":"Full Metal Panic! Volume 9 (Full Metal Panic!

At the end of book 8, Kaname, worried about Sosuke as he returned from a mission, was verbally rebuffed by him and fled, crying, making her examine her purpose on board the TDD. As she flees, she runs into Guaron and two traitors, who hold her hostage and then take over the TDD in book 9!Gauron, to assert his power, reprograms the computer to listen only to him, and then commences an attack on an innocent battleship nearby, but only after setting up a false Fire Drill to isolate most of the crew. Sosuke, feeling as though something is wrong, and realizing that he had been harsh to Chidori, defies direct orders and joins Kurz in a mission to save the ship and Kamane, who is just as determine not to \\"be annoying\\" and to save herself. Then Tessa plays her hand to rescue the day and her crew, but it is Kaname that saves everybody at the end (not spoiling it!).

G. A. Cohen's political philosophy, for instance, is immensely useful for challenging the ethical dimensions of bourgeois ideology, as well as for envisioning how a just society might be organized. And though I found John Roemer's \\"coupon socialism\\" proposal utterly ridiculous upon learning of it years ago, I had heard that other members of the September Group were proponents of worker controlled variants of market socialism, and even democratic economic planning. So I had anticipated Alternatives to Capitalism to consist of concrete proposals for transitioning away from capitalism and toward a socialist mode of production. Instead, I was presented with policies which, for the most part, do virtually nothing to alter the manner by which goods and services are produced and distributed in society.The first section of the book, erroneously titled \\"Alternatives,\\" consists of several essays on economic theory. Gy&ouml;rgy Szir&aacute;czki opens this section with an essay analyzing semiprivate, quasi self-managing entities - which were being experimented with in the People's Republic of Hungary - known as \\"internal subcontracting enterprises.\\" Simply put, they were \\"independent work-groups [operating] inside state-owned firms on a subcontract basis\\" (p. 40). Aside from explaining the history of their development and efficiency strengths, Szir&aacute;czki endorsed their further utilization. Not very inspiring or useful in today's context, to say the least.The following essay was authored by Martin L. Weitzman, and it is a concise description of an economic model he has been promoting for decades called \\"profit-sharing capitalism.\\" Weitzman contends that if workers were to \\"receive a significant portion of their pay in the form of a profit-sharing bonus\\" full employment without inflation would be attainable (p. 69). This is so because \\"A profit-sharing system makes the marginal value of an extra worker exceed the marginal cost of hiring that worker,\\" thereby ensuring that the system \\"gravitate(s) towards an equilibrium with excess demand for labor\\" (p. 65). Weitzman dismisses the potential of labor-managed firms in his scheme due to his skepticism regarding their operational viability and potential to facilitate technological dynamism, and their alleged inability to produce full employment - all of which are inaccurate and adequately addressed in the theoretical literature on market socialism (I recommend David Schweickart'sCapitalism or Worker Control?: An Ethical and Economic Appraisalto those interested in the subject.) Overall, Weitzman's proposal is interesting, but certainly not an alternative to capitalism.Like the aforementioned Szir&aacute;czki essay, Tam&aacute;s Bauer's essay (\\"The Unclearing Market\\") also concerns the Hungarian socialist economy; specifically the difficulties it was experiencing in its market reforms. He targets bureaucratic interference and inefficiency as the cause and suggests privatizations and further market reforms as the remedy. Why this essay was deemed worthy of inclusion by Elster and Moene is, quite frankly, beyond me. That is not to suggest that Bauer's views were without merit, but rather that they are not germane to the subject of alternatives to capitalism. (Interestingly, opinion polls conducted in Hungary continue to indicate that \\"80% of those 50 years of age or older consider the time before the change of regime happier,\\" while \\"Nearly 75% of those aged 40-49, and 55% of those who were students and young adults during the late 1980s concur.\\" See P&aacute;l Tam&aacute;s's research for more on this phenomenon.)Karl Ove Moene's essay, in my opinion, is the most interesting economic analysis featured in the book. In it, he compares market socialism with a form of capitalism dominated by \\"strong unions\\" - an endangered species at this point, but still somewhat prominent in certain industries at the time of the book's publication (1989). Moene argues that \\"worker influence exerted through pressure and threats,\\" as observed in trade unions, \\"may lead to perverse outcomes.\\" This is obviously true, since workers within capitalist enterprises have an incentive to work the least amount possible while demanding the most they can bargain for in the wage-for-labor-time contract. Unions, granting greater power to labor in wage negotiations and organizing shopfloor policy, can be expected to perform less productively than their cooperative counterparts; the reason being that the incentive structure of labor-managed firms are the exact inverse of capitalist enterprises, since workers are the firm's residual claimants. Unionized capitalist firms also invest significantly less in capital relative to labor-managed firms because \\"each increment of capital will increase the wage payment to the union later on\\" (p. 91).Moene further provides a thorough refutation of Benjamin Ward's famous critique of labor-managed firms featured in his 1957 paper, \\"The Firm in Illyria: Market Syndicalism\\" (American Economic Review, Vol. 48, pp. 566-589). Ward had argued that labor-managed firms are faced with a perverse short-run supply curve, resulting in \\"the optimal number of members in the coop [decreasing] and the firm's supply decreas[ing] the higher the output price\\" (p. 86). In practice, however, this does not occur because it violates the basic cooperative principles which labor-managed firms are organized around. \\"It can be shown that when the coop practices the principle of equal treatment in either an ex ante or ex post way, no one will vote for reductions in membership when faced with higher output prices,\\" writes Moene (ibid). Thus a perverse short-term output supply curve poses no threat to a worker controlled economy. Nevertheless, there are factors which limit the growth dynamic of labor-managed firms. For example, there are diminished returns to scale in worker cooperatives - since any increases in profit achieved therein would simply have to be shared among more members - therefore placing is a definite limit on their growth potential. This would imply that companies in a socialist market economy would be relatively smaller than capitalist corporations currently are, and full employment would require government intervention (e.g., by implementing a policy whereby the state serves as the employer of last resort). But if full employment could be reached, a market socialist economy would be less prone to recession than capitalist market economies are because \\"a small drop in demand\\" would not \\"lead to increased unemployment,\\" since labor-managed firms are more flexible under volatile economic conditions - the exemplary manner by which the Mondrag&oacute;n Cooperative Corporation (the world's largest and most successful cooperative network) has managed to maintain remarkably high levels of employment throughout this economic crisis is an empirical validation of this.Alec Nove, renowned economic historian of the Soviet Union and market socialist theorist, spends a significant portion of his contribution to the book refuting the market fundamentalism overtaking British politics during the Thatcher administration - and his criticism of laissez-faire mythology remains as timely as ever. \\"[M]arkets and automatic economic forces cannot solve all problems,\\" Nove proclaims at the start of the essay (p. 99). He goes on to list a variety of industries which, in his opinion, undoubtedly warrant central economic planning and price controls - e.g., electricity, oil, gasoline, and coal - due to their being natural monopolies. He also defended, contra Thatcher, maintaining public ownership of Britain's social services circa 1989 (health care, council housing, transportation, etc.); the reason being that their efficiency (or lack thereof) was unrelated to their ownership structure, and they were/are vital for reasons of societal welfare regardless (pp. 102-103). Like most market socialists, Nove also suggested that a system of public banking replace capitalist financial markets and that workers' control of the means of production be expanded to the greatest extent possible - though he expressed some reservations with respect to whether workers would be genuinely interested or content in participating in management (p. 103). (Most studies conducted on workers' self-management, however, indicate that there is a positive correlation between managerial participation and overall job satisfaction.) Perhaps suffering from a lack of imagination or class bias, Nove denied the possibility of a feasible model of comprehensive economic planning which failed to include a technocratic elite at the helm ever being designed - just as he did in his earlier work,The Economics of Feasible Socialism. With that exception, his chapter was quite valuable.Following Nove is the second section of the book, entitled \\"Criteria,\\" which features essays on political philosophy from G. A. Cohen, Jon Elster, and John Roemer. For me, this was the book's redeeming aspect. Cohen's chapter, \\"Are Freedom and Equality Compatible\\", is a critical analysis of Robert Nozick's critique of socialism and defense of libertarianism (more appropriately referred to as 'propertarianism') on the basis of self-ownership. Propertarians like Nozick believe that unequal economic outcomes and private property logically follow from an acceptance of this theory, but Cohen demonstrates that what the Right generally considers \\"freedom\\" - broadly defined as meaning that an individual is the \\"morally rightful owner of himself, even if the existing legal systems do not fully acknowledge that fact\\" (pp. 113-114) - is not at all incompatible with socialist egalitarianism. \\"Self-ownership is, contrary to what Nozick says, compatible with equality of external resource distribution, since the inequality that Nozick defends depends on adjoining to self-ownership an inegalitarian principle of external resource distribution, which need not be accepted. When instead, self-ownership is combined with joint ownership of the world its tendency to generate inequality is removed\\" (p. 124).Jon Elster's essay defends a ideal featured in Karl Marx's early philosophical writings known as \\"self-realization\\" - which simply means \\"the full and free actualization and externalization of the powers and the abilities of the individual\\" (p. 131). It is a very Aristotelian concept, and one which is central to most socialist theories of distributive justice. Elster counterposes self-realization with the standard bourgeois concept of the good life consisting solely of possessive individualism (i.e., consumption), and provides persuasive arguments for believing the former maximizes welfare to a greater extent than the latter. The purpose of consumption, Elster explains, is to \\"derive satisfaction\\" (as in reading a book, eating a meal, etc.), whereas the purpose of self-realization is to \\"achieve something, and satisfaction is supervenient upon the achievement rather than being the immediate purpose of the activity\\" (p. 130). Using the Solomon-Corbit theory of 'opponent process,' Elster then juxtaposes consumption with self-realization and proceeds to show that \\"Any given consumption episode. . . . has the pattern that it is initially pleasurable, but includes painful withdrawal symptoms once the activity ceases.\\" \\"The pleasure of consumption\\" therefore \\"tend(s) to become jaded over time, while the withdrawal becomes increasingly more severe.\\" Self-realization, on the other hand, produces the converse effect: \\"the attractions of self-realization increase over time, as the start-up costs diminish and the gratification from achievement becomes more profound\\" (pp. 134-135). Elster goes on to reject the marginalist approach to the utility of work because \\"work tasks are not made up of homogenous bits, but have a complex temporal structure\\" (p. 143). In addition to discussing methods whereby work life can be utilized for advancing self-realization, Elster also considers political participation to be another promising avenue for achieving the same goal, arguing \\"The development of moral competence through rational discussion is a form of self-realization that ought to be valued as highly as self-realization at the workplace\\" (p. 147). According to Elster, this applies equally to economic democracy, but warns of the possible hazards which lie in allowing any democratic institution to \\"degenerate into activist rule,\\" which results in individuals becoming mere means in other peoples' self-realization. To defend against this possibility, Elster suggests implementing a system whereby democratic processes are automatically \\"transformed from direct to representative. . . . when the level of participation drops below a certain level\\" (p. 154). It is clearly a thought-provoking essay and a well-argued defense of Marx's conception of the good life.John Roemer concludes the book with a discussion of private and public ownership, analyzing the welfare implications of each and finding the former difficult to reconcile with egalitarian principles (not surprising).In closing, I was both disappointed and pleasantly surprised with this book. Disappointed because the title and introductory chapter led me to believe that this work would focus more on legitimate alternatives to capitalism, but surprised by the caliber of its philosophical essays. With that said, the book would have significantly benefited from including contributions by the leading theoreticians of socialism today, e.g., Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel (who designed participatory economics), W. Paul Cockshott and Allin F. Cottrell (who advocate cybernetic economic planning), and David Schweickart (an important market socialist theorist) - all of whom were publishing work on socialism in 1989. Consequently, I have chosen to deduct two stars from my rating."},{"Title":"Assessment in Early Childhood Settings: Learning Stories","review":"The powerfulness of this book, I believe, comes from its strong theoretical grounding in good quality Early Childhood research. At the same time it is very accessible to parents, teachers and caregivers working in Early Childhood. Lots of examples of children's, teachers' and parents' voices are given, clarifying and expanding on the discussion making it very readable and enjoyable. Although primarily about assessment, this book has made me reflect also on my assumptions and beliefs about children's learning. It presents a very powerful view of the role and methods of credit-based assessment in learning."},{"Title":"Assessment in Early Childhood Settings: Learning Stories","review":"I purchased this book for my daughter who is in the Early Education and Child Care Program in University.

The setting and the caracteres are a chiche of the most basic nature. The plot can be predicted from the third page. The publisher Villegas editores must have been desperate to have a new tittle to their collection and selected the first envelope that arrived on the mail that day or it was having a christmas party and the phamplet was selected from a raffle."},{"Title":"New Spaces, Old World Charm (Elements of Living)","review":"My wife and I are in the process of redecorating our house and a friend slipped this gem under our Christmas tree and thank god he did. Let me say we are using Ms Sample indirectly to redecorate our place. Her writing, ideas and images have provided the direction we needed to get started and the blueprint to design our dream interior. This book is gorgeous, the writing superb and the ideas are genius. It's a welcome addition to anyone's library no matter what shape their house or apartment is in. Be careful though, we had friends over for the holidays and they tried to swipe it. Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"New Spaces, Old World Charm (Elements of Living)","review":"I purchased this book in the hopes that it would assist in my transforming a newly-contructed house into a charming, old-style home. Without a doubt, it did! Sample's guide offers a variety of styles, all of which are inspiring. I particularly enjoy the featured designers sources listed after each home (especially my favorite, Elissa Cullman's Revival Chic) and the trade tips that accompany each chapter. I find Sample's book to be inspirational yet practical, user-friendly and concise, and beautifully photographed. It has a permanent home on my coffee table."},{"Title":"New Spaces, Old World Charm (Elements of Living)","review":"I have ordered several books from Amazon over the years based on reader reviews and I did so in this case as well. I took the time from my busy life to make sure no one else made the same folly. In the first chapter you will find an \\"Updated Colonial\\" living room with purple walls, matching purple crown molding, purple accents, purple painted fireplace mantel, and once again the exact same purple painted on the book shelves. I feel confident that this room would be a perfect fit for Willy Wonka's Verucca Salt. The foyer continues with vertical stripes of dark and light purple contrasted with the black and white race flag checks painted onto what could have been lovely hard wood floors. The designers state that they were giving the client what they wanted, yet their picture with her wearing a purple shirt and he a purple bowtie really makes me wonder if those poor homeowner folks are secretly living in agony, but think it must be nice since it's in a decorating book Their dinning room is lovely for a circus performer who likes to bring work home. Once again, the designers pay no attention to distinguishing between the beautiful crafted moldings, trim, and windows, and they painted the entire thing a screaming blue-green with fuchsia curtains and pink fabric on the seats. There is no sense of scale and symmetry as two separate pictures in this chapter are hung without regard for the lines of the molding, and without regard to scale. They might take some lessons from Susan Sargent if they want to continue design. If only one chapter was like this, I could have kept the book instead of it being the first and only book I have ever returned to Amazon.No, all the chapters are not that bad, but maybe due to such a poor lead, they really don't inspire. I don't know what style the author was attempting to profile, since it seems to bounce between old style colonial and minimalist urban and there is no common theme tying in all the chapters.It's a pass."},{"Title":"New Spaces, Old World Charm (Elements of Living)","review":"What a great design book!

Ms. Sample's book didn't overwhelm me as many of the other design books I looked at did with impractical ideas. While it is beautiful enough to suffice as a coffee table book, my original copy is dog-eared and highlighted throughout with ideas and suggestions I was able to use and customize for my own needs. Highly recommended for anyone with classic, old world style!"},{"Title":"New Spaces, Old World Charm (Elements of Living)","review":"I have to concur with S. McCoy who dissed the purple house, I mean blue house. Yes, it was not purple but the color was in overkill. Remember Barney, the purple dinosaur? Well this is the Barney of houses.On the show Top Designer which airs on Bravo TV, interior design hopefuls are presented with various design challenges. One show asks contestants to pick a color and their challenge was to design around that color. If memory serves me correctly, every student literally designed spaces much like the Barney in this book. Most of the judges harshly critiqued the contestants for literally taking the color challenge and overdoing it.This book is so so. If you ocassionally pick up a copy of some of the high end mags like Architectural Digest, Traditional Homes, etc., most have resource guides in the back that you could access. This is nothing new.Also, the designers in New Spaces seem to have conflicting design philosophies. To wallpaper or not, that is the question. To have clean spaces or bric-a-brac. To have the lived in look or a showcase home.I think the best advice for me came from Ann Leconey, on page 131. Under the header \\"Use Architectural Shells,\\" she basically set the stage for a well designed room by first, as she puts it,\\" designing the interior architectural shell.\\" According to Leconey you start by choosing the wall finishes, followed by the window treatment, and finish with the flooring.According to her, you are then ready to move forward with your color scheme, fabric, etc. At least she gave me something that I could work with."},{"Title":"New Spaces, Old World Charm (Elements of Living)","review":"I love New Spaces, Old World Charm. The homes featured have given my husband and I great ideas, and we think the resources chapters are terrific. We just moved into a new home and as we remodel it, we are referring to the book on a daily basis. We like how the sources range from high-end to budget given that there are items we want to spend a lot of money on and others that aren't as important to us and we are looking for attractive product at medium to low price points. Each chapter gives a selection of sources ranging from very expensive to medium priced to budget. So far all of the retailers we have bought product from have websites which is really helpful becasue we have been able to review products from home.The author says that the sources listed in the book were told to her by the featured designers. It's great to learn where top designers shop and also see that even though their clients generally have very large budgets, they know where to find a good bargain. I also like how the author lists tips on how to buy to the trade product without hiring an interior designer. She lists stores that sell trade only directly to customers and buying services that will buy trade only for you for a small fee.I highly recommend New Spaces, Old World Charm. It offers so much more than your typical coffee table book!"},{"Title":"New Spaces, Old World Charm (Elements of Living)","review":"New Spaces, Old World Charm is a combination of classic interior design 'coffee table book', how-to guide and resource reference. It's rare to find so much useful information in one product. I especially like how it features top designers' work and demonstrates how to achieve their looks.

But this book only goes so far in achieving its goal, mainly because of the lack of addressing the architectural elements. And the approach taken is questionable. A diverse group of interior designers each present examples of their work in a chapter, teamed with a collection of commercial resources related to a particular theme. The uneasy part comes when the designers often come across as having paid to be included in the presentation. And the vendors, though a valid source of quality goods, are surely advertisers. Though not a bad publication if considered a hard bound handbook, the pricing is way out of line as most readers would not consider it a design book in the general sense. It is best as an attractive advertising directory."},{"Title":"New Spaces, Old World Charm (Elements of Living)","review":"I'm enjoying New Spaces, Old World Charm very much. I like how the design work in it is of high-end homes (with the exception of the Gissler-designed house) but the author presents what the designers did in the spaces by technique (as well as listing sources) so that no matter what your budget, you can duplicate what is seen in the book. I also like how she presents a variety of design styles, demonstrating 12 individual designer's approaches to transforming new spaces into ones with richness and character. As I pinpoint the style I like best for my own home, I need a book that gives a good overview of different ways to achieve the look. And although this book is about recreating antique and vintage styles, the design pictured in the book is fashionable and eclectic. The spaces don't look like exact duplications of an antique styles.I also like the resource section, which goes into detail about why the sources are valued by top designers. Even though the book was published in 2004, the sources are still timely. People hire designers to learn the secrets the author gives in the book. I also like that author obviously went out of her way to list trade only and retail sources in each resource chapter to help the readers. She wants the book to appeal to those who can afford trade only and hire interior designers and those who want to spend less and buy on their own or do a combination of the two."},{"Title":"New Spaces, Old World Charm (Elements of Living)","review":"There are some beautiful pictures and wonderful ideas in this book.

As they mature, they will be exposed to new and unfamiliar circumstances and learning about how others dealt with new situations will help prepare them.This book is not about a haunted house, quite the contrary, while the house is abandoned and could be considered spooky; the children have no qualms about entering. Alan is a boy living in a beached houseboat with his widowed mother. Pete and Chris are a brother and sister who live nearby and when they meet, they quickly become friends. Alan's late father was one of two brothers whose father owned a house nearby. When Alan's grandfather died, his will could not be found. The grandfather had stated that he was going to leave the house to Alan's father, but with no formal document and another brother, the matter had been tied up in litigation for years.Alan regularly goes into the house to explore and once he meets Pete and Chris, they start accompanying him. As they are leaving the house one day, Alan notices a footprint indicating that someone else has entered the house. This is the beginning of a mystery that the trio investigates. To do so, they must conquer their fear and engage in some significant deductive reasoning and they are able to do both.The plot of this book is at the right level and complexity for young people. The main characters must think things through and be brave, yet young readers will be able to follow the plot and the danger to the children is minor. It is a good exercise in critical thinking for the child in the middle years of elementary school."},{"Title":"Community Organizing","review":"We read this book for a grad school class, and it was the best book I read as a grad student. Each chapter is organized into two parts, a theoretical treatment followed by an in-depth case study. Although it's a bit heady, the book is also extremely practical. The field of community building/organizing is obviously practice-oriented, but some solid theory has been needed for at least a generation. Other &quot;macrosociologists,&quot; planners, and political economists have tried but fallen short of merging theory with practice in this important endeavor of community action. This book succeeds where others have failed, and it should be required reading for anyone in the community development, public health, or social work fields."},{"Title":"Community Organizing","review":"Used this book for a Community program class in public health.

He used great details including interviews for people, stories about fighters, and Muhammad Ali's life and career. The book begins with days before Ali discussing Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston. In great detail, Remnick talks about those two fighting and then he works into Muhammad Ali's career. The author's veracity was never called into question by me. Remnick's many references and thoughts made me seem like I was in the story. Remnick captures the legacy of Muhammad Ali and really portrays his life well. Remnick explains how Ali came to be and the road he took as he battled his way through life as well as in the ring."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"While I enjoyed the movie &quot;Ali&quot; very much, its narrative drive does get a bit foggy at times. This is an excellent book that covers the times in which Ali grew up and effectively uses the differences between Patterson, Liston, and Ali as a way of illustrating the diverse atmosphere of race relations in America in the forties, fifties, and especially the sixties. The author gives us important insight into why Ali is so special as an athlete and as a cultural icon. He shows us not only his physical powers, but also his inner strength and resolve. This is all shown without glossing over Ali's weaknesses and failings.However, Ali's weaknesses and failings are simply part of the human condition. His desire to be a force for good in this world, to help others, and above all, to be free, are inspiring to read about and to contemplate. That he was able to remain true to himself and his beliefs in the face of incredible pressure from all sides is proof of his historical worth.This is a book worth reading and especially now as background to the movie &quot;Ali&quot;. There are also wonderful pictures that show how remarkable Ali really was in his prime."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Muhammad Ali is an almost universally revered figure today, but this book reminds us that it was not always so. This book covers the time between when young Cassius Clay won the Olympic gold medal in boxing until he emerged as the premiere fighter of the '60's when he beat Floyd Patterson in 1965.Until Ali came along, heavyweight fighters were expected to fight flat-footed and use their superior strength and hitting power to defeat their opponents. Ali showed them a different way with his &quot;float like a butterfly, sting like a bee&quot; way of fighting. And there was always his bragging. Ali knew very well what he was doing with his poems and his ever-running mouth. They sold tickets to his fights, pure and simple. But in his first fight with Liston even he wasn't sure if he could deliver on his boasts.If you've ever wondered how it was in the '60's when Clay fought the bear, Sonny Liston, this is a must read. You'll learn things about Muhammad Ali that haven't been covered before. I'd recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"THIS BOOK IS REALLY WELL WRITTEN.

The only fights that Remnick discusses is two of the battles with Sonny Liston. What about Fraizer? What about Foreman? Heck, what about Spinks? Wasn't there a Rumble in the Jungle? And I know there was a Thrillia in Manila. Didn't Ali get knocked silly in MSG thanks to the soup bone of Joe Fraizer? The first part of this book isn't even about Ali.

These are the years when Ali became Ali...the champ at the height of his powers.But there's a special bonus in this book - a good portion of it deals with Sonny Liston. You talk about your seminal 20th Century characters. They don't get any more interesting than this guy: the abused son of a sharecropper, long stretches of imprisonment, a fight career directed by mob interests, a violent death. In short, a writer's dream. Remnick brings Liston together with Floyd Patterson (and you'll never find a greater constrast) and walks you through these two battles before turning his attention to Ali. Thus, you get a full portrait of Liston prior to encountering the force of nature that was then Cassius Clay.The effect is a curious sympathy that you have for Liston as he enters the maelstrom developing around Ali. In most retellings, Liston is cast as the personification of evil. Remnick made me see him in a different light.My advice for a great Ali study program:1. Watch 'When We Were Kings' [Best documentary ever]2. Read 'The Fight' by Norman Mailer3. Read 'King of the World'4. Buy any book featuring Howard Bingham's photography of Ali."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"This is a great writer that can be appreciated by the boxing fan and non fan alike. At times the narrative is a bit choppy. But in the end this style adds to the reader's enjoyment as the usual biographical methods become enhanced. The title and cover pic are a little misleading : while Ali is clearly the focus much space is given to (and much is learned about) Liston, Patterson and most interestingly, the whole boxing culture....Bottom line : A great book."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"David Remnick delivers a terrific biography of Muhammad Ali with &quot;King of the World,&quot; but this book should never be mistaken for a conventional sports biography. It is also social history and a compassionate yet realistic portrait of America's guiltiest pleasure: the seamy, yet somehow sometimes heroic world of professional boxing.The first thing that struck me when I read the book is that its first section discusses Muhammad Ali (or Cassius Clay) very little. Instead, Remnick focuses on the two boxers who helped to gave shape to Ali's legend: Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston. The former was a reluctant champion from the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, and Remnick brings Patterson's reticence and self-doubt into full view. The latter was a street thug from an impoverished rural background, a vision of America's deepest fears about African-Americans.Remnick details Liston's two devastating first-round demolitions of Patterson and illuminates the complicated relationship the public had with Liston. On the one hand, he was despised because of his criminal background and ties to the mob; on the other, Remnick makes clear, he was comforing because he confirmed stereotyped perceptions of black men. One of Remnick's great accompishments in the book is to humanize Liston without in the least diminishing his surly and even hateful demeanor.With Liston the controversial heavyweight champ, the loud, abrasive, seemingly self-confident Cassius Clay, of Louisville, Kentucky, stepped into the national spotlight. Remnick displays the future champion in all his complex glory: his braggadocio, his complex relationship with white people, including his trainer and doctor, his innate intelligence that was paired with his lack of formal schooling, his ability to manipulate the press, and so on.Interwoven into his story of how Cassius Clay literally created his life and legend and became the man we know as Muhammad Ali is excellent social history on the civil rights movement and Ali's relationship with the Muslims, including Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X. It is not surprising for those of us who grew up in the '60s that sport was so mixed up with politics in Muhammad Ali's day and that he was a key figure in shaping politics. Those who do not remember the time, however, may find it enlightening to realize that there was once an athlete who paid dearly for his political beliefs: Muhammad Ali was stripped of his heavyweight title and banned from the ring for four years for his opposition to the war in Vietnam.Remnick brings all of this vividly to life. He manages, in a bare 300 pages, to meld sports, politics, and history into a story that unfolds like a great heavyweight fight. Must read."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"I've come to be a fan of Ali later in life, way after his career was over. I never saw him fight in his prime. How I became acquainted with him was through Thomas Hauser's biography. Which spans Ali's life from birth to the present. He tells Ali's story through anecdotes of the people who surrounded him throughout his life and those who just knew him through certain events. Hauser's book is so complete and tells the story from so many different angles that the author of this book, David Remnick, cited Hauser many times in his own book. This book goes through a hundred or so pages before you even get to Ali's career and stops after the Patterson fight (basically right before the Foreman and Frazier fights). Ali's life from the Patterson fight forward is glossed over quickly in the epilogue. To his credit, Remnick relates his moments spent with the champ poignantly, but these moments were few and far between. After taking another look at the book's title I should have figured that it's about Ali's rise to prominence and not his career."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"I'm a big boxing fan, and am fascinated with both Muhammed Ali, how he evolved from Cassisus Clay, and Sonny Liston. There's a lot of great boxing writing, however, and I thought every angle of these two had already been covered, both in facts and in their roles as mythic figures. So it was with great pleasure (and surprise) I found David Remnick's book so terrific. Besides learning new facts that only a good investigative reporter could dig up 35 years after the fact, the book read like a great story. The prose really flowed, but not in a pretentious way that took away from the subjects, and I think even non-boxing fans would enjoy the tale of when these two tragic men (though Ali wouldn't become tragic for decades)met to fight for the heavyweight crown. I plan on buying a hardcover for my boxing book collection (a shelf I'm VERY discriminating about.)Thanks David Remnick!"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"This book was fascinating. I remember the grown-ups talking about these fights when I was a kid. I knew they were a big deal, but I didn't know why. Now I do. Mr. Remnick has illuminated the times and the political/racial atmosphere in which these fights took place. I found the short biographies of Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston especially enlightening. It's surprising to read how loathed Ali was at the time. And how lucky he was! If the first Liston fight hadn't been postponed because of Ali's hernia... when Liston had really trained and was ready... well, who knows? This has been the best sports book I've read in years, and I can't recommend it highly enough. What a wild ride!"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"This was a very well reported book, and an excellent snapshot of a changing time, in sports, and in race relations in the US.For better or worse, however, the real Ali comes through strongly in the book. While Remnick, and everyone who talks to the author extensively in the book, praises Ali as a great, sweet and brave man, he comes through to me the same as he always did: while undoubtedly a great boxer, he overstayed his welcome in the ring, and more often than not, his boorish behavior seems very off-putting.I'm happy that Ali was around in his time, to move the countries attitudes, but he certainly seems a bit more of a lout than anyone was willing to admit, in the way he treated his friends, women, and opponents.Nevertheless, the subject should not get in the way of the book itself"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"The Titans Reigned SupremeFantastic book - more than just the Ali Story -This is one of the best-written and thought out books of the happenings amongst a small circle of the greatest heavy weights.You get a rare insight into the lives and minds of Floyd Patterson, Sonny Liston and Cassius Clay - and the awakening/becoming of Muhammad AliI went into this book wanting to feed my hunger for knowledge of Muhammad Ali and came out of with a craving for more Sonny Liston - I now want to know all I can about him.Only a brief period in time is covered - but it's an in-depth look at that time and the people and the places that made up boxing and some of the world outside boxing.This is a great book for anyone interested in these titans - for anyone interested in Patterson, Liston and Ali - for anyone interested in the history of legends.One of the best books I've experienced - I truly felt like I was there at times - in that era - that energy of the people and the timesThis is one of those books where you wish there was a part 2"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"David Remnick's biography of Muhammad Ali covers not just the career of one extraordinary fighter, but the widely encompassing sweep of his historical time. The book begins by sharply examining heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson and the unique qualities he brought to the America of his day, a quiet, soft spoken man who carried himself with dignity. Remnick then traces the rocky road to the championship for Sonny Liston, which was achieved after a stop at a federal penitentiary. Liston longed for acclaim from the public, and hoped he would get it after dispatching Patterson in their 1962 title fight in Chicago. A restless, brooding man, Liston would move from St. Louis, to Philadephia, then west to Denver and ultimately Las Vegas.Ali's brash behavior in demanding a shot at Liston's title was part calculated strategy, part show business, boosting his recognition level all the while, building on the name value he began achieving after winning a gold medal in the light heavyweight class at the 1960 Rome Olympics. Eventually his loud bravado would convince Liston that he was actually crazy.When Ali won the title from Liston in 1964 in Miami Beach many boxing authorities and fans thought his win a fluke. He then defeated Liston in a controversial rematch in Lewiston, Maine, a one round knockout many believed resulted from Liston lying down on the job. Remnick disagrees, quoting Ali's trainer Angelo Dundee and others in accepting that Liston happened to walk into a well-placed blow that traveled a short distance, but was substantial enough to accomplish its objective. Remnick also points out that Liston bore the fate of reaching the title after his prime, and might well have achieved a longer, more far reaching destiny as champion had the fates been kinder.The high point of Remnick's dramatic account of a highly colorful American figure arrives when he tackles Ali's refusal to be drafted into the Army. Remnick does an excellent job of presenting and analyzing with sharp critical intelligence the forces at work during the sixties who admired Ali's stand along with those who opposed it, some of whom bitterly hated him. He does an excellent job of describing how African-Americans reacted to Ali as a fighter and a man, particularly at the critical moment when he stood up to political forces who sought to pressure him to be drafted into the Army during the highly controversial Vietnam War.This is a book that provides a sociological panorama of Ali and his time. As such, this broad landscape is an invaluable work which enhances reader understanding of a controversial period of American history."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"When boxing mattered, boxers were more than pugilists trying to break each other's wills; they were symbols that attracted the attention and aspirations of the masses. Like gladiators in Rome, these courageous men allow us to project our hopes, fears, and insecurities.David Remnick tells the story of Cassius Clay's growth from a skinny, mercurial, but morally upright boy, to a hero and symbol of resistance and hope for millions of anti-establishment figures. Ali captivated the hearts and minds of fans unlike any athlete before or since. Remnick does a beautiful job of explaining why and how this happened. No matter how dominate Michael Jordan was, or Tiger Woods is, neither absorb our emotions like the sponge known as Muhammed Ali.His grace, speed, and power thrilled, while his words, political stances, and humour enthralled. Everyone in America should learn the story of this hero. There is no better place than Remnick's book to do so. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"This is not really a standard biography. It focuses only on a few of Ali's fights, ending with his bout with Floyd Patterson in 65. So those looking for a comprehensive overview of Ali's career will be disapointed. However, it does show why Ali is the greatest athlete of the 20th century. It does that by telling Ali's story in the context of his era and it is captivating reading. We get Ali in all his greatness -- and even in all his cruelty. He was a man, but a man that stood for something. That alone makes him rare in sport, especially today when all athletes seem to be interested in are endorsement deals or making rap records. Somehow I can't picture a Michael Jordan allowing himself to be thrown out of sport during his prime years, simply because of a deeply held religious belief. Pick up with book, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Absoloutely fabulous. Having been born in the late 60's I can only imagine what it was like for Ali. While reading this book it was as if I was there. Remnick has chosen a delicious topic that left me hungry for more. Brilliantly weaving in the civil rights movement with the Heavy Weight title fights, Remnick puts the reader in the middle of the 50's and 60's. In the process he confirms what we already knew in our hearts, Ali is the greatest fighter of all time. But not just for his ability in the ring, but for his stand. His stand for what is right and possible for humanity. Bravo!"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"The colorful chartacters of the 1960s boxing world come to life in this very entertaining and insightful work. A must for non-boxing fans too!"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"At a time when the phrase, &quot;You the man&quot; seems to be applied to every &quot;wannabe&quot; during every sporting event on TV, this book tells the tale about the person who really is THE MAN! The mystique that is Ali comes to life as a truly special person . . a man who, though basically illiterate (he was initially given an 87 IQ (sub-intelligent) by his draft board), who never learned to read, and who has lived a large part of his adult life without being able to express himself. I found it fascinating to learn about his exposure to religion and his endorsement of a philosophy that was interpreted incorrectly by most of the newspaper reporters who covered his rise to the Championship during the 60's. This book, which follows Ali for a short period of his career . . . the 1st Liston bout up to the Patterson fight . . . casts a giant floodlight and illuminates many of the shadows that have confused many of us about this legend. I now know why . . . (I really never was able to understand my instincts before this read) I have come to regard this guy as &quot;the Greatest&quot; ! David Remnick should receive another Pulitzer Prize for this one."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"The best book I have ever read about Muhammad Ali, especially due the in-depth analysis of the conversion of Cassius Clay to the Islamic Faith, as well as the detailed coverage of the two men who held the Heavyweight Championship crown prior to Clay/Ali, Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston. Anyone who is interested in the history of Ali will cherish reading this book."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Remnick employs an exceptional writing style in describing the ascendency of Clay/Ali against the backdrop of the Patterson-Liston matches. His treatments of the preparations for the Ali-Liston fights are tantalizing. I would have enjoyed some discussion of Ali's post-prison matches, viz., Frazier and Foreman but that shortcoming does not change the fact that this was my favorite book of 1998"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"In one on the Eyes on the Prize videos, the focus is on Muhammad Ali and his effect on American culture. Well, this book addresses those issues and more. The most phenomenal fact about Ali is that he vastly shaped himself. When boxing promoters largely developed the public personas of their fighters, Ali decided who he would be and didn't care about how he would be viewed. He cared more about his principles. If Liston and Patterson had done the same, they would probably have been happier men.Whether you hate Ali or love him, read this book to better understand him."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"David Remnick does a masterful job in placing the reader alongside Ali - from Ali's days as a youth in Jim Crow Louisville, to his success in the Olympics, to his &quot;shocking the world&quot; with his annihilation of an unbeatable Sonny Liston, to his controversial spritual growth obtained via the Nation of Islam. The beginning scene is exceptional with Remnick at Ali's farm in Michigan and is only continued throughout the book and finally when Ali walks Remnick to his car to leave Ali's home. The reader's respect and amazement over Ali's life (and this is only from youth to denouncing the draft)will further be stregnthened. Remnick does a great job of supplying the reader with &quot;Ali-isms&quot;, quotes and memories from the Champ. Those who feel sadness of Ali's current state will be a bit relieved that Ali himself is most at peace with himself and condition. Through Remnick's work we are all reminded that Ali was and is, for all eternity, truly The Greatest."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"By focusing on the Ali-Liston battles, &quot;King of the World&quot; paints vivid and unforgettable portraits of not only Ali, but Liston and Patterson. This is a fun read, and the most memorable book on Boxing since Thomas Hauser's book on the same topic."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"David Remnick is superb. This is the &quot;Real Book&quot; David should win the Pulitzer Prizer for, not &quot;that other one&quot;, he did win one for writing. As Ali's Deer Lake, Pa. Training Camp photographer during the '70's, I can tell you of this kind, gentle man, who was oh so awesome within the ring. Ali is a &quot;one-man masterpiece&quot;, &quot;a true work of functional artisitic prowess&quot;. David Remnick, on paper in prose, captures all of this. Ali is my friend, my mentor, my role model, and yes, I AM a bit biased, but there have been other works on Ali and this is the &quot;best of the best&quot;. May Allah be with you, David, and with you, &quot;Champ&quot;. - Maury Schiowitz"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"This book is excellent. What makes it so captivating is that it really is about how America was changing from the late 50s through the mid sixties. As such, it is an incomplete bio of Ali, but a great window into America during the early 1960's period of Civil Rights."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Excellent book. The way it's written gives us a very good sociological view of USA in the 50's and 60's."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"I think I read this in 3 or 4 sittings - that's unheard of for me.I was literally swept along in the narrative - and was most disappointed when the book ended!Simply the best sportsbook I've read in a long time.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"This book takes place in the 60's, 70's, and the 80's. This book tells you about all of the racial conflicts that he had to put aside during his career. The main events are where Muhammad Ali A.K.A Cassius clay has his big fights against big names like George Forman and Joe Frazer. There are also many other events that involve his social life and his beliefs. The book has a lot of really good content in it about his life his reasons why he started boxing. I would recommend this book to people who like boxing or who are curious to whom the greatest of all time is."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"\\"By using the Clay-Liston battle as a pivot and placing Muhammad Ali in an accurate social context, David Remnick constructs a narrative very much like Ali himself: astute, double-hearted, irresistible. He is so completely in charge of his craft that it becomes an art.\\"- Toni Morrison's \\"blurb\\" on the back of the hardcover edition's dustjacketMs. Morrison may be one of the late 20th century's best American novelists, but she's hardly a person whom I'd look to for a recommendation as to good boxing books and this bio, unfortunately, ain't one of them. Simply put, KING OF THE WORLD is not only marred by author David Remnick's lack of expertise about the \\"Sweet Science\\", but also by his wilful ignorance as a result of his marked prejudice in favor of his subject, bias that leads him to observations out of touch with reality.For ex., on page 193, Remnick writes, \\"Nearly every time (Clay/Ali) threw the jab (in the third round of their first bout) he followed with a chopping right that bounced off the top of (Sonny) Liston's head... After one combination, Liston's knees wobbled and he very nearly went down. Liston managed to hold on, to grasp at the ropes and steady himself ... Liston went straight at Clay, but Clay caught evry punch on his elbows and gloves, just as he had trained himself to do\\". Well, anyone who's actually seen the film of that bout will know that the punch with which Clay hurt Liston was an illegal \\"rabbit punch\\" flush on the BACK of \\"The Big Bear's\\" noggin. Furthermore, at NO time did Sonny grab or even grab AT the ropes ('tho he was forced back to them). Also, Ali was not at that time or any other adept at picking off punches with his elbows or gloves and, as evidenced by the film, simply covered up the way novices are taught to and Liston does, in fact, score some major wallops to his body. And, indeed, Remnick intentionally skips over the action from about a minute into the third stanza to the interval before round four, not mentioning that once Clay began to wind down from exerting himself and Liston began to aggresively come forward behind wild, heavy punches once his head began to clear, it was the defending champ who took control of the last half of the round.Unfortunately, when he did skip forward (to the rest period betw rounds 3 & 4), Remnick then commits another error by lending credence to the fiction that Liston's cornerman Joe Pollino applied a solution to his gloves in order to impair Clay's eyesight. Again, a viewing of the film demonstrates that the author can't be more wrong becuz not only did Liston \\"carry\\" his gloves CLOSER to his OWN face than he had in the previous three rounds, but also \\"worked\\" Clay's body when in close, rather than engage Clay in a clinch and thrust his gloves into Clay's face, which one wd logically expect him to have done were Remnick correct.Quite frankly, if an author cannot be relied upon to accurately relate fight action that was FILMED, one shudders to think how accurate Remnick was at conveying conversations and incidents that were NOT recorded, esp since he did not bother to footnote his sources. Combine the above with the fact that the author doesn't really have anything new to add to the many bios and dvds about Ali already out there - except more hero worship - and KING OF THE WORLD is a book one should take a pass on. Thank God that I only paid 3 bucks for my copy (at a used goods store).BTW, if one were interested in a more comprehensive Ali bio, I, like other reviewers, recommend Thomas Hauser'sMuhammad Ali: His Life and Times, which examines Ali's entire career - and life - 'tho be forewarned that Hauser is more biassed in \\"The Greatest's\\" favor than Remnick (or at least he was 'til he & Ali - for whatever reason - had a falling out) and also isn't exactly an expert on boxing technique. And/or, if one were interested in a book about both Ali and Liston, I recommend Bob Mee'sAli and Liston: The Boy Who Would Be King and the Ugly Bear. While that author makes his share of factual errors and, again, isn't the most astute of boxing observers - despite being a boxing commentator for the UK's Sky network! - he is at least much more objective than Remnick and Hauser and, indeed, provides a much better, fairer picture of Liston than his other biographers."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. 4 stars for the book and a 5th for Ali.I was discussing &quot;When We Were Kings&quot; (an amazing documentary on the Rumble in the Jungle) with a co-worker and he asked why everyone held Ali in such high esteem. I couldn't really answer him effectively until I read this book and understood the context from which Ali came. I realize now how many ways he upset the world and challenged the prevailing ideas about what a boxer should be. Remnick captures the times, Ali's amazing skill, his warmth and his tremendous impact beautifully.Ali was right when he once said, &quot;I'm the double greatest.&quot;"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"The book focuses on early fights of Muhammed Ali in very great detail. However, along with that you get a history of boxing in America from beginning of 1900s to 1960s. The surrounding atmosphere of the boxing world is mostly an unknown to people. This book puts it into right perspective. It is an enjoyable book to read, I recommend it."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"As a Ali, and a boxing fan i was concerned that this book would not tell me anything 'new' about the champ. I shouldn't have worried the author does a superb job of telling the 'histories' of all the main players and mixing it with the society of the 1960's. He also tells the stories of the other main fighters of the times, Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston. Never boring and written in the style of a historian the author achieves all his objectives and leaves no doubt that Muhhammad Ali was 'the greatest'..."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"A great book! It's more about Liston as the Tyson-like beautiful brute and Patterson the neurotic pugilist than about Ali (Clay). The book does great job in its discussion of the seemy side of boxing; organized crime and the like. It tends to get a bit bogged down in the last two chapters, but overall its a buy!"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Head and shoulders the best and most balanced of the numerous Ali biographies I have read, this book - like the man himself - transcends sport. Remnick is a master communicator in print who delves deeply into the culture and times of the early sixties to present a unique tale of the man who defied the establishment - both white and black - and ultimately indeed became &quot;King of the World&quot;. This book is really three biographies in one, with the stories of Charles &quot;Sonny&quot; Liston and Floyd Patterson, although as in life overshadowed by Ali, still fascinating in their own way. This book manages to both entertain and educate in a most enjoyable manner. What more can you ask?"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"It is, as many have said, one of the great sports biographies of all time -- but it's also one of the great history narratives of all time. It's not just Muhammmad Ali profiled here, but the trio of heavyweights who dominated headlines in the early 1960s: also Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston. And in many ways, those two are more fascinating because, before I read \\"King of the World,\\" they weren't accompanied by the same pre-fight hype. Here's Liston, a dangerous and sullen felon who's achingly lonely; there's Patterson, a great athlete but at the same time so thoughtful and intelligent he was plagued by a boxer's worst enemy, self-doubt.And that's not to say anything of the portrait of the time, of Black Muslims, Malcolm X, Norman Mailer, the media, John F. Kennedy... Trust me, even a non-sports fan will be mesmerized."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Like me, even if you do not particularly like the &quot;sport&quot; of boxing, you should find this a very well written and insightful work, examining part of the life of one of the more important persons making up or recent history as a society. I have always had great admiration for Muhammad Ali, and after reading this work, the admiration has grown. The author takes a simple, yet comprehensive look at our American &quot;fight game,&quot; and gives if a very realistic face, the good, bad and ugly. The book is well written. The book is a credit to both Ali and the author, Remnick. Would love an expanded, all inclusive biography of Ali by Remnick some day. Well done!"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"I've heard many people say that this book isn't very well written due to that fact that it isn't on his whole life. There are things left out like the Thrilla in Manilla and the Rumble in the Jungle. You could say that (because it is true) but that isn't the point of the story. David Remnick didn't want to go into Ali's entire career and life because of the point he was trying to make. All he needed to do was to do that first part of his life to make the point. I think that Remnick does the best job at writing about Ali's life and what he did for Americans. I gie this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"The title of the book is King of the World : Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero. This piece of work, of course, traces the RISE of Ali.You finally worked it out, Clutchmotor. &quot;After taking another look at the book's title I should have figured that it's about Ali's rise to prominence and not his career.&quot; Very perceptive.This book is a fine take on the evolution of one of the true icons of sporting history."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"This is book is focused in Ali and his life between 1960-1965.

I've been recommending it to everyone since then."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"this was the best biography about the best fighter ever"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"For what Remnick set out to do, I can't imagine it done any better. The narrative is honest and keeps the same steady pace througout. Remnick shows all of Ali, not only the greatest fighter of his generation, but also a man capable of being callous towards his wife and friends when they failed to live up to what the Nation of Islam demanded. Certainly his shunning of Malcolm X immediately before his assasination reveals a different side of Ali than I had ever seen on TV. But most importantly, Remnick shows the charisma and charm that made Ali great. Overall, this is an important book which frames Ali in the panoramic of the great leaders and issues of his time. I recommend it to anyone, even those not interested in boxing."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"This is an enjoyable and informative book. Like the author, I am not a boxing fan, but I do like sports, and I especially enjoy well written non-fiction on almost any \\"slice of life\\" topic.

It is worth watching, although I definitely enjoyed the book more."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Hello, this book King of the World is a great book about Cassius Clay and the champions that lead up to his dominance. It tells about Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston and many things about the stuff out of the ring that people don't usually get to see. You get to know Cassius before and after he was a champion. This is a book you want to read if u want to know anything about the greatest that ever lived."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"I dislike reading biographies &amp; autobiographies that made the central characters larger than life, or elevate them to demi-God status. This book has none of that. And yet, everything about Muhammed Ali is larger than life. The book described the circumstances &amp; Muhammed Ali's self-belief which elevated him to a hero or anti-hero status. If the readers were David Remnick's fan, then, you would appreciate the writer's eloquent style &amp; his in-depth research &amp; interviews, as displayed in his work of Lenin's Tomb, which won him the revered Pulitzer's Prize. Here, Muhammed Ali (previously Cassius Clay) is depicted not simply as a boxer, but also an icon who epitomises the turbulent 60's America, a country which was divided into 2 nations, the whites &amp; the blacks. Muhammed Ali is a symbol of defiance for his people as he refused to be drafted into the army to fight a war that's none of his concern, a symbol of beauty and skill and courage, a symbol of faith, a symnbol of racial pride, of wit, and love. He also represented boxing of the new era by not having any connection with the mobs who had the tendency to fix the fights. Moreover, Muhammed Ali disregarded the bad words that sportswriters (used to be dominated by the whites) wrote about him. As time goes on, it's fascinating to read that his undying belief changed his critics rather than the other around. He was THE man, accomplished goals that he set up to do and there were times when he doubted himself but nevertheless, with a cumulation of sheer luck and sheer persistency that he beat against all odds. Now, as he is eaten up gradually but definitely by the Parkinson's disease, he was at peace with himself thru his total devotion to Islam &amp; its cause. To add layers or dimensions into Muhammed Ali's persona, David wrote about heavyweight champions of yesteryears particularly Floyd Patterson &amp; Sonny Liston, &amp; champions of the present day such as Mike Tyson &amp; Evander Holyfield so that we would appreciate in-depth of what makes Muhammed Ali the king of the world of all times. We would also read about Muhammed Ali's life intertwined with Malcolm X's, his involvement with the Islam Nation &amp; Elijah Muhammed, his background &amp; relationships with his family, people that he engaged with, him being a simple &amp; humble man behind the limelight &amp; so forth. Nobody makes Muhammed Ali but himself, a boxer, a promoter all blended into one. It was such a touching moment to finally read of him holding the Olympic torch at the summer games in Atlanta, which was a milestone for the man himself. It was a captivating &amp; intense book to read. The book also contains several significant black and white pictures of Muhammed Ali. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"The book was a well written and well developed book. It not only portrays Ali as a complex, deep man who did much more than just box, but the whole generation of fighters, promoters, gangsters, Press agents and all the people of the age. The trajedy of Liston, Pattersons lost hope, the rise and fall of some of America hardest working men. The book is an explanation of the scenes behind and all around the sweet science. You dont have to be a boxing fan to enjoy it."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Remnick's multi-facted biography of Classius Cly (Muhammad Ali) places into the focus the young champion as he was in the beginning, before he became a legend (faults included), and in my case, a hero. Most compelling were the mini-biographies of Liston, Pattterson, Malcom X, the various sport writers. These helped to place perspective into the story and let the reader be a part of those times. How soon we forget the overt racism that was ingrained in American life not so long along. I have never been a boxing fan, but have long admired Ali as a person who had the courage to do the right thing. Today it is easy to look back casually remark that his accomplishments were as a boxer. However, Remnick's Clay/Ali paints the brash (in those days the word uppity would have been used)confident young Negro that challenged existing conventions and won. We might even say that nobody ever &quot;walked the talked&quot; like Ali did. Yes, he was neither the bad negro or the good negro, he was and became Muhammad Ali, a negro who stood as an independent man, ready to change the way others preceived himself and the members of his race. Ali should go down not only as a great boxer, not only as a man that help to end the draft, but a man that helped to change the way Americans look at African-Americans. Ali is one of the true icons of American History."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"This book significantly broadened my understanding of Ali's critical role in helping Black America face White America on eye-to-eye, if not equal, terms. Ali is the rarest of characters, and Remnick does a remarkable job of presenting a story of considerable, although presently underrated, historical significance in a lucid, educational and always entertaining manner.A great read!"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"David Remnick's &quot;King of the World&quot; is one of the best sports biographies ever written. Rarely has an athelete done as much to define his generation or been more controversial than Ali. Hard to believe today, with all of the adoration heaped upon Ali, but he was once a hated figure. This book chronicles his rise up until the time he refused to be drafted for the Vietnam War. Most surprising are the details about his involvement with the Nation of Islam and how that involvement both ruined his first marriage and caused him to turn his back on his great friend, Malcolm X. This book is for sports fans and anyone else interested in reading about an extrodinary life."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Perhaps I am not the best person to review this book as I am not a boxing fan at all, rather a person who appreciates good non-fiction and character studies. I picked up this book based on other reader reviews and the fact that that Time magazine named it the Best Nonfiction book of the year. The title of this book, as mentioned by other reviewers, is somewhat misleading as the book is only in part about Muhammad Ali. This book is more of a history about the era in which Ali became the champ. It is a well written account of Ali's association with the Black Muslim's and Malcolm X. It is also an informative account of the other famous fighters of his time and before. While the book is not a &quot;gripping&quot; book it certainly holds the interest of the reader. Surprisingly, after reading it I found myself less of a fan of Ali's than before,which may be the best evidence that the book is an honest account of the era."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Having read perhaps a dozen biographies of Ali, I was unconvinced that there was anything really new to say. I was wrong. Remnick's strength as a biography is to understand the cultural significance of Ali relative to the turbulent sixties. While Ali's made-for-media persona and story makes it easy to extract the figure from his era, the book sheds even more light on Ali by placing him firmly within the political, cultural and racial tensions of that time. This book is written on all of these multiple levels, and in addition is as good a pure \\"boxing\\" book as you will find. An outstanding study of one of the seminal cultural figures of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"A great book that introduces you to the era, the key characters, and of course, Muhammad Ali himself. The author did a great job of providing the historical context in which Ali's persona was formed and how his fighting career developed over time. For all the boasting, and Ali's achievements, it was interesting to read how Ali deliberately developed his public persona (and backed it up in a good fight, don't get me wrong). Beyond boxing, the author also spends a lot of time on Ali's connection with the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X, and the surrounding political turmoil.Overall, a great and a comprehensive book on Ali and those around him - great read for boxing and non-boxing fans alike."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"This is the story of how the greatest boxer of all time shook up boxing , and America , when he first arrived on the scene . It traces the story from his childhood , up until he was sentenced to five years in prison for refusing the draft for the Vietnam war ( \\" Man , I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong \\" ) , that ultimately would cost him three and a half years of his peak as a boxer .The story really revolves around three fighters , - Floyd Patterson , Sonny Liston , and Ali himself , and the fights that they had amongst each other that would see Ali rise to the top and usher in a new era ( political , as well as sporting ) . The first fight between Liston and Patterson happened at a time when Afro-Americans were demonstrating for racial equality and there was tension in the air , but to white America and it's sports writers , there was nothing more comforting than two stereotypical safe negroes ( \\" uncle tom verses the mafia controlled black brute \\" ) knocking hell out of each other . All that changed when the \\" Louisville lip \\" arrived . Hell ! heavyweight boxers were not supposed to fight like lightweights , they were supposed to take their punches like a man , and as for all of his verbal \\" who does he think he is ? \\" . And for white America , and a few conservative blacks , it got worse . He started hanging out with Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam , and then horror of horrors , he changed his good old fashioned christian slave name to a muslim one ..........The three boxers in their different ways represented the political and cultural struggle that was happening in America at that time , and the author's psychological profile of each boxer adds a personal pathos to the bigger picture . Ali's sense of humour and bravery ( not just in the ring ) is everywhere in this book , but , it is the nobility and humanity of the man that shines through . A must read !"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Muhammad ALI is Still The MAN.No Athelete Since has Struck A Cord as Powerful as THis MAN.THis Book Highlights His UPS&amp;DOWNS.It says SOmething For A Person To Sacrifice their Freedom for what they Believe in is Wrong.&amp;ALI always Stood Out.He was His Own Creation.A Fighter in&amp;Out The Ring.A True Warrior.he has touched folks all over The World.HE IS HISTORY RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES.DAVID REMNICK Does A GREAT JOB HERE.ALI WILL ALWAYS BE THE MAN."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Like Lenin's and Resurrection, Remnick's new book on &quot;the greatest&quot; not the smartest, is well-written and interesting. It places Ali in his historical context by first introducing us to Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston. His book reminds us that Ali was a very controversial figure in the first half of his career. The book is really about race and politics interwoven with an excellent overview of boxing. I only wish Remnick would have focused a little more on what Ali did when he was banned from boxing from 1967-71 while fighting the draft and why he was banned from boxing during these years. I think he should have explained the basis for the Supreme Court's 1971 ruling in Ali's favor. I highly recommend the book. Amazon gives a great discount."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Resnick does a suberb job of putting Ali's achievements into the context of boxing and society. He does this in the context of the Ali-Liston fight. This includes an indepth analysis of the Mafia influences on boxing at the time of their fight. By doing this, he is able to show the dramatic change which Ali broght to his sport. More interstingly, he presents the thesis that Ali was not only able to master his sport but the difficulty of being a champion outside the ring. The paradox of this is that he was much maligned while champion particuliarly with respct to the draft issue. However, in hindsight Ali has proved himself a leader and changer of the world. Ali strove to be and became &quot;King of the World&quot;."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"David Remnick was an amazing author when it came to writing this book. He used great details including interviews for people, stories about fighters, and Muhammad Ali's life and career. The book begins with days before Ali discussing Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston. In great detail, Remnick talks about those two fighting and then he works into Muhammad Ali's career. The author's veracity was never called into question by me. Remnick's many references and thoughts made me seem like I was in the story. Remnick captures the legacy of Muhammad Ali and really portrays his life well. Remnick explains how Ali came to be and the road he took as he battled his way through life as well as in the ring."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"i bought this book to find out a little more about muhammad ali and when it arrived and i saw how thick it was i thought it would be quite heavy-going. i am 15 and easily bored but this book is very good and detailed, although i think it focuses a little too much on other boxers at the beginning, however this is good background and demonstrates muhammad ali's rise to the top more. i would recommend it to anybody to read because it is interesting."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"This book I would recommend to all the people who either like boxing or Muhammed Ali. I would also recommend this to people who don't like to read because you would enjoy it and keep reading until its done. This book is about Ali at his best. From his childhood days to his greatest boxing match ever. This a nonfiction book that tells about Ali's career and the other boxers of his time, which include Floyd Patterson and Sonny Linston. Their fights took place in the 1960's. The best fight ever in this book was held in Miami Beach against Sonny Liston. This fight was exciting because Ali was the underdog of the fight and won it when Sonny Liston just gave up. The worst thing about this book is that it didn't fully describe all the other fights in his career."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I am reading it for my English class. Mr. Remnick does a superb job at capturing the glory and sorrow of Muhammad Ali. Not only is Ali the greatest fighter ever, but he is also a human, and Mr. Remnick captures that aspect of Ali's life."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"This is a truly a deserving book about one of the centuries greatest sportsman,civil rights activist, personalties and people.

Outstanding book for an outstanding man."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Well written, even handed, King of the World gives the reader an excellent taste of the boxing world during Ali's era and provides many inside anecdotes and descriptive accounts of just how the world of professional boxing operates.

He has always been a man I've loved and admired. This book is very interesting since it deals with Ali's beginnings and detailed events in his life on the rise. It's an interesting story and I couldnt put this book down. I wish for a part two &quot;The Peak&quot;. I wanted to continue to read and read about this interesting man. I've been recommending this book to everyone."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"I liked this book and would recommend it to friends. If you want to read just one, genuinely great piece of writing about the REAL Ali, however, rather than biographies such as this and Muhammad Ali: His Life And Times by Thomas Hauser, I recommend &quot;The Tao Of Muhammad Ali&quot; by Davis Miller. There are passages in Davis Miller's book that will make you cry, others that will make you laugh and some that will have you itching to know what happens next."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"This book is extrememly well written--absorbing and engaging, and well able to bring the characters to life. One of those books I looked forward to taking up again at the end of a busy day (and I'm not even a sports fan). The only problem, for me, was that after a rich, thorough beginning which chronicles Ali's career beginnings within the context of the boxing industry of the times (which &quot;beginning&quot; occupies fully three quarters of the book), the telling of Ali's life rather abruptly peters out, entirely omitting his years of boxing exile and then giving his post-exile years an extremely slight treatment. It left me wondering how Ali's career and public image progressed, what twists and turns there might have been to get him to his present Parkinsons-afflicted state."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"I concur emphatically with the great reviews this book has received. The surprise of this book is the compasionate biographies of Liston and Patterson, as well as the rivalry of Malcolm X and Elijah Muhamed.When the Author describes the sight of Ali standing above a fallen Liston in their second fight, he stops the action and refers you to an enclosed famous photo. He tells you in one paragrapgh about the young photographer who shot the picture, and interviews him. Many side stories and bio are included."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"I can't believe it, a book that gets you cheering for Patterson over Liston, then Clay over Liston, then feeling bad for Liston as he meets Ali, and finally nervously cheering for Ali as he demolishes Patterson--only to eventually feel guilty for not having supported Patterson. This book really leads you through the early sixties from a unique stance. In short, this is a brilliant wonderful book that is well researched and superbly written."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"The cover caught my eye! I got the book for my father who, for as long as I can remember has been an Ali fan. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. There is so much more to the man than just the talking. Although I'm too young to have seen the beginining. By reading this book I felt like I was there."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Is there anything left to say about Muhammad Ali? Absolutely, when the writer possesses the skills of David Remnick. The author does a marvelous job of presenting the former heavyweight champion as a complex individual during a most turbulent period in our history - the 1960's. Through his use of clear, readable language, Remnick focuses on, and simplifies, some complex social and psychological issues. The prologue and the epilogue, featuring the author's visit with the modern-day Ali, provide an effective structure, allowing the reader to better understand the man who, now more than ever, remains &quot;King of the World.&quot; Somehow by the end of the book, we have a feeling for Ali the man and the reasons he has indeed transcended the world of sports. This is more than a book about a great boxer, or even a remarkable human being. Ultimately, Remnick has provided us with a book about the second half of the twentieth century in America. Great reading!"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"This book captures the context in which Ali first gained notoriety.It clearly describes how Ali broke the mold relative to sports figures by contrasting his style both in and out of the ring to that of his immediate predecessors Sonny Liston and Floyd Patterson. Ali was &quot;THE GREATEST&quot; in many ways. His influence on not only his own sport but on the entire culture is evident throughout this well documented and entertaining book. It is remarkable how much has changed in 35 years. Remnick brings many of the events of the early 60's clearly into focus. I found it fascinating to think about the proximity in time of such events as the Kennedy assassination, the Clay-Liston fight, and the Beatles invasion. Not that any of these things are necessarily related, but it WAS an amazing time. The writing here is crisp and the numerous quotes from eyewitnesses enhance the narrative. Well worth the time."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"For me, this book should have been titled \\"Death of One of My Heroes,\\" which should become self-evident if you read this entire review. I believe the book is mostly accurate, and it is a well-written book.Remnick (the author), in my opinion, devotes too much time to Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston. I also wish he had given more details about Ali as Ali got older and continued to box.Without question, Muhammad Ali, in his prime, was the greatest heavyweight fighter that has ever fought.\\"DEATH OF ONE OF MY HEROES\\": I did not realize how much Ali allowed the Nation of Islam (NOI) to influence him. Because he let the NOI influence him--yes, Ali DID have a choice!!!--Muhammad Ali: (1)lied about throwing his Olympic medal over a fence, (2)divorced his first wife, (3)broke off a friendship with Malcolm X, and (4)claimed to be a \\"minister\\" to avoid the draft. If you think the above describes a \\"hero,\\" your definition of \\"hero\\" differs from mine.The book is good. Unfortunately, it killed one of my heroes.Buy it and read it. It is well worth the $$$."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Bertz / Randall\\"Almighty god was with me! I want everybody to bear witness! I am the greatest! I shook up the world! I am the greatest thing that ever lived! I don't have a mark on my face, and I just upset Sonny Liston, and I just turned twenty-two years old. I must be the greatest! I showed the world! Italk to god every day! I am the king of the world!\\" shouts Cassius Clay (Muhammad Ali) to the sporting press, after defeating Sonny Liston in 1964. This statement enraged boxing fans all over the world. Here was a twenty-two year old nobody with a big mouth, and he just defeated Sonny Liston. At the time, Liston was viewed as invincible. Liston was an experienced fighter who was known for defeating his opponents in two rounds or less. Not only did he lose the heavyweight championship to Ali, but he quit without being knocked down once. This declared Ali the king of controversy. \\"King of the World\\" by David Remnick is the story of the rise and fall of Muhammad Ali. Remnick does a fantastic job of showing us the different sides of racism. He focuses greatly on Ali's devotion to the Nation of Islam. The book showed many similarities between the Nation of Islam and the Klu Klux Klan. Remnick explained that both the Nation and the Klan were for segregation and that they both use methods of violence and terror to enforce their beliefs. After reading this book, I realized that the similarities are uncanny. Remnick's numerous references to these similarities proved to me that Remnick is a non-violent integrationist. I believe that one of the main points of the book is that segregation is wrong. The book greatly describes how the Nation of Islam had interfered with Muhammad Ali's personal life. For example, Remnick noted Ali's marriage to Sonji. He went into great detail how strong Ali's love was for Sonji, but he couldn't accept her inability to conform to hisreligion. This became a problem for them and they eventually got a divorce. Remnick also noted the emotional distance between Ali and his father being caused by his decision to join the Nation of Islam. Remnick goes even further in describing the way Ali turned his back on his best friend Malcolm X. He also wanted to let the reader know that religion should never get in the way of your personal life. The book said that the only thing in Ali's life that Ali regrets is \\"his cruel and hasty rejection of Malcolm.\\" Now days, Ali looks back at Malcolm X with great respect. The main point Remnick was trying to communicate with his audience was that Ali stood up for what he believed in. Not only in the boxing ring but, also with his religious and political beliefs. In 1966, Muhammad Ali refused to be drafted to fight the war in Vietnam. The government threatened to take away his heavyweight championship and throw him into a federal prison for the next five years. Ali still refused. When they asked him why he refused to fight in the Vietnam war, he replied \\"I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong.\\" Eldridge Cleaver described Ali as a \\"genuine revolutionary\\" and the \\"first \`free' black champion to confront white America.\\" Writer, Jill Nelson, called Ali's refusal of the draft a \\"supreme act of defiance.\\" However, not everyone supported Ali's refusal of the draft. Conservative boxing fanscalled him an unpatriotic bum. They thought he was hiding behind his religion because he was lazy. Remnick took a much more liberal stance on the situation. The author seemed to support Ali's decision. For many years, Muhammad Ali would be both loved and hated by boxing fans of all races. Some people believe that Ali should not have been allowed to be exempt from the war because of his religion. Others looked at his exemption as an amazing defeat. The only thing anyone could agree on was his amazing abilities in the ring. In 1997, during the summer Olympics, Muhammad Ali was invited to light the Olympic torch. In my opinion, this proved Ali to be a very patriotic man. It proved that the world had never forgotten about Ali, and itnever will. Lighting the Olympic torch is one of the highest honors any athlete could be given. \\"King of the World\\" was published in 1998. Exactly one year after he lit the Olympic torch. I think that's why this book was written when it was.The ignition of the 1997 Olympic torch was Ali's return to the public eye. And this book was written to honor him."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"King of the World by David Remnick was one of the best books I've ever read. It is the true story of a champion and how he got there. I recommend anyone who likes stories about winning and glory, to read this book. If you also like reading about dudes getting smoked by a champ. Read this book."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"What else can I say -- David Remnick scores a knockout with this book. I picked it up in Harvard Square and devoured it in a day. The central figure of the book is Muhammad Ali, no doubt. However, after reading Remnick's book, you realize the pivotal roles both Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston played in building up Ali's mystique. Remnick gets you to love Ali, pity Liston, and empathize with Patterson by getting you the inside details on who these men were and what they were all about."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"David Remnick's King of the World conveys the complexity of the man Muhammad Ali, both outspoken and tender, as it traces his early years as a young aspiring boxer and the events surrounding his first heavyweight championship. The book provides an inside look at the boxing establishment in the 1950s and 1960s and how it exploited and used young African American boxers, among them Liston and Patterson. Ali is unique among the boxers of that era, sustained by a strong sense of self and purpose. I was particularly intrigued by the description of Ali's religious journey and by the inner peace that characterizes him today. This book portrays a slice of American life, exposing the beauty of one human being, the drama of his life, and the racism that could have destroyed him but did not. Read this book and enjoy it!"},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"I thought it was inspiring and heartouching. I learned a lot of things that I didn't know.

The brash young confident kid is portrayed in great detail but the portraits of the other major figures: Liston and Patterson are just as engrossing. Remnick writes well, mixes the story with telling anecdotes and chronicles Ali's rise in the context of the social changes of the time.The book is accurately called 'the rise'; you don't get a lot of the mature Ali and his fights after his comeback. My main question about the book, and it's one the book doesn't answer; exactly HOW did this sometimes loathed figure; an outsider in a religious and racial sense from the authorities, become such a modern day hero? Exactly how did that happen? There's a book there waiting to be written.In the meantime enjoy this one."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Remnick brilliantly sets up this classic and at times tragic tale with the story of Sony liston and Floyd Patterson, and how destiny decided for both their paths to meet an invincible and troublesome Cassius Clay, later to become Muhammad Ali. One can almost smell the sweat and feel the blood in this inspiring and breathtaking true story of the dark and seedy world of boxing during the mob days. Like life, in boxing there are winners and losers. As Ali rose to fame and fortune Liston sank to despair and obscurity. This great book paints the gritty and stark picture of the reality of the ring in that classic age, when a cocky young man named Cassius Clay not only drew a line in the dirt, but spit that dirt in anyone's eye who dared question his dedication and greatness. A timeless book and must read for any Ali fan, or fan of boxing in general."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"This bestselling biography of Muhammad Ali is an excellently written page-turner which not only captures Ali's rise to greatness, but also the political undercurrents of the era."},{"Title":"King of the World","review":"Superb book.

I've read the others (excluding Hill's book on Baroque Music not yet released), and while it's good, it's unfortunately the weakest of the lot.The book is geared for graduate study in music, and is a little too heady for beginners (by the way, the book's title refers only to Western music in the Classic Period, c.1760-1830).Downs takes a chronological approach to the subject, but begins with a boring introduction on Eighteenth-century philosophy and musical aesthetics. This really is a shame, because the rest of the book (if you make it through) happens to be much better.Downs covers the early emergence of Classic music out of the Baroque, and then follows with two short chapters on the first halves of Haydn and Mozart, respectively. After another interlude on music and other aspects during the Classic Period, Downs resumes with Haydn, Mozart, adds some Beethoven, and then leads the transition into the nineteenth century.Despite the boring beginning, Downs' writing style is still very rigorous and scholarly. He makes many references to the book's sister, the Norton Anthology of Classical Music, and provides the most in-depth analyses of the entire Norton Series.I feel bad giving the book three stars, but the other books by Atlas, Plantinga, Morgan and Hoppin are all better. Reinhard Pauly's book is also out there, but it's shorter and I haven't read it. Norton also published Charles Rosen's book Classical Style in 1999, which may be in response to this volume.I must say, however, that on information alone, this book is very good and can be a great reference."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The Era of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven (The Norton Introduction to Music History)","review":"Downs Classical Music is intended for upper-level undergrads and graduate students in music. I use it in my 500-level class because the historical account is very comprehensive, including substantial references to sources that would otherwise have to be assigned as outside reading. The book begins with a detailed account of the late Baroque and Pre-Classic era, information that students have often forgot from their introductory courses. The analyses of works are generally good. There are some drawbacks that need to be addressed. First, the accompanying Anthology contains a wide variety of works, but almost no complete works. Students are deprived of complete sonatas, symphonies, concerti and other longer works. Also there is no set of recordings to accompany the Anthology. Many works in the Anthology require real digging to find a recording. Finally, the last chapter gathers all of Beethoven's works together as a kind of afterthought. Right now I can't find a more informative text for my students."},{"Title":"Classical Music: The Era of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven (The Norton Introduction to Music History)","review":"This book is excellent for both students and teachers who are studying the Classic Era of music history.

She was going to be the best shepherd in Bray Valley history. And any wolf who tried to eat her sheep had better watch out!&quot; Well Zimmo, the last wolf on the mountain, had other ideas. He was very hungry and he had a plan to outwit this new shepherd. The next day, just as Betsy was getting started, Zimmo appeared. Quickly, she blew her whistle and cried wolf, and the townspeople came running. But when they arrived, all they saw was Betsy and the sheep. Zimmo had cleverly disappeared. Betsy got a lecture. Later in the day, the whole episode repeated itself, and this time, Betsy was sent back to Shepherd School for a little refresher course. The next morning, the town decided to give her one last chance. She took the sheep up to the pasture and there was the wolf again. But this time, Betsy takes matters into her own hands..... Gail Carson Levine's comical twist on the old, Boy Who Cried Wolf folktale, stars a feisty and endearing heroine, but the story is a bit too pat and predictable, lacks the drama of the original, and concludes with a silly ending that just doesn't ring true. The real star of this book is illustrator, Scott Nash. His bold, bright, and hilarious, cartoon-like illustrations, complete with witty, sheep asides and thought balloons are engaging, expressive, and filled with eye-catching detail. Perfect for youngsters 4-8, Betsy Who Cried Wolf is not the best of the fractured folktale/fairy tale genre, but it's worth a read, if only for a peek at Nash's wonderful artwork."},{"Title":"Betsy Who Cried Wolf","review":"I read the book Betsy who cried wolf its about how Betsy whose a shepherd.

Then the wolf comes again and she cries wolf but no farmers came so the wolf was really hungry and so Betsy gave him some pie and then while Betsy was getting her shirt un pricked from a pricker bush the sheep were going down a mountain there would of died if the wolf didn't save them because the wolf turned good. Then as for thanks she asked him to stay with her.I liked the book because it was different then other books and most people because people don't like all of the books about one book they like different books about another thing.The message is if someone needs help then help him or her because Betsy helped the wolf then at the end the wolf helped Betsy.The vocabulary is just right for kids between 8-10 because I'm 9 and its just right for me.The conflict is that at firstthe wolf is Betsy's enemy then they become friends. Because the wolf kept tricking her and he got her in trouble.The illustrations are great because they have great details and they're colorful.The characters are great because they're different then other characters in other books.I don't think there are any other versions but if there are I would like to read them.I think the indented audience is for people that have a lot of imagination because they have talking animals and you would have to use your imagination."},{"Title":"Betsy Who Cried Wolf","review":"Hands down, this is my daughter's FAVORITE bedtime book.

Grove Day, tell a wild variety of stories from the horror of the Globe Mutinity to the incredible adventures of Coxinga, pirate of the South Pacific. If you want to know the true story of Captain Bligh, the man of mutinies, you'll find there's much more to the story than in the movies.The theme here is that for centuries civilized man has dreamed of island life with beautiful willing women and few rules or responsibilities. This book shows the folly and tragedy of many and the luck and fortune of some who made it work. I have read most of these stories multiple times and find this a book that remains interesting. As always, Michener is well researched and quite compelling."},{"Title":"Rascals in Paradise","review":"Great book about the dreamers of the South Pacific.

That's what I was expecting when I picked this book up, since I'm a Michener fan from back far enough so I had to use my mother's library card to check out his books (for some strange reason the Children's Room librarian wouldn't let me have them!). On that level - whether or not this volume of true stories met my expectations - I'm disappointed. I'm not sure if it's because of the co-author's influence on Michener's style, but that definitely could be it. There's a certain academic dryness here that I don't remember from any other Michener work. Or is it because the people depicted are just so unremittingly BAD that spending time with them isn't fun?In any case, these are well-researched chronicles of the lives of some through-and-through rascals who did their evil deeds from the 16th Century through the first part of the 20th. There's plenty of irony, plenty of historical detail, and plenty of adventure. I found it depressing, but I recognize that as a personal reaction. Its premise, pointed out by the authors at the book's beginning, is definitely borne out: the \\"refuge\\" so many men and women have sought, and continue to seek, in Polynesia just isn't there to find. \\"Wherever you go, there you are?\\" So very true - and I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed recognizing some of the true stories on which elements of Michener's beloved novel \\"Hawaii\\" are based."},{"Title":"Rascals in Paradise","review":"This is a wonderful collection of short stories that are bound to please. a cant miss!!!"},{"Title":"Rascals in Paradise","review":"quick delivery - received as shown without dust coverand way too musky - can hardly read with my asthma-sorry to say but true.cheap so it is also true that u get what u pay for."},{"Title":"Rascals in Paradise","review":"It was not so good a Michener book.

Gallagher focuses his reader's attention on several quite different companies which include The Vanguard Group, Wendy's, AutoNation, Dell Computer, Cirque du Soleil, and the St. Paul Saints. The same core values and non-negotiable principles which these companies not only illustrate but indeed celebrate can also be found in other exemplary companies such as Edward Jones, Container Store, Alston &amp; Bird, Xilinx, and Adobe Systems.Gallagher helps his reader to understand her or his own business culture, how \\"strategists\\" drive operational excellence, how \\"motivators\\" create a positive working environment, how \\"team builders\\" maximize the ROI of human capital, how the \\"nimble\\" help to establish and strengthen an infrastructure for change, how \\"customer champions\\" build an enduring service culture, how the \\"passionate\\" help to create a sense of business as a way of life, and how \\"visionaries\\" provide their organization with an awareness of a higher purpose. He also explains why so many corporate cultures fail and why rigorous and comprehensive \\"cultural due diligence\\" must be completed prior to mergers, acquisitions, and other growth strategies.He concludes this brilliant book with some timely observations: \\"While corporate culture has become a fashionable term to describe the core values that drive an organization, it is also very misleading, because corporate implies that corporate culture is purely the domain of large corporations and high-flying CEOs. It also implies a certain powerlessness on the part of the individual. In reality, neither could be further from the truth.\\" He goes on to reiterate that every organization of any size \\"has its own culture, and its leaders exert tremendous influence over the values that drive that culture.\\" However, each individual within any culture has the power to define the values within her or his own working environment. At least to some extent, each individual also has the power to change the current values of the organization. Of course, there are some situations which become intolerable, situations which lack both meaning and purpose for certain people.Gallagher insists (and again, I agree with him completely) that, ultimately, the soul of any organization is no more and no less than the shared values of that organization as revealed in the behavior of those involved. When lists of the most admired companies are formulated, it is no coincidence that those on the list are also the most profitable within their respective industries. For each of them, culture IS strategy. Decision-makers who challenge that are among those in greatest need of what Gallagher offers -- with eloquence as well as precision -- in this book.Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Daniel Goleman's Primal Leadership, David Maister's Practice What You Preach, and Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba's Creating Customer Evangelists."},{"Title":"The Soul of an Organization: Understanding the Values That Drive Successful Corporate Cultures","review":"While not a badly written book, it somehow completely failed to deliver on it's title as far as I was concerned.

Once the police realized the enormity behind the find they had found, they called in the scientists.The subsequent research was so contraversial, that it has been &quot;hushed&quot; and is only found on a few PBS stations and this little book.Personally, I have to wonder if this &quot;frozen man&quot; was a child or grandchild of Adam.I am a scientist, but I am a Christian, and this book about this hushed discovery once again smashes those two worlds together.If you are a person who endeavors to pull this two worlds togethers, you would really enjoy this book.

I highly recommend it, rating it 5 stars, although there is one printing mistake on page 28, line 14: the first coin should be 5 cents instead of 1 cent.

He is an over-rated, highly over-priced Manhattan doctor who said nothing new about connection between infections and fertility. What is all hype about? Haven't you ever heard that chlamydia can cause infertility? His \\"innovative\\" theory about horizontal and vertical transmittance of infection is extremely dubious and not scientifically confirmed.But yes, he knows how to make good money on people's fertility problems by using his fame. Everything that has been successfully treated for years in Europe presented by arrogant, self-obsessed doctor Atilla Toth as a great \\"revelation\\" for which he feels legitimate to charge about 20K from a couple.What's wrong with you, guys?

I only hope more women learn of his methods."},{"Title":"Fertile Vs. Infertile: How Infections Affect Your Fertility And Your Baby's Health","review":"I have the utmost respect for Dr. Toth's crucial work which is clearly described in this book. I was referred to Dr. Toth by several women who regained health and achieved successful pregnancies after Dr. Toth treated them for chronic infections not addressed by other physicians. Although I consulted many well-respected NYC specialists for pelvic pain and malaise, only Dr. Toth diagnosed and treated my condition correctly. Despite normal laboratory findings and a history of very few sexual partners, a laparoscopy revealed an active pelvic infection. I referred a friend to Dr. Toth and she delivered a healthy baby after Dr. Toth treated her and her husband for infection. A physician they had consulted previously, had diagnosed genital infection as a probable cause of their inferitlity, yet inadequately treated their condition. Recent research correlates medical deseases such as heart disease with chronic infections. Dr. Toth outlines the connection between medical problems, low-grade infections and reproductive difficulties. Dr. Toth therefore emphasizes the importance of adquately treating genital track infections prior to planning for childbearing. I am using a pen name because of the sensitive nature of this topic. I feel so grateful that I learned of Dr. Toth and and benefited from his work. I was so pleased to see this book as it will likely help a larger number of women and couples be exposed to Dr. Toth's critical findings."},{"Title":"Fertile Vs. Infertile: How Infections Affect Your Fertility And Your Baby's Health","review":"READ THIS BEFORE YOU PROCEED TO IUI or IVF. I mean it. Outstanding in every way. Hard to imagine that it might apply to you, but read it anyway. Once you realize that infections can be passed down in utero (meaning you could have gotten them from your parents or in-laws) and that traditional STD testing AND traditional treatment methods only mask the problem, you begin to accept that perhaps pathogens are playing a role in your infertility. Know that if you have undiagnosed harmful bacteria in your uterus, and you succeed in getting pregnant without being propery treated, you are playing Russian roulette with your baby's life and health. Learn about the connection between prostate cancer and heart disease in parents (like yours) and a baby's future infertility (you could be that baby!) I've met several women who went to this doctor and were stunned to find out what they tested positive for... They realized they'd had symptoms they didn't even know meant anything (like frequent urination) when they were really signs of low-lying infection.

Infertile: How Infections Affect Your Fertility And Your Baby's Health","review":"Dr Toth is a remarkable man. His work and treatment are simple but groundbreaking. In a world where those experiencing infertility are sent hurtling towards high-tech (and high cost) procedures such as IVF, his advice seems almost mundane yet it flies in the face of current medical thinking - fix the cause not the symptom. He believes, and his practice shows, that chronic infections cause many of todays reproductive problems; problems that can often be easily remedied with an extended course of antibiotics. Even more astounding, he purports that infections cause many of the diseases we are facing today - diabetes, heart disease, even some cancers. He talks about how infections can be passed from partner to partner but also from mother to child. The more I read his work and evidence, more convinced I became. As someone who has benefitted tremendously from reproductive medicine but has also seen it fail in a tragic way, I have become convinced that Dr Toth is onto something here. Testing of all couples prior to pregnancy is the only sensible outcome of his work but beyond that, his work has huge implications for the way we manage our overall health and medicine in general. We all should read his book, whether facing infertility or not, and take heed."},{"Title":"Fertile Vs.

Han is still reeling over the death of Chewbacca. He hooks up with an old friend who tells him about a group of smugglers who have made an alliance with the enemy. A great deal of the book revolves around how he persues this group of rouges. The characters introduced in this book are pretty cool. The Ryn character that kind of attatches to Han is very cool. As I understand, part of the reason Chebacca was killed, is that it was hard to work with his POV, Point Of View. This new character can speak, so therefore, a POV can be used. . .

I hope the sequel is just as good."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"The book is ok. It was good to see more of Han after he had to make place for this Corran-creature in the last two books. Yet I missed the other characters. It's really a Han-book but it's not that bad because the next one makes up for the lack of other characters in this book.The whole story with Elan was good but the end was very disappointing because she didn't achieve anything. Well, at least Vergere seems to have cured Mara, which I didn't expect to happen that quickly."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Any Star Wars fan who has read any of his books, not to mention the ones in the X-Wing Series, knew that this book would not disappoint. And it did not. We finally get to delve into the mind on Han Solo, who has had a rough time since the loss of his partner Chewbacca. Han must quickly put his life back in order, because the Yuuzhan Vong are not going to stop for his loss. So without help, he goes back to his smuggling days. He soon finds out that an old friend is working for a group called the Peace Brigade, a group affiliated with the Yuuzhan Vong. What will Han do? The only thing he can: honor Chewbacca's death."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"A bit of a turn in the series. This book brings Han Solo back into the fold (after a 2 book absence) and essentially focuses on him and a Yuuzong Vong infiltration agent. Not a bad story, but I missed the events surrounding Jedi. There was practically no use of the force in this book. As these books develop, I am quite happy to see that this is really just one long series. Each book, new author or not, takes off exactly where the last one left off. Since this galactic war is on a huge scale, this could run for at least 10 or more books. We'll see what happens."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"While I was glad to at last see Han coming out of his grief and fighting again, at the same time I felt that other aspects of the story were somewhat neglected. However, writing and plot wise, I'd say this is probably one of the best installments to come along yet. I was also pleased to finally see a book that focused almost exclusively on the adult characters. The kids are great, but I'd hate to see them replace Luke, Leia, Mara and Han and the like too soon. Anyway, in this book the Vong decide that the fastest way to defeat the New Republic would be to destroy their greatest asset; the Jedi. They dispatch the Priestess Elan, equiped with a killing biological weapon living inside her, along with her 'familier' Vergere (Rogue Planet anyone?) to go and feign deffection to the New Republic in order to get close enough to the Jedi to destroy them. Elan claims to have information about a disease her people infected one of the Jedi with (Mara of course). Anyway, Mara continues to fight the disease the Vong infected her with, but she's losing at best, and is now practically on her deathbed. Meanwhile Han's grief over Chewie has turned into a lust for revenge, and he heads out with an old smuggler pal of his to hunt down Reck Desh, a leader of a bizarre group of people called the Peace Brigade, allied with the Vong, who believe the only way to stop the Vong is to give them what they want. Anyway, this book is quite a bit more intracite then some of the others. Though it focuses mainly on Han, there are many other subplots revolving around each other. It's pretty intense at times, so I can't say I'd recommend it to kids, though teenagers and adults will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"It was a slow beginning, reading this book. The first couple chapters, nothing important seemed to happen and hello, where was the action? There simply wasn't anything, until you start to read the beginning of the climax, which wasn't too bad. But the beginning was too slow for me. It reminded me of reading Vector Prime regarding the Vong's invasion - nothing but detail, detail and more detail without action."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I didn't like the direction 'Vector Prime' started in, but the 'Dark Tide' duology helped remedy that to an extent. It is done once more here, and we finally get back to good ol' Han. It's a nice touch after the very depressing 'Ruin' to see one of the big heroes in action.One flaw I've had with the previous books is how they skipped around every which way with their plotlines. The Civil War-era stories often had centralized plots that focused on a certain situation, not the whole galactic face. 'Hero's Trial' is more of a focused work, by far the most in the series. Han's quest is an interesting one, and the galactic situation is well done, too.And the Republic actually wins a battle! Throghout the seires they had tried to hard to mkae it seem dark that all the battles were incredibly bloody for both sides. For once the Republic kicks some Yuuzhan Vong butt. I also like the connections with the largely ignored 'Black Fleet Crisis' books. Kudos to Luceno for finally tieing in elemnts from there and thus helping to validify the whole series. The Vong defector and the Vergere elements are interesting and produce a tie-in with 'Rogue Planet' as well. Overall its a good book, and highly reccomended for Han Solo fans."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was full of emotion and character development. Luceno did his homework and give Han Solo his life back. I felt that the character Droma give the story some badly needed humor."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Han continues to deal with his internal pain, seemingly finally snapping in this book as he flies off on on his own adventure to help an old friend.The set up is pretty good, with Han taking on some different personality characterisitcs than normal, adding some variety to his well known behavior. He meets a new ally, Droma, who while interesting, is pretty two dimensional and will eventually get boring.Despite being an obvious set up for many events to come, the book still maintains its interest. You get to see some new Yuuzhan Vong ships and weapons, and the followed characters manage to get in trouble no matter which way they turn.While not the best of the New Jedi Order series, the book manages to keep you entertained throughout and is worth reading."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"James Luceno has earned my eternal gratitude with HERO'S TRIAL, for he has put the fun back in Han Solo. I fondly remember watching Star Wars for the first time almost ten years ago, and like so many others, my life was changed. The reason for this wasn't Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader, the epic space battles or the Force...it was Han Solo.Going into my first viewing of Star Wars, I had heard all there was to hear about lightsabers and the Force, of the Death Star and it's demise. I expected all of that. What I didn't expect was the humour, the sarcasm, the wit, all supplied by the scoundrel Han Solo. He was the fun and excitement of Star Wars, for me anyway, and since The Empire Strikes Back, I haven't felt that again.Since his union with Princess Leia, Han has become a general in the New Republic, a family man, and compared to the rogue of his earlier days, a pansy. Han is an upstanding citizen now...HAN SOLO! That's ridiculous. She has taken all of the swagger from a man who's swagger defined him. To me, he's a different character from the one we met in Mos Eisley.But along comes the New Jedi Order, along comes the death of Chewbacca, and BOOM! Han is back! Widely regarded as a terrible idea, I believe that Chewie's death is one of the smartest ideas ever conceived in the Extended Universe, because it gave Han back his cynicism, his biting humour, his impatience and do-it-alone attitude. But most importantly, it finally gave Han a partner as equally fun as himself, someone who Han can bounce off of and actually have conversations with...Droma, my favorite addition to the Star Wars universe in a very long time. Together, the duo are just plain fun to read.The first 2/5's of the book didn't really grab my attention. There were some interesting moments, like Chewie's funeral and the interaction between Han and Leia, but overall, it wasn't anything special. But once Han meets up with Roa and the two go off in search of their old pal Reck Desh, things really get exciting. Once Droma appears, the story is in full swing and gaining momentum with every page. The momentum of this book is tremendous. By the end, you couldn't pry me away from this book for anything. I was completely hooked.James Luceno's characterization of Han is dead on, and he throws in tons of old-school Han catch-phrases and mannerisms. From calling everyone \\"sister\\" to throwing his finger in everyone's face, he made Han feel like Han. I loved it. And by the end of the book, when Han is coming to accept Droma, he goes so far as to let him sit in Chewie's chair, and he calls him \\"partner.\\" I thought this a nice touch and it was good to see Han dealing with Chewie's death in a way, and allowing himself to move on.If not for the slow start, I would have given HERO'S TRIAL a five-star rating, and I can't wait to sink my teeth into AGENT OF CHAOS II: JEDI ECLIPSE. PIck this one up. Droma rules."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"This book is ok. It is much better then Agents of Chaos II. The story however, revolves too much around Han Solo to the detriment of the other characters. Yes, Han Solo was ignored on the 2 Stackpole books, but to have 2 books with the main focus just on him was not really needed. The stories could have been told in one much more interesting book, than in two books that it is easy to skim through. While it was nice to see some of the characters from the Han Solo books brought back, they really did not do much to enhance the story. The addition of Droma, just made him into a Chewie clone. It was uninspired. I would much rather have seen Han working with Anakin than with Droma. The subplot involving the Ving priestess and Vergere was interesting, but really only served to reintroduce Vergere to the Star Wars universe after the few times she was mentioned in Bear's Rogue Planet. Thankfully, the disease that plagued Mara Jade is beginning to be wiped out, but Luceno ignores his more dynamic characters to settle in the stereotypical companions for Han. That said, Hero's Trial is better than its sequal, but the two Agents of Chaos books are the 2 worst books in the NJO series."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"James Luceno's command of the intricacies of the Star Wars Expanded Universe makes him one of my favorite authors of tales of the galaxy far, far away. The Agents of Chaos duology, started by Hero's Trial, finds him fitting a story into the larger framework of the New Jedi Order. Some themes from the first three volumes carry straight into Hero's Trial and are very little changed. The New Republic politicians continue to grapple with the government response to the broadening war and humanitarian crises. The arguments for and against involvement have not changed much from the prior books. The Yuuzhan Vong continue to scheme and invade worlds. We do learn more about their separate castes, including spending time with an elite member of the priest caste. Han continues to grieve for his loss depicted in Vector Prime, but in this case Mr. Luceno does take this element and expand upon it, making Han's journey through grief the central focus of the duology.Some closure is brought to the tragic events of Vector Prime as the heroes attend a funeral near the start of the story. This scene was a nice retrospective of a hero's life but it didn't pack the emotional punch one might wish for. It is more a summary of events than a deep-feeling send-off. Still, it works well enough, and sets the stage for Han's journey to come. After returning to Coruscant and meeting surprise old friend Roa (from the Han Solo Adventures), Han sets off on a journey to ascertain what has become of Roa's wife and also to deal with a new threat, the Peace Brigade. The Peace Brigade are an interesting addition, essentially mercenary traitors to the New Republic willing to sell out anyone to the Vong for money. The public persona they depict is one of reasonably working with the invaders (hence the name) but their motivations are much more selfish.Leia has given up on a wide-scale official response to the invasion and is off aiding refugees as best she can with limited resources. Otherwise she spends most of the novel reacting to Han's lashing out. Luke continues to debate with his Jedi the best course of action. At this point in the New Jedi Order, I'm ready to see the Jedi take decisive stances, but their ongoing deliberations do play well off of the tragic events involving Corran Horn in Ruin, the prior novel.The most interesting new storyline of Hero's Trial focuses on a Yuuzhan Vong priestess named Elan and her cryptic familiar Vergere. Elan is ordered to inhale a virus with intent to expel it upon a gathering of Jedi. She will accomplish this by pretending to be a defector. Her loyalty is never in doubt through her story arc, but Vergere's is considerably more intriguing, especially her last action of the story. Her role is greatly expanded upon in future novels but is well introduced here, and for readers who have already explored Mr. Luceno's prequel-era novel Cloak of Deception, her appearance here is extremely interesting indeed.Mr. Luceno does introduce an entertaining, if rather stereotyped, companion for Han to travel with in the form of Droma, a Ryn. Droma has some lively sparring with Han and a few genuine laugh-out-loud moments. The hanging plotline at the end involves Droma; otherwise Hero's Trial is largely self-contained (with the exception of the overall invasion which of course continues through all nineteen books). I always thoroughly enjoy Mr. Luceno's ability to reference past events and characters of the Expanded Universe and that does not disappoint here. What does disappoint a bit is that the story doesn't seem necessary, with the possible exception of redemption for Han. Most of the larger plot elements just spin along and the Yuuzhan Vong invasion feels very similar at the end to how it did at the start."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Hero's Trial is a mixed bag. Some parts of the book are quite enjoyable and well-done; others fall flat. On the whole, this is a lackluster book coming from a rather strong series. It simply fails to live up to the standard of excellence that Michael Stackpole set with Books II and III, and it is not quite as interesting or well-written as Book I, which is itself a problematic read but does decently with characterization and plot.I rather liked the first third of Hero's Trial--Chewbacca's memorial service is rather well done and there is some meaningful Han/Leia interaction--but the book pretty much falls apart after that. First of all, Luceno cannot write a space battle. He spends several pages on each of the few major battles that take place, but instead of relating details of strategy and the progress of the battle, he fills the space with meaningless, if florid, descriptions: \\"Asteroidlike coralskippers, varying in size, shape, and color, advanced in an unstoppable cloud, forging through the intense hail and swarming into the midst of the starfighter groups. Well-maintained formations broke apart as crafts peeled away to all sides, barrel- and snap-rolling into furious engagements with their quarries. In a bloodbath of swirling combat, coralskipper preyed on starfighter and starfighter on coralskipper\\" (180). This is all very pretty, though rather silly for the excess of adjectives, but it paints nothing more than a general tableau of \\"space battle.\\" Part of the problem is that we don't know anyone in any of the battles, so Luceno has no obvious character(s) to follow--a problem that stems from his book having such a narrow focus (it deals more or less exclusively with Han). Luceno tries to fix the impersonal nature of the fighting in a later battle by tracking one X-wing, but the pilot is no one we've ever heard of before, and we never hear of him again--not to mention that Luceno renders rather little of the pilot's thought process and actions. In a book about a war, this failure to describe or engage with military combat is rather disappointing--especially because this book follows on the heels of Michael Stackpole's duology, and if ever there was a master of battle-description, it was Stackpole.Aside from the trouble with writing combat, Luceno falls into a few other traps. Around the middle of the book, he makes a typical Star Wars novel mistake by constantly quoting the movies. Han Solo is a quarter of a century older than he was in the films. You'd think he'd have expanded his vocabulary a little in that time. Also, in the second half of the book Luceno's writing shows signs of influence from Kevin J. Anderson, author of the most abominable Star Wars books ever written, the Jedi Academy Trilogy. The events are melodramatic, the characters act stupidly, and the dialogue is like slap-stick comedy. Particularly annoying is a scene at the start of ch. 20 in which the Jedi hold a council that reeks of Kevin J: the characters act with uncharacteristic idiocy, deciding that something obviously suspicious is really okay and that the best way to deal with it anyway is to be insanely optimistic just because \\"we're all together!\\" What really gets me is that Wurth Skidder, undeniably the least wise and intelligent of the Jedi (i'm not kidding--check his stats in the NJO Sourcebook if you don't believe me), is the only one who says anything rational or intelligent at the meeting. Anyway, Luceno draws the scene to a close by refering to events directly out of the Jedi Academy Trilogy, confirming the source of his Jedi's behavior.Finally, Luceno's language lacks clarity. At times this makes the plot rather confusing. There are things he just fails to explain adequately--fine points of the bo'tous toxin, details of one character's death, etc. At other times, he trips on his overly-developed vocabularly. He uses (and sometimes abuses) far too many SAT words, which create clutter and just make his writing sound silly.Don't get me wrong, though. The book isn't all bad. I really appreciate Luceno's insistance on re-using characters from past Star Wars novels--it lends credence to the fact that the books really tell one continuous, canonical story. Sometimes he overdoes it, writing entire chapters that talk about what happened in previous books, but it is good to see that not all characters in this universe show up once and then evaporate. Luceno also writes several passages of inspired characterization and inner monologue. In particular, I think he does rather well with Threepio, giving the reader an internal view of the droid that is rare in the books, and treating him with the appropriate mix of levity and seriousness. Luceno also does some interesting and appropriate things with Han's character and with Han's marriage to Leia, though I wonder if the credit for this belongs with the committee that designed the plot for the entire series. Similarly, he introduces Vergere, who will later become enormously important, and he builds her up as a convincingly ambiguous and mysterious character. Finally, I actually somewhat enjoyed Droma. His banter could be a little too much at times, but it was far more interesting than Luceno's excessively serious description. Also, Droma actually seemed to have a touch of depth to him--that is, he was a bit more interesting than a stereotype, which is more than I can say for some of the other Star Wars characters I've met."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"This is a well written book. There's been a lot of griping that Luceno left out many major characters entirely or gave them cursory roles, but I think that was absolutely necessary for what he was trying to accomplish. This book is FAR and away more character driven than anything Stackpole is capable of writing. Luceno made the characters of Han and Leia in particular far more believable than many of the other SW have lately. Far more real. Human. It was a nice break from a rather stale mold, but there is nothing about their characters you won't recognize. They are just much more alive than they have been in awhile.In fairness, this is not much of an action book, and I expect that is why a number of people have been giving it low marks. Oh well. If DelRey can keep authors with as much talent as Bear, Salvatore, and Luceno on the project, the books will be worth reading. I'm not interested in knowing exactly how an X-wing is flown, really. I'm far more interested in the characters themselves. This is their story, afterall.Heh. This has kind of turned into a Stackpole gripe. I'm just tired of hearing him touted as one of the &quot;best Star Wars authors&quot; in the same sentence as people like Zahn who paid as much attention to militaristic detail without sacrificing good character weaving. Luceno isn't the best there is, but he's good to be sure."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"The Agents of Chaos series kicks off with a rousing Han Solo adventure that brings some much needed levity to the New Jedi Order proceedings. Han may be dour and grumpy, but he's far more entertaining that the brooding Jedi we spent the last two books with. Luceno puts the focus back on the core characters (Han and Threepio especially), and as such, the book just feels more...Star Wars-y.If you're an Expanded Universe junkie, though, fret not! There are more references to the Pre-Jedi Order books than you can shake a gimer stick at. It's almost as though Luceno's editors asked him to throw these tidbits in to assuage fan worries that those books were being ignored. Believe me, those worries are no longer justified.Hero's Trial also resolves some long-standing issues from Vector Prime (think Mara Jade) and ends on a pseudo-cliffhanger. I'm not sure I like Han's questionable familial ethics here, but I'm sure he'll redeem himself in the next book...or not. That's really the beauty of these NJO books: long character arcs where anything can, and usually does, happen.All in all, if you dig the New Jedi Order, you'll dig Hero's Trial. It's good, swashbuckling fun for geeks of all ages."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I have read some of Luceno's other work, namely the Robotech books. While he is usually a great writer, honestly this is the first book of the New Jedi Order which seems to telegraph the plot turns in advance too much. You know exactly what will happen, and when it will happen. It's predictability seems overly cliched as well. Still it is decent, but not as good as his Robotech work."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"James Luceno has done an excellent job of continuing the saga. His handling of Han through his depression and bringing on a new side kick was superbly handled. While die hard Chewbacca fans are still strugling through the loss, realist understand that creatures die in conflicts. I can't wait until book II hits the mailbox."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"This is certainly a more than adequate follow up to the excellent Dark Tide duology by Stackpole. Luceno, no stranger to Sci-fi, takes Han back to the days before the Empire, when he was just a smuggler trying to eke out a living on the wrong side of the law. Indeed, Luceno makes several references to Brian Daley's classic Solo adventures. It seems to me that each NJO book focuses on different characters. In HT, it was Han, in DT it was the Solo kids, etc. On the downside, the Vong seem to be getting even easier to kill, yet they plow right on towards the Core. This is, all in all, a good follow-up to DT, and I eagerly await Jedi Eclipse and Balance Point. But one thing I don't get is, how are they going to stretch this Vong thing into 30 novels? Anyone with ideas, please e-mail me."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Luceno did a great job capturing Han Solo's personality. I rank him up there with the likes of Daley and Crispin. Luceno also provided plenty of action, humor, and tidbits from past novels. He has created a terrific new character in Droma. I highly recommend this book to any Star Wars fan."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"This book definitely shows a different side of Han Solo.

After the mopey Han we've seen in the last few installments, it's good to see him have an adventure again. This novel is exactly that, Han Solo's adventure. Luceno does it quite well also. He sets up the book quickly without belaboring every point, and then action begins relentlessly from one chapter to the next.

Needless to say, I loved this book, and i suggest it to any one with a sense of justice and love and an imagination."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"For those of you looking for more of Han, look no further, for James Luceno has him brilliantly portrayed in this excellent novel. It seems that he is finally coming to grips with the loss of Chewbacca. And one of my old favorites, Tenel Ka, is at least *mentioned* which is far more than I can say for her in the *other* NJO series. However...Where were Anakin, Jacen, and Jaina, not to mention Danni Quee? Same question for Corran, Wedge, Gavin, some more rogues, Janson, Tycho... call me retro, but I love those guys! Lowie and Waroo (wasn't he called 'Lumpy' in earlier books or was that my imagination?) don't really have significant parts either, although I can hardly begrudge James Luceno for that- if I had it my way the book would be a thousand pages long (that way I probably wouldn't be done before the next book comes out- on second thought, I'd have it done in a week, maximum). All in all, a brilliant piece of science fiction. Yay James Luceno!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I was wondering when Han would stop moping around after the loss of Chewbacca and get back into his old wisecracking self. I also liked running into his old smuggler pal Roa again, as well as the fact that the Vong are slowly assuming their rightful place as easy-to-vaporize cannon fodder. Han also gets a new pal of sorts, Droma the ever-so-amusing Ryn with eccentric personality traits and insights into the universe in general. There's also confirmation of any suspicions you've ever had about the similarity between sabacc cards and tarot cards, and an amusing Indiana Jones misquote to boot."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"The first three books in this series were compelling and well written. They introduced characters well and like any good space opera, was liberal with the action.This book however fails to live up to that standard in my opinion. Firstly, it's focussing almost entirely on Han Solo, who I'm bored of. His constant winging about Chewbacca dying is tiresome and annoying and by the time you reach the end of the book you're not brimming over with sympathy but bubbling with frustration. Whoever said \\"older and wiser\\" never meant this to be applied to Han Solo obviously. He's written like he's still unmarried and in his 30's. It's unbelievable and insulting.The writing style also annoys me. It's hard to get into the story because it's very disjointed and not written in a way that ties things together neatly. You're left with a feeling of \\"what?\\" whenever a new chapter begins.I'm reading this only because I want to get past it to a book written by a better storyteller. It disheartens me that he has written The Unifying Force because as the last book in this series, I was hoping it would be good. Here's hoping he writes Jedi better than he does old smugglers."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Don't get me wrong - I love the Star Wars novels and wouldn't miss one for the world. Also, I feel that the New Jedi Order series has been quite excellent so far overall. But did NO other reviewer get really fed up with the constant (and I am talking nearly every page here!) references thrown in to adventures 20 or more years in the Star Wars time line's past? They were so constant that it became quite taxing to read. The new stuff with the Vong was a worthy continuation of the plotline; however, the references to Solo's past and the lack of almost any original dialogue from any of the principle characters detract severely from this book's readability.Also, it contains a couple of errors that were annoying in a pesky kind of way - such as when earlier on in the book he mentions that Solo's donated his blaster to the New Republic's war museum and then about 50 pages later he's pulling it out of a cupboard in his apartment and dusting it off...Loyal readers will, like me, continue to buy books like this to keep up with the story; however, if the style is indicative of things to come, then I will be sadly disappointed."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"WARNING!!!! Review does contain one SPOILER!!!So i have really enjoyed reading the first three books of the New Jedi Order series. However i do not believe \\"Hero's Trial\\" holds up to the standards the first three set. It was time to hear about Han and what he has been doing for the past 6 months. So i liked the idea of having a book focused more on his character. However, the story written by James Luceno just never had me fully engaged and longing to read the next chapter. Luceno was very descriptive but that description never helped me understand the story or situation better. Although it was a good attempt, i did not like how we read about chewie's funeral from C3PO's perspective. He's a droid for crying out loud!! He doesn't feel emotion on understand human death!! Why waist time reading about how he's trying to understand that. I wanted to know what was going through Han and the rest of his families minds. I like how characters from Hans past were introduced and i also liked the new character Droma. One last thing... WARNING!!! SPOILER!!!... I thought it was really random how Han all of the sudden finds and gets a hold of the cure for Mara. That plot has been building for three books and going on and on about how its Mara's battle and then all of the sudden Han finds it at the end of the book and it just happens to begin healing her. It just didn't feel right to me.Over all, good attempt, good ideas, but i just felt they were poorly written and poorly executed, which led to the book not being as engaging as i would have liked. But if your like me and have to read through the series in order then you'l just have to read it. Hopefully the second book will be better."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"The Agents of Chaos novels have related storylines, but they function as stand-alone novels as well. Hero's Trial has two main story arcs - Han Solo, who is finally coming to grips with Chewbacca's death, and the Yuuzhan Vong's latest plan to harm the New Republic by killing the Jedi.Han uses his thirst for vengeance to get out of a drunken slump. He runs into an old friend who conveniently is looking to stop a former associate who is working for the Yuuzhan Vong through an organization known as the Peace Brigade. This part of the novel is just fine, the sort of material you expect for this series.However, the Yuuzhan Vong plan isn't all that exciting because the reader is given all the behind-the-scenes information. This eliminates most of the suspense and instead turns it into a guessing game - how far will they get before they are stopped? The novel would be much more enjoyable if the Yuuzhan Vong's plan was only hinted at instead of explicitly spelled out.The novel ends with Han finding his old self and saving the day. Overall it was a decent read, but I don't know if it warrants a re-read in the future."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Those who question the direction Star Wars novels have taken should read 'Hero's Trial'. Dealing with the continuing invasion of sinister alien forces, this book deals more with Han Solo than any of the past New Jedi Order books had. This makes it a plus for any fans of the original characters from the films. Also, the novel manages to move the Yuuzhan Vong invasion story along, keeping the continuity in the books more plausable. Star Wars stories are definately on the upswing."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"In a series that I, a devoted Star Wars fan haven't liked much so far, Hero's Trial was a welcome addition. From the beginning, Luceno captures the spirit of the characters very well, and keeps the intrigue up without having to include mindless action. I love his portrayal of Han; I think that his is the best representation of Han that has ever been done, with the possible exception of A.C. Crispin's work in her Han Solo Trilogy. The introduction of Roa is interesting, although his recitation of classic Star Wars lines is cheesy, repetitive, and downright stupid. Other than that, however, this is an excellent book in what, so far, has been a lackluster series."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"James Luceno did his homework, and he sure kept the New Jedi Order going. I just wanted to stop by and comment that I enjoyed the book and refused to set it aside to read another until I was done."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Okay, so when I first started the book, it went by very slowly an hoped as I read on, it would get better. Thank God it did. The funeral of Chewie was so touching and Han's journey to redemption was beautiful...even while reading this, I thought to myself, how great Droma and Han fit together. I know Droma will never replace Chewie, but I think Han likes him. And Luke &amp; Mara, not enough page time as they did in the Darktide Duology. I mean, it stated on the back cover that Luke was trying to keep the Jedi together. In the book, we don't even see this happen. The storyline was mainly focused on Han and Leia. I remember, even one in part, Han thought if he survived he would reconnect with Anakin. That's the part that really got me."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"This is a great book! I have read all of the New Jdi order books out so far. This one was good and had me up late because I was so hooked. The only negative is that this whole series is written by many diffrent authors so it seems like peoples personalties change. The Yuzhaan Vong attackers seem more human in this book than in the one before it. you see the story from their view a bit more. There is alot of interesting plot. I thought that the last book in this series, Ruin, left alot of things to build on in this book but than I was suprised to not see some of those things. Like we never heard of the Empire in this book while in the last book the Empire helped the new republic fight the Yuzhaan Vong and they seemed to form an allanice. But all in all a very good book."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Just when you were cursing Del Ray for it's new twisted take on star wars. James Luceno comes along and ties the new series to the old. Some times I feel that the other(meaning any one not named Zahn) star wars writers have never Dueled with a plastic Lightsaber, waited in line for tickets, played the computer games, or seen the movies over and over. James Luceno changes that. He really knows the universe inside and out."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I started the book and couldnt put it down i finished it in two days and didnt want it to end the over all writing was good and it was full of emotion. however it is not the best book in the series. i would indeed recomend it however."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"While this is not one of my favorite Star Wars books it is an interesting story. A large part of it is about Han and the way that he handles loosing Chewie. It is also about how his family (Leia, Jacon, Jaina, and Anakin) are affected by this."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Since Heir to the Empire was first released, I have read nearly every Star Wars book that has been published based on George Lucas' universe. The New Jedi Order Series, though written by various authors, has left me screaming for what happens next whenever I finish the latest. A complement to the series is Rogue Planet, which actually comes in after Phantom Menace (Episode I), but eludes to the existence of the Yuuzhan Vong, the new enemy that approximately 50 years later will begin to decimate the galaxy we all have come to know in the Star Wars craze. I highly recommend the entire series to anyone who wants a fast-moving story and an utterly terrifying look at a new, seemingly undefeatable, foe."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I'd give it another have star, but they don't have a box for that. Han is back, but I feel you'll find him a little different. He still seems to be going through the healing process. I don't remember him being so angry all the time, but as with anyone going through the loss of a good friend, it takes time. The Vong seem to be invincible, but fortunately for everyone, they have human flaws. They don't think of every detail. Slow moving at the start, but it gets going toward the end. Star Wars fans read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Jim Luceno's books \\"Hero's Trial\\" and its sequel \\"Jedi Eclipse\\" were both competent efforts that are sure to please the average Star Wars fan. If I were allowed to award stars, this book would have gotten 3 and . Readers like myself who were disappointed in how this New Jedi Order series started because the kick-off book ignored so much of the continuity that has come before will be pleasantly surprised to find these too books positively crammed full of references to the past novels. Even fans considering themselves to be Jedi scholars will find themselves challenged to identify the origin of some names and places. The author and his helpers sure did their homework ... and then some! New readers shouldn't be confused by this but rather will understand that the Star Wars Expanded (Exploited?) Universe has a rich history worth exploring.The books have two failings worth noting. The first is that both try to do too much in too few pages. Many of the favorite characters are only mentioned or have bit parts in this story and the brevity makes them seem out of place. Also, as has been the case with many of the Star Wars books in the last couple of years, the endings seem far too rushed. There were a few hundred pages leading up to a climax that was finished off in only a couple dozen. I wish the endings were stretched out a little and described more thoroughly.Another thing that kept me from liking these two novels more is that they are part of the New Jedi Order series that is centered around the Yuzzhan Vong alien invasion of the galaxy. I find these new villains and their bio-tech weapons to be generic, not terribly interesting and the stories they appear in feel very different than the Star Wars that became such a mainstream hit. It is also sad to see the New Republic forces and the Jedi portrayed as short-sighted or even stupid although it is a convenient way to explain why they are continually being pushed back by the unimpressive Vong. Even though we are only a handful of books into a 20+ novel series, I'm already sick of these two-dimensional gooey thugs and I would like to see this invasion story wrapped up as soon as possible. If this book did not feature the Yuuzhan Vong, I probably would have given it another star."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I am not saying this book sucks, as a matter of fact it is a lot better than other SW books out there. The only problem is that the author doesn't stand to the quality of others like Zahn, Allston or Stackpole. He tries to give some edge to the book by introducing characters found in earlier books, but that goes in detriment of new characters and the story as a whole. Also, the book starts to get really exciting only after half of it is gone. Besides that it is quite a good book."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I've loved Star Wars from the very beginning. As a community librarian, naturally I'm book oriented and I've read every Star Wars book ever printed. I really love the New Jedi Order series, especially how they all interconnect. Poor Han was getting very dull, just vegging into middle age and then getting hit with Chewie's death really woke him up. I know other people have complained about Han moping around in the previous novels, but he had to go through that to finally realize he had to get back to his real self in order to finish grieving for his pal. It was interesting to read about Vergere, Elan's &quot;pet&quot; and wonder whether this is the same former Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi were looking for in Rogue Planet by Greg Bear. Please read this book; you'll be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"i am an avid star wars fan and have read all the new jedi order books this is one of the best tons of action and gives u a real insight on how pirates minds work."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I bought this book with some trepidation, as it was following to stellar novels, being the Dark Tide Duology by Mike Stackpole. i need not have worried. James Luceno hit Han Solo's character right on the head, and shows a knowledge of the Star Wars mythos to rival that of Lucas himself. Luceno weaves a tight story, that gives us almost everything we want, bad bad guys, great good gys, large battles, and twists and turns to keep us guessing and interested. Make no mistake, this is Han's book, Leia and the rest of the gang take a step into the background, with Mr. Solo taking a full step into the spotlight. This is actually quite a relief, with the subdued Han we have seen in the last two books. Another thing that is wonderful is the cover, a return to the more detail oriented covers we have seen in the past. The two Dark Tide covers were dreadful, and this one is a marked improvement, actually showing things recognizable from the novel itself! There are a few downsides however. After Stackpole's wonderful and personal battle scenes, where we are inserted right into the action, Luceno's space battles seem lacking. They are just fine, just not as involving as those that we saw in Onslaught and Ruin. This may even be seen as a plus by some. The other major complaint is the lack of backstory and closer on Verge. For a character that plays such a pivotal role, she is little more than a name and a physical description, and I would have really liked some more. This may be rectified in the next novel, but it should have been done here. These are the only real complaints, and the rest of the book more than makes up for them. All it all, a very worth novel, and one that makes me look forward to Luceno's next one, Jedi eclipse. 4/5"},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Forget Nodoze man... just read this!! This is James Luceno's first star wars book, and I have to give him a little slack just because he is new. However... He failed to capture the tone, and the general overall feel of the series that the other authors had created. Although discriptive with his words, he doesn't use them to capture a scene... he just uses them to be discriptive. Text books do the same thing. Although he did try to do some funky stuffs wuth his approach... like writing from Threepio's view at Chewie's funeral... he just doesn't pull it off. He doesn't advance the plot, or add to the charector at all; (this entire book is about Han.) And I don't know Han any better now than I did before. 350+ pages of total waste.An A for effort. A failing grade overall."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I've been reading each NJO book in succession and have found that this book is the most boring. Reading a Star Wars book I root for the bad guy .. since the good guys always win anyways. And this book dissappoints me. The Vong achieve almost nothing - it seems nothing happens that affects the war. You could almost skip this book in that sense.Instead you get to read how Han accidentally, through lots of luck and coincedence, saves the day. It's just not gripping enough. I wished Elan fared better, she was a very interesting character.Where did Deign Lian go ?I still give it 3 stars because despite the letdown feeling of the ending, we get to meet new interesting characters such as Droma and Elan."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Finally, an author that has studied up on his subject and actually researched the SW history before writing the book. He has successfully combined elements from every area of the SW timeline without messing up like others who have treid this. The battle scenes in this book are well-written, on par with Stackpole. In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing Luceno write a Rogue Squadron book sometime. He did a great job in developing Han's character (and pulling him out of his hole of grief and self-pity). The plot was well-developed with great care to the details. I would have liked to have seen some Jedi action, but the book was about Han, so it's understandable. I also loved the way he ended the sixty year long cliffhanger about a lost Jedi. In short, the was a great book, masterfully written. Mr. Luceno, you did a wonderful job."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I love the New Jedi Order Series, it is finally a dose of reality to the beloved Star Wars Universe, but I have really been dissappointed that since Chewie's death, Han has been non-existent.

Keep them coming, this is becoming an even greater epic!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Although our favorite rogue turned hero has been missing in the last two New Jedi Order novels, he returns to the forefront and in great form. Finally coming to deal with the loss of Chewbacca and the rift that loss has created between him and his son Anakin.The Vong this time around try a more subdued attack rather than the brute force we have seen in the last several novels and once again are fleshed out with the new caste we see.I greatly enjoyed this book, and I am awaiting the next in the series happily!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Only one word can be used to describe this book- WOW!!

I strongly recommend this book to any who loves Star Wars."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I like this book, though the author has Nom Anor back. It starts at Obroa-Skai, after it is captured by the Vong. Then they start translating the history information and then talk about infecting the rest of the Jedi with Mara's illness, using the guise of a defecting Vong preistess, an assasin in disguise.Han is back and back for blood. Chewie's son,Waroo, and his nephew,Lowbacca, want to continue the life debt. Han says that he'll think about it, and goes off on his own little journey, eventualy running into the Vong preistess.All in all, a great book.

Where Stackpole's duology focused primarily on sieges and action, this book delves into the personal realm of Han Solo with an intriguing subplot to boot. This is what made this installment great. There was a vast sense of impending doom in this volume and you kept asking yourself, \\"How will this be dealt with?????\\" A very good book. I had a few tears in my eyes at the end. A fairly major event that fans have been wondering about finally appears to resolve itself. Read for yourself. Youll love it. Im on to book 5 now. Ill be back. May the force be with you!!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trialis easily one of James Luceno's best entries in the Star Wars Expanded Universe. The book focuses on the exploits of Han Solo. Only, this time Han is still recovering from the loss of Chewie. Luceno manages to show Han's character development in realistic and subtle ways. We see Han face difficult decisions and come to terms with Anakin. He also finds a new partner, a gypsy-like alien with an attitude. I love the tension between Han's desire to recapture his \\"glory days\\" versus that of his family life. Exposing this sort of tension is one of the New Jedi Order's greatest strengths.Overall, Luceno's writing is superb and he nurtures several interesting plot twists and cliffhangers. Vergere is a puzzling new character who I suspect will return in the series. If I had any complaints in that area, it would be with the Yuuzhan Vong \\"defector.\\" Rather than surprise readers, Luceno tells readers early on that the defector Elan isn't truly defecting, but rather hopes to assasinate several Jedi. It would have made the book that much better if we didn't know and were left guessing about her motives. On the other hand, I can understand his decision, since not revealing the plot would also have necessitated omitting all of the Yuuzhan Vong scenes, some of which show their backstabbing and infighting in a way we haven't witnessed before. Also, the solution to Mara's illness was a bit too easy.

The dialogue at first is a little ponderous, with drawn-out statements that seem a little wrong, but it gets better.The character of Han Solo is the key point of the book, which was great to see since he seemed to take a back seat to everyone else. Between the time that Chewie dies on Sernpidal (SPOILER!) and the end of this book, the reconciliation between Han and his son Anakin really hits a father.I like the new copilot character that they've given to Han. He's a bit like Han with his sense of humor, and also a little like Lando, but with less of the smooth pretense. I hope he sticks around a while.Luceno really gets down to the guts of Han Solo, and it is his insight which saves the Jedi from certain doom at the hands of an assassin. It's Han Solo at his gut-feeling best, and I couldn't reccomend this book more."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"While Hero's Trial, the fourth book in the massive New Jedi Order series and the first in author James Luceno's Agents of Chaos duology doesn't have quite the same epic scope as previous NJO volumes (no planets die in this one), it is still a crucial volume in the series.Essentially, Hero's Trial is a Han Solo adventure, which is fine considering that Han has been more or less MIA during the previous two NJO books, drowning his sorrows after the loss of Chewbacca inVector Prime (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 1). It's good to see Solo back in action, and the mission he takes on - hunting down the Yuuzhan Vong's Peace Brigade agents - gives him the sense of purpose (not to mention vengeance) that he needs to get on with his life.The book's other key development is the introduction of Yuuzhan Vong double agent Elan and her familiar Vergere, who will go on to be one of the most interesting, compelling, and yes disturbing characters the Star Wars Universe has ever seen. You'd never know it from this book, but the diminutive alien will set in motion events that will shape the galaxy for years to come.Luceno does a great job with this book. It's exactly the kind of rollicking adventure you expect from a Han Solo tale, though the ever-present Yuuzhan Vong threat keeps the book from getting to lighthearted. Luceno has obviously done his homework, as events and characters from both Brian Daley and A. C. Crispin's previous Han Solo novels are referenced extensively in Hero's Trial. It's a bit light on Jedi action, but it does show that the events in the NJO series impact everyone - not just the Jedi.If you've enjoyed the previous NJO books, this will be no exception. The best part is that the story is just getting warmed up!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Hero's Trial is a mediocre book in what has otherwise been a decent series to date. The first three books (written by R.A. Salvatore and Michael Stackpole) were quite decent, which makes the shortcomings in Hero's Trial even more disappointing.The book isn't horrible; it's just not fun to read. With the exception of Droma, a new buddy Luceno introduces for Han, nearly every character in the book is painfully boring. The Yuuzhan Vong, who were engaging in the first three books, became nothing more than the obligatory bad guys. Description of their biological technology became long passages of text which the reader couldn't care less about. This is quite different from the first three books, where the novel and menacing threat introduced by the Yuuzhan Vong is really what made the story work.Following the same trend, Luceno's space battles are very dry. There is nothing in the way of tactics, skill, or strategy conveyed to the reader. There are lots of action words and quite a few adjectives, but in the end they add up to nothing. You could skip over the entire battle and not be worse off for it.Lastly, Han was given a new sidekick to replace Chewbacca. Luceno tries to write some witty dialog between the two, attempting to deliver on some of the charm Han Solo displayed in the movies. Unfortunately, this too falls rather flat - and at times seems much more slapstick than it should.As a stand alone book, it really isn't worth reading. As part of a larger storyline which to date has been good, it is tolerable."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"If you have read the first three books in this epic series, you already know that Chewie died when Sernpidal's moon came crashing down. Since then, dozens of worlds have fallen, including Ithor in the Mid-Rim and Obroa-Skai, the library world located in the Inner-Rim.After Chewie's funeral on his homeworld of Kashyyyk, Han decides that he needs to deal with his grieving in his own way, that is alone. However, he learns that an old friend has joined a fifth columnist group. Meanwhile, a defector comes over fromt he Yuuzhan Vong. But is she really a defector.James Lucerno keeps things moving in this fourth volume of the series. While the focus is on Han and his personal crisis, it doesn't neglect other developments in the owngoing war between the Yuuzhan Vong and the New Republic. There are a few surprises on the way as well as more and more of the galaxy comes under Yuuzhan Vong control."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I thought the author could have allowed Leia and Han be together more.

The only part I'd change is more scenes with the other characters."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"A great addition to the NJO, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.Written well enough...my main critique comes in Luceno's handling of space battles. A major part of the Star Wars Universe involves squadrons of fighters and ships going to blows in Space Combat; however, Luceno needs to work on this aspect of his writing. His space battles are lacking and pale in comparison to the rest of his exciting story. With the first battle scene, I thought he was trying to avoid writing the details, which actually might have been better than him trying to do so (which he attempts later in the story).He does wrap up some annoying parts of the NJO saga extremely well and makes the saga ready to move on. These things include: Han's pouting over Chewbacca's death and Mara's illness. I think these things were annoying him as much as they were me...so he got rid of them. Bravo!Overall, I think he is an excellent addition to the SW universe, and he has written a great book."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"This book is by far the best NJO book I have read so far, even though I'm only on Star By Star. It had a ton of action and introduces Droma, who kept me laughing with all of his witty remarks."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I'll keep this short and sweet because I don't want to spoil anything... I have never read any of Luceno's work, but he does a good job continuing the New Jedi Order series. Where the previous books were more directed towards the Jedi and their contributions towards this new enemy, Hero's Trial gives us a new respect and admiration towards our lovable hero, Han Solo. He has been sorely missed due to the death of Chewbacca and now has to overcome his grief and fight in the name of Chewie. Sometimes it seems as though Han could be &quot;Force-sensitive&quot; for all the situations that he seems to get himself in and out of... but, that's the Corellian luck for ya. Anyway, it was an excellent book with some great insights to the character of Han and how deep his relationship with Chewie really was. The rest of the cast is also built upon nicely which promises a great follow up in Jedi Eclipse. Happy Hunting!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"As with Mr. Greg Bear and \\"Rogue Planet\\", Mr. Luceno is another excellent addition to the Authors who continue the Star Wars epic. I also will be brief following the standard of the other person who has commented thus far, and I hope others will as well. Please do not give away anything that the covers of the book do not.Han is back; the reader must decide which incarnation of Han Solo has returned. Han has evolved so much through these books, and no single event can match the death that Chewbacca's death had upon him. But as the back of the cover states \\"Han becomes the.....he once was\\". And with this persona so much of what fans have been missing is back, in a manner of speaking.This Author steps the level of writing up on this book, as well as increasing the depth of some familiar old friends. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is about awareness, what it means, how each individual copes with it, and the implications it may have. This plot line was totally unexpected, and in my opinion very well done.Mr. Luceno avoids the clich&eacute;s that most Authors embrace; he expands the Organic Weaponry of The New Republic's Enemy in new and clever ways, and clearly makes his mark as a top tier writer for the Star Wars World.I feel fans will really enjoy this installment."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Great story. The writer clearly has read every piece of Han Solo fiction ever written (or at least done a good deal of research) and blends Han's past with this new future in a quite believable way. As I understand it, Luceno also helped pen Robotech. I was reluctant to get into the &quot;new&quot; Star Wars books because I felt that besides screwing up his own D&amp;D novels Salvatore had clearly lost his mind when he killed off the Wook. It's impossible to pass up a well written Han Solo story though, and Luceno has presented an excellent (albeit darker) story about our favorite rogue turned hero.The character actually experiences something of a rebirth while he is forced to deal with the very non-Star Wars real emotion of grief in a very realistic way. While Solo is the focus of the story the author adeptly handles the underlying plot and characters surrounding Han in the story. The space battles, in particular, are above average for Star Wars books. They are so good, in fact, that I kept thinking Luceno would be good candidate to further script the adventures of everyone's second favorite Corelian, Wedge Antilles (provided he hasn't been killed off either).Han and Luke are handled carefully, but are given a bit of maturity that 25 years would bring them. Solo has the age issue to deal with (much like the actor who played him) and Luke seems to be the Jedi Master in every way. In one bit I could almost detect the writer's question about whether or not to use the Jedi Temple on Coruscant as a local in the book. It would have worked, but only if it isn't destroyed in the other movies. He wisely opted to come as close to that as possible without using the real deal.In the end, the villians are convincing and the heroes are right on the mark. There is even a deadpan Harrison Ford moment that is taken right out of The Last Crusade. While this is a darker story than standard Star Wars, Luceno certainly has crafted himself a minor masterpiece here. Solo fans unsure of this &quot;new&quot; series ought to check it out. Besides the lack of favorite characters Lando, Wedge, and Talon Kard, this one will have you finishing it faster than Solo could pull off the Kessel Run (and wanting more)."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"This book is great for those of you that have wondered what happened to Han Solo. Jay Luceno writes a very good book, that enters the Star Wars world and places him right behind the likes of Timothy Zahn and Micheal Stackpole. This book really explains well what has happened to Han since Chewie's death. He tries to explain his feelings toward the war with the Yhuzzan Vong, Leia, Luke, and especially Anakin his youngest son. The book reads well, but doesn't weave the same type of web that Timothy Zahn and Micheal Stackpole create in their visions of the Star Wars Universe. I have read all of the accounts of Han, Luke, and Leia since the very beggining with A New Hope. I would reccomend this book as an excellent continuation of the New Jedi Order series and I really anticipate the release of Jay Luceno's next book in October."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial is the fourth book in the Star Wars: The New Jedi Order series. The series so far has been dazzling, but unfortunately there always has to be a bump in the road. This one's it. Michael Stackpole provided a lot of momentum with his two book series, but Luceno drops the ball a little bit. It's not that bad, by any means. It's just not that good.I've been anxiously awaiting Han Solo's story ever since what happened to Chewie. In Stackpole's series, Han was sidelined as somebody who was wallowing in his sorrows and going off to get drunk. He was gaining weight and basically becoming a slob who didn't care about anything. But we knew he wouldn't be like this forever. When I heard that Hero's Trial was about him, I rejoiced.Then I read it, and I wasn't quite so happy. I'm not sure if it just suffers in comparison to Stackpole's, or if it has its own problems. First of all, while there are the requisite space battles that any Star Wars book or movie has to have, the scenes just fall flat here. The dialogue's not bad, but the descriptions of the battles just lie there, moribund. They don't bring that sense of exhilaration that previous ones did. Sure, all the terminology's there: the jukes, the jinks, the firing of lasers and proton torpedoes. However, the sense of the ebb and flow just isn't there. I wouldn't say I was necessarily bored, but they definitely didn't hum.The second problem with the book is the other characters. They are, almost to a man (or woman), dreadfully dull. Luceno creates a few Yuuzhan Vong characters, but they just lie there on the page. The scenes on the Vong ships are flat and just basically exposition. The Vong plan is to \\"allow\\" a defector to join up with the Alliance, but when she meets the Jedi Knights, a surprise will be awaiting them. This is not a spoiler as the plan is detailed by the Vong in the first few chapters. Thus, any sense of suspense is lost because we know what they are trying to do. The only suspense is whether it works or not. This isn't always a bad thing, but this causes the Vong characters to be nothing but mouthpieces as any scene with them devolves into \\"make it look like you're trying to rescue her, but make sure you don't.\\"None of the other characters inspire much in the reader either. The lone exception to that is Droma, the Ryn that Han meets up with on Ord Mantell. Droma has a lot of snappy dialogue and he makes the perfect foil for Han. He becomes a temporary partner to Han, and the interplay between the two is a wonder to behold. Droma is sarcastic, philosophical, slightly a coward but he's also willing to make the extra sacrifice when necessary, even with his tail (which we see in a truly memorable scene where it's instrumental in rescuing Han). He is a wonderful creation, and I hope we see more of him.Another major problem with this book is the coincidences. The Star Wars universe is full of coincidences, and usually I can look past them. If two stories are going on, it's very likely that they'll both end up in the same place eventually. That's all well and good. But in this case, three stories all end up in the same place, and it just stretches my suspension of disbelief almost to the breaking point. On top of that is when Han ends up on the same passenger ship on which the defector is being transported. I'm willing to grant a little bit of leeway on this usually, but this book was just too much.One thing I did like, however, was the way the story showed two sides of the same faction (in this case, the Vong and their associates) not know what the other one is doing. Some Vong associates actually believe the defector is real, and they try to capture her, throwing a wrench into everything. It's the sort of incompetence that happens in real life, when the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing, and it was nice to see here. It adds a bit of chaos to everything and was a nice feature.From a series point of view, I am a bit disheartened, though. Monumental events happened in the last book. While some of them are referred to (the planet Ithor, for example), one of the major events is never mentioned at all: the fall of Corran Horn. While this did happen a couple of months ago in the Star Wars timeline, it still should be fresh in everybody's minds. But he doesn't get a mention at all. It brings up something I was afraid would happen, and I hope it doesn't become a chronic problem. Are the authors only going to use their own characters in their own books? I seriously hope not. I don't want Horn sidelined for too long. He's too interesting of a character.I think I liked this book more than it sounds because I was anxious for some Han Solo action. It's nice to see him again, and it was nice to see him be his old roguish self. I love the quirky grin, the \\"who, me?\\" attitude and his ability to get himself into the worst situations and then fly out of them unscathed. This is the Han Solo that I loved seeing in the old movies and I missed him. He's a man who isn't used to responsibilities, except to himself. He's been living a responsible life for 25 years now, and it's beginning to wear on him. It was good to see you in action, Han. Too bad the book around you couldn't have been better.David Roy"},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I really enjoyed a great many things about this book, not least of which is the fact that it revolves around Han Solo, but delves substantially into his more emotional side. It also seeks to resolve certain elements within the escalating conflict between the New Public and the Yuuzhan Vong. However, James Lucerno's chaotic writing style makes events hard to grasp insofar as actual resolution is concerned. This hampers an already convoluted plot by the Yuuzhan Vong to infiltrate an assassin into the New Republic so that they can murder as many Jedi as possible with a poisonous virus carried within the lungs of the assassin.It also lays Chewbacca to rest in a private ceremony on his homeworld of Kashyyyk, and Lucnerno thankfully had the good sense not to have Chewie's relatives assume the life debt, even though it was suggested. Han skillfully manages to avoid having another Wookie as a first mate, since that would have diminished Chewie's death greatly. Instead, Han must come to grips with Chewbacca's death by himself and in his own fashion, which usually means periods of brooding introspection and occasional verbal attacks on family members, including Luke, Leia, and Anakin, who bears the brunt of Han's wrath while the lad must come to terms with the guilt he feels over Chewie's death, and his father's accusations that he left Chewie to die.The Vong fake an attack on a New Republic ship and sacrifice a vessel so that an escape pod bearing the priestess, Elan and her bizarre avian companion, a Fosh named Vergere. Beforehand, however, they connive a plan whereby Elan ingests a virus that will collect in her lungs and incubate until she is brought before the Jedi with vital information about Mara's illness. Then she exhales the virus which quickly multiplies and immediately causes hemorrhaging and an agonizing death. The reader steadily becomes suspicious of Vergere until it is revealed that she is actually from a region of the galaxy near the Corporate Sector. Doubly so when Elan wonders if the Yuuzhan Vong will ever come to master the Force, and Vergere states that the Vong aren't really worthy of it.A rather amusing chain of events ensues as a band of traitorous humans known as the Peace Brigade learn that Elan is in New Republic hands, but isn't aware that it is a plot by the Vong. The Peace Brigade is a band of traitors who have sold out to the Vong, and believing they will be rewarded for the return of one of their own, hatch a plan to capture Elan. In the Ord Mantell system, Han meets up with Big Bunji, from the old Han Solo books, just as the Yuuzhan Vong attack. Things turn inane when the Vong attack a space station known as Jubilee Wheel with a giant elephant trunk that begins vacuuming people out of the station! However, that aside, the ensuing dialog between Han and a Ryn named Droma escalates into a rousing series one-liners that had me laughing out loud. Escaping the Jubilee Wheel, Han and Droma board the Queen of Empire, a passenger liner ferrying refugees Coreward.It becomes pretty obvious that Han has found a new first mate in the pleasantly goofy Ryn, Droma. I found however that Lucerno's writing style isn't well suited to depicting the Yuuzhan Vong. As Stackpole and Salvatore have done in the past with the aliens, Lucerno's Yuuzhan Vong have very little menace to them. Nom Anor is reduced to being little more than a toady, gone is the malevolence that he displayed so wonderfully in \`Vector Prime'. Plus Lucerno lacks Stackpole's ability to write space combat sequences. Whereas \`I, Jedi'; \`Onslaught'; and \`Ruin' gave the reader vivid accounts of X-wings having it out with coralskippers, complete with pilots' input and battle chatter, Lucerno's battles are more sterile and come across as if viewed from a distance or dispassionately. There are too few cameos, except from characters like Kyp Durron and Wurth Skidder.All in all not a bad go, but something of let down after the first three books. I only hope 'Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse' has a little more focus to it. On the up side Lucerno does portray Han Solo very well, and seems more like his old \`Stars' End' self rather than an aging space pirate. My other hopes is that the series doesn't wimp out with its conclusion by trumping up some silly deus ex machina ending, but instead something with vastly more grit and mettle to it. We're not reading Star Trek here, because Star Wars gas always been something better.May the Force be with you."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"The last couple of New Jedi Order books, which were the Dark Tide duology, focused mainly on the various Jedi. So it makes sense in a way that this book is mostly about Han Solo, since he was pretty much ignored in those two books. After Chewbacca's memorial service on the Wookie home planet, Kashyyk, the Solo family returns to Coruscant, where Han runs into Roa, an old buddy from his smuggling days. Desperate to avenge Chewie's death, he agrees to go off with Roa in search of a mercenary band working for the Yuuzhan Vong. At the same time, the Vong allow a New Republic ship to capture one of their priestesses, Elan, and her &quot;familiar,&quot; Vergere, a creature that is certainly not a Vong but not any other recognized species either. Elan and Vergere are supposed to pose as defectors so they can arrange a meeting with the Jedi, during which Elan will unleash a disease. Although the outcome was somewhat predictable, quite a few of the twists and turns along the way were anything but predictable. This is another five star book from the New Jedi Order series. I just started Jedi Eclipse (the sequaL), and it's sure to be great as well."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"For all those readers of the New Jedi Order series that began with Vector Prime, many will recognize that Han Solo has been somewhat absent from all the other novels that had followed this new direction in the Star Wars universe. He has only been briefly around since the death of Chewbacca and this has allowed authors to invent new characters and breath depth to many others that were previously second stringers or were only supporting characters in earlier exploits.However, for those that missed your favorite Corellian, he's back, but not exactly the same scoundrel that the princess was so coy about. This novel explores the pain of Solo's loss and a rejection and rebirth of his core beliefs. I thought the novel was a bit slow in the beginning when it came to the memorial service back on Chewie's home planet. Han's feelings were re-hashed over and over again for what seems to be filler material, and you get to feel that Han is now whining. It is understandable to a point, but I soon tired of the lengthy flashbacks. I felt his treatment to Leia and Luke was a bit out of character, but events that eventually unfold probably allow for this justification.As the story revolves mainly around Han, he finds himself in trouble as always, and it is an entertaining read as he moves from one situation to the next. What he does discover is a situation that places him in the same shoes as his son Anakin, and for the first time really comes to terms with dealing with Anakin as he relates to Chewie's death.A new character is introduced into this story and he seems like a perfect fit as the new partner for Han. Though he may not replace Chewie immediately, the seeds are sown for a great pairing down the line. This character is very rich in depth and was written very well. He displays a sense of humor that compliments Han's dry wit and sarcasm.Some interesting turns take place in the New Republic government, somewhat reminiscent of the Empire as it came to power first in politics prior to its militaristic stance that the Rebellion fought against. Other notes: C-3PO contemplates his mortality. Lando is absent. Very little is dealt with the Solo children.Finally the Vong....I feel that they (as a whole) who were described as an all powerful force to fear from the 1st few books, has suddenly became not only passive, but softened up. I was really excited about their potential as a new threat, but it looks as if they aren't so bad after all. A real shame if the initial intent of the New Jedi Order was to add shake things up and bring back some fun filled tension to a huge galaxy. Hopefully the next books will re-focus this effort. Overall, it was a good book for Han Solo fans."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Well, the New Jedi Order keeps on truckin' and so far it doesn't seem to be running out of steam. While not as good as the Dark Tide series, I'm still having the most fun reading Star Wars since Heir To the Empire came out! This new installment features Han like we all love him, gambler, scoundrel, and master pilot. After all the pathos Han's been going through since Vector Prime, I was pleasantly surprised to find this book brimming with humor, most of it from the interaction between our smuggler and his new Ryn buddy, Droma.Also interesting is the reappearance of Vergere, the Jedi that Obi-Wan and Anakin (Skywalker, not Solo :) were serching for in Rouge Planet. I hope more comes out of this storyline in the future. I mean, wouldn't it be great if Vergere could hook up with Luke and tell him about the Jedi of old and how his father was as a kid? Great possibilities!James Luceno does a bang up job continuing the series and I, for one, can't wait to see what he puts Han, Droma and the gang though in the next installment."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Honestly, I was a bit skeptical when I first picked the book up, as Luceno was an author unfamiliar to me, and the NJO series was so filled with complexities and disappointments. However, I have to admit, Luceno has a lucid, flowing style that keeps you enthralled in the novel. I put the book down twice while reading it. Once to eat dinner and once because I _had_ to sleep. With the reintroduction of Han Solo to the playing field, things are looking up for the beleaguered New Republic. Unfortunately, the book is a little lacking in the Jedi presence for a novel supposedly focused on them. Also, I find it vexing that the two major internal problems confronting the heroes were cleared up in the same novel. It makes me wonder what we've got in store in the next installments."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"For quite some time now, there have been three SW authors that I couldn't decide between as far as who was best: Stackpole, Allston and Zahn. Luceno has joined them. Why?he plot moves along at a nice pace. I was kept on the edge of my seat for several chapters.The action sequences are very well written. Pulse pounding blaster battles and dogfight. No lightsabres, however. This book does fine without them though.It's in te department of characters that Luceno really shines. Han is the obvious star of this book and Luceno does a great job exploring him and his grief. Luceno does a great job bringing back the Han of old and helping him grow. Han's new friend is also well done. I found myself laughing outloud at some of their exchanges, such as when they are flying in battle together. Luke, Mara, Leia and Anakin are also close to the mark. In what amounts to a cameo, Borsk is dead on as well.And speaking of cameos, Luceno knows his EU. If you liked, Kapp Dendo showing up in Ruin, you will love this book. Cameo after cameo. One of my favorites is back, Showalter from the Corellian Trio. I really enjoyed his plot. Some of the best scenes involve 3PO. It's amazing how Luceno gets inside his head.I also learned a lot of new words from the book. I liked that aspect of it. Anybody know what gibbous means? You will after you read this. And read it you should."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"EXCELENT BOOK! Wonderful! I enjoyed James's writing and I look forward to more of it. This book worked for me because I LOVE Han Solo! I don't know why, but I loved his sarcasim and charm from A new hope to know! Very Exciting and keeped me reading until I couldn't open my eyes. I almost cried when I got to the final page because I wanted to keep reading!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"It's Han's time to shine in this wonderfully written book. Yes, after all the attention the Jedi received, Luceno masterfully focused on Han Solo, bringing out the potential and strength to face the death of Chewie and the yearning for vengeance. Luceno succeeded beautifully. The charachters(especially Han, duh) show depth and feeling, the action is intense, the story has a smooth flow and amazing ideas, and the pages fly by fast. This book is really good. I am looking forward to the sequel and I would recommend it for not the usual Star Wars fan, but rather someone who is looking to read a book with wonderful style."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"This is the 4th of the &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; set of books, which started a new story line in the Star Wars universe, introducing a new enemy that is slowly beating down the New Republic's forces. In the 1st book &quot;Vector Prime&quot; They brought a moon down on a planet killing Chewbacca. In this book, &quot;Hero's Trial&quot; we finally have Han's closure, and quite possibly Chewwies successor. I won't give away the plot, Han's new buddy is certainly a distinct enough character that is both likable, and believeable. The chemestry between Han and his informal new co-pilot is wonderful, but certainly not as good as Han/Chewie. It was a good read, and I'm curious as to where this goes."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I had hoped for more from the followup to the fantastic Dark Tide series. The book is not poorly written, and the story is generally satisfying, but the book focuses solely on Han Solo, completely ignoring the rest of the galaxy. While Solo's adventures are reasonably exciting, they failed to grip my attention, and I had some trouble getting through this book, for lack of interest.Okay, to the story. Han Solo, who had been almost entirely left out of the Dark Tide series (which focused on the Jedi), is still mourning the loss of Chewbacca at the hands of the Yuuzhan Vong at Sernpidal. Solo is highly depressed and takes his anger out on Leia and storms away on his own. While almost every one of the 'good guys' is left out, dont worry, the Yuuzhan Vong are present and give Han a hell of a hard time. Han allies himself with an old friend, and after a Yuuzhan Vong attack, a new one. By the end of the book, Han uncovers a Yuuzhan Vong plot to completely eliminate the Jedi, and does his usual hero thing to try and avert it.Over all, the book is not terrible. Han Solo is true to his original character, an independent rogue, not the paternal Han Solo shown since the Thrawn Trilogy. For any Han Solo fan, this book would probably rank up with AC Crispen's trilogy, but as a New Jedi Order book, Hero's Trial is rather one-dimensonal, and any reader who is not a Han Solo fantatic will find themselves wishing that there was more mention of the Solo children, Luke Skywalker, Corran Horn, etc. This book is not vitally important to the series; nothing of any great import occurs, except perhaps the first real indication of the Yuuzhan Vong's hatred of the Jedi, which will play an important role later on in the New Jedi Order series.A good effort for Luceno (his first Star Wars novel) but this book doesnt stand out and is probably my least favorite New Jedi Order book to date, perhaps even my least favorite Star Wars book to date (L. Neil Smith's Lando Calrissian saga may give Luceno a run for his money, though)."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Fans of Han Solo will not be disappointed by this book as Luceno demonstrates he has explored every facet of Han's life thoroughly. There are numerous irrelevant references to Han's past scattered throughout the book as Han stumbles throughout the galaxy and befriends the Jar-Jar Binks of the EU, the insufferable, comedic creature called Droma. We have Han stumbling through the galaxy in an attempt to help Droma find his clan-mates; in doing so, Han manages to stumble across the latest Vong scheme and accidentially foil it.With the exception of the Vong scheme, the rest of the book is just useless filler, but then I'm not a Han fan."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Brilliant! While the first three NJO books have concerned themselves with the Jedi forces, in particular the Solo children, Luceno has revived the stale Han Solo character.In previous books, Han has been left out of the story, but here he is thrust into the spotlight, as he slowly comes to grips with the loss of Chewbacca. During the course of the story, Han takes small steps to move on with life and to allow his healing to begin.I feel that Luceno truly captures the Han Solo that we all remember him from episodes 4-6--a wise cracking, dashing, risk-taking scoundrel. In addition, Luceno also introduces us to an alien, Droma, who I have a sneaking suspician will replace Chewie as Han's first mate (In later installments, that is). The sarcastic banter between the two spacers made me pause during the reading to chuckle at the friendship being forged.Luceno is a splendid author who truly captures the Star Wars spirit. I recommend this book to anyone who loved the original trilogy. You'll feel yourself fall back in love with the setting just like I did."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"this book series is amazing i love the new jedi order book and this new jedi order book series rocks and its awesome james luceno is now one of my favorite authors!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"\\"Hero's Trial\\" provides the reader with an excellent plot containing many twists and turns.

This time, he is but one of a group of leaders. For all their mastery of biological weapons, they are finding the New Republic to be a formidable foe.Han is also back.

This book is really a story of how he pulls himself out of the rut he was swimming in after the death of his beloved friend. Along the way, he finds himself an interesting sidekick, Droma, who does a wonderful job of taking over Han's role of providing comic relief. From time to time, we see the creation of a character with such lasting potential. I do hope to see Droma in many more books.Although \\"Hero's Trial\\" is the first part of a duology, there is a conclusion of sorts. It's nice not to be left hanging off a cliff. For all the doom and gloom of the New Jedi Order, we find an ending that is uplifting. There is hope."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"Welcome back, Han Solo! We missed you!The Yuuzhan Vong have a new plan to kill the Jedi: send Elan, a priestess of the Deception sect, into their midst as a defector and poison them. Meanwhile, Han Solo finally comes around and starts to come to terms with his grief.NOTE: Based on audiobook and novel.I find myself at odds trying to rate this book. On one hand, when I first read this, I was bored stiff. The language was too heavy, the plot too invisible, the characters too mediocre. On the other hand, the abridgement outdid the actual book (rare praise indeed!) and trimmed away the fat of Luceno's writing and left a pretty darn decent book.Let me stop you now and say this: this review does spoil who died in Vector Prime (which you probably already know by now). So if you haven't heard who died and don't want to know, skip to the last paragraph.The book opens with Harrar, a priest Yuuzhan Vong, debating life, religion, and the Jedi with a Gotal priest. It was really well done scene and definitely made me interested in the rest of the novel. The Gotal struck a nice balance of being independent, yet hopeful of the Jedi.The introduction of the new character, Harrar, also opens the galaxy to religion, something that really hadn't been very prominent before (unless it was them crazy whackos kidnapping Leia's kids or somesuch galactic mischief). The Yuuzhan Vong have a very violent religion, and this is our first peek at it.Then we move to Kashyyyk and Chewie's wake. I loved the ceremony but...why did it take 6 months to get around to his wake? Most religions have the wake sometime within the WEEK of a death. Is this a Wookiee thing? Were they unsure of his death? Luceno, tell us! Not to mention, Mara's absence because of her illness was stupid. Mara is family; she should have been there to commemorate Chewbacca's death.It's about this time that I realize Luceno-isms. Strange words like \\"arboreal\\" and \\"polyglot\\". Info-dumping (though I did like the continuity nods in some respects). And none of the characters, from Han and Leia to Luke and Mara feel authentic.Let me be frank: this book is about Han coming to terms with Chewie's death. I am not going to diss too much on how long it takes for him to grieve (though 6 months of doing NOTHING does seem a bit excessive), but I will say this book should not have come after the Dark Tide duology. It should have been concurrent. While Leia is doing her shame dance to get Jaina into Rogue Squadron (btw, if you are a Jaina or Jacen fan, skip this book, they are barely in it), Han should have been out there with Roa, trying to find Reck, not at home at Coruscant drinking himself to oblivion. FOR SIX MONTHS. Apparently.Han and Chewie were close, but I can't imagine him drinking for 6 months, suddenly becoming sober and THEN deciding to leave to avenge his partner. Talk about delayed reaction!While I liked how Han and Leia endured difficulties in their marriage, both characters felt like they had to be warped in order for the separation to occur. I kept wondering why Leia was so sedate and meek; why doesn't she snap out at Han for his behavior? Yes, he is grieving and she knows this, but have people act like people! Lovers say mean things to each other, sometimes at their lowest points. Don't ruin Leia's character just to split our couple apart.The other \\"couple\\" in this book is Luke and Mara, who are really only present to provide \\"tension\\" to the whole infiltrator plot. Oh, nos, Elan has poison and wants to meet the weakened Mara! Whatever will we do?! Their character is nothing like what has been established and Mara appears even more of a wimp than Leia.But, let me stop stalling. Let me just get to the character everyone wants me to talk about. Droma. Ah, a more thinly veiled excuse for a sidekick replacement I have never seen! Firstly, Droma's species is the least convincing and most disturbingly similar depiction of a real world ethnicity (the Roma, more often known by the more derrogatory \\"gypsies\\") I have ever seen. Colorful, odd dress? Check. Fortune telling? Check. Nomadic? Check. Dancing and singing? Check. We can now add it to the following list:Neimoidians -> AsianToydarians -> JewsGungans-> BlacksRyn-> RomaMany apologies to all of the above ethnicities. I am embarrassed for each and every one of you. If it makes you feel better, remember: whiny, bratty, immature Anakin is Caucasian.As if that weren't bad enough, I don't like how hard Luceno tries to make Droma Chewbacca's replacement. Han is taking Chewbacca's death so hard, he is separated from his wife and kids. Why do we need a poor excuse for a sidekick? Why can't we honor Chewbacca's memory without the chirpy insanity of a poorly drawn character?Harrar isn't a bad new character, Vergere is great to see (love her bit of deception!), but does Elan have to be YET ANOTHER sexy female? Why is Yuuzhan Vong beauty so similar to human acceptable beauty? Shouldn't she be hideously scarred? But, oh, no, can't have anything like that! Women are objects meant to be manhandled and oogled at. I still have yet to learn my lesson.As the fourth entry in the NJO, Hero's Trial is a great example of \\"too little, too late\\". We should have seen Han grieving much earlier. We should have had fights between Leia and Han earlier. We should have seen the priests a little earlier so it didn't feel like, once again, new author = new enemy. But still, it's got a decent story, and it's not often I can say that an abridged audiobook improved my perception of the book. I should probably rate this higher, as it is one of Luceno's best books in Star Wars EU, but I will knock down for all the above stated reasons.Brought to you by:*C.S.

The beginning is kind of slow and there is a lack of main characters besides Han. This is the book for you if he is your favorite character. Not much Jedi action, but a fair amount of battles and good new characters. Also the end is FABULOUS wrapping up many annoying themes that run through out the series. A very happy ending in my opinion."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"This book is a great way to return to Han as the main character. So far the other books in the series have been based on Rouge Squadron or on all of the main characters Luke, Leia, Han, etc..

It was worthy to the New Jedi Order Series. Again, Han Solo becomes a loner again. But Chewie isn't there this time. Han Solo doesn't get any help from anybody. So this is like a Han Solo book.

Chewie's demise left our favorite smuggler wracked with guilt and anger, and the fact that he has become an object of pity among his friends and collegues in the New Republic has only made Chewie's absence that much more painful.But now Han finally has the chance to get revenge for his best friend's murder. Han leaves his friends behind to go on a solitary mission that may end in his death...a mission to strike at the very heart of the Yuuzan Vong invasion force in a way that the massive New Republic military never could. The only question is, will Han's thirst for vengeance put him in grave risk against impossible odds?

It was boring. It had to much Han, not enough of the other characters. The parts I liked were the ones with Anakin and Jacen. I would recemend skimming this book, because there are quite a few important plot points, but I really did not like it."},{"Title":"Star Wars Agents Of Chaos 1 Hero's Trial","review":"I am estatic that we FINALLY had some CLOSURE with Chewie! It's like Micheal A. Stackpole completely avoided the subject of Chewie. Unless I'm mistaken, don't most people have funerals when they die? I know that everbody was distracted by the invasion but couldn't the characters just confirm for the readers' sake that Chewie was actually going to have a funeral?Anyway, I thought Chewbacca's long-awaited eulogy was very touching. The Wookies' insistance to keep the life debt for Han was just another statement of how giving and loving our furry friends are.The Vong's plot to assasinate the Jedi was inventive and interesting to read. I think there is a lot more that we are going to find out about this \\"familiar\\" Vergere. She is too mysterious and disappeared too quickly. I love the part where Han uses Chewie's gift to Anakin to save his life. It lets you know that everything will eventually be all right between Han and his son.Han is back! Wow! I thought the day would never come! I think Mr. Stackpole was some personal vendetta against Han and his (former) partner. He was always dismissing Han as \\"getting over his grief\\" or simply not mentioning him at all. I am glad that our hero from the rebellion is back as a MAIN character.I LOVE DROMA. I think Han's new \\"temporary\\" copilot had the wit and charm to lighten this book up. I hope Han's furry friend plays a role in the rest of the series because I think that over time Droma can grow to almost replace Chewbacca. Notice the \\"almost\\". No one could replace the lovable walking carpet. han needs a \\"partner in crime\\" in this war and the Ryn is perfect. I also liked the appearance of Roa. (I hope he's okay).All in all, I give this book 5 stars because the wonderful Mr.Luceno picked up the pieces after the 3-star books done by Stackpole.Murl Jorgensen, 13"},{"Title":"The discovery of India","review":"I had heard quite a bit about this book, but never had a chance to read it until very recently. I must say I was highly impressed by it. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of independent India was a thorough intellectual. His narration of history and knowledge about India is excellent. Since he was a nationalist, and also because this book was written while he was in prison, the author's intense dislike for the British do come out oftentimes in his narration of history. However the author himself is aware of it and acknowledges it. Though western educated, Jawaharlal Nehru had an intense love and hope for India. An extremely well read man, this book while giving a very good outline of India's history and past, also serves to provide the readers with Nehru's own philosophy of life and is thus autobiographical at times. This lends it an unique flavour and makes its reading even more enjoyable. While Nehru took intense pride in India's rich heritage, he always emphasised that we cannot live in the past. His dreams and hopes for India as a forward looking, modern and tolerant nation fostering peace and co operation in the world are pretty well brought out in the book. Intensely nationalistic, he was always careful that nationalism does not degenerate into the narrow variety, the type which inevitably does more harm than good. Whether one agrees with his views or not, one can't help admiring the man and developing a respect for him. Overall this book is in many ways a very enjoyable, informative and profound read. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about India."},{"Title":"The discovery of India","review":"A number of reviewers have noted that Discovery of India and Glimpses of World History were written during the years Nehru languished in British custody for sedition and civil disobedience. What none of them, nor the publisher, have pointed out is that these books were culled from hundreds of letters that Nehru wrote to his daughter, Indira (Gandhi), then in her teens and early twenties. As a forcibly absentee father, Nehru wanted both to explain his absences and play a role in her life and upbringing. The letters were his gift to her - an indication of his love and caring and a way to educate her in his world view. If the books seem romanticized, that is why. If they seem personal, that is why. And if they seem subjective, that is also why. They were not intended for publication. These were love letters from a father to his daughter to explain the world to her and her place in it, as he saw it. They imparted to the future Prime Minister of India a sense of nationalism, love for country and a belief in democracy, as well as an intimate understanding of politics and working the levers of power. These books are far more than an intellectual exploration of Indian and world history; they were the seeds from which modern Indian history grew. A precious gift, indeed."},{"Title":"The discovery of India","review":"Written by Jawaharlal Nehru for his daughter Indira, this book is an introduction to the history of India as well as an insight into Nehru's political vision during the fight for Independance.The narrative framework is that of Nehru's stay in prison, which gives him time to write and look back on the history of the sub-continent, and on the Nationalist movement.I find this work simply amazing. Nehru doesn't just tackle a few centuries of \\"Indian\\" (he actually speaks about a lot more than the present days India) history, he tries to offer a panorama through the ages, from the Indus Civilization (just discovered a decade or so ago at the time) to his entry in history. This history of India is eminently political, as the title proves it, since Nehru invites us to discover India, an entity that did not formaly exist yet. His presentation of the sub-continent's history aims at : doing justice to the incredible richness of the indian past and culture that was overlooked by the British (see MacCauley for instance), creating a history of the subcontinent as a \\"unified whole\\" (from Asoka to the Mughals and the British), and finally, summing up the nationalist movement's history.However biased Nehru's view may be, his presentation of the facts is incredibly compelling and classifies this text as an uplifting testimony of his political views. No matter how much one knows about the more objective history of India, it is impossible to resist partaking in his dream of a unified country. This view might be criticized as imperialistic or just unrealistic since he thought of India as India + Pakistan + Bangladesh, nevertheless when reading this book it is possible to forget everything about history and share a bit of the fiever that animated Indian Nationalists of the Congress.I find this book extremely informative as much in terms of Nehru's views as in terms of history. However you will need another source on the history to balance Nehru's unifying enthusiasm, for instance India a History by Keay is a very good read as well as an information packed volume (with nice photos).As a final word I'd say that Nehru's take on the history of Islam in India is very intelligent in its attempts to minimize and expalin the gap that was starting to increase dramatically between the Congress and the Muslim League and is useful when trying to understand the origins of the Muslim/Hindu clash (here again, other sources are needed, but it's still worth taking in consideration)."},{"Title":"The discovery of India","review":"I wrote this review a couple of days ago.

I chanced upon the book again recently and decided to hash out the book from the first page to last. I was very impressed with his deep and insightful interpretation of various historical events in the 5 millenia long history of my country, and of his objective portrayal of the same. He was not overtly parochial as I suspected he would be, but was critical of my countrymen and of our culture and their actions when necessary, and lauded their actions when they were justified. Particularly interesting to me were his writings on the social evolution of our caste system, which is said to be a great problem, and is constantly criticized (particularly by the you-know-who's of the western world). However, Nehru showed that, the system in it's ancient and present forms are dogma-induced perversions of it's intended goal, which was to provide checks and balances to racial and class-based divisions that plagued other \\"more civilized\\" Hellenic and Saxonic/Nordic societies in Europe (he also pointed out that the caste system enabled ancient Indians to avoid the sick barbarity of the mass slavery of other human beings with minds and thoughts like our own, something which all civilizations other than India and those in the Far East have practiced on a nauseatingly copious scale). Also, I was impressed by his organized portrayal of the British Raj which, by all accounts other than those of the Europeans, was a savage massacre and rape of our land and people to satisfy the Anglo-Saxon bloodlust (while it did have a small number of benefits, it did not justify the claim of \\"Pax Brittanica\\"). If I were to paraphrase the British occupation based on his writings, I would have to say that his contention was that, while the British enslaved our people in order to \\"civilize\\" us, we wound up civilizing them, as, in the final analysis, they were amenable to reason and dialogue and consequently we were able to sue for our freedon through civil disobedience rather than wage bloody wars for it like other countries like the United States were forced to do.However, one criticism for this work is that Nehru has often been a tad shaky on his facts. One might argue, of course, that his main intention was not to provide a litany of names and dates, but explanations and interpretations. But one must remember that history is a science as much as it is an art, and the scientific method entails detailed records of all the facts before providing an interpretation of them. Nehru is a little deficient on this. For example, he summarizes the spectacular rise of the Mauryan Empire in just 1 paragraph, without describing the palace intrigues that lead Kautilya to engineer the rather dramatic fall of the Nanda Dynasty and crown Sandracottus/Chandragupta Maurya as the Emperor after driving out the Celucid Greeks. He only touches the interesting bits about the invasions of Demetrius and the Scythians and Huns (though he does mention Mihiragula the Horrible), the mistreatment of the Buddhist monks by the Sunga Kings, and the grand achievements of the Gupta Empire that entail all that is finest about our people even to this day. Also, his portrayal of Muslim rule in India is somewhat biased, and he only describes the bad bits, such as the jizya and the pagan tyranny of Aurangzeb while glossing over the good bits during the reigns Emperors Akbar, Jehangir and all those chaps who tried to build bridges between Hindus and Muslims. He did not write about the reletavily progressive outlook of Indian Muslims (relative to the Persians and Afghans of that time) that laid to the establishment of the Ghulami (Slave) Dynasty in the Sultanate, when Iltutmish, a poor slave, rose in the ranks to become an Emperor, or of our first Empress, Razia al-Din (although the incompetence of the Tughlaq dynasty negated much of that later).All in all, though, I'm glad I read this book as I know more about my roots than I did before."},{"Title":"The discovery of India","review":"Henry Ford should have read this book.

He used his time in prison wisely and wrote books. 'Discovery of India' is one of his well-known works and widely regarded in India as a classic.In the Preface, Pandit Nehru states that the book was written in prison in 1944. The fellow prisoners were scholars from a cross-section of India. They held discussions on numerous topics on history, which helped Nehru clear his mind on various aspects of Indian history and culture. He mentions that it was a privilege to live in close contacts with \`men of outstanding ability and culture, and a wide human outlook which even passions of the moment did not obscure'. Nehru's manuscript was typed and published, unedited and unchanged, by his daughter Indira.The book is Indian history as Pandit Nehru saw it. Whether the reader agrees with the contents or not, it is certainly scholarly and thought-provoking. He has covered ancient to modern history, and has presented his own ideas for the future.The subject is incredibly vast and deep, but the truly interested reader will enjoy the book immensely."},{"Title":"The discovery of India","review":"I purchased the book, because i read it on my journey through India many years ago and I had good memories from the book.Not only the descriptions, but for all the feeling wherewith Nehru has written the book, stayed in my memory."},{"Title":"The discovery of India","review":"This massive book contains a vast storehouse of knowledge; historical facts and fables evolved over many centuries.I was impressed with how Nehru challenged the British system as he struggled to find ways to break the yoke of colonialism. India's political history may not be understood by many, but I thought it cogent the way he explained the inter-relationship with the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress.Nehru's treatise did not include the tactics used by the British to \\"anglicize\\" and \\"racially demonize\\" the Indians nor addressed why the sacred books, the Vedas were translated by Max Muller, a German. He wrote extensively about the light-skinned \\"Aryan Race\\" but he did not provide much information about the Dravidians and the complexities of \\"race\\" to \\"caste\\".His book will stand the test of time as an informative document of ancient Indian folklore and history. As much as he revered the past, Nehru's vision for India's future, however, lies with science and the lessening of past religiousness, and the old codes imbued with the supernatural and metaphysics speculation. These views of his thoughts in 1940 are vindicated by the richness of the computer and engineering technology that is in present day India."},{"Title":"The discovery of India","review":"Having grown up watching the classic television adaptation of the book, I have always had a great admiration for Pandit Nehru. A few years back I bought the book and it was sheer joy to read through and to get to know India personally. Even though I am an Indian, I would say, that I felt more close to India after reading this book. I would bet, this is one history book you will not put down for sure.In today's perspective, when everyone is looking at and talking about India, there are lots of misconceptions. Unfortunately, most of us (Indians) have forgotten our roots and have no clear idea of our own country. I would bet you pick up randomly any number of Indians and ask him or her about the history of India, and everyone will come up with his own version, which is almost always far away from truth. I have to accept that I too belong to that category, but now with \\"The Discovery of India\\" by my side, I believe I won't go wrong. For instance, how many of us know that the real inhabitants of India, the real Indians were actually the South Indians (Dravidians) and rest of us are all Aryans the non-inhabitants? How many of us know that the so called caste \\"Kshatriyas\\", \\"Brahamans\\", \\"Shudras\\" had nothing to do with religion but was an indentification of one's occupation? How many of us know that the word \\"Hindu\\" didn't mean \\"a person who follows Hinduism\\" but \\"The citizens of Hindustan\\"?(Pardon me if I hurt someone, but that it is a fact. If you already know, then hats-off to you)I personally believe, every Indian must read this book and more so every politician, the current bunch of people regardless of whichever party they represent, because none of them have any idea what India is all about.

Nehru has, at many times, tried to undermine Indian history and often compares it with China. To him, the ancient Chinese civilisation is far superior to that of India. Some facts are outdated as this was written while India was still under British rule. Nehru has also attacked religion several times without understanding it.

There are many of them (one for each state) in this series of somewhat short novels which reflect the good old non pc days --- interesting for a change, sometimes.Jessica Thorne, waiting for the traffic lights to change and cross the street, finds herself standing next to Brodie Hayes. Once the town bad-boy and an ardent admirer of her older sister, Jordanna, Brodie has now become a successful and wealthy businessman.At first, Brodie mistakes Jessica for Jordanna. Jessica barely recalls Brodie since she was a young girl at the time, however, she does remember that Brodie was very aggressive and, at times, threatening in his pursuit of her sister. Brodie had also been angry when Jordanna rejected him and was rather convinced that the reason was that the well-to-do Thornes looked down on him for being poor.Thus, when Brodie invites Jessica for lunch, she is determined to cleverly maneuver her way out of it but she soon finds she is no match for a determined Brodie Hayes. A romance blossoms although Jessica is tortured by the thought that he is trying to live out his fantasy --- or get revenge ---- for Jordanna. Also disturbing is his habit of buying her expensive gifts as if he is trying to buy her affections. Later, we find that Brodie wants a more permanent relationship with Jessica, but not marriage, and Jessica wants a ring. They break up and it seems like there's no hope, but after Jessica loses her temper and makes a scene in a restaurant, it breaks the ice for some true confessions.Not great, but all flowed smoothly for an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Sentimental Journey","review":"This was only the second Janet Dailey book I've read so I don't have much to compare it to.

It is clear, decisive, and concise--everything so much of current work in NT is not. While it lacks the degree of discussion (primary and secondary) that one finds in the later works (Boussett; Neufeld; Kramer), it covers the territory with a clarity they seem to lack.Only one point of concern: While his attention to later creedal developments shows the breadth of Cullmann's expertise (rare for a NT scholar, then or now), this discussion (in my view) appears too early in the work and will (I fear) strike many NT scholars/students as overly Patristic and perhaps as running the risk of anachronism. In my view, this discussion is important (esp. on a history-of-religions level), but it should have been saved for the third chapter or so.Finally, given that this work was written over a half-century ago (without revisions in the interim), it is an excellent place to start, but would have to be supplemented both with the classic works that followed (e.g., Boussett; Kramer) and esp. with more contemporary periodicals, etc. But above all: this is a rare sort of work (now increasingly rare) worth finding and it's a shame it has been out of print for so long. Hopefully Lutterworth press will see fit to re-issue it."},{"Title":"Comanche Prairie: A Western Trio (Five Star Western)","review":"Giff Chesire is known to us who love old fashioned, classic, traditional westerns and indeed I was glad to see Leisure begin to publish his work in paperback after so many years of not being able to find his work. Too bad they made the decision to quit printing mass market books. But about this book, all three stories are worth the price and capture the intensity and drama of what it was like to live in the West, particularly the great northwest of Oregon, where Giff Chesire lived. These are good stories, written by a man who loved his craft and it shows. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Comanche Prairie: A Western Trio (Five Star Western)","review":"Once again Lesiure Books offers modern-day readers the opportunity to sample the writings of a western writer who practiced his art in the '50s. In this case, Leisure presents two short novels and a short story by award-winning author Giff Cheshire.Cheshire grew up in a turn-of-the-century Oregon homestead, an upbringing that resonates in his western and north-western fiction. Cheshire's Oregon background is brought out by 'River of Gold,' the best piece in this volume. This story is a marvel, tracing, as it does, the development of Oregon and the importance of wheat farming to the region. Unlike the other two stories in this collection, 'River of Gold' takes its time to tell its tale of the common farm folk who settled Oregon and battled isolation, bad weather and the California gold rush which drained Oregon settlements dry of men as they headed south with gold fever. There's nary a gunfight in this tale but what a great piece of writing!To my mind, the two other pieces in this collection suffer from the same problem. The main characters in 'No Man's Range' and 'Comanche Prairie' find themselves in bad situations and react with a decisiveness and knowledge of their enemy that stretches credulity.Be that as it may, buy this book! 'River of Gold' alone is worth the price - it may not be your typical western but it's a wonderful, very human story that illuminates the role of the sod buster in settling the West."},{"Title":"Quality of water from public-supply wells in Massachusetts, 1975-86 (SuDoc I 19.42/4:91-4129)","review":"This excellent guide is recipient of the Reviewer's Choice award and is well deserving of it.

It's in these situations you will use a book like Access 2000 Answers!The book is divided into 16 chapters organized by subject and level, easily accessed through a well-organized index. Some of the solutions are very basic other more advanced using VBA programming, and throughout the book you'll find these snippets of VBA code to copy and use in your database application, most of these are useful and easy to follow.To use a book like this one holds a certain risk. It will enable the inexperienced developer to use some of the more fun and advanced features, which we all want to do. But do you know why Access 2000 does what is does? Do you know enough Relational Database and Programming theory to recognize when to make use of VBA code and how to debug the code, so it doesn't create havoc in your application?If you want to make use of a certain feature in an Access database application, its not enough to know how, you must also know what other objects its related to and how they affect each other. For this purpose I recommend Applications Development In Access 2000 (ISBN 076007108X) by Dirk Baldwin and David Paradice, which includes 5 different applications to learn from.An unintentional but added value of the book, is its use as a checklist to estimate your level as an Access developer.

It is important to recognize that this is not a manual or a tutorial guide to using Access, but a collection of commonly asked questions and their answers based on data collection from a technical support environment. Considering the cost and time involved in calling tech support these days, this book provides a good place to turn as an alternative. It is broken up into easily manageable sections, and the answers are well written and clearly understandable to most users, provided they have a working knowledge of Windows. It won't answer every possible question but it does a very good job of anticipating what questions you can expect to have and is well worth the investment as a supplementary reference for Access 2000."},{"Title":"Access 2000 Answers!: Answers (Answers Series)","review":"This is an excellent resource...as long as you understand its scope and purpose.WHAT THE BOOK IS: It's accurately described on the front cover as \\"Tech Support at Your Fingertips\\". It very effectively uses a question and answer format, with many of the questions beginning with \\"How do I...\\" or \\"How can I...\\" The answers are to the point, but not sketchy. The book's sections and chapters are organized around the features of Access: forms, tables, queries, etc. So it's usually quite easy to locate your question and its corresponding answer. And the quality of the writing is consistently good.It might be true that all the very practical information contained in this book can also be found in the Access online help system that's included with Access software. But the book seems to be much better organized. That, combined with the paper format, make for a significant time-savings (and much less frustration).WHAT THE BOOK IS NOT: A step-by-step tutorial on learning to use Access - or (more importantly) a tutorial on database design. Knowledge of that latter topic is an absolutely essential pre-requisite to creating well-designed tables in Access (or any other relational database system). The authors are very good about *distinguishing* database design from using Access itself. Early in the book, they provide a one-page introduction to the topic, emphasize its importance, and recommend that the reader become familiar with the topic if he isn't already.On that latter topic, I highly recommend \\"Access Database Design and Programming\\", by Steven Roman (which covers Access 2000). It's an O'Reilly book (one of the better computer book publishers), and Roman does a terrific job of explaining database design *concepts*, then explaining their *implementation* in Access. However, Roman is intentionally light (or silent) on the subject of Access details such as forms and tables - so the two books complement each other exceedingly well.Once I started reading Roman's book, the Answers book no longer seemed confusingly devoid of context. Instead, it seemed focussed and to the point - because I began to approach it with the necessary background understanding. As a bonus, if you expect to do programming in Access using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), the second half of Roman's book will also come in handy.I fully expect that this \\"Answers\\" book and Roman's book, used in tandem, will be all I need to become a solid Access developer. At a later date, when I need to look into detailed fine points of Access usage and programming, I may acquire the highly acclaimed \\"Access 2000 Developer's Handbook, 2-Volume Set\\" by Litwin et al.I give the \\"Answers\\" book five stars.

The first chapter of the book, per se establishes the premise that the intellectual life is a calling from God, one that is sacred and to be held as a trust.In the second chapter there is a section on the spirit of prayer, among other topics.Chapter three develops the paradox of solitude and involvement with other people. An intellectual, as is the case with other creative individuals, does both.Work is the topic for chapter four and the contexts include: continuity of work, work at night, mornings and evening, and moments of plenitude.A creative scholar must be open to insights around him.&quot;Ideas emerge from facts; they also emerge from conversations, chance occurrences, theatres, visits, strolls, the most ordinary books&quot; (p. 73).The remainder of the book fleshes out this discussion of intellectual work.A reader would leave this book a more thoughtful person from having been exposed to these ideas.

He told me this topic was covered in Sertillanges' book and suggested I read it.The title makes it sound as if the book might be pretentious, but it is not. In the same way that Peter Drucker's superb The Effective Executive is a book for any knowledge worker rather than just for managers, Sertillanges' book should be helpful for anyone who wishes to work using their intellect, rather than just for rarefied intellectuals.The 1998 reissue (the 1992 date listed on Amazon.co.uk is incorrect) of the 1987 edition has a new forward by James Schall. I think he captures the essence of Sertillanges' book very well:\\"At first sight...this is a quaint book. At second sight it is an utterly demanding book.\\"The subtitle of The Intellectual Life describes its contents well: \\"Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods\\". For Sertillanges, intellectual work is not something done in isolation of the rest of a person's life. He believes strongly that in order to do intellectual work to one's capacity, one must order the whole of one's life with this goal in mind. And further, that this requires habits of simplicity, detachment, note taking, memory, writing and more. His book is thus a step-by-step manual that sets out these requirements from the general (virtues, character) to the specific (note-taking, writing).For most people who are not already members of religious orders (Sertillanges was a Dominican friar) it would be terrifically demanding to follow all of Sertillanges' prescriptions - and involve major changes to one's life. Sertillanges does believe, however, that if one takes care with the rest of one's life then intellectual work can be done satisfactorily using only a couple of hours a day. His book is thus a mixture of the extremely demanding and eminently practical - particularly as much of his advice involves cutting out and eliminating habits that waste time and disturb thought (e.g. pointless correspondence and interactions with people, reading of novels and newspapers).After reading Ben Franklin's autobiography and Charlie Munger's Poor Charlie's Almanack at the beginning of the year, I have become increasingly aware of the crucial role of habits in determining the outcome of peoples' lives. I was stupid enough to have spent a good proportion of my life testing out the truth of Franklin's maxim: \\"Experience keeps a dear school, yet Fools will learn in no other.\\" I no longer have any doubt that forming good habits - and most especially avoiding forming bad ones - is terribly important. After all, reliability - which Munger considers the single most important determining characteristic for a person's life - is really just another habit.Sertillanges understood this very well and the importance of habits that facilitate intellectual work is a topic that he brings up repeatedly - and in my view very wisely - in his book:\\"One acquires facility in thinking just as one acquires facility in playing the piano, in riding, or painting.... The mind gets into the way of doing what is often demanded of it.\\"This is not the only resemblance between the advice in Sertillanges' book and that given by Charlie Munger (the best source for his ideas and the most useful book I have ever read is Poor Charlie's Almanack). The importance of a broad base of knowledge, the danger of over-specialisation and the critical importance of only a few ideas in each subject are all covered in this book.Another striking similarity is Sertillanges' view of the importance of 'contact with genius' and how one goes about acquiring wisdom:\\"...the principal profit from reading, at least from reading great works, is not the acquisition of scattered truths, it is the increase of our wisdom.\\"I was left with somewhat mixed feelings as I progressed through The Intellectual Life. At times Sertillanges' overt religiosity became a little much for me (I am not a religious person) and I found his prescriptions rather daunting.As I neared the end of the book, however, my view changed and I found myself extremely grateful that Sertillanges' had written this book for us. It was partly because his section on writing answered with great clarity some problems that I had been wrestling with, and partly because I realised that one could simply take what one needed from his book - rather than the whole package.My difficulty in deciding how much to read remains somewhat unresolved: there is a tension between Sertillanges' advice on reading and that of people like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger on investment (my own profession/hobby). Sertillanges advises cutting down on excess (particularly undirected) reading, including, for example, newspapers:\\"As to newspapers, defend yourself against them with the energy that the continuity and the indiscretion of their assault make indispensable. You must know what the papers contain, but they contain so little...\\"Buffett, on the other hand, claims to read five newspapers a day and urges us to read everything in sight!I suspect the different advice is due to the type of work. Firstly, I am not sure that investing is an inherently intellectual pursuit (Buffett has often said that after an average level of intelligence the right temperament is more important). Secondly, intelligent investment is just applied opportunism - and in order to take advantage of opportunities we must first be aware of their existence.I did not find this an easy review to write. I have had to leave out various topics that I would like to have discussed more fully (such as Sertillanges' excellent advice on writing) and still feel this review may be overlong. However, I believe a review that does not attempt to set its subject firmly in context is of limited use. I'll leave the final word to Sertillanges:\\"There are books everywhere and only a few are necessary.\\"I commend this unusual book to you as one of the necessary ones."},{"Title":"The intellectual life: Its spirit, conditions, methods","review":"Indispensable for anyone desiring to become a genuine and disciplined scholar; it provides an outstanding roadmap for anyone aspiring to the intellectual life and its mastery. A few of Sertillanges' suggestions are antiquated due to the date of the book's publication. This, however, poses no difficulties for the reader as these patches of \\"elderly wisdom\\" are easily updated - substituting the era of the typewriter with the age of digital scholarship. The principles taught in this text remain unchanged over time. After all, it is the task of \\"one who would know\\" to refashion the specific, temporal elements of \\"BEING & DOING\\" in accordance with the essence and ideals which form the timeless core, indeed the heart, of a life lived in pursuit of the highest things. It is the journey that captivates and grips both spirit and mind with a particular awe; overwhelmingly humbling and dazzling the soul of those who bide the perils of such a life and are rewarded, if they do not succumb to their own pride, with the unexpected, dumbfounding flash of perceiving (or more accurately SEEING) an image, a fleeting shadow of \\"that which IS\\" - the act of knowing something for the first time which was not taught to you by another, nor derived as the end product of a line of reasoning."},{"Title":"The intellectual life: Its spirit, conditions, methods","review":"The French A.G. Sertillanges originally wrote The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods in 1920. This edition was published by The Catholic University Press in 1987. The translation from the French is both warm, and serious. It reads as if you are sitting by a warm fire in the evening, in a quiet room full of books from all ages. An experienced friend is telling you the best way to go about spending your future time in this favorite room.What first drew me to this book was its title. I wondered if it would give me some insight into the private thoughts of great thinkers. Besides, if the book has been around 90 years, and is still in print, certainly there would be something to be gleaned from its pages. The title may seem a little daunting at first, but the truth is that this book is a very heartfelt journey into the life and mind of the everyman thinker, whom Sertillanges calls \\"great men\\", but can be any man with the drive, desire, and discipline to think and produce something original.While this book is male-centric, and considers women to be the \\"wife of the thinker\\", this was in no way a hindrance to my enjoyment of the book as a woman. This was simply a product of the time, and also very fair and right in its portrayal of the role of the wife. A wife, Sertillanges says, can be supportive of her thinking husband, and also help him by just being with him while he works, she also working on something she equally loves. This is right, proper, timeless, and in no way means that a woman can't just happen to love being a thinker also, as opposed to say for example, the family seamstress or gardener: both good hobbies and work in their own right. The point in it all is discipline more so than gender.The major themes throughout this book are Faith, Discipline, and Balance. Sertillanges asserts that a blend of Roman Catholic tradition, a purposeful discipline, and a balanced life are the key to succesfull and fulfilling thought thereby generating great works for the benefit of all. I can't say that this formula is wrong as it is based on Biblical values, however, I do believe that Sertillanges places too much emphasis on Roman Catholic Tradition instead of pure Biblical Truth. As a Catholic author this shouldn't surprise his readers; Catholics hold both scripture and church tradition as equal as decreed by the Council of Trent, the documents of which Sertillanges suggests a learned man read. This is one main difference between Catholics and Protestants who hold a doctrine of Sola Scripture - \\"Scripture Alone\\". I fall in the latter camp, but since this book is not a book on theological doctrine, I simply took in this part of the book as informational. I can say that I was very appreciative of the fact that Sertillanges makes a strong case for the validity and importance of men of faith living the intellectual life in service to God. This is a point he makes well.Sertillanges spends a large portion of the book explaining why the intellectual life is a calling, a vocation, and why a disciplined mindset is pivotal in fulfilling this calling effectively. His primary recommendations revolve around simplification of one's daily schedule, having a good understanding and practice of solitude, and preserving an interior mental silence. In later chapters, he described how to organize one's reading, research, note-taking, and writing. Some of the methods described are outdated but can be easily adapted to the computer age. Overall, the ideas and mindset transferred to the reader are of the type that stay with a person, reminding them of a better way when doing the work of the thinker.A few key quotes:\\"Slacken the tempo of your life. Receptions, visits that give rise to fresh obligations, formal intercourse with one's neighbors, all the complicated ritual of an artificial life that so many men of the world secretly detest - these things are for a worker. Society life is fatal to study.\\"\\"Vocation means concentration. The work and the conditions that further it are the whole thing. Money and attention squandered on trifles will be much better spent on collecting a library, providing for instructive travel or restful holidays, going to hear music which rekindles inspiration, and so on.\\"\\"Frequent only a few whose society is profitable; avoid, even with these, the excessive familiarity which drags one down and away from one's purpose; do not run after news that occupies the mind to no purpose; do not busy yourself with the saying and doings of the world , that is with such as have no moral or intellectual bearing [tabloids and gossip sites, anyone?]; avoid unless comings and goings which waste hours and fill the mind with wandering thoughts. These are the conditions of that sacred thing, quiet recollection. Only in this way, does one gain access to the royal secrets...\\"My personal favorites:\\"And you, thinker, why have you come to this life outside the ordinary life, to this life of consecration, concentration, and therefore solitude? Was it not because of a choice? Did you not prefer truth the the daily lie of a scattered life, or even to the noble but secondary preoccupations of action?\\"\\"Thus the wise man, at all times and on every road, carries a mind ripe for acquisitions that ordinary folk neglect.\\" [This is not about intellectual snobbery, this is about a choice that any person can make.]Quoting Keyseling: \\"The truly wise man doed not dispute, he does not defend himself. He speaks, or he listens; he states or he tries to discover the meaning of things. [How is that for a lesson in internet etiquette, not to mention life?]On variety of study: \\"You must cross your crops in order not to ruin the soil. And do not imagine that to carry this comparative study to a certain point is to overload yourself and to lose time about embarking on a special study. You will not overload yourself, for the lights thrown by one subject on another will, on the contrary, make everything easier; as you acquire breadth, you mind will grow more receptive, and less easily burdened. By approaching the center of all ideas, everything is simplified, and what better means is there of approaching then center than to try different paths, which all, like the radii of a circle, make us feel that we are converging on a common meeting place.\\"At this point, I am tempted a create a graph of this spoked circle of varied study, with God at its center, because to know anything truly, God must be at the core. Another picture of this is that to know anything truly, God must be at its foundation; the subject must be approached from a Biblical, Truthful worldview as its basis.This leads well into a final quote, which will also serve as a fit conclusion:\\"The man without some such equipment, is in the intellectual universe, like the traveler who easily falls into skepticism through getting to know many dissimilar civilizations, and contradictory doctrines. This lack of a coherent system of ideas is one of the great misfortunes of our age. To escape it, thanks to the intellectual balance afforded by a sure body of doctrine, is an incomparable benefit.\\""},{"Title":"The intellectual life: Its spirit, conditions, methods","review":"This book would make an excellent gift for the student beginning university work and the tired student, professor, or independent researcher who needs a refresher. Sertillanges has advice for everything from being moral to staying healthy to taking good notes, all of it both persuasive and practicable.It's a good guide for scholars of every discipline, so long as they are Christian or warm to Christian ideas. Sertillanges' arguments, especially in the first chapters, rely upon premises like the unity of God's creation and the incarnation of Christ. For instance, in a section entitled \\"The Intellectual Does Not Stand Alone\\", the author says \\"Jesus Christ needs our minds for his work, as on earth He needed His own human mind; we have that measureless honor. We are His members, therefore have a share in His spirit, are therefore His cooperators\\" (pp.13-14). If you aren't Christian and/or you refuse to listen to any arguments which assume the tenets of the Christian faith are true, then this may not be the book for you.The little sample above gives an idea of Sertillanges' charming prose, and this entire book is full of captivating writing just like it. For some this book will be an edifying one-time read, but for others it can become the cornerstone for a truly fulfilling intellectual life."},{"Title":"The intellectual life: Its spirit, conditions, methods","review":"Still a very good book about:Why (a lot) and how (a little bit) to become agood thinker. Very inspiring.The original French version is available for free online(among others at www.inquisition.ca).Cheers!Stefan"},{"Title":"The intellectual life: Its spirit, conditions, methods","review":"A. G. Sertillanges (1863-1948) was a French Dominican brother who studied the moral philosophy of Thomas Aquinas, the great Catholic theologian. Sertillanges published this particular work, \\"The Intellectual Life,\\" primarily for lay Catholic readers who intend to pursue an intellectual activity as at least a part of their life's main work. His model is a short letter attributed to Aquinas that goes by the name of \\"Sixteen Precepts for Acquiring the Treasure of Knowledge,\\" and his goal is to update Aquinas's vision of intellectual work as expressed principally in this letter for a modern reader. Following Aquinas's lead, Sertillanges gives practical and theoretical guidance in the topics of the proper mode of living for an intellectual and the moral and intellectual framework that should underly a life devoted to study.Among the most interesting of Sertillanges' arguments is the idea that an intellectual life must be a vocation in the sense that an individual must have an inborn desire for intellectual work, and further that a personal lacking such a call will not have the will to accomplish anything in the intellectual sphere, despite perhaps possessing great intelligence or other virtues. So the first insight is that will to do and an interest in intellectual work is the first, most important qualification, and that success or failure in an intellectual occupation is mainly an issue of disposition rather than intelligence.Another principal argument is the idea that an intellectual has a moral obligation to the rest of mankind, and that this obligation demands that all intellectual work must have an eventual practical use for society. The same moral obligation also dictates that an intellectual should prefer a project that is within their ability to complete rather than another greater and perhaps more interesting project that is too large for their gifts, because a completed project does service to the world while an uncompleted work does not serve anyone.Sertillanges also argues that while we should initially develop a broad intellectual base of knowledge to build upon, a deep speciality knowledge is essential to actually understanding the world. He believes that real knowledge is always a knowledge of root causes. One cannot hope to develop this knowledge by a broad survey of many subjects, but instead by endeavoring to understand at least one subject down to the fundamentals. To know one thing is necessarily to neglect others, and a certain amount of ignorance is necessary and unavoidable for a true intellectual.Other reviewers on this site have criticized Sertillanges as being uncomfortably effusive over religious themes, and this is without a doubt a fair criticism. Additionally, many of his arguments rely on appeals to Catholic theology and morality, and it follows that readers who do not share Sertillanges' beliefs may have trouble accepting certain of his conclusions. The Catholic idea of service and good works does however adapt pretty well to a humanist paradigm, and readers who approach the work from this angle will likely be able to resolve the issue to their satisfaction.A related criticism is that most of Sertillanges' arguments are unscientific in nature, and rely more on metaphorical examples and biographical episodes than on cause and effect or logic. This criticism is harder to answer, except to say that many of Sertillanges' conclusion really have the ring of truth when contemplated in the context of one's own education experience, and seem to be effective when put into action.Aside from those qualifications, this book is the most insightful I've read on the topic of education and learning, and among the first rank of anything I've ever read. On an initial approach, many of Sertillanges' conclusions are ideas that you may feel that you have a decent understanding of already. There is, however, a significant functional difference between half-knowledge and actual knowledge, that is to say that you will get more out of an idea that you have developed to enough of a degree to trust in action as compared to another idea with which you are merely familiar. Additionally, many of Sertillanges conclusions share a counterintuitive element with the arguments I summarized above. For those reasons, I give this work my very highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The intellectual life: Its spirit, conditions, methods","review":"... and inspiring. iug igo k8oug ugiug iugh h jiuh i h i i i iu iu k g g"},{"Title":"The intellectual life: Its spirit, conditions, methods","review":"The practical of the book is good.The motivational, spiritual/theological relevant, the conceptual is GREAT!Sertillanges does well in speaking to the issues and reality of doing study work, reading/researching & writing/producing. He even has a section for spouses (p.43-5). The actual practical aspects of the book are worthy of a read.The special pieces of this work are what he says about \\"work\\" from the perspective of what it means as a disciple of Jesus. These comments lend themselves to any discussion of sanctification doctrine, or one's relationship with God as a believer in Jesus.It is not heavy in philosophical or theological language or quotations/citations of others, so it makes for an easier read that expected. He makes many illustrative comments as well, like little word pictures that are more inspirational in tone than simply helps (e.g. pursuing truth is like following a tributary to a river eventually finding the ocean).One comment he makes is regarding the ultimate mystery of knowledge that all people will have: no one is able to know everything, not even everything on a single subject. The absence of things said is more telling than what is said for Sertillanges, as it reveals the greatness of ultimate Truth, found only in the eternal God. So a pursuit of any truth is essentially a pursuit of God. The comment that is so wonderful is that at the end of life, the works of our life will be either as \\"straw\\" or proved \\"reward\\" in God's purifying judging holiness. This will be like \\"the silence preceding the great cry with which the whole soul will vibrate in the flood of light revealed\\" (p.142). In other words, like a great anticipation of something waited for all life, a holding of the breath, a peeringn into the blinding light of God, waiting... waiting... wondering... wanting to know, to see... and then...... I love this picture of what it will be like to come before holy, loving God finally seeing the hope of our faith, knowing truth first-hand, personally, awed and humbled and overcome with the greatness of Him!Highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"The intellectual life: Its spirit, conditions, methods","review":"And there are plenty of maxims in this book. I missed not being able to highlight them on my Kindle, but, then again, it's just as well, since I would have highlighted half the book. My favorite may be an unattributed quote \\"He who stumbles without falling takes a bigger step forward.\\"Sertillanges outlines the nature of and the virtues needed for the intellectual life. He discusses the balance of the physical, mental, and social aspects of the intellectual life. Much of it centers on balancing the depth and breadth of focus: studying and recreation; sitting and walking, reading and looking around; learning and creating, etc.Open to any random page and you are likely to read an inspiring thought in a well-turned phrase. As I read I kept imagining one sentence after another being posted to someone's Facebook status.This is an ennobling manifesto of living a life devoted to thought."},{"Title":"The intellectual life: Its spirit, conditions, methods","review":"There are some books that have the ability to change the way you look at things, and this is one of them. Written originally back in 1921, 'The Intellectual Life' by A.G. Sertillanges O.P. is a manual for those interested in the intellectual life of study. But is is much more than that, it is a manual on how to live. The book is based upon a Thomistic framework, explaining first what the intellectual life is and why one would engage in such work. The author makes it clear that there can be no real intellectual work without virtue, being regularly engaged in prayer, and of course being in the state of grace. Discipline of the body is also expressed. One who cannot control their appetite for example makes a poor intellectual. It is extremely important to have a regular schedule in life, having the same time each day to pray, to exercise, to study, and of course fulfill your regular obligations of work and family, etc. The author even touches upon getting proper sleep, not too much, yet not too little, and even gives advice on how to make your sleep productive.The second half of the book explains how to actually engage in study. He talks about always using the methods of Saint Thomas to form one's intellectual foundation, starting first learning the basic principles of philosophy and logic. The book teaches you how to read and how to properly research the subjects you want to study. He teaches you how to take notes and how to write well. How you spend your time with others and how you engage with them is also talked about. In short, the author teaches you not really how to study or how to write as a separate work, but he teaches you what it actually means to be an intellectual in the true sense of the word. It is not something that you do, but something that you become. He teaches you how to integrate your daily work, your family life, your spiritual life and your study so that you can always be active in living \\"the intellectual life.\\" If there is one book you should read before you read any others, this is it. It has changed the way I think about life, and it is rare that a book has this effect. It has made me think about what is important in life. I am now on a mission to remove any obstacles that will keep me from achieving a well ordered life towards God, and towards my studies.The author also has another great book available titled, 'Thomas Aquinas, Scholar, Poet, Mystic, Saint'. It is an introductory book on Saint Thomas which gives a basic sketch of his life, his thought, his spirituality and his work. It is only 140 pages, but it is a great book to read along with 'The Intellectual Life.' I find it always rewarding to go back and read introductory works on Saint Thomas. There is always something to be learned from them. If you implement what these two books teach, then I believe that you will be made a better person in doing so."},{"Title":"Christmas Stockings in Cross-Stitch","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer, these designs are incredibly beautiful. My sister-in-law owns this book and I have been borrowing it from her over and over. Until I saw this book, it was kind of hard to find stocking designs for everyone that celebrated Christ's birth rather than the coming of Santa Claus. Not any more! (Just so you know, there are also non-religious and Santa designs, too.)"},{"Title":"Christmas Stockings in Cross-Stitch","review":"I too checked this book out of my local library and think it's really good! It's from the publishers of Better Homes and Gardens and Cross Stitch & Country Crafts magazine, and there are some really nice stocking patterns. My favorites are Colonial Heritage Sampler stocking and Victorian stocking (by Barbara Baatz) and Songs of Joy stocking (by Nancy Rossi). There are also smaller patterns where you just stitch the stocking cuff -- cute and don't require as much stitching. There are color photos of every finished stocking, and the charts are color and are easy to follow."},{"Title":"Christmas Stockings in Cross-Stitch","review":"I got this book from the library and I just don't want to return it!

I was disappointed with the limited designs. Half of the designs are only stocking toppers. The full stocking designs are nice but some aren't even related to Christmas.

There's something for almost every Christmas interest - bears, horses, Santa, deer/wildlife, angels, cardinals and even a cat. Quality design, much more detail than cartoon like styles.I would consider this book more for the experienced cross-sticher. There are instructions but little help with stitching or how to assemble the stocking itself. Usually a book has a glossary of stitches/techniques and this doesn't.

As full of tips as it is of already known reminders, I would pick this book up from time to time for positive reinforcement; especially when you are struggling with aspects of some relationship in your life. It was a quick but helpful read, very distilled to key ready-to-apply principles."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"I read a few reviews that said there were Christian views, which isn't a deal breaker for me so I took a chance. This book is entirely based on Christian principles and what appears to be the autho'rs opinion and nothing else. The first chapter states that Howard Hughes descended into a state of self neglect where he did not cut his hair or nails for years. This is clearly because Hughes was mentally ill, yet this author concludes he had no friends and was incapable of love because he chose to care about nothing but money and greed and just didn't try. I stopped reading and returned the book as well as another I purchased by the same author. I don't understand why this was not an issue for other readers."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"Reading this book, once again, I was very touched in so many areas. But I was especially touched by his analogy of how many people set goals to accomplish material landmarks, people who continue to work towards those goals, until they have surpassed those goals. But, who have you ever met who sets a goal to have one confidant to tell everything to, who also tells everything to that person? Who sets a goal to have friends on various levels, besides that one confidant?Not many of us do this, because this means exposing parts of ourselves that we have spent our lives running away from, and filling up with material possessions.But if you will just visualize yourself setting this goal, and all that this will mean to you, you will get more than you expect, and all that you can handle.Read this book because you are a human being, worthy of being listened to, while you experience your soul connecting to another's soul, as you feel safe to be who you are, right now.You will grow beyond your wildest dreams."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"This book was recommended to me by Richard Weylman. He makes alot of money teaching people how to be successful, and he said this book was worth his time. It turned out to also be worth mine. Friendships are so vital to our lives, but most of us maintain them by reflexes which are not always healthy orconstructive. This book has no great insights, it just points out some very practical ways to make and maintain friendships. That's why it's so valuable. You'll remember something you read every time you interact with someone, and that simple suggestion will make a difference you can feel. Just the small adjustments you make to the relfexive way you used to deal with others can strengthen friendships, soothe hurt feelings, and help you reach out to those who need you. And the whole book took about two hours to read. Buy it, read it, and then give it to a friend."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"The book was easy to read, interesting with valuable information. It is a must for all couples wanting a Christian relationship."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"I found this book on a friend's bookshelf and I thought it was a joke! Who needs to read a book and learn to be agreat friend? Well, you will regret if you don't! This is not some bogus self-pitious help-yourself remedial series; but points out some practicals that we always feel embarrassed to do. For example, it's OK for a guy to tell a male friend that he loves him and cares for him. It's absolutely acceptable to give hugs, shake hands, and touch. Many people oversee the very important fact that friends are always there to suffer with and to cry with. I guess this book doesn't teach you just to be a better friend, it helps you to be more vulnerable and open wth your friend. Remember that you've got to be a great friend in order to have yourself a great friend."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"This book is a great book for people trying to get closer relationships...it's very specific."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"I liked the friendship factor a lot.It is not a book that is going to give you a play-by-play tactical instruction on how to make friends. Nor is this a book of strategy that tells you what to look for in friends, and what kind of friends you should attempt to to make.Rather, it is a book about diplomacy. It definitely feels like a light read (as some negative reviewers commented) but I think of that as a positive characteristic, owing to the general attitude that you need to approach your friendships with -- which is keeping things light.The author never gets too specific, but his general instructions are useful and filled with lots of insight. The writing style is really good, and he is able to successfully tie in quotes and anecdotes from famous figures throughout history to keep the reading engaging.Although the reading is light, the content is good. The author is able to direct the reader towards often overlooked aspects of friendship, and also touches on what kind of situations to avoid.My only criticism with this book, is that I feel as if the information could be a lot more focused. For example, the author has a lot of good subsections that coalesce into points such as: \\"assign top priority to relationships\\", \\"cultivate transparency\\", \\"dare to talk about your affection\\", \\"create space in your relationships\\" - all very good advice, and very well preceded by interesting anecdotes and stories. But you never get a sense of organization or priority in the material. Each chapter has a point like the ones I've mentioned above, and its very difficult to sort out what takes precedence in certain situations and how all of these pieces of advice relate. A little bit more focus in the writing could have made this an amazing book.I'd also comment (as a someone who is not Christian) that there is a bit of Christian writing in the book and there are many references to Jesus. I don't really have a problem with any of it because it's all in good taste.Overall this is a good book, not amazing, but a good primer on personal diplomacy."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"The author is a therapist and discusses cultivating and maintaining intimate relationships for both friendships and straight marriages. The book's religious overtones (references to the Bible, Jesus, and God) increase as one gets further into the book. The book was written in 1979 and does not discuss alternative lifestyles when it comes to intimacy. However most of the principles are applicable.The contents is good common sense stuff, spelled out in a compassionate constructive manner. Sometimes it's good to see the obvious spelled out to make it obvious and fully benefit from it. I feel the book was useful."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"'...Friendship is the model for all intimate encounters.' McGinnis says it himself in the book. And once you read the book, you'll see what he means. Not only has this book helped me with my relationships regarding friends and family; it has also helped me to become a better person. This small book is a good read. Read each chapter, think about what you have just read, let it marinate for a day or two, and then go on to the next chapter. Enjoy the journey!"},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"Being of a cynical bent I must first confess that the rather gimmicky title of the book did put me off a bit. However, intrigued by the premise of a friendship book based on Christian principles, I took a closer look. By and large, while there are indeed references to Bible passages and Christ, the points that the author is putting forward can usually be understood by a person without a Christian background. Even so, for a Christian reader like myself I found the Biblical references did valuably strengthen the point the author was making.What I liked about the book was its focus on getting simple, basic principles across. We all know the importance of love and forgiveness and suchlike; I don't believe anyone sets out to be a bitter and loveless person. Yet, as the author points out, the main trouble people have with love is not that they dispute its value, but that they despair of ever finding it. This book serves as encouragement that things once thought hopelessly impossible may actually be achievable, by dispensing timeless, practical advice presented simply and memorably - advice made all the more so by the author's wealth of experience as a professional therapist. There is little in the way of abstract psychoanalytic terminology; Freud and Jung, when mentioned, are plainly summarized and used to make a practical point. And by practical I don't mean \\"try this approach, it really works, I tried it and see I have tons of friends now\\" (which - let's face it - is a trait too common to many self-help books) - rather, I mean that it is something which makes intuitive sense, which checks out somewhat to my personal experience, and which I can see working for me in the future.All-in-all, anyone looking for a sensible approach to friendship would do very well to buy this book."},{"Title":"The Friendship Factor","review":"I thought this book was great!!!
