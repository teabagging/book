THS BOOK SHOULD NOT BE READ UNLESS YOU LOVE THE DESTRCTION OF THE WONDERFUL HUMAN NATURE GOD CREATED."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I feel relatively uneasy about saying something negative for such a classic as 1984. But, learning the book's lesson about what the world would be like if one's individuality were lost, I'll say what I truly feel. I think this book is slow and depressing. In fact, the only reason that I kept reading on was because of the introduction of Julia in the story. I found her character intriguing. Why was she put there? Who is she? Can her motives be trusted? It was only after I read the story, that I realized she was created by the author for the sole purpose of being used as a barometer for Winston's (the protagonist in the story) individuality. What Julia means to Winston is an indication of how much Winston has lost of himself. His ability to think and remember the past.In 1984, the world is divided into 3 superpowers. Winston belongs to the Ingsoc Party (a contraction of [Eng]lish [Soc]ialism) where to have thoughts in opposition or in deviance with propaganda meant capture and subsequent brainwashing by the Thought Police. Everyone in the Party is watched and monitored by telescreens (two-way TVs that broadcast as well as receive) and hidden microphones. A new language called Newspeak is a rapidly decreasing subset of English created to make the expression of rebellious thought an impossiblity. On top of this, all books and works of literature were being rewritten in Newspeak and their essential meaning contorted to serve the purposes of the Party.If George Orwell's vision of the future haunts you, then his objective was achieved. His main goal in writing this book was to both set a mood and give a warning. The mood he sets is for what an extreme Socialist state would look like twenty years from the time he wrote the story. His warning is of what would happen if Socialism were perverted by the ruling class where power becomes an end and not just the means.The ideas presented in this book are powerful and well thought-out. However, the story itself is dull and uneventful. If you like a story that you can read and reflect on afterwards, this is your book. If you like faster-paced stories, pass on this one.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3 (humorless, basic English dialogue)E (Erotica) - 0.5 (go Julia go)A (Action) - 0 (n/a - goes hand in hand with the story being dull)P (Plot) - 3 (dull story, good vision)"},{"Title":"1984","review":"To me this novel is unmistakingly about religious doctrine, not just totalitarian governments and the terrors associated with revolution. The way people are told to believe in the Party (Christianity) even though they have the intelligence to reason that it is totally illogical. I can see no difference between someone who has faith and someone who is prepared to use doublethink to mentally condition themselves. Both require the user to operate at two levels - to apply scientific fact for instance to construct televisions and rocket engines, and then to be able to switch into illogical rambling and decide that they believe an obscure doctrine that has no basis in fact.That is why Orwells ideas cannot be dismissed as &quot;far-fetched&quot; and irrelevant. If the faithful ever gain the whip hand of society we may well see ourselves being repressed into acceptance of ignorance and the worship of Big Brother (God). What is it they tell us as children? That God is omnipotent and can see everything? Does that sound similar? The telescreens and microphones are simply an extensions of God\`s apparent omnipotence and the Thought Police the modern dy equivalent of the Spanish Inquistion.I found it very ironic that one reader claims that his desert island books would be 1984 and the Bible. The former is a book that warns against society discarding intelligent thought and reason, the latter is a book that through the ages has caused that to occur.Everyone should read this book if they can. There are many levels of comparison other than that of religion of course, but it is here that I see the most relevance to contempoary society."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I am a second year high school English teacher and I just read this book for the first time because I loved Animal Farm and I am now trying to figure out a way to talk my district into including it in the curriculum.I am not a very political person (I don't even vote), but this is a very interesting read about a society that never existed, but is coming very close to emerging: a society in which someone is ALWAYS watching (think reality TV mixed with Bush's phone taps).If you have never read this book, do yourself a favor and pick it up."},{"Title":"1984","review":"As a summer reading assignment, I was assigned this book to read and appreciated Orwell's sense of imagination.

(OR ARE ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS FROM THE DESK OF big brother? Now that would make sense.) Help me out here, guys! Am I missing something? Or are there really that many people that can read Orwell and totally miss what HE is saying. I'm just the messenger of the messenger! Get it?Okay, so again, here's my take on Orwell. Reviewers, please point out where I am wrong if you think my review UNhelpful. Thank you.Orwell's classic 1984 is, very simply, true. Many believe that it was a prediction of what our world would be like in 1984 (it was written in 1951). It was not a prediction but rather an analogy to the world of Orwell's time. He was ALREADY LIVING IN 1984.Most people cannot (or will not) see that our world is already controlled by BIG BROTHER. It is sad, scary but true. In 1984 Orwell shows the governments of the world scaring their own population. Well, America does the same thing! So does any country that wishes to extract huge taxes from its population to support \\"needed\\" war machines. Now that the Soviet \\"threat\\" is gone, America needed a new one. Enter: TERRORISM.But if the reader cares to do a bit of research he or she will find that American militarists have been suggesting that the American military and CIA conduct terror against ITS OWN POPULATION for many years now. During the Cuban \\"threat\\" the pentagon asked Kennedy to allow it to blow up an American ship killing Americans! He declined.Are we SURE who was responsible for 9/11? No one has taken credit for it. Why? All terror groups IMMEDIATELY TAKE CREDIT FOR THIER WORK when they pull something off. Why wouldn't the Taliban or Al Quaida jump at the chance of taking credit for the greatest example of terrorism in America? The only LOGICAL explanation is because they didn't do it!I'm not saying that American militarists did it. Maybe it was a country that stood to gain from having America go after those \\"crazy Moslems.\\" Israel? How about Israel and America? Who knows? But there is no EVIDENCE of who actually did it and more important WHY.You can sit back and take the easy explanation spoon fed to you from corporate owned media with its own agenda. Or you can read and understand 1984 and start thinking beyond the \\"obvious.\\" If you want to read a book that picks up where 1984 leaves off try HOW TO SAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD. Yes, I wrote it but that is no reason not to read it. Everyone advertises his or her own books. I simply offer it because, like Orwell, I want people to know what is really going on and why.Read between the lines when you read American \\"news.\\" Better yet listen to news broadcasts from other counties. It's not a matter of writing outright lies as much as OMITTING details and SKEWING various parts of stories.Orwell gives you the tools to begin to think for yourself. If it's too much work or too scary, then just put your faith in your president. He would never lie to you, would he? Like his Daddy said, just \\"read my lips.\\" Oh, that's right. What he was referring to turned out to be a lie and he DID RAISE TAXES after all! Oh, well. At least you can trust Orwell.Joseph Francione [author of HOW TO SAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD]"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is a very well written book, I just had trouble understanding it.

I just re-read the book and it still packs the wallop now as it did then. Perhaps even more so since one can see parts of this book coming true.This was required reading back in the day, and I am glad it was. A series of \\"Negative Utopias\\" such as Animal Farm, Farenheit 451, Brave New World warned of the dangers of societies where personal freedoms are lost, the individual and free spirit are crushed.These warnings and themes are ingrained in our speech today, which is a good thing. 1984 speaks of a world always at war, citizens are under constant surveillence, history is changed on a daily basis. It is a sharp criticism of Communism, Fascism or any government that restricts personal freedoms.It can be a depressing read, since the environment is dark, oppressive, gloomy and the sad ending is foreshadowed by the characters. But it has to be dark, because a society so stripped from freedom would be impoverished. Highly recommended for all High School students, for anyone who hasnt read this, and yes, for those who read it a long, long time ago."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is a dystopic novel. It describes a possible future world where totalitarianism completely controls the lives of the population, leaving no space for freedom, privacy, individuality etc. The novel is very often cited nowadays. Recent events, such as more video surveillance, making communication snooping legal, communist parties appearing in western countries, make the novel seem like a warning, as the world described therein is not unlikely to happen.I read the book as a non-native English speaker and found it easy to follow for my level (C1). I liked that the author invested a great effort to describe in detail the totalitarian world and the mechanisms which keep it alive. The horror of living in such a world is very well highlighted by showing experiences from a typical citizen.All in all, a must-read book, not necessarily because it entertains, but because it educates."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith is one of those.

Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex and even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.If he gets caught, he will be sent to the \\"Ministry of Love\\" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity.

Much more graphic of a novel than I first expected, and humorous at the most unexpected times, I know now why this is a classic novel."},{"Title":"1984","review":"What is the most significant novel of the twentieth century? Justify your answer with specific examples.The 20th century produced a plethora of literary masterpieces. Choosing, and then asserting which novel is the most significant is supremely difficult - almost as difficult a choice as Abraham had when the Lord asked him to sacrifice his only son, Isaac. I personally love the mental stimulation in works of fiction. In particular I love the human drama and savage social criticisms that are found within fictional dystopias. As such, I believe the most significant novel of last century was \`1984' by George Orwell. The book addresses (and attacks) issues of authoritative governments, propaganda, sectorisation, thought control, social classes, as well as rebellion, and love and hate.As a novel, \`1984' is so highly regarded that it has been reprinted into some 65 world languages. This fact alone speaks volumes about the importance of this particular piece of literature. Orwell writes his novels for anyone who can read, albeit some people may find a dictionary necessary at times. By writing simply, Orwell doesn't exclude anyone from his novels.\`1984' is simply written, easily read and thoroughly brilliant. It is about government totalitarianism in Britain - but it could be about any country on the planet. The government in the book are a brutal regime that use lies, propaganda, and power to keep their citizens in a state of fear and subjugation. We have seen Orwell's sage words come true in various world governments; including Zimbabwe, and perhaps more poignantly, North Korea. In fact, the word \`Orwellian' stems from \`1984', and can be used to refer to any tyrannical government.Winston Smith is the main character in the book. He works for the government and his job is to write propaganda - including wiping out official facts, and embellishing government statistics. The world is broken down into three super-states, and the British government he is part of is in \`Oceania'. Here we see more future events scribed before the fact. Oceania can be regarded as similar to the modern day European Union. Currently, sectorisation is in progress all over the world. APEC, OPEC, the G20 and a host of other blocs and conglomerates reinforce this point.This literary masterpiece has been studied rigorously in various high school English classes all over the world, and this is testament to its significance as a novel. My high school used both \`1984' and Orwell's other classic, \`Animal Farm' as texts for senior English lessons. It is somewhat ironic though; that in the 21st century the \`Big Brother' concept has been turned into a smutty, distasteful television program.\`1984' is a book filled with human drama. It is about us not letting go of our democratic values, and making sure that we, the citizens, keep our governments transparent and accountable. It is about the courage of one man to rebel against tyranny, but sadly it also finishes with tyranny winning in the end. The book foresees actual historical events, and lets us know that dystopia is a possibility anywhere, anytime. \`1984' is used in many classrooms around the world - and some aspects of it are part of modern day popular culture. These facts, as well as the points already outlined make this book the most significant novel of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The book was a little worn and was written in but it is just fine.We enjoyed reading the book and i will continue to buy from Amazon.It was here when you said it would be.Again thank you for your promptness."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Used book but in good shape.

At times brilliantly lurid and erotic and at other times completely bleek and depressing. At all times it is however engaging to the point of being one of those cant-put-down type books.Secondly this book is just as important as Hayek's Road to Serfdom. Although Hayek's treatise rightly or wrongly (and I would tend towards the latter) skewed economic thinking towards the economic rationalist line so favoured by the Friedmanites, it was 1984 that put the fear of god into people who care little for economics. It has helped shape the world that we live in today.As a side note, the final part of Simon Schama's History of Britain is a look at The Two Winstons. Namely Churchill and Orwell through the main character of this book. It is an excellent exploration of the two men and really gives an idea about who they were and what they really stood for."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's 1984, changed the way I look at life. It has made me leary of all fanatics, particularly relgious fanatics. The society of Oceania closely resembles many ultra-Right wing organizations. They demand total conformity from all of their members. Big Brother parallels the Judeo-Christian God in that he demands total loyalty. The Party cannot lie. If they say that 2+2=5 then it's true, and the individual is forced to conform. One of the scariest concepts in the book is &quot;Ignorance Is Strength.&quot; I've spoken to many religious fanatics who believe that ignorance is strength. They would rather believe what they have always believed, than question &quot;so-called&quot; truth. The most valuable lesson that this book taught me is that any authority that cannot be questioned, cannot be trusted!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I viewed this book mainly as a pleasant romantic novel. But I found that the main character Winston was very arrogant and shallow though Orwell made sure that the character was very believable. Generally a very well thought out book, though some areas, such as when he is taken by the thought police are very simple and obvious and lacking in imagination. Anybody could have written that section, it lacked originality.However, I thought that the system of government was very well organised and well thought out and seems like an efficient and effective method of ruling. Although, very harsh and unfair and not something you would like to see in practise. Cold and harsh but effective.In conclusion a very romantic story that was upsetting in places. I cried when Julia was captured."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This 1949 classic has lost none of its punch. With his descriptive depiction of the future, Orwell really puts the fear into the reader's heart. With his description of a totalitarian socialist regime, Orwell's masterpiece stimulates a fear that is reminiscent and matched only by The Red Scare of the late 1950s.The most amazing feature of this book is that it still holds relevance today. With America's War on Terrorism, the Bush Administration has started restricting American's basic civil liberties, such as a right to trial. This action almost seems to be a precursor to the restricted socialist atmosphere described so well by Orwell. Still if this book has one message, it is that the individual mind is stronger than any government and that humanity and freewill are things to cherish, not taken for granted.This book is a crystal ball into our country's future and deserves to be read. The founders of our Constitution would be appalled at the current state of the USA and what the Bush cabal is doing to it/us.The ideas in this book are ones that are as appropriate now as when Orwell first wrote them. In this time (2001), we have our &quot;Two Minutes Hate&quot; with Osama bin Laden. Newspeak, the language created by the ruling party in 1984, is amazingly detailed and seems feasible in light of our dyslexic Bushisms. It is based on the English language, and its vocabulary grows smaller instead of larger every year. An appendix, included in the book, enumerates some of the terminology and syntax of the language, and explains how the language is designed to control the thoughts of those who utilize it. To bad it can't be updated with all the words our low IQ president has created.Many of the principles that Orwell writes about (e.g., thought control) are done in a quite blatant way in the book. In the real world of the 20th/21st century they're done, only much more subtly. That way, we don't know they being perpetrated on us. But with the Patriot Act, the boldness is destroying our Constitution.Here's how 1984 applies to current events:WAR IS PEACEThe new &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; is being sold as a guarantor or our safety. While this war is being waged, we're to accept permanent war as a fact of life. As the unavoidable slaughter of innocents unfolds overseas, we are told to go back to &quot;living our lives.&quot;FREEDOM IS SLAVERY&quot;Freedom itself was attacked,&quot; Bush said. He's right, though here's the twist: Americans are losing many of their most cherished freedoms in a frenzy of paranoid legislation. The government wants to tap our phones, read our email and seize our credit card records without court order. Further, it wants authority to detain and deport immigrants without cause or trial. To save freedom, we have to destroy it.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHAmerica's &quot;new war&quot; against terrorism will be fought with unprecedented secrecy, including press restrictions not seen for years, the Pentagon has advised.When you read this book, you'll be better able to see the signs around you. The world portrayed by Orwell is \`HERE AND NOW.\\"If you think it's all a conspiracy... then check out these books also: I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program \`insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over.

It wasn't the current political environment that drew me to the it, yet it's relevancy can't be denied (I'm a former English major and have been reading some of the classics that my education neglected).That being said, a lot of comparisons can be drawn between Saddam Hussein and \\"1984's\\" Goldstein (keep in mind I'm no Kerry supporter). I'm not saying Saddam's atrocities are fictitious, but they certainly were embellished to gain the support of the masses for a war the United States is incapable of winning. Now that war is being used by the Bush Administration (read Big Brother) to make a case for its being elected to another term. Or, to paraphrase Dick Cheney, if the other guy gets elected, you might die. I hate Big Brother.The manner in which Orwell gets his point across is a little gimmicky at times (a manual on how the government operates, as well as one on the language), although I doubt many writers could construct a better way of getting across their point. It's not anything that would detract from a five-star rating."},{"Title":"1984","review":"why? read the book...i dont exist"},{"Title":"1984","review":"A certain mental maturity is needed to appreciate this book.

Go back to your Barbies, nitwits: you'll never be able TO READ."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I found Nineteen Eighty-Four to be genius in the respect that it is absolutely consistent, and original in some cases, in detailing the State's efforts in gaining total obedience from its victims. Most importantly, Orwell acknowledges the means of gaining unquestioned obedience: annihilating man's reason and independent thought, which in turn erodes his will to live by his own efforts. Despite some minor inconsistencies in the plot, Orwell's theme about man's struggle to live in a totalitarian state is an intense, emotional experience.Cleverly labeled concepts such Newspeak, Doublethink, Thoughtcrime, Sexcrime, etc, are an interrelated, systematic means of destroying man's ability to reason and observe existence objectively. Objectivity is the means of identifying and differentiating percepts from reality, which are then condensed into concepts. Without objectivity, concepts cannot be formed; without concepts, language is not possible. Big Brother recognizes this fact and works backwards by manipulating language to shape concept formation. The resulting oversimplification of concepts and ideas eventually leads people to question their observation and knowledge. How will one discern the real truth? By relying on an outside authority: the State.The obliteration of the mind is compounded day by day by the harsh, desolate environments and the endless repetition of propaganda. Dependence, anxiety, and helplessness soon replace independence, confidence, and strength. Students of philosophy will no doubt see the State's stance on gaining knowlegde, ethics and politics similar to that of Plato, St. Augustine, the Medieval Church, Calvin, Luther, Hegel, Marx, etc.Finally, Orwell states the real reason for gaining man's obedience: power for the sake of power. Orwell is consistent: Big Brother does not pay lip-service to man's supposed base and evil nature. No, the state wants obedience because it can take it. This is the politics of, as Ayn Rand once stated, \\"might makes right.\\"Of minor point, there are some minor inconsistencies in the plot. One must ask the question: how can citizens/automatons, who are constantly conditioned to be totally intellectually and perceptually dependent on the State, run a quasi-technological industry by their own independent reason and actions? Despite this, the overall point of an omniscient and omnipotent State is understood.Nineteen Eight-four is an excellent book if one wants to observe the effects of the loss of independence and freedom on individuals. One noteworthy point: Orwell, an avowed socialist, indirectly attempts to distinguish socialism from communism or fascism. Throughout this work he demonstrates the essential need for objectivity and reason in man's life. Despite this, there is no objective reason to believe that man is his brother's keeper and that he must surrender the fruits of his labor under threat of government compulsion. History demonstrates socialism (government control of personal property) as the transitional period from some governmental controls to total control.

I listened to this while driving to work in my car. This is a very deep, thoughtful novel to begin with. It is made so real by a good actor. I highly recommend this."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is a story that, unfortunately, seems to be slowly coming true. Many science fiction titles are escapist literature that either imagine a very different world(s) from our own, or at the very least, hold out some hopeful message - in other words, the good guys usually manage to win. This is neither kind of book. And it is science fiction because the sinister use of technology is what allows Big Brother to invade everyone's privacy and dictate what the characters can do or say, with severe, nightmarish punishment for \\"disobedience.\\" There have other novels that have seized upon this idea of an anti-utopia, but Orwell was one of the first to place it in a realistic future, and in a chilling this-is-all-too-possible way.And the parallels with our modern world are especially profound, parallels that are obvious all around us. The growing number of surveillance cameras on street corners, the ironic (but deliberately) named Patriot Act, the rise of political and religious intolerance in the world...all of it does not bode well for the future of our basic liberties. Orwell got in right back in 1948, and although he was primarily referring to the \\"red menace\\" of his era, the tactics used by suppressive governments are tempting for any government because of the control such tactics provide, liberties be damned. Your agenda- whatever it is- can more easily be achieved if you can identify your enemies early on and thwart their every move. The problem is, when your enemies are law-abiding citizens whose political (or religious) views don't match your own- and that's the only \\"crime\\"- you've stepped over the boundary of national security and entered the realm of repression. And to stop open criticism of these tactics, these governments (including the repressive one in 1984) invariable claim that the critics are \\"unpatriotic,\\" \\"traitors,\\" maybe even \\"terrorists.\\" Sound familiar? Repressive governments have been using these tactics for centuries; only now, modern technology makes it a whole lot easier- and yes, unfortunately, a lot more tempting.Of course we don't want real terrorists. The problem is, a \\"quick fix\\" of sweeping powers put into the hands of a relatively few like-minded individuals- with checks and balances muted if not totally brushed aside- can, will, and has lead to abuse of those powers, primarily for political and personal gains. That was the real message of 1984, and it's one we should never forget. And if the citizens of a repressive government either don't recognize the danger- or worse yet, vigorously defend it under some mistaken notion of being \\"patriotic\\" themselves, surrendering their own liberties in the process- that just makes it all the easier for the incumbents to remain in power, with little chance for genuine reform or change.It's all there in this great book, 1984, which deserves to be widely read forever and amen.-Mark Wakely, author of An Audience for Einstein"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Nineteen Eighty-four is a classic and timeless book; It has as much effect today that it possessed in 1949. I would strongly argue that this book is a classic novel and deserves every bit of praise that it has and will receive. It doesn't feel like there is any type of language barrier between Orwell, his message, and today's reader. He often uses long sentences with very descriptive words to allow the reader to be able to see/feel/smell every place and problem that the main character, Winston Smith, encounters and deals with.I expected this novel to be painful to read and understand, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that Orwell had done an exceptionally good job of writing the novel, and thus made reading the book utterly painless. One of my favorite descriptive paragraphs in is when Winston enters the canteen where everyone eats lunch. Here is an excerpt form it:\\"In the low-ceilinged canteen, deep underground, the lunch queue jerked slowly forward. The room was already very full and deafeningly noisy. From the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth, with a sour metallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of Victory Gin. On the far side of the room there was a small bar, a mere hole in the wall, where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip.\\"Slowly I began to see the chapters fly by, amazed by the originality that the setting included. This was meant to be a bit of a pseudo-Sci Fi novel, in that it is set in the future. But unlike many other Sci Fi novels, however 1984 does not focus on how the technology works. Rather Orwell focuses on why it works and why the government made it, or replaced something else with this new approved technology.I was fascinated by how believable the setting was and how myself, as the reader, didn't come across any of those usual Sci Fi moments where something is just to out there for the reader to grasp, or relate to at all. This is a book about humans and the human condition, not about sparkily flying cars or teleporters. In fact, many things about the futuristic setting of 1984 make you glad that you are in the present time and not in this hellish future of thoughtcrime and Ingsoc(which means English socialism in newspeak, a new form of shorter English). From horrible tasting \\"victory\\" coffee, gin, and cigarettes, to the constant fear of being prosecuted with thoughtcrime. The reader is constantly drawn into Smith's nightmare. Even just having unusual facial patterns in public or in front of one of the countless telescreens could lead to not only your own death but you being erased from history. Indeed, the world of 1984 is Orwell's own interpretation of a world with socialism as its only form of government, and how he thought socialism would naturally evolve.The sense of paranoia and the disturbing way one could look at this new age as a possible future for the human race is immense, where everyone is as politically correct as can be. Children turn in their parents to be killed by the government for thoughtcrime, and people watch extremely gory movies and laugh their heads off when the children and their mother get pumped full of lead from a helicopter. Wars that may or may not really be going on, constant missiles going off around the towns, blowing up hundreds of people everyday, leaving the others left alive without a sense of fear because they know that Big Brother, the father figure of the party, will save them from their enemies, all these features add to the unusual background of the story. Winston himself works at the Ministry of truth, and basically writes some of Big Brothers speeches, creates imaginary hero's of war to raise the morale of the people, rectifying history books and novels to better fit the parties beliefs, and the creation of propaganda. I found it interesting and ironic that Orwell would make the main character, who despises the party inwardly, work for the very ministry that keeps the lie a reality.I could safely recommend this book to anyone who likes English literature, or likes to think and ponder of an idea or thought. Because I found the whole premise of the book incredibly enjoyable and thought-provoking. It all seems so believable, like Orwell saw all the gaps in the theory of his novel and his invented culture, and made sure to cover them all. It takes you to another world politically, but isn't fanciful about it; in fact, when I think of this new London and Oceania, I think of a very gritty, dirty and rusty nation.I really loved part I of the book as it is more about introducing you to Oceania and the Party's rules/beliefs rather then the progression of Winston as a character and his situation. \\"War is peace, Freedom is slavery, Ignorance is strength\\" is the slogan for the party, and it is repeated many times throughout the novel. I think that it was a great yet practical way for Orwell to sum up the attitude of the party and the setting of the novel in just nine words. 1984 truly is a classic of English literature. It will, and has, stood the test of time. It feels like this book has hardly aged a day, because of the detailed yet simple writing method that Orwell uses. As long as the English language remains the same, one could read this book and understand what Orwell is portraying in 1984. Because it relates to basic human fears of always being watched and the fear of speaking out and being your own person, someone who thinks for himself. The novel has a universal character to it. Anyone could relate to it; not necessarily paranoia, but just that feeling like you cant quite speak your mind fully for one reason or another."},{"Title":"1984","review":"If not one of the more entertaining novels, this book is certainly one of the most important reads of the century. As others have probably already stated, this book is not so much a warning as it is a clear testament of what is already happening today. It is meant to destroy your impression of society and the world, forcing you to see it as it is; not as it is represented in the news, in film and other mind deluding media.I cannot put it any simpler than that.The story is about a man who lives in a futuristic world that is governed by the will of the nameless, faceless government, which is only referred to as, \\"Big Brother.\\" Big Brother controls not only the actions of the people, but human thought is also enforced. Everyone is watched. The most disturbing aspect to this story is not the fact that human rights and individual freedoms have been stripped away, but the fact that everyone agrees to these terms. That leaves no room for change; no will to fight. It is a story about a government that was allowed too much control over the people, where the future is hopelessly secured and preserved by totalitarian rule.It sounds impossible, I know. But it is not impossible. There are countries and governments who have achieved such power over the wills and minds of the people and, like in this story, do not believe they are being oppressed, simply because they do not know freedom or individuality, having never experienced it, or worse, forgotten what it was like.The People's Republic of China just happens to be one such government, which has managed to not only limit outside information from entering the country, but controls what people see and hear within the country's walls. Chinese search engines are monitored and websites that speak of government crimes are shut down. Local news in China is also heavily monitored and journalists who step beyond their stations and center their articles on truth are threatened with their lives. If you were to tell a citizen of China that a whole village was massacred for protesting the construction of a power plant intoxicating a nearby river essential for the village's survival, then that citizen would most likely call you a liar. All Chinese citizens see on their television sets are repeats and repeats of heroism in the fight against the Japanese occupation, which only strengthens the loyalty the people of China have towards their government, forever binding them to that *one image, while the Communist Party strategically conceals the bloodbaths and assaults on their own people.Despite the fact that this book was written long ago, it has more standing purpose today than it ever did in the past. I use China as an example because I know something of that country and its people, but such human restriction is practiced in all countries, some more than others. I remember when the war in Iraq began, there were millions of people somehow believing that Iraq had something to do with 9/11, encouraging everyone, even senate members of the Democratic Party, to support Bush's decision, and they did.The minds and the wills of people can be bent, shaped and directed by your government, while keeping you completely blind to the fact, and this book here is probably the best example of how it is done and how far it can go...if it is not stopped."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is more of a timeless book than \\"Animal Farm\\" in that while Communism itself has come and gone, the superstate described in this novel, has not.There may be no Ministry of Truth in our time, but who can't see the parallels between the politically correct newspeak and doublethink described in the book and that created by the 'politically correct' wordsmiths of our era?All, in all, a well written book with \\"eye opening\\" coverart in the Signet edition with forward by Erich Fromm."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Even though it may be two decades past its proposed occurence, \\"1984\\" by George Orwell is just as relevant and unsettling as ever. Orwell crafted an original novel of a negative utopia where humans live under the almost complete power of a government which monitors the actions of all. Yet there is more to the story than the fate of what happens to its two main characters, Winston and Julia.Winston Smith is discontented; he finds himself more and more having radical thoughts that go against the government, and finds himself taking actions that could get him arrested if these actions were known. But Winston doesn't care - he knows that there must be more to his life than the lies the government passes off as truth, the very lies that he helps them to rewrite in his job at the Ministry of Truth. When his path crosses with that of Julia, the two embark on an 'illegal' love affair and further rebellion against Big Brother. Their effort is doomed to fail and the reader watches the deterioration of Winston's resolve, and of his memory.While the story of \\"1984\\" is engaging and well-written, the characters vivid and actualized, there is more to the story than such a simple summary. It is a dark treatise on the effects of power when held in the hands of a few, or even also just the corruption that the drive and desire for power can have. In a world that is constantly changing and making advancements in technology, the world that Orwell envisioned is all too ghostly familiar. It would be rather easy to imagine a world where people accept what they are told through the television and other media, without giving it a second thought (or even a first thought) of their very own. It is all too easy to imagine the world described in \\"1984\\" even two decades later, for Orwell's nightmare vision has no expiration date."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell imagined the future in a dull state where every single thought, emotion and action would be monitored by the government.1984 tells the story of Winston living in a socialist country, feeling depressed and then deciding to rebel.Orwell is able to convey the helplessness of Winston as well as his routine by use of short snappy sentences.

And the concerns it raises will never be outdated. Think of how you can be traced by credit card transactions, and how every information about your habits, income, interests, etc. is stored somewhere. Then think about the telescreens in 1984 again. Privacy has become an illusion. Also consider this: The information we receive, from newspapers, tv, radio, or the net can be manipulated easliy. How do you know something you saw on tv is real? You weren't there. How haven't seen it happen. You can only trust that the information you receive is true. And if a totalitarian regime takes over, it doesn't matter whether it's Communist, Fascist, or Fundamentalist. People will suffer regardless of ideology. Consider a Christian Fundamentalist government. -Mandatory Church attendance to be conditioned with the newest propaganda (2-minutes-hate) -Sex before marriage is unlawful (as in 1984) The list could be continued, but what's the point?

Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin both once said &quot;Those who give up Freedom for Security, will not have, niether do they deserve, either.&quot; 1984 is a perfect description of a society that gave up their freedom hoping for safety.

Previous posters are correct that Orwell NEVER intended his novel to be an indictment against Communism. After all, Orwell himself fought against the Franco Regime during the Spanish Civil War - on the side of the Republicans AND Socialists. I would like to respond to a certain (British) poster thus: The individual reads and relates his interpretation of a novel/philosophy to the modern situation in which he/she finds him/herself. This would inevitably lead some to relate Nineteen Eight Four to a modern totalitarian society based upon the personality cult, e.g., North Korea (Kim jong Il, Our Dear Leader)."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is the best book I have ever read!!

The book holds numerous references to the horrors of stalinism and nazism as well as describing the problems with democracy (the same argument that he brilliantly describes in his previous novels and essays). Also it shows the problem of the individual within the collektive and how easily groups and structures can hold the individul hostage.

George Orwell'simagination captivated the mind throughout the novel. One constantlyforgot that Orwell was a man of the 1940s writing his view of what the world would be like in 1984. It was amazing to read Orwell's perception of the future in such vivid detail. This is the story of an entirely new world. Just as people thought that the world would become utter chaos in our far future, the year 2000, George Orwell believed that in his far future, 1984, there would only be three superstates in existence: Eastasia, Eurasia, and Oceania and the world would live under complete government control. ...The totalitarian government present in Orwell's novel is in many ways similar to those which have existed throughout history in Russia, China, Germany, etc. It is fascinating to think how Orwell was impacted by the events going on around him. This novel was the means by which George Orwell warned the nations of the possibility of complete loss of individualities and freedoms. 1984 screams to be read by all. It is a disturbing leap into the reality that these circumstances could come to be, but it is also a novel of great imagination and creativity and tells a story that one could never forget."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When I have the chance to read it,I was really shocked because what the book said was the history in red China.All the things are familar to any Chinese people over 30 years old.I am surprised because there was no difference between reality and the imagine of author."},{"Title":"1984","review":"to be perfectly honest, after i'd completed '1984', i feared for us all. partly because i am a perpetual worrier, partly because this book so easily depicts what can, and already has begun to, happen to us as a race. 1984 intricately details a world shot to hell by mass propaganda, scapegoating, blatant lies and brainwashing. the story is told in third person, through the jaded and frustrated eyes of one winston smith, just another poor soul gone wrong. we see what the world has become: a machine, cold, colorless, dangerous. the government, known only as the Party, literally rules each and every aspect of life, down to the thoughts in one's head. the storyline sounds somewhat complex, but in actuality it's easy, almost too easy, to understand and relate to. the saddest, perhaps, part of this book was the fleeting love affair winston becomes involved with, and its eventual, and inevitable, demise. towards the end of the story my heart sort of dropped, because it does not necessarily end in triumph. i cannot give a good enough description of this book, it's hit too unbelievably close to home. i bought it not too sure of what the premise was(which i do often because i am a fool), but once i'd opened the book, i could see i held a real gem."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is the most influential anti-Utopian novel of the twentieth century.

Orwell's unique vison, formed in the desperation of post-war Europe in 1947, descibes a future in which a totalitarism government controls all. The main character, Winston, is not set up to be a likeable, hopeful, hero-type protagonist, but rather, is created in the image of all men. He loses hope, attempts to fight the system with small rebellion of his own, and fails miserably, as anyone would under the circumstances. His affair with a woman is the subject of censure in many reviews of this book, but again, it was not set up to portray a loving, human relationship, but to serve as irony in it's most bitter form. When love, honor, compassion, and other words of that calibure are erased from the human vocabulary, you have 1984. And Orwell's vision may serve as the correct one. People today lose their humanity with alarming swiftness, and we are faced with the simple choice Winston must make: fight or flee. Fight Big Brother and the government, or flee the mind and become another faceless drone like other characters in the story. While depressing, this novel also raises some interesting questions.

It is also the story of one man's fight to maintain his freedom in the face of totalitarianism. Through this book, George Orwell depicts, in horrifying detail, a world that is becoming increasingly similar to our own.The book follows a man named Winston Smith, a resident of Oceania, which is a huge country under the power of Ingsoc (English Socialism), commonly known as \\"the Party.\\" In Oceania, the Party has the ability to monitor everyone at every time, so that not even one's own thoughts are private.Winston seems to be the only person alive who (secretly) hates the Party and longs for its demise. He alone believes in truth, in external reality; everyone else is content to let the Party dictate reality. And dictate it does: in order to keep its hold on Oceania's citizens secure, history has to be rewritten, the past continually altered, in order to prove the Party infallible and to erase the memory of the days before Ingsoc took over. Thus, one day Oceania is at war with Eurasia; Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia. In the next moment, Oceania is at war with Eastasia, and suddenly Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia. Whatever the Party calls truth, becomes truth. If the Party says that two and two are five, it becomes fact. What's disturbing about this is the fact that the people of Oceania not only agree with the Party when it alters reality; they believe the party. Through a process called \\"doublethink,\\" they are able to consciously change or erase their memories, then forget having erased them, then forget the act of forgetting.1984 exposes the danger of giving up our individuality, the ability to think for ourselves, the abandonment of the belief in truth. The only way the situation presented in the book ever could have happened is if the people of Oceania let it happen. They let themselves be controlled to the point that they no longer realized they were controlled, nor that they had at one time been free. Once they did that, they reached a point of no return. Possibly the most frightening thing about 1984 is that there appears to be no way to escape the Party, no way to overthrow it, no way to be free when \\"Big Brother is watching you.\\" That is the message of 1984, and that is why the book is so horrific: once people surrendered their minds, they lost them forever. There is no revolution, no awakening, no hope of revival.Through his book, Orwell warns us, the readers, that if we do not fight for the right to think, the right to \\"say that two plus two make four,\\" we will eventually become the people of Oceania.The world of 1984 is a horrifying, hopeless, utterly dark world, one which we must fight against at all costs. For this reason, I think everybody should read this book. It forces us to see the logical conclusion of the postmodern attitude that \\"truth is relative.\\" That is perhaps the most dangerous belief in our world today, a point 1984 demonstrates all too clearly. If truth falls, so does our world, our ability to be free human beings. \\"Two plus two make four,\\" wrote Winston in the book. \\"If that is granted all else follows.\\" The reverse is also true. If two and two could just as easily make four or three, if truth is left up to the individual to decide, if there is no solid, external foundation on which we can lay the structure of our morals, beliefs, and our society, then it is only a matter of time before we will fall into the hands of Big Brother."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is an amazing cautionary tale of what happens when the government runs amok and squelches the very people it is supposed to represent. As with any symbolic tale, readers will allow The Party- and its figurehead, Big Brother- to embody whatever agency or institution they deem oppressive, although it should not be lost that the political philosophy of 1984, or \\"INGSOC,\\" is a paraphrase of \\"English Socialism.\\" Orwell, like Ayn Rand, foresaw the bleakness of a socialism approaching its purest form, and recognized how society becomes much blander and grayer with regulation and equal rationing for everyone.For everyone, that is, except for those in charge, such as the antagonist O'Brien and the Brotherhood. The Inner Party members purposely created a caste system under the auspices of caring for those who are less fortunate or intelligent, while in reality systematically ensuring that the rich and powerful stayed that way, without threat of the lower classes revolting. The Inner Party learned from history that those in power rarely stay that way, and eventually get knocked off their pedestal by the leaner, hungrier classes below them. By creating artificial scenarios of constant war, Thought Police, and imprisoning work conditions that held no promise of improving societal conditions, the Outer Party members and \\"Proles\\" (from proleteriat) would always remain too tired and intimidated to rail against their surroundings. The primary aim of modern warfare, for instance, was to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living.Politics aside, 1984 is a compelling action story, and I was surprised at the many racy, sexy, violent, and terrifying scenes therein, all of which kept me spellbound. Though the future predictions of Big Brother had not materialized by 1984, or (arguably) even now, this story's plot or action sequences are not one bit dated. Protagonist Winston Smith, and eventually his love interest Julia, is involved in a true rage against the machine that immediately engages the reader and summons both interest and sympathy. Surprises abound, and I had no idea until the story's end as to whether Smith would conquer the system, or end up being convinced that 2 +2 = 5.There are far too many fascinating aspects of this book to list. For one, the concept of memory eradication, and whether or not something really did happen if there is no proof to be found of its occurrence. Oceania, homeland to Winston Smith, was alternately at war with either Eastasia or Eurasia, and as soon as the enemy changed, any proof of having battled the other was immediately banished. In fact, Winston worked in the Ministry of Truth, where he and his coworkers spent their days erasing (e.g., burning papers or rewriting newspaper columns for the archives) any proof of events whose existence contravened the present philosophy- this way, (a rewritten) history would show that Big Brother never got his facts or predictions wrong.The book's language is amazing- clearly Orwell envisioned not only an entire dictionary's worth of new words, but a revolutionary new approach to speech as a device to control the thoughts of the speaker. The elimination of words which hold secondary meanings, and/or which convey independent thought, engenders a world in which people are incapable of- or not aware of the possibility of- treasonous thoughts (\\"thoughtcrimes\\"), let alone acts. \\"Doublethink\\" is the act of consciously denying reality, and making oneself believe wholeheartedly Big Brother's fictions."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I can see why this is a classic. A very original tale, quite spooky. I really enjoyed it. It was interesting to read this in 2012, I can see that a lot of the writer's predictions about the future have come true, which is scary!!

Through out the novel, you reach for some shred of hope, some inspiration to hold on to. You will NOT get any. What is depressing about this book, is that it is acutally not all fiction. It is really happening in our world in some degree in a country or another. I actually had nightmares about Orwell's 1984's world during the time I was reading this book. Then I read Animal Farm and it reminded me so much of what happened to many countries after revolution. It seemed that he had predicted the whole ordeal. I am so depressed reading these two novels back to back. I may have to order a silly shallow love story to forget about real life tragedies for a while!!!!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is as real and frightening now as it was in 1948, 1984 or any other time period. The difference is it was mostly conceived as a political story originally but has now become terrifyingly accurate and real in a high-tech world of government and corporate surveillance. Privacy is a major concern now when in the 1980s it was hardly given any mention or great concern. 1984 is about a government worker (Winston) who enjoys his job but starts to have suspicions about what is really going on in the world. The government severely restricts individual freedom, religion, choice of partner (procreation is not particularly encouraged), choice at all, movement and occupation. Winston starts to slip up and slip into the dark side. He knows he will get caught but cannot help himself. Yet Winston dreams the proletariats will rise up to defeat Big Brother. Is there some force in us which cannot be defeated? It is a powerful work that everyone can relate to. George Orwell has been blatantly copied by scores of book and film writers for over 50 years. Read the original for yourself and be amazed. Is the idea of 24-hour a day surveillance, \\"hall passes\\", spying, control, restriction and propaganda that far off?

I think it is apropos because the UN is considering a non-binding regulation of the internet and the prevalence of spying on citizens in many countries of the world, even in democratic countries. Consider Vic Toeves, Canada's Public Safety Minister, proposed bill C-30 which would have given the police and security officials more power to monitor internet and phone communication. I fully agree with the necessity to investigate crimes and particularly child pornography which is rampant on the internet, however the tools used to accomplish this monitoring must be very specific and not intrude on the majority of Canadians.Orwell, I think, hit the nail on the head.

The story is very well written, it gives you a very good idea as to what a Dystopian world could potentially look like.

Orwell's main theme in this book is that the aim of any dictatorship is to bore it's citizens to death and thereby suppress thought.Any form of excitement is thwarted by the Junior Anti-Sex League,24 hour interactive television and repetitive labour.Orwell seems to be saying that without imagination, there can be no freedom.Still,despite the lack of a clear plot, this is the best dystopian book I have ever read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The way Orwell suck you into the book is one of the most effective ways I've experienced. His metaphysical imagination of the last decade is frightening and mind-blowing at the same time.

And to the 15-year-old reader from USA who said that it's mundane, I have a word of advice for you. If you can't imbibe the message in the book, then you're just immature. Mind you, I'm 16."},{"Title":"1984","review":"First, I wanna say that this book is above anything else you will read during your lifetime. It is more inspiring than the scripture, and for many, more useful (no offense).When I finished reading 1984 in my freshman year of college, I was completely depressed, devastated, yet infinitely enlightened. 1984 is not fiction by any standard; the techniques used by the totalitarian governments in the novel resemble those of today's Third World countries very much that you would think Orwell was a real prophet, or maybe just the mentor? Anyway, I come from a country with a totalitarian regime, and 1984 was like a slap on the face and a wake-up call: I suddenly realized why my country is in constant war, why we see the portrait of our own Big Brother everywhere, why my countrymen never taste the revenues of oil and how it is all achieved. Oh, in case you were wondering, I come from a country called Syria.The novel cannot be fully appreciated by an American who lived all his or her life thinking that the biggest threat to their life was the Commies or Saddam Hussein using chemical weapons on them, or, not having milk to go with their cereal in the morning. Those who truly suffer their governments' greed and insanity will undoubtedly find some form of solace in reading Orwell's masterpiece. Alas, most of those live in countries where reading is not a luxury to be had freely, and where existence is a struggle. In short,the novel will transform you to a whole plane psychologically and intellectually. READ IT, for your own sake, for humanity's sake. Only then will you know why it is really a free (well, almost) cure to stupidity, ignorance, and apathy."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I believe that this book shows a great struggle between being an individual and being a follower of an unknown power.

For those of you who believe that power can be benign, just read this book, and you will NEVER fully trust any power structure again."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is not only the best book he wrote, but also without any doubt the best apocalyptical novel ever written and probably also the best book written in the 20ieth century, that is the most important one. George Orwell once wrote that if one was to summarize his complete work, or find one topic in all of his books, novels, essays and short stories, it would be his fight against totalitarian systems. So 1984 wasn't only the last book he ever wrote, but also his impressive final work on the topic that had influenced all his work. Why is it so genius? Mainly because it is a universal work. Of course it describes perfectly well real totalitarian systems that existed, like Stalin's or Hitler's, and it is basically a book against totalitarian systems, but it is also more. It describes a society, but also the minds of the people living in it, it describes the way mankind could be, it is a universal book about human evil. Ideas like doublethink or newspeak seem frightening familiar to us, we know the trends that lead to what has become out of society in 1984. The probably most shocking thing about 1984 is that it is perfectly realistic and logical in its structure. It is a perfect dictatorship, with High Tech and omniposcient. The main difference between the system in 1984 and, for example, Hitler's dictatorship is that the government in 1984 can do something no other dictatorship in reality ever could: Totally reign over man's mind. What Socrates once said today still is true: The thoughts are free. Even people resisting the nationalsocialistic regime and being caught and tortured still had their thoughts, they could make them say anything, but they could not make them really believe it. In 1984, even thoughts are slaved, it takes a long time to change Winston's mind, and it is not easy, but they finally succeed, finally Winston's mind is changed, impressively demonstrated by the famous final sentence of the book. The shocking thing is that even this seems to be possible to the reader, no one can claim that it's not logical. It is interesting to know that Orwell really believed that the future would look like 1984. Sure, he was dying while writing 1984 and had ergo no hope left, but nevertheless it is too easy to claim that he was too pessimistic, anyway. 1984 also is based on his own experience, the confrontation with inhumanity and human misery in his whole life, the experience of the slums in Paris and London, the Spanish Civil War, English hippocritical people, the Nazis and the Holocaust, etc. One really can see the ideas presented in 1984 developing in his work, &quot;Politics and the English language&quot; is nothing else but a description of newspeak, and in &quot;Looking back on the Spanish Civil War&quot;, he already talks about the concept of the nonexistence of truth in a totalitarian system, even using the same example (2+2=5). It is also too easy to say that 1984 is over, that Orwell was wrong, and what he predicted will never actually happen. 1984 is a warning, a horrible and shocking warning which must not be ignored by anyone."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Stephen Bradley: I first read this book and now Im 15 and I still haven't read another book. Every time I read it again I find another piece of clever symbolism. I would recommend this book to anyone! I am incredibly awed by the clever uses of English and symbolic meanings. For example I have been told that Gin was thought to be the downfall of the British Working Class. It would be a shallow understanding of the book to claim it as an anti-socalist book as Orwell (Eric Blair) obviously cared about the working class and was only against pretentous totalatarian states. I invite any like minded people to discuss the book with me. I apolagise for carless grammar and spelling (Im only 15 :) )"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell wrote about his own time, 1948. He found the reality of what was going on so disturbing that he refused to acknowledge this time: he swapped the 4 and 8, hence its title.Orwell explores a depressing humanity, listless with meaninglessness.The crux is at the end where Winston is talking to O'Brien and says he knows that he will fail...that there's something in the universe, something that he will never overcome. O'Brien asks if Winston believes in God. Winston says no. Thus there is nothing that exists that the party does not control.This is Orwell's nightmare; a world without God."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's portrayal of a distopic future is extremely powerful. Perhaps what makes it so gripping is the haunting plausability of it all - you'd like to think &quot;this is a book, it's fiction,&quot; but it could all too easily come true. As a college student, this has had far more impact on my beliefs than any textbook or lecture. If you've read and enjoyed Huxley's &quot;A Brave New World&quot; (also very good), you'll like this one, too!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's unbeleivably captivating and horrific view of a totalitarian society never fails to make a reader reflect upon the riddles of our society. The story of a grand experiment, a utopia gone horribly wrong, '84 has never been as potent, or as frightening, as it is now, as we approach an ever higher level of understanding through technology. The novel revolves around Winston Smith, a typical Party member torn between his personality, his emotion, and the omniprescence of Big Brother and his thought police. Constantly trying to stay as far as possible from the party's cruel influence, Winston learns of the truth behind the propaganda, and learns how the incredible power came upon the first leaders of the party. By controlling thought, the party has become intangible, and undefeatable. From the first sentance to the last four horrifying words, 1984 is a novel to be reckoned with, and one that is difficult to recover from. WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Eric Arthur Blair was an important English writer that you probably already know by the pseudonym of George Orwell. He wrote quite a few books, but many believe that his more influential ones were \\"Animal farm\\" (1944) and \\"1984\\" (1948).In those two books he conveyed, metaphorically and not always obviously, what Soviet Russia meant to him.I would like to make some comments about the second book, \\"1984\\". That book was written near his death, when he was suffering from tuberculosis, what might have had a lot to do with the gloominess that is one of the essential characteristics of \\"1984\\". The story is set in London, in a nightmarish 1984 that for Orwell might well have been a possibility, writting as he was many years before that date. Or maybe, he was just trying to warn his contemporaries of the dangers of not opposing the Soviet threat, a threat that involved a new way of life that was in conflict with all that the English held dear.Orwell tried to depict a totalitarian state, where the truth didn't exist as such, but was merely what the \\"Big Brother\\" said it was. Freedom was only total obedience to the Party, and love an alien concept, unless it was love for the Party. The story is told from the point of view of Winston Smith, a functionary of the Ministry of Truth whose work involved the \\"correction\\" of all records each time the \\"Big Brother\\" decided that the truth had changed. The Party slogan said that \\"Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past\\", and they applied it constantly by \\"bringing up to date\\" the past so as to make it coincide with whatever the Party wanted.From Winston Smith's point of view, many things that scare us are normal. For example, the omnipresence of the \\"Big Brother\\", always watching you, and the \\"Thought Police\\" that punishes treacherous thoughts against the Party. The reader feels the inevitability of doom that pervades the book many times, in phrases like \\"Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed forever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you\\".Little by little, Winston begins to realize that things are not right, and that they should change. We accompany him in his attempt at subversion, and are unwilling witnesses of what that attempt brings about. This book is marked by hopelessness, but at the same time it is the kind of distressing book we all NEED to read...Why do we need to read \\"1984\\"?. In my opinion, basically for two reasons. To start with, Orwell made in this book many observations that are no more merely fiction, but already things that manage to reduce our freedom. Secondly, and closelly linked to my first reason, this is a book that only gets better with the passing of time, as you can read in it more and more implications. One of Orwell's main reasons for writting this \\"negative utopia\\" might have been to warn his readers against communism, but many years after his death and the fall of communism, we can also interpret it as a caution against the excessive power of mass media, or the immoderate power of any government (even those who don't defend communism).Technological innovation should be at the service of men, and allow them to live better lives, but it can be used against them. I guess that is one of Orwell's lessons, probably the most important one. All in all, I think you can benefit from reading this book. Because of that, I highly recommend it to you :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's final novel, 1984, was written amidst the anti-communist hysteria of the cold war. But unlike Orwell's other famous political satire, Animal Farm, this novel is filled with bleak cynicism and grim pessimism about the human race. When it was written, 1984 stood as a warning against the dangerous probabilities of communism. And now today, after communism has crumbled with the Berlin Wall; 1984 has come back to tell us a tale of mass media, data mining, and their harrowing consequences.It's 1984 in London, a city in the new &uuml;berstate of Oceania, which contains what was once England, Western Europe and North America. Our hero, Winston Smith works in the Ministry of Truth altering documents that contradict current government statements and opinions. Winston begins to remember the past that he has worked so hard to destroy, and turns against The Party. Even Winston's quiet, practically undetectable form of anarchism is dangerous in a world filled with thought police and the omnipresent two-way telescreen. He fears his inevitable capture and punishment, but feels no compulsion to change his ways.Winston's dismal observations about human nature are accompanied by the hope that good will triumph over evil; a hope that Orwell does not appear to share. The people of Oceania are in the process of stripping down the English language to its bones. Creating Newspeak, which Orwell uses only for examples and ideas which exist only in the novel. The integration of Newspeak into the conversation of the book. One of the new words created is doublethink, the act of believing that two conflicting realities exist. Such as when Winston sees a photograph of a non-person, but must reason that that person does not, nor ever has, existed.The inspiration for Winston's work ,may have come from Russia. Where Stalin's right-hand man, Trotzky was erased from all tangible records after his dissention from the party. And the fear of telescreens harks back to the days when Stasi bugs were hooked to every bedpost, phone line and light bulb in Eastern Europe.His reference to Hitler Youth, the Junior Spies, which trains children to keep an eye out for thought criminals- even if they are their parents; provides evidence for Orwell's continuing presence in pop culture. &quot;Where men can't walk, or freely talk, And sons turn their fathers in.&quot; is a line from U2's 1993 song titled &quot;The Wanderer&quot;.Orwell assumes that we will pick up on these political allusions. But the average grade 11 student will probably only have a vague understanding of these due to lack of knowledge. It is even less likely that they will pick up on the universality of these happenings, like the fact that people still &quot;disappear&quot; without a trace every day in Latin America.Overall, however, the book could not have been better written. Orwell has created characters and events that are scarily realistic. Winston's narration brings the reader inside his head, and sympathetic with the cause of the would-be-rebels. There are no clear answers in the book, and it's often the reader who has to decide what to believe. But despite a slightly unresolved plot, the book serves its purpose. Orwell wrote this book to raise questions; and the sort of questions he raised have no easy answer. This aspect can make the novel somewhat of a disappointment for someone in search of a light read. But anyone prepared to not just read, but think about a novel, will get a lot out of 1984.1984, is not a novel for the faint of heart, it is a gruesome, saddening portrait of humanity, with it's pitfalls garishly highlighted. Its historic importance has never been underestimated; and it's reemergence as a political warning for the 21st century makes it deserving of a second look. Winston's world of paranoia and inconsistent realities is an eloquently worded account of a future we thought we buried in our past; but in truth may be waiting just around the corner."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's classic was incredibly visionary. It is hardly fathomable that this book was written in 1948. Things that we take for granted today - cameras everywhere we go, phones being tapped, bodies being scanned for weapons remotely - all of these things were described in graphic detail in Orwell's book.Now that we have the Internet and people spying on other people w/ webcams and people purposely setting up their own webcams to let others &quot;anonymously&quot; watch them, you can see how this culture can develop into the Orwellian future described in &quot;1984.&quot;If you've heard such phrases as &quot;Big Brother,&quot; &quot;Newspeak,&quot; and &quot;thought crime&quot; and wondered where these phrases came from, they came from this incredible, vivid and disturbing book.Winston Smith, the main character of the book is a vibrant, thinking man hiding within the plain mindless behavior he has to go through each day to not be considered a thought criminal. Everything is politically correct, children defy their parents (and are encouraged by the government to do so) and everyone pays constant allegiance to &quot;Big Brother&quot; - the government that watches everyone and knows what everyone is doing at all times - watching you shower, watching you having sex, watching you eat, watching you go to the bathroom and ultimately watching you die.This is a must-read for everyone."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Here is the book that first got me thinking about politics and philosophy.This is Orwell's dystopia of how he feared the world would become run by a group of cahooting despots by 1984.The main character, Winston Smith, lives in London in a dictatoeship run by \\"big brother\\". In this state there is no love but love for big brother. There is no excitment but patriotism. Chocolate is rationed and orgasms are banned.

It seems that the publisher scanned the paper text, ran it through some OCR software, and published the work without a human reviewing it for quality."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Six years ago I was in a bookshop and on the shelf I saw a copy of George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;. I had often heard people mention this novel on TV in political discussions and so on without really knowing what they mean't. Out of curiosity I decided to buy the book and see what it was like. I quite enjoyed it, and later that year we had to read it for Year 12 English. What I found interesting were the reactions of the other kids. Some liked it, others found it boring, uneventful or irrelevant. I remember one boy saying: &quot;But 1984 was nothing like that!&quot; The point about this novel is that it isn't supposed to be like a Nostradamus prophecy. George Orwell was writing about the social conditions that existed at the time in which he was living. Shortages, censorship, government red tape and the manipulation of popular opinion. I'm not overly concerned with the book's issues of politics or whether it's been proved inacurrate or not. I like to think of this as the story of an &quot;alternative&quot; 1984, a look at how different the world might be if history went in a different direction. Other books that explore this theme are &quot;The Man In The High Castle&quot; and &quot;Fatherland&quot; which are both set in worlds where the Nazis had won the Second World War. These books revel in historical inaccuracy. I think &quot;1984&quot; still has some relevance though. Especially the way the media alter people's view of the world by deciding what we should and shouldn't see, or the way newspapers &quot;enhance&quot; photographs. An example that comes to mind is when a newspaper altered a photo of the killer Martin Bryant by putting more shadow around his eyes to make this ordianary-looking man look psychotic. George Orwell was right about the idea of people being under constant surveillance, now that hidden cameras abound, a device more subtle and unobtrusive than the telescreen. Even though we're not all wearing blue overalls and worshipping a demi god, free will is being undermined in a more insidious way. This novel has made an impact on other writers, particularly Anthony Burgess. He wrote a novel called &quot;1985&quot;. The beginning of that novel descibes his version of how the world of Big Bother, Ingsoc and the Thought Police came about. This isn't a sequel, more of a reaction to the former book. In conclusion &quot;1984&quot; is an interesting book of a world that might have been, and might still be."},{"Title":"1984","review":"For as long as I live I will always remember the day I finished \\"1984,\\" the first time I read it, while seated in the back of my high school trigonometry class. Inconsolable, I gazed over the last five words - completely devastated - and sobbed uncontrollably.In the ten or more times I have reread it since, I was no less shocked and shattered by the book's conclusion. Ostensibly a cautionary tale about a midlevel bureaucrat assigned to help reduce the number of words in the dictionary, \\"1984\\" is the tragic story of Winston Smith, a freethinking, middle aged man, who through glimmers of a childhood memories and clandestine visits to \\"prole\\" neighborhoods (newspeak for poor), radically tries to reconcile life in a totalitarian nanny state.With the omnipresent hum of the tele-screen always present, Winston is the perfect party patsy, saluting the authorities and seething with anger at the daily \\"two minutes hate\\" that secretly leave our hero wondering who is the Emmanuel M. Goldstein, the object of the government's loathing.When despite medical problems too gruesome to recount and enough secret spies to fill a Le Carre novel, Winston Smith conjures up enough optimism to pursue a romantic relationship with Julia, \\"1984\\" takes on a frightening turn. A devoted (or maybe not)? member of the Junior Anti-Sex League, whose signature emblem is the form-fitting sash that hugs seductively around her waistline, Julia is perhaps not the refuge Winston seeks. Or is she?Without destroying the truly devastating ending, I would wholeheartedly recommend 1984 to anyone who is interested in politics, language, romance and government.Yes, you may be left devastated by the book's last five words, but you will certainly be left with more to think about than drying your tears. - Regina McMenamin"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Most people read 1984 when in high school; it's an accessible classic, with plenty of shock interest as well as literary value. I'm reviewing 1984 here for those who may already have read it. The overall theme of oppression and the fear of totalitarianism is well known; but there are underlying themes that are interesting reading indeed.For example, the excerpts of &quot;the Book&quot;, purported to have been written by the underground resistance under Goldstein (or by the Party itself, if we are to believe O'Brian) is a mouthpiece for his social philosophy. In the fragment of three chapters, the ruling class, middle class and proletariat class (high, middle, low) are pitted in an eternal cycle where the high seek to exlude all others, the middle to achieve high status, and the low to simple create havoc and complete upheaval. Take a look if you haven't read this part of the book carefully. It's mighty interesting.Winston's relationship to O'Brian is also fascinating; the enigmatic O'Brian, Inner Party member and intellectual, has a fatal attraction for Winston--even more so than his passive affair with Julia. And when O'Brian breaks him in the Ministry of Truth, it is as much a surrender of love as it is a brainwashing. The interaction of Winston Smith and his persecutor is a uniquely written relationship.If you haven't re-read 1984 in a while, and especially if you read it when you were young, it's a great book to revisit."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is one of those classics that I never got around to reading while in high school (it was required, but I just didn't read it ;)... At the request of a colleague I picked this book up last year and was blown away by point of the book. In the chaotic and unclear times we live in, I recommend this book to anyone and everyone who wants to understand what the point of the elite is and what the point of government is. Everything is about control and power ... AND KEEPING IT. We live in the novel 1984 ... and that's scary. Should be required reading for all Americans."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Reading it in high school didn't have the impact it was supposed to. Like most classics they aren't appreciated until later in life. For me that came in 1994.This classic is about government interference in our lives. It is a jab at the soviet system then, under Stalin. It was easy to draw parallels between the ever-increasing politically correct language and the language that kept evolving in \\"1984.\\" New words like \\"herstory\\" instead of history seemed absurd. I too felt that government and society were encroaching on my privacy and freedom of speech gradually.The irony is that \\"1984\\" does not have to be about the political left; it can also be about the political right. Our present government is spying on us in violation of the law. People who challenge our government are called traitors. New phrases of \\"flip-flop,\\" and \\"cut and run\\" are used by politicians to increase social and political pressure. These are new words and phrases that keep evolving just like the language evolves in \\"1984.\\" Our government repeatedly makes statements to keep its citizens in a state of fear. Americans can now be locked up as enemy combatants without due process.This is what makes this book such a classic and so timeless. The ink, paper and pen are replaced by the keyboard. The screen is replaced by the one you're are looking at right now.Are we going to end up like Winston and be tortured? May I have some victory gin please?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I liked 1984.

This is my all-time favorite book. Its wonderfully intriguing and sophisticated plot sparks intelligent thought, reexamination of our society, and serves as a warning for our future. This book should be on the &quot;Human Required Reading List&quot; anyway becasue of the every day references to Big Brother and other common analogies. Be prepared to be amazed by the power of the mind!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I feel as though I should be shouting all the cheesy cliches: &quot;What a page-turner!&quot;, &quot;I couldn't put it down!&quot;; but I would hate to parallel such mindlessness with Orwell's pure genius. 1984 is an excellent story with familliar characters (the rebel, the romantic, etc.), but also much more. Orwell's accuracy surrouding both the government and the media is undeniably disturbing. This book and &quot;Brave New World&quot; have turned me on to a whole new genre of literature."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The key to really grasping Orwell's &quot;Negative Utopia&quot; is to get an idea of where he was writing from. Note that the power of the Orwellian totalitarianism stems completely from punishment and fear of such. This seems reasonable considering that Orwell had just witnessed the &quot;glory&quot; of the Nazi dictatorship and the birth of Stalinism. However, such a society still creates a certain level of discontent."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I'm rating 1984 a 10, since it's pretty apparent that the book has indeed stood the test of time to become a twentieth century classic.But people growing up today- particularly since the fall of the Soviet bloc- may have a hard time understanding what Orwell was writing about. At the time the book was written, the Soviet show trials were still in the news, and Orwell- a lifelong socialist who still distrusted most socialists- saw in the Soviet trials what could happen to England. 1984 was then written as a warning to the British of what Orwell felt their world was coming to.Today's readers should keep in mind that the world Orwell warned about was not a fantasy world, but aside from the techology of the Telescreen, very much a real picture of the Soviet Union of the 30s. When government officials start talking about controlling the Internet, and restricting communication between people, or wanting to hold onto everyone's encryption keys, think of 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"de este libro me hab&igrave;an hablado bastante, por lo cual me decid&igrave; a leerelo, y desde esta modesta opinion lo considero uno de los cl&aacute;sicos de la literatura universal.Por lo cual muy recomendable."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Someone wrote that 1984 shows us how the world would be like if the governments obtained complete power over the populace.

If we fail, the nightmare of 1984 can turn into reality.Orwell's 1984 really makes one think. The novel stays on your mind, and hopefully it will never go away.How would I react as a citizen of a totalitarian state?Would I have the guts to stand up for democracy and human rights, knowing that it could get me killed?Even if 1984 is a nightmare, small parts of it become reality every day, throughout the world.So maybe George Orwell's great novel isn't just a warning?And hey, look out for Newspeak!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Though I consider this book a masterpiece I personally like &quot;Animal Farm&quot; better. The ending of 1984 is fantastic..shocking and all around genius...but before reaching that climax, one is exposed to a long and dreary relationship that is based more on hate of their surrounding then actual love. I wish Orwill had paid just a little more attention to the characters. They could have made the book go by a little faster. then again he was a conceptual writer and never really paid much attention to his charactes. Its the message that counts not the content...and the message is a warning about big government presented by BB himself."},{"Title":"1984","review":"&quot;Under the spreading chestnut tree I sold you and you sold me: There lie they, and here lie we Under the spreading chestnut tree.&quot; 1984 is a powerful book about communism and one mans defiance against it. Imagine the world split up into three huge superstates which all are communist. The government controls your way of life, where you work, what you think, how to love, what your provisions will be, and everythiing in between. It is a stunning tale of passion and rebellion that ends with a BANG. A must read for anyone who loves a good story.

When I started it, I couldn't put it down. When I finished it, I couldn't pick it up for fear of paranoia. Even now, after I've finally somewhat gotten over it, there are still some nights I can't sleep thinking about this unbelievably incredible book. It's ten times scarier than any Stephen King novel, and it's at least as deep, if not deeper, than anything written by Poe or Shakespeare. This book should undoubtedly be a requirement for anyone in the entire world living under any form of government. The story takes place in 1984, but it could be set in 2084 and not much would change. There is absolutely nothing I've ever read which even comes close to projecting the kind of heavy, depressing, absolute fear which utterly consumes the reader and stays with them forever. Of course I would recommend this book, but I must warn that it can't be treated lightly. It will send you to the edge of paranoia, and throw you into a smothering kind of depression. This is not a book you will soon forget, and it's not a book you can read without questioning everything you think and believe. You'll never hear the phrase &quot;Big Brother is watching you&quot; again, without chills going down you're spine, and fear filling every corner of your being. You must also read LORD OF THE FLIES for another chilling portrait of society gone wrong."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This books is a classic! It is very visionary and rightly predicts some societal trends towards totalitarianism. It is highly pessimistic, so don't expect a happy ending!!!!I disbelieve the claims that this book is written against religion. In the book, the Ruling Party, which is viewed negatively, is against religion--as we would define it. I find it much more probable to take the simple interpretation--it is written against political totalitarianism. Sure, atheists might like to have a good book like 1984 to trump their cause, but this book can not be understood properly within its literal/historical context without realizing that it strongly eludes to Soviet-style Communism and political totalitarianism in general."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I first read this book in high school but never really appreciated it till just recently. With the passage of the Homeland Security Bill, I thought I'd better refresh my memory of this book. And this book is scarier than any Stephen King book ~~ it's scary because our future has arrived. With Big Brother watching our every move ...The book is a reflection upon past times as well as the future ~~ it's a history of mankind. It is about power. It is about control ~~ one man over another. It is about power through total submission ~~ submersion of the self. It is not about the greater good of life or mankind. It is man at its very worst. Orwell took a deep look into despair and wrote bluntly about it. The surface of it is Big Brother watching every move you make ~~ till you get into the book and realize there is much more at sake. And it's so well-written. No matter that I wanted to put the book down and ignore it, I couldn't. I had to read it to the last page. And it's the scariest book I have ever read.1-9-03"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I've recently finished reading Nineteen Eighty-Four, and it has to be one of the best books I've ever read. It's about the life of Winston Smith, who lives in a alternate future, where the world is ruled by power-hungry socialists who control every aspect of people's lives, right down to their very thoughts.Winston believes that he remembers a happier time before the revolution, when people were free, wars could be won, and laws dictated governments. He decides to rebel against the system, despite the threat of being killed, by starting a journal.This is definitely one of the best books I've ever read. It offers insights not only into the possibility of a horrible future, but also into a confusing present. An example of this is how the book introduces the idea of \\"doublethink,\\" a practice where a person holds two contradictory beliefs at once, and can still believe both. Orwell leads us to believe that this is but an evil communist idea, but in fact, he is satirizing the propaganda of our own \\"free world.\\"All in all, I immensely enjoyed what is undoubtedly the author's biggest masterpiece, and would instantly recommend it to just about anyone."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Not for the faint of heart, this book grips you and won't let go. Although written in the 40s (?), Orwell's message of the horrors of what might happen under a socialist government has not staled through the years. I had always heard the phrase &quot;Big Brother is watching you&quot;, but never understood all that those simple words entailed until I cracked this one open for a read. What I found was an experience very hard to forget. The description of Winston's world is surprisingly vivid, and one can almost feel the &quot;telescreens&quot; silently watching your every move. The torture scenes and mind games the O'Brien brings along about a third of the way in are nothing if not chilling. And then there's the abrupt and haunting ending... I'm not ashamed to say that when I finished I hurled this book across the room in anger, much to the surprise of my family. A classic that I hope will stay on reading lists for years to come, this book should be required reading for all those who considered themselves &quot;educated&quot;. Pick it up. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"No amount of positive reviewing will do justice to the importance and beauty of this book - you have to read if for yourself. What I really want to review are the reviews of some reviewers from Wstern countries. They like the book, but their reviews are of the kind 'This is a book about a hypothetical totalitarian dictatorshp, ..., etc.' What is wrong, is the word 'hypothetical' This book could have been titled 'Bits of the History of the Communist World (albeit a little allegorical)'I don't know what people born in the West understand in this book. Not much perhaps. The very fact that Orwell is the ONLY Westerner I know of to have written an accurate description (though a bit allegorical) of communism in practice, suggests that most Westerners couldn't understand what was happening in the communist world. I suggest that they read it for what it is: History cast into an allegorical novel.Now an example or two. There was a famous picture in history textbooks in communist countries. Lenin in a podium holding a speech, his hand streched to the masses listening. On his left you could see Stalin. Everyone of my age has seen this picture. What most people haven't seen, though, is an older version of it: Lenin holding a speech, and on his left, Trotsky. (Winston's job right)Now my country (Albania) was great friends with USSR, until 1961, that is. Albania broke up with USSR (considering USSR a traitor of real socialism), to advance real socialism together with China. Not for ever of course - in 1978 China became a traitor of real socialism, too, having in fact never been really socialist. There was a famous picture in Albanian history textbooks. The Albanian B.B. (Enver Hoxha) was denouncing the betrayal of real socialism by the Soviet leadership. I have seen all three versions of this painting: In the first one, Enver Hoxha had Chou EnLai on one side and Mehmet Shehu (Albanian Prime Minister) on the other. This was valid between 1961 and 1978. When China betrayed socialism in 1978, Chou Enlai disappeared from the painting, and someone else took his stead. This second version lasted until 1981. That's because in 1981 Mehmet Shehu became a traitor, and 'was suicided'. So he disappeared from the painting, too. This is the last version of it. By the way, the painting stood in the Albanian National Art Gallery. Many people must have seen all three versions of it in original.I could wrie a book longer than 1984, describing how accurate 1984 is.Read 1984 as a history of the communist world; it is valid even for the four decades after Orwell's death.Aleksander Coho"},{"Title":"1984","review":"When reading this book, one is dragged through the emotions of love, hate, betrayal, despair, and utter, unabashed rage. This novel tells a story of negative utopia in which the government knows all and sees all. The citizens are worthless except as workers. Winston and Julia go through a secret love affair despite better judgement. The use of allegory for socialism is impressive. Many parallels, obvious and subtle, can be drawn between the two. The story is enthralling and the book is hard to put down.The reader may feel safe from the situation in this book, but it is not impossible. Of course, 1984 has come and gone, but we must realize that such situations are possible. That is why this book deserves 5 stars. 1984 uses exaggeration to prove a point. Freedom and capitalism are definately worth the drawbacks. We see that if we give the government our freedom, we will eventually become slaves to the government.Orwell was brilliant in this work. We are forewarned. Everyone should read this book (at least once) and try to take a lesson from it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book 5 years ago for an English book report. I've never been able to forget it. It's the haunting account of Winston Smith, an employee of the Ministry of Truth who hasn't forgotten the past, and who wants to change the future.However, Big Brother is watching him. Try as he might, our hero is trapped in a totalitarian world where he faces extermination if he wants to think as an individual and question the government.Published in 1949 during the Cold War, Orwell puts a spin on communism and totalitarianism that to this day makes my blood run cold. I shutter at the thought of our world ever becoming like Oceania, even in the slighest bit.Highly recommended book for the whole world to read.

This book opened up my mind to the importance of the individual in society and the true evils of totalitarianism (when done incorrectly). This is scarier than any &quot;horror&quot; book ever written, because almost all of it is possible (and much of it has already happened). A true masterpiece, this should be required reading for every human being on the planet."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Many of us use Orwell's book for our own purposes, to forward our own ideas and political positions. Even though Orwell was speaking quite specifically about a particular socialist experiment, communism, and a particularly horrible totalitarian gulag-state - Stalin's Soviet Union - his book has such a universal scope that it can be squeezed and pushed and pulled about until it can be made to fit almost any political system anywhere. In this way great works are often de-constructed to make them useful to whomever wants to make a point.A lot of us here are likening the world of Orwell's \\"1984\\" to current life in the U.S. While there are definitely elements of this overreaching intrusion into our private lives today in the United States, be aware of how much farther down that road so many other countries have already gone (and down which we are very unlikely to go). Start with the Islamic nations where the Mullahs exort the masses to their Two Minutes Of Hate towards us every Friday in the mosques. In Britain, under a Labour Government, right now, there are not only surveillance cameras - called CCTV cameras - on virtually every corner in the cities, they are now beginning to install microphones as well (http://portal.telegraph.co.uk/global/main.jhtml?xml=/global/2005/05/04/nmic04.xml) starting in the council flats. They directly say it is to monitor \\"anti-social\\" behavior. This is the insidious beginnings of \\"1984.\\" Well past what we are enduring and in the very country from which Orwell sprang and from which our own ideas of civil liberties originated.In all the world's dictatorships, from Cuba to North Korea to virtually all the Arab states, there is one version or another of the Thought Police. They may be religious police as they are in Iran and Saudi Arabia. They may be undercover military police as they are in North Korea. They may just be your neighbors, as they were in Mao's China (and for all we know, still are to some extent, at least). But in all these places the horror of Orwell's vision is much more advanced than in the U.S. People actually are killed. In Iraq there are still 275,000 \\"disappeards,\\" people who simply ceased to exist under the brutal totalitarian regime of Saddam Hussein, himself a great admirer of Stalin. (I didn't make that number up, btw, Amnesty International did) If you want more proof, just ask a Palestinian homosexual about what constitutes \\"anti-social behavior\\" in the Territories. Actually, if you want to ask a Palestinian homosexual that question you will have to go to Tel Aviv because that is where they all live. Palestinian gays are either dead, in prison, or in Israel.We might be well advised to also be aware that in many other places in the world the true reality of 1984's dystopic vision has been in place for decades, and citizens continue to suffer real torture, imprisonment, and death for things which Americans take for granted as being protected under our Constitution. Yes, there are some egregious violations that are going on here under the guise of the Patriot Act, but they are constantly under fire from our own legal system and from private NGOs and civil liberties watchdogs. Imagine having these kinds of groups in, say, Burma: It's instant imprisonment - just ask Aung San Suu Kyi. What is going on here is nothing when compared to the terrors vistited daily upon millions of people around the world who would only love the chance to come to this country. I don't suspect any of them would think they had strayed into Room 101. ekw"},{"Title":"1984","review":"At the mention of 1984, critics will prostrate worshipping Orwell's mastery of metaphors, readers will rejoice at his clarity, and soothsayer's will marvel at his prescience. 1984 has even spawned new english words like &quot;doublethink&quot; and &quot;newspeak&quot;. And along with capri pants, it seems in fashion to like 1984. This praise is not meritless and Orwell did indite a great book; however, it didn't grab me the way other books have. For me a good beginning makes me stick with a book, and this is something 1984 lacks. The beginning is ponderous and confusing, and I debated giving up on the book numerous times, but I remembered all the adulatory reviews and decided to stick with it. I am glad I did because the story picks up and still maintains its themes. The beginning did tarnish my view of 1984 a little though and I was still cynical of the praise it receive; after my cynicism disperesed I realized the book did deserve the praise--if the reader can bear the beginning."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Take a look at the media of today, they only let one view out.

The problem that most readers have with the book is that they consider it &quot;too boring&quot; and &quot;lacking in action&quot;. What they are missing is that the main point of this book isn't to provide violence and action, of which it has it's fair share, but instead to entice us to think about the human mind, our existance, the way we govern ourselves, the power struggle, and most of all our limitations as human beings. When one really examines this book and ponders its philosphies, to me, makes it exciting and interesting. This is my second favorite book after &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; by Burgess, which I also highly recommend. No piece of literature is for everyone but I do suggest &quot;1984&quot; as a book that will appeal to the masses and help people change their attitude and feelings towards the world in hopes that they might change this planet and prevent any such scenario provided in this book from actually happening."},{"Title":"1984","review":"As a sophomore in highschool, I read this book as a requirement as outside reading.

Constantly watched by cameras, people living in these superpowers are essentialy slaves. The story is gripping and well written. 1984 is very similar to Brave New World, these two &quot;utopias&quot; are both trying to eradicate individuality. Brave New World tries to smother the individual with material pleasures, whereas 1984 uses oppression and false truths to achieve these ends. The books focus on characters who rebel against these governments.

A fan of classic literature or high thrill novels will enjoy this page turner."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Of the two great Dystopian novels, (Brave New World being the other)this one is my favorite. It is a story of a man dealing with his own thoughts about freedom versus oppression, and also an analysis of how Communism has gone bad (dictatorships) and where it could potentially take us. But how different is Oceania from our own society? Think of all the surveillance cameras you see and the idea of hate crime (which invades the thoughts of people, to find what they were thinking). 1984 is prophetic about China and the Soviet Union yet, it also tells something about America and our &quot;freedom&quot;, showing us that no government is going to give you true freedom. The beginning and end of the book are the best parts, the middle is a little weaker, due to the development of a love story (I am still iffy on whether or not the love story part of this book actually harms the book at all). Anyway, it is a great book for anyone and it is highly recommended."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The novel is written beautifully, and it makes a bold statement about humanity... The government has developed its own language, is at constant war with the other two superstates, and watches its citizens at all times. Each superstate has an identical government, one that is at perpetual war in order to gain complete power over its citizens. The process used to gain absolute power is one used by past, present, and future dictators, such as Stalin, Mussolini and Hitler. The nation manipulates its citizens into convenient modes of thinking. However, instead of only using propaganda techniques, they also use Newspeak and telescreens. Newspeak is the official language of Oceania, and has its sole purpose in abolishing all independent thought. This is done by drastic reduction of vocabulary, by getting rid of unnecessary words and synonyms. (Example: the word bad is replaced by the word 'ungood.') The telescreens monitor each citizen at all times, watching for any action, word, or possible thought that could be unorthodox. These two Orwell inventions were foretelling, we see the equivalent of Newspeak every day in present society when we are &quot;politically correct.&quot; Telescreens are present in nearly every business, and sometimes in our own homes. Orwell was obviously warning America and all other countries about the control of totalitarian governments. The reader is introduced to the metaphysical philosophy behind 1984. A government not unlike present ones is at the head of Oceania, and that is where the reality of 1984 becomes evident. The sole manipulative technique used by Big Brother is one that is virtually unrecognizable, mental manipulation. Metaphysics, or the belief that there is existence beyond our comprehension, is represented by Big Brother when the reader learns about doublethink, the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously and fully accepting both. Doublethink and metaphysics are the engines behind the three world governments, and is defined by O'Brien. &quot;Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else,&quot; says O'Brien. &quot; In the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth.&quot; The book reminds us of what has gone wrong, what can go wrong, and what will go wrong when government becomes all-powerful. It is because of this political and social insight that 1984 is one of the best books of all time."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I live in the UK, a place where the world depicted in 1984 are slowly turning from fiction to fact.

In a less than modern utopian society called \\"Oceania\\" rebellion is brewing. A man named Winston Smith finds the strength within himself to challenge the local governmental institution and its leader known only as \\"Big Brother\\". Through the manipulation of information and history Big Brother commands a death grip on the people who he convinces to \\"love\\" him. The people are constantly reminded that \\"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU\\" (Book 1, Ch. 1 pg. 3). Such control in a society can only lead to one thing: Rebellion.Throughout 1984 multiple references to control are found. By using telescreens, devices that blare out propaganda and monitor the population, and the ironically named \\"Ministry of Truth\\", an institution that changes the records of the past in favor of the Party and follows the slogan \\"'Who controls the past', ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.\\" The people are given one hour out of every day to express their hatred. This is a time when,\\"A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledgehammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one evenagainst one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. Winston works as a propaganda officer at the Ministry of Truth's main office in Airstrip One, the name of the region in Oceania where Winston lives. There Winston changes historical records to match that of the Party's will. The Party has also devised a way of both monitoring the population and building an irreverent dedication to Big Brother. This institution is called the \\"Junior Spies\\". The group is composed of young children who are told to watch their parents and neighbors, looking for signs of thoughtcrime (wanting to or knowing that you have committed a crime against the Party.). These kinds of people were \\"one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than on the Thought Police, the stability of the Party depended.\\"Winston holds an office that is part of the \\"ruling class\\" of Oceania. The other class of Oceania is known as the \\"Proles\\", \\"They were born, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passed through a brief blossoming period of beauty and sexual desire, they married at twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part, at sixty. Heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty quarrels with neighbors, films, football, beer, and, above all, gambling filled up the horizon of their minds.\\" If a person is found to be an enemy of the Party they are \\"vaporized\\", any and all record of them is erased. Winston actually assists the Party in this when he vaporizes a man referred to as Comrade Withers. A man that was oncepraised by the Party, but was convinced as a traitor and all past praise must be illuminated.When Winston comes upon a diary and begins to write in it, he immediately knows that he will be vaporized or killed on charges of thoughtcrime. When he is at his neighbor's house fixing their sink one of their children calls Winston a traitor and accuses him of thoughtcrime. Winston is terrified at the prospect of being found out. He goes home and drinks some \\"Victory Gin\\", an alcoholic beverage that everyone drinks. The substance has a numbing effect on the people and makes it easier to comply with the Party. He also smokes \\"Victory Cigarettes\\", the equivalent of common low quality cigarettes. Both the products have the name \\"Victory\\" in front of them signifying the Party's propaganda. It all leads back to governments wanting to brainwash its citizens to total compliance and the rejection of other ideals. The Party even went as far as to convince the people that 2+2=5, and that there is a thirteen o-clock.The Party also employs the use of microphones to listen in on conversations. It is by using these means that they learn of Winston having sexual intercourse with a woman named Julia who works in the Fiction Department at the Ministry of Truth. They eventually rent a room together above a store. There is a painting on the wall in one of the rooms that hides a telescreen that the Party has planted. It is through this screen that the thought police finally arrest Winston.The citizens are not allowed to keep documents or photographs that could lead them to remembering elements of their past. This makes it easier for the Party to \\"insert\\" the memories that they wish for the people to remember. Their \\"real\\" memories become fuzzy after time and are replaced with the memories that the Party has installed within them.George Orwell wrote 1984 in a time when Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and Communist China were all on people's minds. These styles of government instilled fear and hopelessness in the minds of American's. Fear that their basic freedoms were being threatened. Elements of these governments are found in the government of Oceania, even to the uncanny resemblance of Big Brother to Joseph Stalin. Orwell did not just write a \\"good read\\" or a \\"page turner\\", he wrote what he viewed as the inevitable future. A future in which people are lied to, manipulated, and tortured for being different."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"We shall meet in the Place where there is no Darkness\\", whispers the Monster.And he means it.What is it about this little nugget of grue and cold, calculating horror by the English Socialist writer Eric Blair---immortalized to high school students throughout the Anglophonic world as George Orwell---that so captures the imagination, so fires the nerves?Well---it's the lack of Freedom, you might say.But what is Freedom? The freedom to love who you want, unproscribed by the dictates and whims of the Party?Your freedom to do that, my friend, is already circumscribed by narrow geography, by the randomness of your birth: chances are the love of your life, who sleeps so sweetly beside you right now, will betray you of her own free will, without even the torture merited by Room 101.Freedom to do what you want, when you want?Do you have that now? Did you always dream of growing up to work in a cubicle, be badgered by twitterpated thirty-something middle managers for reports that will be filed away into meaninglessness this time tomorrow, and for what?---enough to buy some Ikea furniture that will be worn down by next November?Is \\"1984\\" horrible because of its grinding, horrific economic determinism, its vision of a world of soul-numbed indoctrinated slaves ground down by the Party's inexorable Wheel, willingly chopping their own vocabulary---their own means to express their torment---down into chunks, mono-syllables, mere grunts? The descent into the primal?Come on: when's the last big idea you had that you actually *wrote* down? At least Big Brother's little creatures all have jobs, the better to support the endless---but glorious!---war effort against Eurasia, or wait---yes, Eastasia! The Floating Fortresses! The massed armies of the tireless People of Oceania!Anyway: I don't know exactly what bothers me about \\"1984\\", but I've never forgotten it, and I never will. For those of you who haven't discovered it---I deeply envy you. It's the story of one mindless little cog---Winston Smith---in the Ministry of Truth, or MiniTruth, in the Bold New Language of NewSpeak, proudly decimating the language every single day! Rejoice, Citizen! To do otherwise is Double plus-Ungood.Where were we? Ah yes, Winston Smith: who learns, in between delightful pass-times including hate rallies, drooling before the omnipotent tele-screen (oh stop nodding: you've probably got the tele-screen on even *while* you're reading this, and nobody is forcing *you*...yet), and doctoring information in the Ministry's reports---who learns to lust, and after a fashion, to Love.Orwell, consummate artist, illustrates this cubist, concrete, slag-heaped, hate-drunk pit of despair with all the sparse, telling prose of a master at work: every word works, every sentence tells. And it is a concoction, a wicked witch's brew, of every sputtering despotism ever misbegotten on Planet Earth, spiked with a little extra nightcap of hatred and evil: Stalin's USSR, Hitler's 1000-Year Reich, Pol Pot's Killing Fields.The horror is that, in the end, \\"1984\\" was a human construct, made by human hands, enacted by human voices. We choose, ultimately, what resides in Room 101. We sacrifice our freedom to Big Brother, and then we abide by his all-seeing Eye. We choose not to turn off the Telescreen, until, by and by, the Telescreen commands us to keep it on all day long.That is the shrill animal horror of \\"1984\\": that it is the Future, and that, to be sure: it is far worse than a boot, stomping on a human face, forever.Worse? Yeah: that we choose it to be that way.JSG"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Ok, I have never been much of a reader. I recently decided to get back into reading. I'm glad I picked this book because I loved it. I have always been very interested in politics and propaganda. There were more than a few times during my read that I noticed similarities to our current political climate. Sometimes the instances of similarity were absolutely uncanny. One of the similarities I found most intriguing was the use of hate as a means of control. I believe this technique is being used today in our society. HATE = PATRIOTISM"},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.\\"So goes the slogan of the Party, the oppressive totalitarian regime depicted in George Orwell's nightmarish and depressing vision of the future circa 1984. Enter Winston Smith, our tortured protagonist, who spends his days rewriting the past to coincide with the present and his nights scrawling rebellious thoughts into an illegally kept diary. The increasingly desperate Smith longs to escape a world in which all thoughts are controlled (courtesy of \\"Big Brother\\", the ever-watching leader of Oceania who may or may not exist) and concepts such as individuality, passion, and love are unheard of. Winston finds his solace in Julia, an eccentric and free-thinking woman who shares his angst. They soon become revolutionaries by having a love affair and taking walks in the countryside. Together, the two join a resistance force known only as The Brotherhood, dedicating their lives to the destruction of the Party. However, Winston and Julia soon discover that the eyes of Big Brother are not so easily blinded.Reading 1984, I was literally chilled by how accurately the novel parallels both our current times and the probable future. Not once did I doubt the credibility of Orwell's predictions; the police state he creates is utterly believable from introduction to conclusion. The author unflinchingly illustrates true evil and cruelty, and the entire book emanates a sense of helplessness and despair. Eric Arthur Blair (\\"George Orwell\\" was, in fact, merely a pseudonym) saw a world in which all traces of humanity have been stripped away, and the majority of the population is composed of automatons devoid of the will to think. It is this world that we will be seeing decades from now unless vigilance is kept. With freedom comes responsibility, and we cannot sit idly by as our rights are taken away from us.In fact, we may already be seeing this type of society in many facets of our culture, albeit on a much subtler level than in this work. Orwell's masterpiece has often - and logically so - been used as a political tool by the left wing. Numerous are the uncomfortable similarities to the world we are now living in. \\"WAR IS PEACE,\\" etc. can easily be made to spell out the Bush Administration's philosophy. The telescreens installed in every civilian's home - used for surveillance and propagandizing - prompt the reader to reflect upon our own major news sources, all owned by large corporations with agendas of their own and vast ability to \\"alter\\" the truth. The Party's license to spy on anyone and everyone with no justification is terrifyingly reminiscent of the Homeland Security Act passed by Congress in 2003. It all gives you a fresh appreciation of your ability to analyze what you're told and discern lies from fact.I would recommend this novel to anyone who treasures freedom and needs a reminder of what we could become if our guard is let down. Orwell was a political prophet, a seer, and the consequences of ignoring his warnings could be very dire indeed. To any Republicans reading this review (hopefully the previous paragraph didn't alienate you), please don't regard this as a \\"liberal\\" novel. 1984 is much more than an anti-Bush clich&eacute;. The book's themes are universal, and all proponents of liberty and justice can appreciate it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Winston Smith is a middle aged man livin in the superstate of Oceania. There are three superstates, Oceania, Eastasia, and Eurasia. They all have almost the same type of economy. Also their always at war witheach other. The year is 1984 and Big brother and the thought police are always watching you through their telescreens which are located in almost every corner. You can't even think something against the party or else you'll commit a thoughtcrime. There are three types of people in the scoiety, proles, lowest, outer party, middle, and inner party highest. The superstate of Oceania is run by four sections, Ministry of truth, Ministry of peace, Ministry of plenty, and Ministry of love. Winston smith is part of the outer party. He has a harsh feeling of hatred towards big brother. He starts to write a journal, which is a thought crime and SHOWS HIS HARSH HATRED FOR bIG bROTHER. He hears of a underground organization which tries to bring down this system od unjust. Men and women are not allowed to marry unless the show no affection for each other. Winston was once married. Winston starts to think a man he sees at work is against big brother. Winston starts being followed by a young girl. He soon found out from a note that she loves him. They start meeting each other every couple of weeks. Winston rents a room from a man named Mr. Charrington that was suppose to have no telescreen in it and was supposedly completely private. The girl Julia and winston start meeting there frequently. Soon O'brien approaches Winston and gives him his address. Winston and Julia go to his house together and tell him they want to be part of the brotherhood with Goldstein, the leader of this group against big brother. They join it but learn that they'll never meet Goldstein and will die for the cause and do anything except split apart. O'brien tells Julia and winston says they must read a BOOK on the brotherhood by Goldstein. When Julia and Winston meet again in the room from Mr. Charrington to read the book they are caught by a telescreen which was hidden behind a picture and they find out Mr. Charrington was not who they thought he was. The thought police surround them. Winston and Julia are taken away and kept in cells. Will they be sent to room 101, executed, or will someone arrive that Winston knows? To find out read this book. I felt this book was awesome and scary. I'd reccomend it to everyone. I couldn't imagine being in a world where history kept being changed and people could be arrested for thinking things. Hopefully our world never turns out to be like this."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I hate to say it, but anyone who would try to give this book a bad review because \\"no books are better than others\\" or because \\"Orwell's sole purpose for writing this novel was to encourage anarchy, and to convince his readers to be subordinate to authority\\" (does he mean to insubordinate?) is either two years old or ought to be. You have to be remarkably stupid to shake off this book for any such reasons. This is a great piece of literature and philosophy, and everything that everyone said about it's pertaining to today is absolutely true. If you are debating in the slightest reading this book, trust me, it's worth it. Just fantastic. Anyone who gave it under a four is flat out wrong. ESSENTIAL reading."},{"Title":"1984","review":"As with Animal Farm (by the same author), there is much to learn from this book.What makes this book scary is how easily it could become reality. As you read this book, you must realize that in order to avoid becoming what this book portrays, we need to fight the system now. Because, as Winston learns, once the system is in place it is practically impossible to destroy it. Keep this book in mind while our government makes specific policies... especially while we lose our freedoms and rights of privacy in the name of safety, fairness, and prosperity.And what amazes me (but wouldn't surprise me) is how much the people love what they have; not knowing what they have lost. It is amazing how government can set your mind at ease with the right propaganda. A perfect example was how the government was saying how it had exceeded its prediction in the production of boots (which was actually a lie) and one of its citizens commented on how well they had done in supplying the needs of the people. In the same breath he asked if Winston had any razorblades, which had become very scarce in the recent weeks.And even scarier, it shows how easy it is for the government to twist (spin) our language and use it against us. For instance, in the book we see the Ministry of Love, which is used to torture free thinkers and those who would disagree with Big Brother. We see the Ministry of Truth, which is nothing more than spreading lies on the wealth of the nation and its citizens. So on and so forth. What is especially incredible about this book is the detail of the language that George Orwell went into, while creating a new language called Ensoc (English Socialism).This book shows all of this... and more. It is the model of what any country should NOT become. There is a lot to learn from this visionary book. You can instantly take a lot out of this book. Read it and take a look around you and you will be surprised and how quickly our society is heading in this direction. Fight this trend before you, yes you, fall in love with Big Brother."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Just as Edmund Burke, during the French Revolution, predicted the subsequent horrors of Robespierre's Reign of Terror, so did George Orwell brilliantly foreshadow the nightmarish life that was ubiquitous under the rule of 20th Century totalitarian states. In 1984, the main character, Winston Smith, struggles to gain personal freedom of mind under the Big Brother government that has taken over London, England and the rest of Europe. The constant chatter of the &quot;telescreens&quot; (written before the days of TV) and other mediums of propaganda are virtually inescapable in this frightening world. Orwell's monotone (but vivid) narrative demonstrates his genius because it makes the scene so much scarier, yet all the more realistic to the reader as well. The novel races up to the climax, before its conclusion with an ending (and final line) that is among the most famous of any from the 20th Century. If you've never read 1984 and only heard it referenced, you need to read it because you may be surprised to see how similar its terms are to life in the modern, &quot;free&quot; world. At the same time, you will see why it is ranked among 20th Century classics as well."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Bonnie Ryder Mercy High School Students Mindy Sheehan Humankind has not been deliberately questioning its government for the past seventeen years, or fifty- two years, but, however, since the beginning of time. 1984 by George Orwell simply expresses the fears and anxieties felt by all people towards their government. At all times, society must worry whether government is too large and controlling or too small and unproductive. In 1984, however, the government is extremely small in how many have power but extremely large and authoritarian in its pervasive domination while actively and purposely promoting unproductivity. After reading this book together, my friend and I have a better understanding of how government can grow so large and bleed the soul out of a society. Yes, we can learn about factual historical events but by reading the extreme we have a better understanding of the norm. For instance, how much of today's media is censored and controlled? What information am I not getting? Fifty- two years ago when Orwell first published this book, the United States government had still not apologized for its treatment of Japanese Americans during WW II. It still denied that it had done anything wrong. Their actions were for the good of the country. The U.S.A. would never stoop to the same level as the Germans did with their interred (or would we). Orwell should have felt lucky to live in such an honorable time in history under the motherly wing of all- mighty protective, militaristic of the United States government. Even today history books very rarely even mention this portion of US history. All hail the mighty and glorious past, but do not forget; whoever controls the present controls the past, whoever controls the past controls the future. Again we ask, what of the past has been changed for us? What do we not know? Is Big Brother still watching? 1984 is appropriate for mature Juniors in high school and older. To read the book, one must have patience because most of it is a narrative. Despite the groaning, whining complaints which often accompany the news that a book is a narrative, the personal intimate thoughts are essential to the book. The reader must know how deeply the vein of ignorance runs. The reader must experience the complete metamorphosis which Winston, the main character, undertakes and his personal opinions about his surroundings. How much of our daily lives is spent thinking only to ourselves and analyzing personal thoughts and actions? Because Orwell wanted to create a realistic man, he needed to have intimate thoughts which the reader must understand in order to understand his actions. How many times do we wish that the world could just read our mind to understand us? The reader cannot be bored with the book if he reads every sentence with a grain of salt and tries to fully envelop himself into Orwell's world."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book was absolutely impressive (or in Newspeak-Doubleplusgood)! It was unfortunate that I wasn't able to read this novel in high school when most people should. After reading it in my free time, I was absolutely astounded. This book has been challenged all around the world for its controversial content. It is especially important for those who are capable of reading this book to do so. It sheds light on the importance of freedom of thought, freedom of expression, and freedom of being human. As long as this book is around, humans will understand the importance of freedom.Zachary B. MedinaAuthor of Decador"},{"Title":"1984","review":"What could I possibly say about 1984 that hasn't already been said? Perhaps only how the concept of doublethink chilled me to the marrow:\\"The power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them... To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just as long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality ...\\"Reality is the vast majority of truly successful horror."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 was a great book talking about the dangers of authoritarian governments finally learning from pas failures. The main character Winston tells of his life living and rebelling in himself of this authoritarian government. The country of Oceania is trapped in a never ending state of war though in reality no battles are ever fought. The book deals with Winston trying to learn about a past realizing the past he has learned from the party never really existed. Winston himself has helped the party change the past. The party looks for unique ways to steal away freedoms by using things such as doublethink (the act of forgetting a past reality once it immediately changes) which lead them to get their population to believe in things such as 2+2=4. Winston also seeks an escape from the party forming a secret love affair with a girl named Julia. Together they try to escape the party. They are able to show how difficult or impossible escape really is. This book may have been an alternate reality with the year 1984 having passed many years ago, but the danger warns about reflect some elements of today's society. I also feel it's a really good read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Humans, regardless of free will, can all fall victim to dangerous obedience. 1984 by George Orwell is set in a dystopian United Kingdom, now deemed Oceania. A lawless party rules over with a cult of personality consisting of an elusive, all-knowing (due to the Thought Police and ever-present devices called telescreens) figure known as Big Brother--or as some fondly address as, BB. This novel shocks with its possibilities. George Orwell demonstrates a theoretical but very plausible type of society that can occur when authority gains excessive control and its people prefer \`blissful' ignorance as seen through Winston's characterization and the conformity in the people around him.Winston Smith is a lowly ranked party member himself; however, Orwell writes the novel from a perspective where his private identity is shown. He begins off with starting his own diary. From the beginning, the reader is taken aback--literacy seems to be dangerous and Newspeak, which is far cries from the articulate language today, dominates. Reading and schooling seems to be not as prioritized in this society and even if present, is altered and maintained by party interests. I enjoyed this novel because it demonstrated the common idea that humans without proper education, fall victim to ignorant or blind obedience to authoritative figures. Even in early scenes in the novel, Orwell describes Winston as falling in step to the animal-like behavior of the people around him as they all hysterically scream over an infamous party traitor.I highly recommend this novel because of its nature as a classic; although it takes some time to truly be able to dive into (I struggled to stay completely interested after the first two chapters) it sends a sharp, vital message that all individuals should be familiar with."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Just to add my voice to the rest here. It's hard to overstate the combination of message, artistry, and foresight in this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In accordance with the dystopian theme of this book, it should be required reading. 1984 is my all time favorite book. The characters are powerful and the plot is disturbingly reflective of some of the challenges we face today. The entire text is littered with powerful messages such as; \\"war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength\\". Orwell creates a world in 1984 that speaks to us all on a visceral level. Peering into a possible future reminding us that the road to dystopia is long and paved with good intentions. Orwell is a literary genius. If I could convince someone to read only one book it would be this one. The themes expressed compel you to reflect on our own world and contemplate our own future. Please read this book you will not be disappointed! If you read it and want more I'd suggest Brave New World by A. Huxley as well.

The beginning of this book was honestly a bit unbearable, I had gotten the picture and message of the main points (conditions, environment, authority figures, main character development) within the first 40 pages or so and everything after was just rehash after rehash...But then, roughly half way through the book, it had gotten so interesting, so good, and so insightful, that if it had taken me three weeks to read the first half, it took me all of two days to finish the second half.The authors account of war and his \\"counter view\\" of the world he himself set up was flat out awesome. He cleverly delivered a thorough analysis of war and society through the guise of educating the lead character, and subsequently further demonstrated his points by breaking the main character.

So, I will just make an attempt at scribbling some of my impressions.Orwell builds a world where no single detail is left to randomness. From all the constructions the reader comes across in this book, the most astonishing ones are, (of course this is a personal view):The dynamics of time: More than what the author has created as future, what impresses me most is what he has created as past. To start with, the treatment of past throughout this book is from a philosophical and logical point of view simply overwhelming. The idea underlying the novel is that the past is in your hands, you can do whatever you wish with the past, which implies that no matter what course of actions you take, you can always modify what you've done so far without the necessity of traveling in time. There is no room for history or memories here. Your personal history is what you want it to be at the very moment you are thinking of it; this is: you have as many personal histories as you choose, which also means that you have none. Orwell has shaped a time machine that doesn't presuppose any physical change in space or time for the entire process takes place in the mind. This leaves the main character in a helpless situation since his quest, is the quest of past. He craves for learning something from a world he would have liked to live in, but that he only knows by intuition. As he experiences the feeling of being cheated he grows anguished: he wants his intuition to become certain. If it happens, he will recover his past, his own existence.Newspeak or the economics of language: language is a human construction to help us naming the world we live in. Words are born to serve expressive necessities. In a similar fashion, they disappear when they no longer symbolize something we want to communicate. In Orwell's world, on the contrary, language is a means to modify reality: when a word ceases to exist, the object it used to represent ceases to exist as well. Language is the tool used to shape the world as man wishes. It is not a means to express ideas. It is the idea itself, what has to fit words and not the other way around. If something can't be named, it simply doesn't exist. As Borges says: \\"Words create past\\". Then if words are suppressed, history is simply erased and becomes nothingness, creating a space that has to be refilled by something new.The logics of doublethink or the art of canceling opposites out. The ability to justify everything in an impeccable logical way. (I wonder how many politicians today have taken hold of this \\"technique\\" to justify their actions even when they are aware of the contradictions they entail).Actually, there is a lot more to say, but I'll stop here. Just go and read it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Eric Arthur Blair, under the pen name of George Orwell, wrote 1984 because of his concern of the spread of communism. It is a dark, gothic look at what society could become if the spectre of communism led to totalitarianism. Essentially, it is a more graphic and adult version of his Animal Farm, with people. It is told by a nameless narrator who knows all the goings-on in the world of the future, and follows the life of a middle-aged citizen of Oceania, Winston Smith, who is an employee in the Ministry of Truth. 1984 is not plot-driven, nor is it based on character development (these aspects are still present, however). The primary focus of the book is the setting. We are given the world as it could have become in 1984. Of course, we are not in a situation like that, but the threat of such a situation is still present. This differentiates it from other books, although there is never a reason to dislike or fear something new before trying it. Orwell believed it to be the most effective way to explain the world of 1984, and I think it is effective. If the focus were on the characters or the plot, a high proportion of the messages would have to be interpreted, rather than explained in detail. Different interpretations could mean that certain events make no sense, and discussion would be difficult. Some people may have missed some meanings altogether. By explaining his 'apocalyptic' vision of the future in complete detail, Orwell is able to get the entirety of his message to his readers. Orwell is a very articulate and imaginative writer. The world he depicts is divided into three world powers - Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. The Party controls Oceania, the setting of the novel. Big Brother (a parallel to Napoleon from Animal Farm, or Stalin in real life) is at the apex of the social pyramid. He is the father-figure worshipped by the citizens. The Inner Party comprises 2% of the population, and the Outer Party 15%. The remainder consists of the dumb masses, or 'proles'. Any sign of unorthodoxy is dealt with swiftly and harshly by the Thought Police (a parallel to the dogs, the American secret service or Russian KGB). The telescreens that are planted in the walls receive and transmit information simultaneously. The Thought Police use these to keep their citizens under surveillance. Children are turned against their own parents through the use of spy camps and worship of Big Brother. 1984 is partially a look at how easily children can be manipulated and what happens when it goes wrong. Ironically, the people with the least intelligence are given the highest degree of freedom. They do not pose a threat. The chances of an uprising are non-existent because the proles believe anything they are told, and do not take material facts into consideration. Three of the Party's main slogans: 'War is Peace', 'Freedom is Slavery' and 'Ignorance is Strength' are swallowed without question by the majority of the population. The reasons for this, and how the Party pulls it off, are explained in detail later on. The Party was meticulous in its planning. Any totalitarian system requires a scapegoat. In Oceania, it is Emmanuel Goldstein (John Lenin), the subject of the Two Minutes Hate. The Brotherhood is the rebel group that follows Goldstein's teachings, and undermines the Party at any opportunity. The narrator shows us the thoughts that run through Winston's mind, and how he longs for freedom of thought. He meets the book's loveinterest, Julia, whom he disgusts at first glance and lusts after, due to his own failed marriage and her beauty. She wears a chastity scarf, symbolising her (supposed) contempt for sex, part of the reason for his lust - he believes he can never have her. The message here is the desire for that which is forbidden. He later learns that Julia is a rebel, but in a different way, &quot;only from the waist down&quot;, according to Winston. They find a secret hiding place without a telescreen, and are invited to join the Brotherhood by O'Brien. As it turns out, this is when their troubles truly begin. Orwell describes in detail how the Party came into power, its motives and its true objectives. The full implication and repercussions of these revelations are unfurled in the final riveting part of the novel. However, there are flaws in the exploration of the society. We are not given a sufficient view into the eyes of the older generation that lived through the Revolution. Winston only questions one old prole in a pub, and appeared to give up his inquiry too early. 1984 is a very mature book, and I would only recommend it to people who can grasp similar concepts. If the reader is too young, they may dismiss the book as boring. It may seem so at first, but the novel will make more sense with some thought and, possibly, subsequent readings. If you enjoyed Brave New World, you will enjoy 1984, and even if you didn't, you may still like it. This is a philosopher's book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When I read this story, I was amazed. Though it's written 50 years ago, you can find some things that really exist in our time. Maybe not as terrible but terrible enough. This story is a vision on the future. A future that may come sooner that we expect. I recommend this book to every book lover, this one you can't miss, and remember: Big brother is watching you!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I can't say anything that probably hasn't been said already. Orwell's most famous novel warns us against the power of propaganda. &quot;Big Brother&quot; has become common to our language and culture.This isn't Blair's best work, however. This and ANIMAL FARM are only really read because they warn against Communist propaganda. As mentioned in the beginning, Orwell was a social democrat (although, I would say libertarian socialist). He greatly sympathized with the anarchist movement in Spain (Homage to Catalonia). In fact, the communist attack against the anarchists is probably what inspired him to write stories like ANIMAl FARM and 1984.I was disturbed to see a previous reviewer say something like, &quot;If this book is properly read and understood, you will become a Libertarian.&quot;Blair's best stuff is actually against propaganda systems found in so-called democracies like the United States and Britian. The Soviets had an extensive system, but it wasn't very effective. They kept people in line through violence, mostly. When the ability to coerece decreases (like in relatively free societies eg The United States) the need to propagandanize increases. This has really become apart of mainstream doctrine. To take a quote from someone not so mainstream, &quot;Propaganda is to a democracy what violence is to a dictatorship.&quot; -- Noam ChomskyIt should come as no surprise why Orwell's most popular works are anti-communist..."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Its after you complete the book that it will begin to effect you. You will start seeing the world around you with a different set of eyes. A must read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The problem with reviewing a book by that has been forced down people's throuts all through their middle school, high school, and college careers is that people hate it for exactly that reason, they were forced to read it. I read this book as a senior in high school and I liked it, but I didn't love it. I have re-read it several times along with Animal Farm and many of his essays and I can saw without reservation that Orwell is the greatest political writer of all time, and one of the greatest writers of all time.1984's plot is famous and it's particulars have been expounded on numerous times so I won't bore the reader by repeating them. This novel was written in 1949, after the fall of Totalitarianism in Europe and during the beginnings of the Cold War. Taken in historical persepective, this novel is really a satire about Stalinist Russia. Everything about Stalinist Russia's gets the back of Orwell's hand, the frequent purges where known citizens frequently just disapear, the crippling military regime where personal freedom and expression are crushed, and the overwhelming cult of personality where Stalin was worshipped ala Big Brother.Read only with this historical perspective in mind is still fruitful and interesting, but this novel still applies today to the government of the United States and other governments around the world. Though not as extreme by any stretch, the themes expressed in this novel are relevant today. Double Think is one of the best and most ingenious examples. Double Think is believing two contradictory ideas at one time. Basically it's believing your own lie. Everyone knows that we went to war in Iraq for oil, but we say that it was for weapons of mass destruction, and then they never found them so it changed to we had to find Saddam and save the poor Iraqis and give them democracy. We know the real reason, but we believe the lie perpetrated by Bush's regime for some reason. We do not want to rock the boat, or we want to support our leader or some other convuluted reasoning has lead us to believe our own lie.The Iraq example is also a good example of changing the past. The Bush administration changed the reason for going to war and most people did not bat an eyelash at it. Hell, we rewarded this blatant lie by re-electing him.Now for all the naysayers who say this could never happen and it's portrait of an oppressive regime is unrealistic. I really don't think his point was to make a completely realistic novel. But think, what good would it be if Orwell had written, \\"well, the government was kind of bad, but not that bad, and I still got along all right.\\" Pretty boring if you ask me. He uses extreme examples to get you to think, if he presented you with weak examples you would not remember them at all.And lastly, Orwell knew what he was talking about. Read his essays and you will see that he was an incredibly intellegent man who knew the in's and out's of Communism and the complex social issues discussed in 1984. Read his collected essays and you can definitely chart the genesis of this novel. There is a 1 star review that claims Orwell knew nothing about Communism. I beg to differ. Orwell had a very lucid understanding of Communism, much more so than either you or I.So students, try to pretend this hasn't been forced on you and you might enjoy it. For anyone else reading this, this novel is highly recommended for fans of classic literature and those wary of corruption."},{"Title":"1984","review":"After you read this book, like me, you'll probably wonder if this could become non-fiction. In most cases, I'd say yes. That is why you should try and stay informed on the Orwellian things that are taking place in this country.

The only problem I found with the audio CD version was that the reader's voice was very high pitched and I had to turn the trebble completely off to keep it from hurting my ears."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This novel has changed my overall views on power, politics, economics and human nature to such an extent that I now look at my life in two parts: before I'd read \\"1984\\" and after I'd read \\"1984.\\" This novel was a sort of enlightenment, or \\"awakening\\"for me. While I personally preffer Huxley's \\"Brave New World,\\" I found the stark portrayal of Orwell's \\"Oceania\\" and Winston's fractured individuality to be far more powerful. My review might seem like an overstatement-and perhaps it is. After all, I first read \\"1984\\" in October of 2001 while in grade 11 and perhaps that is why it has had such a profound effect on my outlook. \\"1984\\" is a must read for ALL people, EVERYWHERE, who value their freedom and understand that so long as strong authoritative infrastructures continue to control our lives (governments, corporations, organized religion)with a blind following, our liberty is truly fleeting."},{"Title":"1984","review":"War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.With these 3 contradictory statements, Orwell perfectly summarizes the inevitable end of all freedoms for mankind.I have read this masterpiece over 10 times and each time I glean some new thoughts on the pitfalls of living in what we affectionately call \\"society.\\" During my last three readings of this novel, I approached the book looking for parallels between Orwell's 1984 and our 2002.The first reading I approached it from the right wing perspective and was horrified at how large and intrusive the government has become over my short lifetime. The second reading, I approached from the leftist viewpoint and found myself frightened by the encroachments on civil liberties and personal freedoms over the past several decades. In my most recent reading, I approached it from a stateless viewpoint (read anarchist) and found myself mentally replacing Emmanuel Goldstein and the Brotherhood with Osama bin Laden and al Quaida (note: this is not an endorsement of either OBL or Al Quaida, rather it is just a means to see how a government can puff up an enemy to the point he becomes all purpose ... e.g. Those anti-drug Superbowl ads were they claimed that smoking a joint promoted terrorism).In a nutshell, I am saying that 1984 transcends political leanings and begs the question: Does trusting your wellbeing to your fellow man serve your best interests?The answer is a resounding \\"no.\\"In 1949, Orwell's three contradictory statements could have rang hallow with many readers, but in a world where the peacekeepers are those with the military power to coerce peacefulness, where people spend their freedoms for perceived security (see Patriot Act) and where a simple perusal of television's primetime lineup can prove that no premium is placed on intelligence; one can see how 1984 is more prophetic now than it was in 1949."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's 1984 wasn't the first utopia/dystopia written, but it pretty much set the standard for all those that followed, and even for those that came first. Orwell wrote a novel warning us of what could happen if political power went unchecked, and his warning was especially to his contemporaries living in the post-war England. Orwell does a brilliant job of capturing the despair and dinginess of life in his 1984. In fact he does it so well that if the reader is not careful the general mood of the novel could invavde the reader's life (it did mine). This book has been called one of the few masterpieces of modern literature. The third section especially so. Rarely have I read anything as great or powerful as part three of 1984. The dangers that Orwell warns us of leap forth in this section--the loss of free will and the total breaking of the human spirit, which we all would like to believe always survives. But it doesn't."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A great book a little scary with the idea... that BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING... although we always think of who wathing us in public the idea of being watched in work and in your house kinda brings an idea of the Nazi Gestapo back terrorizing you in your house and in public if they think your against the government body."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Winston is a party member in a government that controls the very thoughts of its citizens.

A classic, and a highly remarkable read. It is also a good idea to read &quot;A Brave New World&quot;, that is, if you enjoy this book.All I've got to say is this is a book that will leave you thinking forever.

While being fiction most of the book is a political satire. The most similar book that I have read to it is actually Jihad Vs. McWorld. It is the first fiction book I have read that valued the importance of language and the &quot;Love impulse&quot;. This is seen even today in advertisements. The importance of the name Big Brother is that it is sononomus with the Christian Father and Son figure although not implicitly stated. Newspeak also culminates the impulse. In 1984 the characters follow the teachings of IngSoc, which by looking at it seems harmless but it a abreviation of English Socialism that can hold connotation's in peoples mind. The same techniques are used in modern government and consumerism.

With the recent launch (in the UK anyway) of interractive tv it makes one realise just how real the telescreen is. Perhaps received at the time of it's publishing as paranoid rantings, these days the terrifying predictions are one by one becoming true-once a work of futuristic fiction this book could almost be used now as an urban survival guide. A beatiful and chilling read"},{"Title":"1984","review":"...when people misinterpret 1984 as an anti-Commie book. Orwell WAS a member of the far-left earlier on in life, and 1984 is an anti-totalitarianism novel, a novel that attacks dictators and wannabe-dictators of the entire political spectrum. And it can still happen - look at the world today: censorship, both on the Internet and in the more conventional media, is becoming more popular, everyone's a fashion-enslaved brain-washed conformity-seeking sheep, and we're all continually screwed by politicians who think they know what's best for us.Another criticism of 1984 is the downbeat ending and the essential hopelessness of it all. But the fact is, that if the world slips into a dictatorship like that in 1984 then there will be no hope. Orwell is trying to tell us that we must fight for our every freedom NOW - if we don't then we don't deserve them.This is the greatest science fiction novel of all time (and you can't tell me it's not SF - just because it's SF doesn't mean it isn't literature)."},{"Title":"1984","review":"As one of the people writing about the book here said, it was not meant to incite paranoia, it was about the evils of paranoia. Also, he was a socialist, so I cannot say that it was just propaganda. And don't forget that Communism isn't dead. There are still a few Communist countries out there, not to mention the many dictatorships. As for the book itself, it was pretty good, once you get into it. I like reading about different worlds myself, so I liked this aspect of it. The characters were also pretty cool. The ending was depressing but very very good.

I read this book for my honors english class, and was surprised at it's similiarities to the present state of some countries in the U.S.A. If I could put in a section in the library under horror. How are Orwell's telescreens that much different from the security cameras popping up on every main street corner and sometimes even in your office or home. With the way technology is people can listen to your phone calls and read your E-mails I would like somone to tell me how far we are from a totalitarian society. When I read this book I got chills.

Just try getting away from a viewscreen nowadays. Also, we watch the TV, but the TV also watches US. Advertisers, the Internet, and MTV control us more thoroughly than the Government could ever hope to espire to. Instead of telling us &quot;We are at war with East Asia. We have ALWAYS been at war with East Asia!&quot; they tell us what our values are, what music we listen to, what movies we watch, etc. &quot;We listen to Britney Spears! We have ALWAYS listened to Britney Spears.&quot; Orwell would've been so proud."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I first read Orwell's masterpiece for seventh grade summer reading in 1983 (got in right under the gun!). It remains one of the key books of my intellectual development. 1984 was the first book to get me to think about the importance of the freedom of the individual, the dangers of mob psychology and the evils of totalitarianism.Winston Smith is a member of the Party, as is everyone else who isn't a &quot;prole,&quot; and like everyone else, he lives &quot;from birth to death under the eye of the Thought Police.&quot; Orwell builds up a gray and chilling world where &quot;no emotion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred.&quot;This is what Orwell imagined in 1949 would be the logical extension of communism. And look where we are, fully sixteen years after the year 1984, with the video camera technology that can do effectively the same thing as the Party's telescreens. Imagine life with a TV that could watch you while you watched it--a TV that could bellow at you to do your calisthenics in the morning or face arrest! That's what Big Brother is all about, the absolute lack of privacy to enforce the absolute conformity of action and thought--something to contemplate before tuning in one of those cheesy &quot;real-life&quot; TV-ratings-grabbers. In Orwell's 1984, there was nothing to laugh about.Orwell's writing style is intentionally as stark as the world he creates. The narrator does a lot of telling as well as showing, but this does not slow the pace. I heartily recommend 1984 for anyone over eleven who appreciates his or her freedom and individuality. You may appreciate it far more once you have finished this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book has changed my vision of natural human nature. I have found many events and characteristics of the Party to be preshadowings of organizations I see everyday. It also showed me how an evil administration can distroy a love that was so strong. This book is scary and too real."},{"Title":"1984","review":"As a teenager I lumped Nineteen Eighty-Four together with Animal Farm. I mistakenly thought the two books were thematically similar except that Nineteen Eighty-Four was longer and featured people instead of pigs. Frankly, I didn't like the book too much. Now, fifteen years later, I have reread Nineteen Eighty-Four and now I greatly appreciate it. It's a thought provoking book that easily deserves five stars. It is too bad that so many misconceptions regarding the book are taught to high school students. No wonder that I didn't like it; I didn't understand it. Nineteen Eighty-Four is not a satire of Soviet communism (that's Animal Farm), nor is it a cautionary tale of government power, nor a prediction of the future. Nineteen Eighty-Four belongs to the genre of speculative fiction. It is a dystopian \\"what if\\" story.Orwell had witnessed a dramatic upheaval in the fortunes of the world's empires. The greatest empire the world has ever known, the British Empire, lay in ruins. Germany had been on the brink of total dominion over Europe but was nonetheless defeated. The Japanese Empire had stretched across the Pacific but it too was dramatically defeated. In time all empires must die. Or must they? What if there was an empire that could endure all calamities, wars, internal unrest, trials, and tribulations, and exist unchanged forever?Orwell's achievement in Nineteen Eighty-Four is that he conceived just such an empire: a totalitarian state that would endure for eternity. Ask yourself: What would an eternal empire look like? What would be its philosophy and organizing principles? What goals would it set? How would it operate? What kinds of individuals would populate it? How would the rest of the world react to it? These are the questions that are explored in Nineteen Eighty-Four.Oceania, in Orwell's fantasy, is ruled by The Party. There are many superficial similarities between The Party and the regime of Soviet Russia; but, in Nineteen Eighty-Four it is the differences that are crucial. Instead of Marxism, The Party follows the teachings of Ingsoc, a governing philosophy based on hatred and the naked pursuit of power. Totalitarian leaders in the real world preach equality while they hypocritically amass wealth and privileges for themselves. In Orwell's world, however, the Party leaders preach hatred and genuinely sincerely believe in hatred, and their conviction in the power of hatred is unshakeable. The defining qualities of The Party (doublethink, mind control, incorruptibility) are not to be found in the real world.Unfortunately, many clich&eacute;s have become wrongly associated with Nineteen Eighty-Four. For example, the back of my copy reads \\"Orwell's prophetic, nightmarish vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is timelier than ever.\\" This blurb is entirely inaccurate. If you remember anything from my review then please remember that the world depicted in Nineteen Eighty-Four is a mad fantasy that can never be realized. It is neither a prediction of things to come nor a critique of any real-world regime. It is not a tale of revolution betrayed, nor a portrayal of exploitative leaders living in luxury on the backs of the masses. So put aside your preconceptions of the book because they are probably as wrong as mine were.In summary, Nineteen Eighty-Four is more an academic exercise than your typical plot-driven novel; but, Orwell's exploration of an eternal, unchanging, invincible empire is engrossing and even fun anyway. The subject matter is often very dark so the moments of levity found in the first parts of the book were warmly appreciated. I recommend it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Did you know that one could be sentenced to up to 5 years of prison for possessing this book in the Soviet Union? The distribution of \\"1984\\" was forbidden in Soviet Russia until 1988, until then people had been distributing the book underground, copying it by hand, translating it in secret and getting turned over to the authorities by their friends and neighbors. Because that's what communism does, it brings out the worse in people.I was born and grew up in Communist Russia, and even though I was born too late to see the ugliest side of it I still know my history and am able to draw parallels.I had the strongest feeling of D&eacute;j&agrave; vu during the 2008 presidential election in the USA, the way people swallowed the \\"Distribute the wealth\\" slogan, expecting the government to solve their problems and make everybody \\"equal\\"...it made me ill.Can't people ever learn from history?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"As a freshman in high school who recently finished the book 1984, I have opinions on the book that might be a little different than most others'. I had read another one of George Orwell's books, Animal Farm, and was pretty disappointed. I liked the idea of the story, but I found it hard to get through at times. Since my eighth grade English George Orwell's work, and recommended that I give 1984 a try, I decided to read that for my first choice as a high school reading assignment.I thought the book was very well written. I hadn't read many books with the same writing style that Orwell uses, which was a good change from what I usually read. Although his style was a good thing to try, I found reading it to be a very slow process. There is a lot of vocabulary that many kids and even adults don't know very well, which made it hard to understand the storyline at certain points. However, the paragraphs that follow usually helped me figure out what the author was trying to say or point out.Although the author did a very good job writing the book, I wasn't entirely pleased with the whole story. I felt the story was very hard to understand at times, in addition to not understanding a decent amount of the words. George Orwell does a great job of keeping the reader guessing about future events, and leaving them astonished at the end, but all of those twists and turns can be confusing. I often had to reread a few events in the story before I fullyunderstood what was happening. Having to do this action several times throughout the book got a bit tiring after a while, and made me a little reluctant to move on in fear that I would have to do it again.Even though the book has its ups and downs, I am undoubtedly happy about my decision to read this book. The dark and suspenseful story of a man and a woman opposing everything they have been taught about life and trying not to be suspected by their cruel government, kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing. Although it was difficult reading at times, and I felt like just giving up on it, the desire for more action and suspense kept me going. This is a great book for anyone who loves to read about action and suspense, and is up for a challenge."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is the kind of book that I admire more than like. I admire Orwell for how detailed and believable the world he builds is. For his efforts to set a dark and unsettling mood and for his detailed analysis of its politics.The reasons I don't like it as much as so many other people? Well, it didn't do anything for me. I couldn't relate or feel anything for the characters. I didn't find the story haunting or particularly appealing. It didn't even make me think, when I was reading books like Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 or Camus' The Fall I had to close every few pages to think about it, because I couldn't hold my thoughts back, with 1984 this didn't happen at all.Reading it's a subjective experience, no matter how good a book is, if you don't feel anything as a result of reading it, why then give it a high rating?I wish I'd liked it better, or at least spotted any major reason for my dislike, but I didn't."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Sorry if I contribute to lowering the score for this classic, but although the main idea is good, the writing is simplistic (reads like a book for teenagers) and the story and characters lack depth and are quite boring.I guess I'm disappointed that Orwell didn't do a better job with such a brilliant idea... The only part that was really interesting to me is when his main character, Winston, is reading from the \\"prohibited\\" book.

This is one very weird, very scary, and very entertaining book. Orwell is a master at setting the creepy tone of a world without freedom, where you know that everything you do is scrutinized by unseen eyes. Yes there's definitely a strong message that is coming across. Look a little closer at the story and you'll find a potent argument against Communism, Fascism, Totalinarianism, and many more political -isms. I can't promote this book enough. It is timeless. It is horrifying. And it is real. And please forgive a total stranger for offering advice, but if you haven't read it yet, you need to."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This thought provoking classic continues to be relevant in today's society, despite the fact that the year 1984 has come and gone. The notion of Big Brother has become a part of everday speech, which I fear is leading to this term becoming clich&eacute;d. Read the book, and you will see what the term implies. The world of trumped up wars, constant surveillance, and historical editing is frighteningly mirrored by that of our own."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This review is for the unabridged audio book version read by Frank Muller. Just the fact that Muller is reading this book makes it worth listening to. But I encourage you to listen even if you read the book before. I read 1984 when I was in high school 30 years ago. I thought it was funny to read about the future predictions as we approached the end of the 1970's. I just finished listening to the audio version, and I now have a better appreciation for the true intent of the work. Orwell was not trying to predict the future. He was trying to show us the pitfalls of certain ways of thinking, of the dangers of taking the human drive for power to its logical conclusion. This is more a picture into the human soul than a prediction. In addition, listening to this work opened my eyes to the influence Orwell has had on more contemporary works, such as the movie The Matrix. Read it. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In one of my post-grad classes, a fellow student chided me for not having read \\"1984\\" despite having been an English major once upon a time. I soon remedied the situation and devoured this chilling classic. Big Brother and the Patriot Act share remarkable similarities (forgive me for stating the obvious). I thought Winston's requitted attraction and love for Julia very sweet--but of course, Big Brother tortures and disfigures the lovers out of their feelings.The human intellect evolves into \\"quacking\\" for communication. An interesting take on how regressed we can become if we are not careful of the public policy and ideology of elected officials. However, I really hope and believe that despite how bad things can get, we will never regress to that extent---but a brilliant and thought-provoking cautionary tale, nonetheless."},{"Title":"1984","review":"My title says it all. I was completely immersed in this novel and enjoyed reading it. It was a fast read, and much more interesting than some of Orwell's other works such as Animal Farm.It's a rather unusual novel because it's made to be futuristic and a novel in the genre of science fiction. However, it takes place more than 20 years ago in 1984. If you can get over that fact it's a great book with jawdropping changes in plot and interesting characters."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Imagine a society where the government (Big Brother) is always watching you-invasive, inevitable, inescapable. Such is Oceania. It is a society in which your innermost thoughts are monitored and punishable by death. There is no love or affection, and there is no such thing as friendship. The only suitable emotion is hatred, aimed at exactly whom Big Brother dictates. Individuality is a capital offense. Existing for your own pleasure will get you killed.Oceania controls the present, the past, and the future. Reality is what Big Brother says is reality. 2 + 2 = 5, if Big Brother so dictates. If you protest that 2 + 2 = 4, and the government finds out, this thoughtcrime will result in your death.Winston, the main character in 1984, dares to believe 2 + 2 = 4.To discover what happens in the life of this rebel, who lives in a society that is intolerant of rebellion, read 1984. This book, set in such a chilling dystopia, will horrify and thrill your heart and mind."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This by now legendary work gave us the concepts doublespeak, thoughtcrime and Big Brother. It is the most important fictional work envisioning a totalitarian future, and warning against it. At the same time it is not a very convincing or moving fiction. Orwell had a one- dimensional quality in his creation of character, and it is very difficult to identify closely with or feel deeply about his characters in this work.Yet now that '1984' has come and gone without the disaster Orwell predicted it still holds our attention as one possible nightmare human future. As importantly it makes its own forceful statement against the kind of controlled, closed- minded world the Soviets, the Nazis, and now the Islamic Radical Fundamentalists would have us be imprisoned in."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 by George Orwell is an excellent novel that displays the possible horrors of a \`utopian government'. The novel takes place in London, a large city in Oceania. The main character is Winston, and he is able to see the lies of The Party, which rules the nation.Throughout history, Oceania has been at war with either Eastasia or Eurasia. The Party uses censorship to revise history to make look as if Oceania has been at war with Eurasia and allied with Eastasia, or vice versa. Winston is employed by The Party and his job is to change these past records.Along with censorship, The Party uses techniques like newspeak and doublethink to control the masses. Newspeak is an effort by the government to create a very simple language that is dull and not descriptive. This \`lean' language is designed to minimize the brain use of Oceanians. Doublethink is another effort of The Party to control Oceanians. Doublethink is a technique taught by The Party that requires people to believe things that they know are not true. For instance, a citizen may know for a fact that Oceania was at war with Eastasia only a few years ago, even though The Party insists that Oceania is an ally of Eastasia and always has been.Winston begins to question the greatness of The Party when he sees how blindly some people can follow the party. This really struck Winston one day during the \`two minutes hate', in which The Party shows enemies of Oceania on the telescreen, and all of the Oceanian citizens scream at the person on the screen. Winston is bothered by this, and gains a deep desire to \`bring down Big Brother'.This book is an excellent read for people of all ages, and can show the dangers of government intervention into personal life."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a brilliant book, written in a cold, indifferent air. It's never slow. You never lose interest. In fact, you'll get mad when you have to put it down. Even during the most mundane things in the protagonist's life (like coming home from work and watching TV) it never loses suspense. Lots of political satire; makes for a good debate when through. If only books were still written like this, more people would have a reason to read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When I first read this novel I liked it but thought that it could have been better. I think much of my thining was caused by Brave New World. But the more research I did into this work and Blair himself lead me to believe that he was right-on. The type of totalitarianism that he was addressing were despotic. I found it odd though that Blair seemed to demonstrate the Marxist system in such a bad light. But it seems that if one looks at his commentary in the light in which it was written one sees that he was not addressing Marxism but Bolshevism (or Sovietism) and Nazism. These were not the happy pleasant dystoipias that one finds in Huxley. Also the issues that Blair was addressing were different from those that are normally thought of, especially in the cse of Huxley. Blair is addressing humanity and the abstracts that go with it while Huxley is looking at aspects of Western culture (e.g. drugs, technology, education and higherarchical class structure). It's true that many of the same issues are dealt with in both works but Huxley still comes to happier conclusions, disturbing as they may be. The reason for this seems to be that Huxley's world was the precursor to Blair's. The war had not yet begun. The socialist experiments in Germany and the Soviet Union had not yet failed. The Spanish revolution had not yet begun. While the world was not perfect it was much easier to be ignorant about the many evils of the world and assume that the only ills that the world could bring were held in the deterioration that over-indulgance would yield. While both are accurate Blair had a lot more information to work with."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book in one word is shocking. Not necessarily shocking in the sense that it's shockingly bad, but the point it conveys, the powerful frightening messages it contains, and the warning it has on modern-day civilization is shocking; It's too \\"apocalyptic\\" to believe, yet it shows that if our world continues to gradually decline, that this may very well be our future. So in that sense this book is great. It is powerful, well-written, and easily a classic that should be passed down from generation to generation.A word of caution, however; this book is not a light, fun read to quickly skim over. It is a book to dwell on, to study, and to learn from.So, with that said, read this book and see into the frightening reality of 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The world of George Orwell's 1984 is a dirty world that is filled with equally dirty people. This filth is both external and internal. There is scarcely a page in which Orwell does not describe the run-down condition that is Oceania. Grime seems to cover each wall and window. Elevators break. Nearly all moving devices need continual repair. The only device that is guaranteed to work is the ubiquitous telescreen. The characters are the human equivalent of their eroding technology. Almost everyone is fat, gross, balding, or otherwise plain ugly. Winston Smith, the hero, is described in terms that make the reader wonder why his lover, Julia, fell in love with him. It is this preoccupation with grubbiness that serves as a subtext to point out that the world of Oceania is the inevitable result when the beauty of individuality is removed and the uncaring and life-denying collective psychology of the state is substituted. When the only ones in a society who seek to celebrate their independence of mind and body can do so knowing full well that their discovery is certain, then their relationship takes on a significance that is worth the terrible cost. For most of the book, Winston and Julia tap dance around each other before finding out that each is not alone. When they couple sexually, their orgasm is a political statement. The next logical step is to find others like themselves. They believe that Winston's boss, O'Brien, is a kindred soul who is also a member of the secret brotherhood. He gives them a book to read which explains the principles by which the group's members live. Ironically, to become a member of this group dictates that both Winston and Julia must merge into the group's collective consciousness more thoroughly than demanded by Big Brother for his group, the symbol of the party that governs Oceania. Their relation is detected nearly at once, but the party allows them to continue until it decides to arrest them. O'Brien is really a traitor to the probably non-existent brotherhood, and it is he who interrogates both Winston and Julia. O'Brien is described as an aging but still vigorous torturer. In fact, he uses his wrinkled face as a metaphor for the futility of Winston to seek to enhance his own psychological life by engaging in forbidden love. Winston is thoroughly beaten, humiliated, broken. His de-evolution from Thinking Man to Orthodox Man is both rapid and irreversible. As he stares into the mirror, O'Brien tells him that if Winston believes himself to be the last free thinking man on earth, then the wreck that stares back at him merely punctuates the party claim that the individual counts not at all in the political scheme of things. When Winston acknowledges that he now loves Big Brother, the reader can see that this love is not the love of emotion but one of indoctrinated and inculcated values, and thus not worthy of the term 'love' at all. The tragic irony is that the reader can see this even if Winston Smith cannot."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book in an honors lit class in 9th grade and was surprised to find that it was not a suspended book at my high school yet (and at the same time I was glad it wasn't). Now I am a Junoir and able to fully apprieciate the well written polital novel. As I recall, it is about a man named Winston and is based in the furture where the government was nearly in complete control over a person and their thoughts. This place is Oceana which is located in London and at war or allienced with East Asia and Eurasia (Winston is the only one who knows the truth to this and is therefore especially watched closely as he contains top secreate information from the \\"Truth Ministry\\"). Big Brother is the politacal party that controls London and the secrete police is basically it's secrete weapon to reading the peoples thoughts and killing them off. Winston falls in love with a woman (illigally) named Julia and therefore ends up joining the Brotherhood (good political party against Big Brother). Here we see telescreens that are hidden all over secrete and public places to moniter peoples movements and thoughts. Winston gets caught doing something he wasn't supposed to be doing and is sent to one of the prisons (the most interestingly detailed part in the novel). Here Wiston must face the ultimate punishment of his life...his own fear. Read it, ponder over it, and fear it, and enjoy it. I've even heard that today London has at least 1 survalence camera for every 15 people (sounds kind of like the telescreens to me)....."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a thought provoking book of what George Orwell thought the world would actually be like in 1984. It is a scary prediction, that your whole society is controlled by an unseen figure and all individual thought is completely discouraged. Free will is taken away and people are basically forced to become living robots, submitting to every will of the Party. An original thought will lead you to become wiped out of existence, and the Party will change the past so that you never existed in the first place. This frightening society is conveyed by the life of Winston Smith, an unhappy Party member who holds the idea of Brotherhood. 1984 is unlike any book I have ever read. Since it requires some deal of imagination, I would not recommend it to anyone who has trouble imagining a totally new system of living. The workings of the government require deep thought, so it is not a very easy book to read. However, I enjoyed reading about this insight of the future. I am completely honest in saying that 1984 is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book with the expectations that it was gonna make me think, and it did. The overall theme that of an oppresive society in the \\"future\\" was both thought-provoking and entertaining. People say that this book has no relevence today because of the fall of Hitler and Stalin, but I say it means more now than ever before. You just need to think of it in the opposite context. Let me explain. Today, we have a wealth of information, some say too much. That is the point. Since we as people have so much at our fingertips, it gets pretty easy for most to spend all day looking at meaningless junk and buying things that they don't need. There is where an oppressive gov't takes over by giving us freedom to look and buy, they take away our freedom of privacy, freedom of speech, and freedom of expression. And that is why this book is so important today, because we may be on the brink of a \\"1984\\" ourselves."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Although Brave New World has been written before Orwell's masterpiece - which is the great merit of Aldous Huxley - and these books show different views of the future, I consider 1984 much more mature than the other. When I started to read it, I couldn't stop. It's intelligent, interesting and VERY well written. Besides, it deals with many, many issues, not only totalitarism, as people use to say. It deals also with loneliness, mass media and the power of verbal language. I really like Orwell's description of a profesional &quot;building&quot; a new language, a language so limited that would control human's thought. George Orwell was very inspired when he wrote this book. Congratulations to this sensitive writer."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I read it again every few years. This is such a scary look into what the future could be. I can't imagine what ran thorough peoples minds who read this book when it was first written in the 1940s. They must have held great fear for what was to come. Since I was 7 in 1984 I, obviously, did not read this book until well past that year.The world that this book describes is a scary place that none of us can begin to fathom living in. Upon reading the first few chapters it was odd to me that people existed in this world without striving for change. Upon finishing the book, I can state that I quickly saw how overpowering the government was and how things would most likely be impossible to change.Lastly I want to add that the scariest part of all is that some of the ideas in the book no longer seem so &quot;out there&quot;."},{"Title":"1984","review":"...1984 is about totalitarianism. It is about a society ruled by a dictator named Big Brother. The thought police carefully scrutinize everyone in the society. They arrest you if you show signs of rebellion or dangerous behavior. Everyone is under constant observation by devices called telescreens; devices that are like two way TVs. One of the points of their society is to make everybody the same. They are working to destroy all things that are individual about people. They also destroy all evidence about the past. They invent and change events so that they are made to look good. They have abolished marriage in the common meaning of the word. You may only get married if you do not have any interest in the person. The main Character, Winston, questions this society. He longs for a time in which people had freedom. He starts a journal, a crime punishable with death, about the things he feels is wrong with the society. He meets a woman named Julia and they begin a secret affair. They find hideaways in the woods and go there separately because if they are seen too often together the thought police will get curious and investigate. They get a room over an antique shop in a poor neighborhood and use that to meet in. Eventually they meet up with a man named O'Brien who asks them to join the brotherhood, an anti Big Brother organization. O'Brien turns out to be a member of the thought police in disguise and they are arrested. They are tortured and made to confess everything. When they are released, they have no strong feelings for each other anymore and are for the rule of Big Brother.I think the significance of this story is to bring to attention the dangers of dictatorships. What Orwell did with his novel was create a hypothetical situation representing what could come if we are not careful. This book was written at a very tumultuous time in history where there were many emerging dictators. This book is Orwell's warning to society."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This was an important book when it was written, and amazingly it is still very relevant today. When it was written, the world was facing the threat of global communism. Wells does an excellent job of attacking the flaws of communism while also focusing on the ways it would be expanded in the future. When you look at the technology we have now, you realize that this book was somewhat prophetic.This book was certainly not a call to action against communism however. It was more the product of frustration and hopelessness, and a warning to the reader. As such, the book is pretty depressing. The characters are trapped in their world and completely unable to change anything about it. Even when it looks like there may be hope, it is soon crushed by Big Brother. I don't want to ruin the book for anyone who is thinking of buying it, so I'll say no more. This is a great read for anyone who needs a reminder of how important and delicate our freedoms are."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Surely one among the few best social allegories ever written, together with Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451 and Catch 22, and the harshest and least humorous among them. Though inspired by the Soviet regime, the mechanisms described in the text are suitable for most democratic and non-democratic contemporary societies. More than a prophecy, the novel represents a study of current social dynamics.Pressure for acceptance, mandate for substantial submission in spite of retention of a viewable independence, stratification of people by means of limited privileges are the pillars over which any sufficiently complex group relies upon. The thread develops from the particular situation of the chief character, Winston Smith, depicted against the environment created by the Party to his final struggle and breakdown, when he is forced to turn personal feelings from another person towards the Party, because \\"there is no love, except love of Big Brother, there is no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party\\". Even if the description of interrogatories and tortures is quite detailed and has been sternly represented in some film scenes, I have found two other issues as the most shocking in the novel: the speech of O'Brien (Smith's inquirer), in which he lines out the three stages, \\"learning, understanding and acceptance\\", that Winston is going to pass in order to cure his \\"mental derange and defective memory\\", and the picture of the fade remembrances of Winston's childhood, writing out the merciless way of how selfish a child could be, attached to Winston as an eternal sense of guilt, and which builds a parallel layer, more intimate and personal, about the subject of retaining memory of past events. Maybe Orwell has been too optimistic, because nowadays, as a consequence of media development, learning and understanding are no longer required: it is possible to obtain a direct acceptance."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I think that every good aware American citizen shouldread this book every five years or so. Our freedom is whatmakes this country so great. The freedom to be different.The freedom to dream and love according to your owndesires.

However, I finally managed to get to it, for better or for worse. Orwell's dystopian novel has left me feeling rather prosaic, and I'm not quite sure how to express my feelings regarding the text. In the simplest terms, I didn't like the novel; but I don't think I was supposed to. And I certainly don't regret taking the time to read it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A quarter of a century late, I finally got around to reading '1984', mostly just to say I'd read it and satisfy my curiousity about whether it lives up to its reputation as 'one of the greatest novels ever'.At the risk of being 'redacted and eliminated', I have to say, 'No.'As a work of science fiction, it has all the ingredients for a good story-a 'lone voice in the wilderness' caught in a 'futuristic' dictatorship that seems equally believable and implausible(maybe another example of 'fudging the truth'?) Orwell's gradual, and muddled, revelations of how England became 'Airstrip One' would have made for a great 'alternate history' novel, if he had been that sort of author (as it was, Ray Bradbury covered some of the same ground from other directions in 'Farenheit 451'.) While some may think Winston 'useless', I found him, at times, a sympathetic character. The relatively small cast of characters, and the relentlessly 'gray area' they all occupied, kept me from really connecting to anyone.For me, '1984' let me down when Orwell subjected readers to his desire to write an article detailing the history of socialism, tailored to fit this story, and disguised as 'Emmanuel Goldstein's' infamous 'banned' text, 'The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'. Having lured us in with the 'bait' of a fascinating premise in which we were told just enough of the background to keep us interested, Orwell then 'switches' to a dry, analytical narrative voice, as if from a textbook excerpt, overwhelming chapter 9 of the novel with long, dull, stretches of several 'chapters' written a la Dr. Goldstein, and forcing me to 'skim' this exercise in egotism until Winston finally stops 'reading' and allows us to see more of the 'practice', and less of the 'theory'!As a cautionary tale of real life, I think the only 'caution' would be to anyone who unthinkingly labels any 'big government' as 'Big Brother', without having read this book for context.Four stars for science-fiction, two for literary merit; on average, not bad, but hardly deserving the 'best book EVER!', breathlessly gushing praise so many give it. However, I'm glad I read it, and saw for myself. I'm just not as taken with 'bleak and dystopian' literature as others may be.Make up your own minds...and be glad you can!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Winston Smith vaguely remembers what the world was like before. Before the revolution, before the Thought Police, before Big Brother. But he can't remember if it was better.I wanted to read this book because its a classic. No bookshelf is complete without it. What I was surprised to find is that I really liked it. Sure, I knew I would like it. It's a classic for a reason but I really enjoyed it. I thought it would be hard to get through and reading it would take a lot of effort on my part. I was wrong.I'm not going to get into the plot very much. It's one of those books you just have to read. It's a story about the horror of human nature. The horror of man's obsession with power. This book was written in 1949. I can understand what an impact it must have had then. With Hitler and WWII still fresh in everyone's minds. Even in the 50's it might have seemed possible that something like this could happen. In today's day and age its not even feasible but it makes you thankful for the world we live in and the privileges we take for granted.I highly recommend 1984 if you haven't read it already.

It was originally intended to be a 100 year update of his novel which unintentionally led to many of the same conclusions that he reached over 60 years ago. And although the totalitarian planetary government in place in my story is much the same as Orwell described in his book, I believe I have described it's origins in greater detail. Many of the accepted practices in today's world lead to results very familiar to Orwell's readers. Such concepts as \\"Newspeak\\", \\"Doublethink\\", \\"Thought Police\\", and even \\"Big Brother is Watching You\\",are being implemented today by contemporary democratic societies, including the U.S. In addition, we now have increased security provisions caused by the war on terror that could result in a severe loss of freedom if left unchecked. I believe my story not only shows that Orwell's warnings were valid, but that given the environment in the world today and the increased apathy of its citizens, many of his prophecies have increased odds of becoming reality."},{"Title":"1984","review":"My copy is so old it does not have an ISBN. It is the twenty-first printing of the 1949 Harcourt edition. Refer, then, to page 191: \\"In the long run a hierarchial society was only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance.\\" (This is the rant of the ficticious Goldstein.)Now read Jon Jeter's \\"Flat Broke in the Free Market,\\" \\"Armed madhouse,\\" by Palast, \\"The Man Who Sold the World...\\" by Kleinkrecht, and, of course, the ever popular blockbuster of international poverty \\"The World is Flat\\" by Friedman. So, I will leave it up to you, gentle reader, was Orwell a prophet of distinction or a paranoid socialist nutcase? Have you already visited Room 101?The book is marred by lengthy and didactic dialogue and the premise \\"They\\" would spend money to force Winston to love Big Brother before whacking him. Stalin, and rest of the politicians, dictators, and religious leaders would not have spent the dime.But, at least, as yet, our ubiquitous screens only broadcast and do not monitor, although there is some very distressing information out there about electronic surveillence.Now, one of the local teachers complained to me that he was expected to be teaching exactly the same thing the same day as all the other instructors in his field. \\"Why don't they just use a DVD?\\" he complained. Now, it just so happens that Uncle Mitch, and I will not tell you who he is if you do not know, just announced that every student could have virtual charter school education just by plugging in a computer (Thus, eliminating teachers, teachers' unions, pension plans, school building maintenance, etc. for the public from this personal taxes).You can bet the DVD would be broadcast from some third world country where the techs would work for food, while those who will rule over us, including Uncle's offspring, attended private schools, probably funded by public tax money. You can also bet a shiny new dime that \\"1984\\" would not be in the curriculum.So, the question again is: Was Orwell a prophet of distinction or a paranoid socialist nutcase?Either way, this book seems almost as fresh today as the day it was written, and, as distressing as this title is, should be on your required reading list.As an addendum: Readers may wish to revisit Orwell's earlier work \\"Animal Farm\\" to discover that \\"1984\\" is really just an enlargement of that previous publication, although the names have been changed to protect the guilty."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I first read this book 30 years ago and I was certain that it explained much in American politics at that time.

It lets the reader know how lucky he is. For a future in which you are watched at all times by the ubiquitous telescreens and are sent to authorities by your own children is one that was not so far off when Orwell wrote this masterpiece.The idea of Big Brother gives me the chills even today.

Written in 1961, Erich Fromm concludes, \\"Books like Orwell's are powerful warnings, and it would be most unfortunate if the reader smugly interpreted 1984 as another description of Stalinist barbarism, and if he does not see that it means us, too\\"."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Going into reading this book I assumed that naturally, seeing as it is usually a mandatory school reading assignment, it would be boring. However, from the very start of the novel, Orwell captures your attention with the description of London as it is taken over by Big Brother. Throughout the book my intrigue never ceased as I constantly waited for the rebellious Winston to rise up against the Party and Big Brother. The further I read, the more and more I believed Winston was going to unite the proles and crush Big Brother. Seeing Winston's curiosity as he read through the changed records or remembered more and more about his past kept me believing an uprising was soon to happen. Once he met Julia I was sure that these two promiscuous characters would fight the Party. What was soon to happen to them however, I didn't believe, even after reading it. I was so sure my prediction was right that I assumed the author was just toying with my head. Orwell does an amazing job in making the story unpredictable and interesting. Even though the story can seem long and almost never-ending at times, it is worth it in the end."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I recently chose to read this book as an assignment for my english class. I've always heard that it is such a great piece of literature, so naturally I wanted to experience it. At the beginning of the novel, I was taken in by the way Orwell starts describing Oceania. Then he goes into describe how the party uses telescreens to watch everything that is done by members of the party. These as long as many other elements of the story were very intriguing and are what kept me reading to the end. For the most part, I greatly enjoyed this book, but I would have been happier if the ending was different."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith is one of those.

Unfortunately Orwell was not obvious enough. 1984 was not a prediction of what was to come. Orwell was writing about what already existed.

Wake up Winston! Big Brother has been alive and well for HUNDREDS of years. Could terrorism be our present &quot;outside threat&quot;? It depends on whether outside means inside. Ask Emperor Clinton.

I found Aldous Huxley's Brave New World a far more compelling read, or if you want a real dystopean nightmare try Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegutt. 1984 starts well, but by the final chapters it seems we are reading Orwell's own anti totalitarean attitudes and the story has been left to the side. This book is worth reading, but I wouldn't accept other reviewers comments that this is the best book in the world."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I am going to go against the grain with this one. There are many other reviews of the exact details of the plot, so I'll just make a few comments as to why I think the book is limited in its overall social value, particularly in its assumptions about human nature. The book is set in a world of political totalitarianism that is so extreme as to become patently impossible.Whilst it may be true that the book serves as an educational warning against totalitarian thinking, and while yes it is well written and widely regarded as a classic and has numerous insights into the workings of political totalitariaism, I personally thought this book far too limited in its perspective of how human nature and society actually interact to justify its solid reputation.It is, in a nutshell, a very absorbing but deeply fatalistic analysis of political totalitarianism. The trouble is, is that this extremely fatalistic perspective is such a limited picture of how people actually think and operate, and how society actually functions, as to become self-defeating. For example: a large assumption pervades the book- human nature and society is largely fluid and 'infinitely malleable'. This so-called extreme malleability, of course can be co-opted by psychopaths/etc into various forms of totalitarianism. But this process, of course, is not inevitable, nor is it as pervasive in its most extreme versions as Mr Orwell seems to think.In a nutshell, the books assumes that human nature, and biological forces in general, do not play a large part in society and politics. Mr Orwell philosophy and activism during his life was very much of the political left, and his fatalistic analysis of totalitarianism in this book is itself, deeply biased towards the left.A curious irony in the book is that Mr Orwell creates a world that transcends the relationship between politics and human nature, in much the same way political ideology and totalitarian thinking does. It is a self-fulfilling philosophical stance, but not in accord, in my opinion, with reality. It serves little purpose, for example, in analysing totalitarianism by committing, in turn, the same mistake totalitarians make-exaggeration and over-simplification.The books general negativity is rooted in the same political ideologies it is trying to expose and warn against. It fails to appreciate the nature or influence of underlying biological forces which shape, and are co-opted by political forces. For example, the moralisitic fallacy is wrong because what \\"ought\\", to be is not necasarilly what \\"is\\", which is a strong subtext in the views of both the resistance ('brotherhood') and power brokers in this book.To gain a different perpsective, to that generally assumed by Mr Orwell, and to show why 1984 could only ever be a passing socio-political fad, I would recommend The Blank Slate by Steven Pinker. Societies do undergo revolutionary cultural transitions, and yes, these often become co-opted by psychopaths and dictators as a social system (often under the notion of 'the Blank Slate', together with the 'moralistic fallacy'), but these social systems inevitably fail and subside-primarily because of the grounding of human nature."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I think this is one of the most overrated books I've ever read.The idea of it and the detail put into it is admirable, but it lacks that special 'something' that can make such serious/scary subject-matter hold my attention.I can understand the importance of the story, but Winston Smith wasn't a character I cared for or found any interest in whatsoever. And although the boook made me dislike Big Brother and The Party--the fact that the proles and even the disagreeing members of the Party didn't care enough to attempt an uprising meant that I really didn't care about any of them."},{"Title":"1984","review":"this morning at 235am dudes in ninja suits came into my house and stole my copy of this book.

The government has placed many rules on the people and if they break these rules, they are taken by the thought police and tortured. It warns people against the thought of a fully functional totalitarian society. In the review from AudioFile, they state \\"Once considered futuristic, it now conjures fear because of how closely it fits the reality of contemporary times.\\" The government that is now in control of Cuba, is like that of the government in control in the book 1984. In Cuba, Fidel Castro controls what the people do and how much they make, by communism. He also has the secret police, to install fear into the citizens in Cuba, to keep them from revolting. Cuba may be fully functioning, but there are a lot of people opposed to Fidel's reign and others that don't want him to be in control any more.In a totalitarian society everyone works for the common good of the government, in turn working for themselves because they live under that government. In M. Alcat \\"bel 78\\"'s review, he states that \\"Freedom was only total obedience to the Party, and love an alien concept, unless it was love for the Party.\\" This is something that is a huge aspect of 1984. Winston, the main character, seems to love Julia more then he loves the Party, which gets him into most of his trouble. He also doesn't follow the rules of the Party and eventually gets caught by the Thought Police. Just like Hurdle stated in a Kid's Review \\"After Winston bought the journal from the antiques store it was fairly hard to see if he would get caught and arrested because buying that item was illegal.\\" Winston almost wanted to break the rules in order to see if he would get caught or not. When he is caught his some what freedom is taken away from him and he is forced to give up all that he wanted in order to get it back.The novel 1984, although being an awesome book, against totalitarianism, is not the book for all. I found the book to be boring and I know that I am not the type of person who likes books about dystopias or imperfect worlds.-N.J.Baptiste"},{"Title":"1984","review":"While regarded as a &quot;classic&quot; by some literary scholars, 1984 is devoid of nearly every element of classical literature. The fall of Communism has erased nearly every trace of relevance this book may once have had. Its warnings of the evils of totalitarianism were overly alarmist by even Cold War standards and are even more so today. The absence of strong, 3-D characters makes even a man vs. society theme seem sorely lacking in depth . The only redeeming quality of this book may lie in providing future readers with an McCarthyist view of the evils of communism from the standpoint of a conservative 50s faux intellectual. If you're looking for a deeper, better-written, and tremendously more entertaining book, try Orwell's Animal Farm. Even walking, talking farm animals seem realistic compared to 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The book has not much to say. It is just the common night-mares of its time.

He's nothing more nor less than a second-rate hack who profiteered by preying on the worst fears of modern man.

Yet another fairy tale, albeit a grown-up one, warns us to LOOK OUT for that proverbial boogy man--Big Brother, in this case, being the latest in a long line of aliases he goes under. Perhaps Orwell's &quot;Newspeak&quot; should include these additions: &quot;Propaganda is Truth&quot;; &quot;Truth is Absolute&quot;; &quot;Freedom springs from Fear&quot;; &quot;Extremism is Virtue.&quot; This book has never made anyone stop to think, but, instead, to fear and hate one more faceless abstraction.

I hated having reasonably high expectations for a so-called classic, only to have to suffer through a drab chain of non sequitur events, thoroughly lacking any explanations at all.- Why did Julia fancy Winston, when he (per his own admission) was barely average looking? In fact, he didn't having any redeeming qualities at all. Orwell builds up some interest by strongly suggesting an ulterior motive to her purported love interest, but turns out that she really just wanted sex (how exciting!/sarcasm).- Passing a note with \\"I love you\\" scribbled on it to a total stranger. Really? What is she, 5 years old?- All the 'truths' about the world that the protagonist lives in are revealed via the long and detailed THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM. But later, O'Brien claims that the manifesto is false, written by himself. So the reader consumes those pages and pages of detail, formulating an elaborate mental picture of the novel's world...only to be told later that it is totally false. What was the point of all that detail then?- OMG! Can Winston really trust O'Brien...considering that he's, you know, a member of party whose prime modus operandi is deception? Oh so O'Brien was lying all along and it was all a trap?? Never saw that coming...shocked!!- How could O'Brien have possibly known that Winston had mentally considered not incinerating a newspaper article once? Can the thought police read minds also? Why no explanation given for this?- For a party that doesn't think twice about liquidating political enemies or dissenters, why go through the long, torturous process to brainwash Winston? Why not just get rid of him and render him another unperson?- So Julia and Winston broke down and betrayed each other. Wow, how could they..give in all that torture (described in excruciating detail, pun intended)? Winston loses, Big Brother wins. Story over! No deviation from the norm. No change to the status quo. No triumph of the underdog. Ok, I get it's a dystopian novel. How about at least a respectable struggle, perhaps just barely and tragically failing in the end after coming so close? ANYTHING that makes the reader care about the protagonists, or makes them special, or distinguishes them from the throngs of other miserable souls in said dystopia? Nope!These are just a few of the most blatant ones. There is nothing redeeming about this novel...an insipid plot, nothing endearing or even remotely interesting about any of the characters, no build-up, no unexpected twists which you couldn't see coming from a mile away. In fact, the novel has nothing going for it other than pure shock value. Which it expertly cashed in upon by being released at a time when anti-communist sentiments were at their paranoid apex. In other words, it's the cold war era literary version of a B-rated slasher flick. Really, if you do decide to read this book, scrutinize it objectively, and honestly ask yourself how you'd rate it if you DIDN'T have any prior knowledge of Orwell or this title."},{"Title":"1984","review":"i ordered orwells 1984 on may 27. my card was charged. i did not recieve book. where do i go for a refund? steve"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a very creative and well written book, Winston Smith the main character who is an insignifacant member of the ruling party in London in the nation of Oceania.

I just finished \\"1984\\" a few hours ago and throughout its reading I had \\"blasphemous\\" thoughts like, \\"This book is crazy.\\" And, \\"Orwell was crazy.\\" And \\"Orwell was a sadist AND crazy.\\" Blasphemous thoughts because how dare anyone criticize such a \\"classic\\" and such a genius as George Orwell! He was a \\"genius\\" alright, a genius at hoodwinking people into thinking he wrote a literary masterpiece. And readers please don't tell me I didn't understand the book. I think I did. I just thought the extreme hyperbole and incredulity was just way, way \\"over the top\\" for any serious denunciation of the \\"totalitarian\\" form of government.As stupid and mean-spirited as our species is at times, I think it was ridiculous to cast \\"mankind\\" in such a low light as did Orwell in this book. Long before anything like Orwell's \\"Big Brother\\" has attained such an unconscionable level of cruelity and sadistic power \\"it\\", I'm quite sure, will be overthrown. The human mind is far stronger, rational, and resilient I think than Orwell imagines it. It IS unfortunately quite malleable but not INFINITELY malleable, which I think it would have to be for such a nightmare as \\"1984\\" to become a reality.The most sickening part of the book in my estimation, while the graphic descriptions of Winston's many tortures are sickening enough, is when he honestly and without the slightest modicum of doubt whatsoever proclaims that he LOVES \\"Big Brother\\". Human beings are BETTER than this, and I don't think they can ever be so controlled, brainwashed and manipulated as Orwell imagines they can be.I think the genius of Orwell, if such can be said of him , is that above all he wanted to SHOCK his readers. And in this he certainly succeeded. An Abstract Expressionist painter named Jasper Johns did much the same when he painted \\"False Start\\", which essentially is nothing more than splotches of different colored paints splattered on a canvas. I think the painting is garbage, but it was sold in 2006 to an American hedgefund manager for $80 million dollars."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's 1948 novel \\"1984\\" depicts a nightmarish totalitarian society in which the government controls all aspects of a persons life.This novel follows Winston Smith, the protagonist. Winston's character is one which Orwell creates in order to evoke sympathy from the reader. I know that while reading this novel, at times I felt very bad for Winston and was really scared for which outcomes Winston was placed in. Orwell does this well by creating a gloomy atmosphere in the novel.Winston lives in Airstrip One, geographically known as London. Airstrip One is the textbook definition of a dystopia. It is a poverty stricken area with many people sick and living in ruins. Everywhere on the streets signs posted saying, \\"Big Brother is watching you\\" are present. This omnipresent aspect of the novel, \\"Big Brother\\" is what first begins to create a menacing environment for the novel.This novel was Orwell's idea of what a communist society would be like, and his idea is not only true, but it is one that is beginning to form in modern society. Written during the communist scare in the late 40s, Orwell prophesied that this would be what the world would come to in the near future. If one is to consider the mass movement in media and technology today, reading this book would make one question fear the direction that technology is headed. With webcams, tvs, phones, microphones, computers, and cameras of all different shapes, sizes, colors, and uses placed around every corner, Orwell's imaginative idea of the future might be more accurate than fiction. The government coming into total power using everything we take for granted against us could seem like a very plausible aspect of the near future!This fantastic novel provides excellent insight into what the government is actually capable of, AND, currently is DOING, such as in North Korea. The thought of this occurring though seems too dark, too scary, and too frightening to imagine-almost unreal.Orwell writes this novel in such a way that it has a fear factor to it. Although I quite love this, it might not be for those who are faint of heart. It's underlying message-that these events are highly plausible- might leave people scared and worried. This is because Orwell does not sugarcoat anything. He writes with cynical and harrowing details, presenting everything clearly and concisely. By the end of the novel, I was convinced that what had occurred to Winston was far worse than death.All the things we take for granted such as love, freedom, justice, and independence are alien concepts in \\"1984.\\" Any small instances of these ideas, and Orwell abolishes them from the text as fast as he can. Orwell seems to be destroying all of Winston's hopes throughout the novel. Every time Winston has a shred of hope that good will triumph over evil, Orwell goes out and makes it completely the opposite. He doesn't share this view that he creates for Winston, so he manages to also destroy it in his own character by the end of the novel. Orwell ensures that he will frighten you.I personally enjoyed \\"1984\\" both as a novel and as a possible warning for where the future is headed. Although it is a book which some people might find bleak, it is one that manages to get the authors point across. Orwell raises questions in his novel about government, mass media, and absolute control over mind, body, and soal. These questions really have no easy answer, and most answers still remain unclear. I believe \\"1984\\" is a must read for people, in order to understand how important their lives really are. You better get it in your hands now before \\"Big Brother\\" is watching you too... O_O"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Have you ever watched a movie that ran your emotions through the ringer? And after you watched it you say it was one of the best movies you have seen even though it was such an arduous journey? That is what this book was for me.There is such a general feel of hopelessness in this book. The governement has such a tight grip on eveything that you know any betrayal, no matter how small, will be found out. The government in this is such a huge and pitiless machine, you know there can be no mercy and even when our \\"hero\\" begins his first small acts of rebellion you almost wish he wouldn't and save himself what you, the reader, know could happen.There are moments you dare to hope that the spark of individuality and freedom of thought might continue if only in secret, even though you, the reader, knows these hopes are probably futile. This, I think is the brilliance of the book. The environment is so well crafted it is like you are rebelling with him in your hopes, even though you know the price and how you will feel when things unavoidably come crashing down. Thus is the human spirit, however, and something I believe the author intended. The journey belongs to you as well as our hero.This book had me thinking a lot in my downtime, about how things could easily go the way of 1984 in our world with only a few more tweaks. It seems ludicrous but I am sure you could come to the same conclusion. I am a conservative fellow by nature and there are things this book says that I do not agree with, however I think we can all agree that the loss of basic freedoms and rights is a horrible thing and this book makes you see what you have and how easily it could all be taken.Try this book out if you are ready for something heavy and to do some thinking afterward. thanks."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Amazing. The intricacy of this world that George Orwell creates is fantastic and frightening. The themes of history, control, and technology sent my mind in a good thought-provoking buzz. Winston provides a wonderful central character who is seemingly broken yet somehow hopes still. The ending is depressing but fitting.I have only one issue with this novel. The relationship between Winston and Julia feels artificial and purely sexual. It feels as if Orwell was trying to express a love between them, but I didn't believe it.This novel is definitely worth a read. Again and again."},{"Title":"1984","review":"One of the most embarassing secrets in my life has finally ceased to exist. Until last week i had never read 1984.

The links to this present age are evident in nearly every page of the masterpiece."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Imagine living in a dystopian society where your government monitors your speech and every thought, disguises its corruptive status by saying that it's working for a better tomorrow, and basically everything else to control ideas and brainwash the people into supporting its propaganda. Well, imagine no further, just read 1984 by George Orwell, which follows the life of Winston Smith through the post-war, dystopian society of Oceania as he reminisces his childhood before World War II while struggling to live under the rule of the Party. Winston faces a society where no one is unaffected by the ever-changing of the Party and everyone lives in constant fear that Big Brother is watching over them.Winston lives in the city of London, where he works for the Ministry of Truth as an editor for printed text, condensing words into the language of Newspeak. The constantly shrinking language of Newspeak was created to reduce the possibility of \\"thoughtcrime\\" (the act of thinking outside the Party's beliefs) among its citizens and to eliminate any vocabulary deemed unnecessary. For example, the prefix \\"double\\" can be added to the word \\"good\\" to form \\"doublegood,\\" which indicates that something is very good, and vice versa. This is one way that Orwell displays censorship in a communist society, eliminating as many radical ideas from society as possible.Orwell created characters like Winston who made you sympathize for him, from the way he describes his childhood to the way he shows his secret disdain for the Party. Along the way, Winston meets with Julia, a woman from the Fiction department who is the exact opposite of the Party-supporting person she claims to be. From the way Orwell crafts his characters, you can see that he wanted a character that would entirely rebel against the Party to meet Winston, a man who only secretly disdains the Party, to bring out his dark side and do things that he would never have done by himself. With Julia, he secretly rebels from the Party by engaging in everything the Party is against, all the while trying to conceal himself from Big Brother.As much as you'd like to think that Big Brother is nothing but a fantasy, 1984 was written about the communist countries after World War II like the USSR. Orwell makes this dystopic society parallel to communist society in that everyone is monitored, propaganda is displayed through all areas of media, and the government does its best to alter its ugly past and to sugarcoat current events to put the country in a more positive light. Some say that the novel is too dark; a possibility for this could be Orwell was suffering from tuberculosis during the time he wrote 1984, so his pain and suffering is paralleled in the dark descriptions of society. In the communist society and in Oceania, there are those that strongly support the government's propaganda, and there are those that disagree with the propaganda and long for the days before the government changed. North Korea almost accurately mirrors Oceania in that they're run by a communist government, the people live in poverty, and they live in constant fear of the police taking them away. The sad reality is, the fictional society of Oceania is very much alive in today's world.\\"It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. Then the face of Big Brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals: \`War is peace; freedom is slavery; ignorance is strength.\\" The scenery and the way Orwell tells the story made me feel like I was actually living Winston's life. The darkness of the novel only adds to the real feel of it. It is a bit slow in the beginning where Orwell describes Oceania, but once you get to the middle, you won't want to put it down. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading science fiction, or even to anyone who is looking for a good read. The only downside to reading this novel is that you might start thinking that the thoughtpolice are watching you through the television and listening to everything you say through the walls."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This novel seems to be becoming more poignant as the years go by. What was once a frightening science fiction tale about a future gone wrong is now a prophetic vision of a reality we all know. One cannot dispute the fact that we are now surveilled in every aspect of our lives and we are only a hair's breadth away from authorities being able to peer into our very private spaces at will. The march of technology makes fiction into fact and it is our job to be ever vigilant against threats to out privacy. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The year 1984 has long since passed, but this novel remains a relevant vision of a world where the State controls every aspect of the person's life, and even thoughts can be crimes.When I was in high school, I tried to pick up this book and read it. I got all of a couple of pages into it before setting it down and never returning to it. Fast forward a little more than a decade, and I finally picked it up again. And you know what? This is an excellent story! I just needed to get in touch with my cynical side. A high school senior has too much optimism to appreciate Nineteen Eighty-Four.I used to think (back when I hadn't actually read the story) that this was a book about a society where the government was watching its citizens' every move. Well, there is that, but there is so much more to this book. I was impressed by the scope of the ideas touched on here. Most fascinating to me was the concept of thoughtcrime. The idea that a government would seek to control and judge the very thoughts of its citizens is horrific, and yet it is one of the more plausible concepts in the book! It's not enough to obey the government; you have to want what it wants, to give up your will to a shadowy, unknowable Authority.Then there is the concept of the State being able to watch you constantly. It's like the whole populace is living in the Panopticon. I loved the scene where the two main characters have to wait for a crowd to be able to meet each other. In a society where you are always being monitored, the only place to hide is a crowd.The spookiest facet of this imaginary, horror-story society, is that it is conceived as being perpetual. The \\"people\\" will never overthrow the government. It functions like a machine, both in its inner workings and its relationship with the other major world powers. It is designed to last forever, to never become the victim of revolution. And through advanced technology and psychological control, it is working.The last part of the book was a riveting, frightening scene. The agents of this terrible society do their best, not to force our protagonist to conform, but to instill in him the desire to conform. To make him love the forces that control him. It is genuinely scary, and painful to watch. The last couple scenes were just amazing.This book is more than just a Bible for folks complaining about the government intruding on personal privacy. \\"Big Brother is watching you!\\" It is a frightening picture of how a society would look where the government is taking captive the very minds of its people, and through technology and thought control achieving a kind of clockwork immortality. It is a dark vision, but one worth seeing.Highly recommended.Final Grade: A"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I've probably re-read this book more than any other book I love. It's one of my top five favorite books of all time. Even in high school when I was first forced to read it, I loved it. If you haven't read this book, even if it's not your particular genre of interest, please give it a try anyway! Those who haven't read 1984 yet would be shocked how many cultural references today stem from this book. I can't tell you how many times I've seen 'big brother' and 'thought police' t-shirts/bumper stickers/posters/etc. Plus, wouldn't you love learn how to make up funny newspeak words with your friends?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"When I first read Orwell's 1984 I was 16. Now I'm 44 and I must say that the book took on a whole new meaning to me. Most people say this is one of the best of the worst books they'll ever read - and I'm one of them. What I find amazing is how Orwell, in 1948, had such vision to see our planet's future unfold. It's hard to know if science fiction begets truth, or if truth begets science fiction - either way what 1984 portrays is very relevant in today's society; even the introduction of Newspeak ... while we haven't gone to this extreme the truncation of today's language certainly lends itself to the whole idea of Newspeak!Don't read this book just before going to bed ... unless you want to experience some very unusual dreams."},{"Title":"1984","review":"To this day, no other novel has changed the way I look at society as George Orwell has done with \\"1984.\\" I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I enjoyed the book somewhat.

This didn't bother me though, as it was only one or two pages in the whole book and it didn't mar my enjoyment of one of my favorite books of all time.

I wonder if I read the same book you did?As other reviewers have said: this book is a masterpiece. Orwell captures many details of life under a totalitarian regime. He backfills Winston's character with memories and dreams -- if I lived in that society, I'd spend a lot of time in my head, too. He proceeds from there to the economic and political system, presented both through Winston's job and his trips to the proletarian quarter and through The Book. And from there to philosophy. The man who tortures Winston explains why, down to the first cause."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is classic literature! George Orwell invented Big Brother in this book and it is scary to behold. He makes Big Brother all too real and all too feasible. I read this in high school and it impacted me even then. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"There are undoubtedly a lot of great books out there but there's a selective few that I would consider a must read, and 1984 is one of them. Is it really that good? My personal opinion is that there are better books out there in its genre, but none have had the impact 1984 has had. 1984 is a reminder of the things that we take for granted everyday, It's about one mans struggle to keep what he values most, his free thought.I've read this book once, looking to give it a second read. It's hard for me to pick it up again because the feeling you get from reading 1984 is not exactly a great one, it's depressing. Which is why I prefer reading Vonnegut.Regardless, 1984 is one of those books we should all read at least once."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I never had to read 1984 in school. It was always referred to by teachers, but references were never enough to make my realize what the book was exactly about. The idea in my mind had been that the book was about an ideal look at the future of the world (America?) in 1984 (the book being written in the 1940's).Well, the idea wasn't exactly wrong, but it wasn't nearly the happy and bright world of the future I was expecting (lamely I was thinking Jetson's... go figure).So with a Kindle in hand, I decided I'd take it upon myself to explore many of the classics I never had to read as a student in school or even those I dismissed in the way the typical student with a narrow view of the world might.To start at the end of it all, the book was good. It was much better than I expected. Of course the idealized view of the world presented isn't the ideal we all want. It's a utopian world that is to the extreme of being dystopian because the requirements to idealize everything requires a type of world control that isn't as far fetched as it may seem.I don't want to go into many details except to say that the book is disturbing yet enlightening. If you have any awareness of the world around you, especially the world of the early 21st century, you'll see that many of the ideals aren't so far-fetched with our current world governments. Many of the catch phrases such as Big-Brother come from this book, and it becomes very clear what these ideas refer to. Of course the world isn't nearly so extreme, and I do think Orwell was exaggerating a viewpoint of what the world can be like. But in presenting the concepts in this manner, Orwell was hopefully making us aware of the slippery slope we may (now do) find ourselves in with respect to the perfect society.How close we are to what Orwell presented will depend on the reader. I can see parallels with our US government of the last 10 years, but then again I realize that to be as close as suggested would be quite pessimistic. Regardless of how close we may be, any reader should keep and open mind and awareness of what they learn from this book. This isn't the happy world I expected, and ultimately I found it a bit of a depressing world to think of.Yet, in the end this one book makes me really understand the importance of this book as a classic. This book does has its entertainment value, but its influence on the way we think and the awareness that comes out of the book is one that can't be dismissed. It's not a difficult read, and the more people that read it and become aware of it, the better off we'll all be, and the less likely the society ruling this fictional world will ever become real if we are in fact headed that way. And if we aren't head that way, be entertained by it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I think it would be safe to say that 1984 is a unique story. As far as stories go, it's hard to categorize. Generally speaking, 1984 fits into the fiction category, yet it rings eerily true. It could be called science fiction because of the prominent use of technology in the narrative (telescreens, rocket bombs, etc.), but this doesn't quite fit either. Is it a political treatise on the nature of dictatorships and their nature to suppress all free thought? Yes, that is true too, but even this doesn't quite get it I think.I suppose to get close to its heart, would be to say that it is a fictionalized political and philosophical commentary. While it is \\"dystopian and satirical\\" according to Wikipedia, and I would agree, it goes beyond this. Its focus is not on any particular dictatorship (although communist Russia comes to mind), but on political power in general. It could readily be used in a political science course. The lecture(s) could be called, \\"The philosophy of the dictator\\".1984 makes me think of Nietzsche's philosophy which included the so-called \\"will to power\\". The political genius \\"Big Brother\\" exercises his power over others to the ultimate extreme. His goal is not merely political suppression or suppression of free speech, but rather the conversion of the hearts of all so that they will love big brother for his own sake. Through reprogramming, Big Brother seeks unified thought and purpose.The story also reminded me of the movie The Matrix and the Borg from Star Trek. In each of these stories, the political elites (the matrix or the collective) use groupthink to accomplish their ends. Big Brother uses it as well. He required the control of language by issuing a \\"Newspeak Dictionary\\". To get everyone to think along the same lines was his ultimate goal. Those who could not adapt were eliminated because they were like viruses in the system. We see this issue in the film The Matrix. Smith says to Neo that the humans are like a virus that must be eliminated.Unlike the Matrix, where there is a hero, 1984 contains no hero. Winston is not even an anti-hero. He is a cog in the machine. It is almost a pointless story in that sense. The reader does not root for Winston, but only stands as an observer in dismay. It betrays the form of novel and the traditional story arc. There is no vanquishing of evil, no destruction of Big Brother. In this story the bad guy wins in the end. It is intended as a cautionary tale of what can happen to us if we are not careful. From a story point of view, I found 1984 unsatisfying. As far as its political analysis, I found it very profound. It was fascinating to read the ramifications of ultimate power.The commentary of O'Brien during Winston's interrogation, torture and imprisonment was right on the mark. The power structure of Big Brother far surpassed all previous dictatorships. Those in the past did not take it far enough. Big Brother had the courage to take power to the ultimate level. Big Brother intended to make himself a god to be worshipped. His thought would be the only thought. Groupthink would reign supreme.I would recommend reading 1984. While it will not bring a happy feeling to the reader by the overthrow of Big Brother, it is worth reading for its political and philosophical reflections on modern society. We would do well to heed Orwell's warnings regarding the potential loss of freedom. He warns us against the aggregation of too much power in government. Orwell has created a chilling tale that will make the reader reflect seriously on the proper role of citizens, of government and the importance of free speech."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When I decided to read this book, I was a little apprehensive. I was NOT a fan of Animal Farm so I wasn't sure what to expect with this novel.

I thought the book was just a little too far fetched for me. His prediction of 1984 was just so negative I found it really hard to get into it. It was difficult to read simply from lack of interest. I Think that this book may do wonders for other people though, it's just not really my style. For the most part I've always heard good things about this novel from other people. So just because I didn't think the book was that fantastic, don't let that stop you. I would advise you to read this book to see if Orwell's depiction of this strange negative utopia is for you."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The book 1984 by George Orwell was in a way funny. It was somewhat odd and mysterious, but it was funny. It was funny because of how George Orwell viewed the future. He described secret organizations. I believe that this book was very good literature, but it gave a weird outlook on the year 1984. As an example George Orwell writes,&quot;Winston feared for his life that the thought police would track him down if he dared keep writing in the diary.&quot; Even so for a person who loves reading about what could have been and the odd ways history could have happened, this George Orwell classic is all for you, and I recommend it. For those that prefer a more realistic novel, like me, aim for another author and book of your choice."},{"Title":"1984","review":"At the risk of being tarred and feathered for disliking a \\"classic...\\"Orwell was a philosopher trying to be a novelist, and in my opinion he failed at both. The first third of the book is painfully slow and plot-less, in the middle third Orwell gave up on expressing his ideas through plot and had his main character \\"read a book\\" about the Big Brother society, and the last third is brutal and depressing. I think Orwell would have done better to simply write the philosophy book he had his character read and forget about the boring, contrived plot he attempted to create. Also, sex is such a common metaphor throughout the book that it was practically a fourth main character.The only reason I gave the book two stars is because it made me think about the influence of the Holy Spirit. Orwell was not a Christian, and as such saw the possibility of a future with no morals, no absolutes, and a useless, broken human spirit. I kept thinking, \\"Even if society was like this, SOMEONE would still know truth and stand up for it.\\" The reason I believe that is because of the Holy Spirit and God's promise of a remnant. It is comforting to know that, no matter how bad our world gets, 1) man was still created in God's image and that image cannot be completely snuffed out, and 2) as long as the Holy Spirit and the church remains, there will always be those who recognize and stand up for truth. The Bible seems to indicate that the Holy Spirit and the church will someday be removed from the world, and the world of 1984 might not be too far off from what that could look like, except that I think it will be worse. I would say read the book if you want to ponder that, but it's so poorly written I say don't bother--I'm sure you can find something better."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book back in the '60's and seeing the events unfolding with the election of Obama, I wanted to see how much of Orwell's prediction are coming to fruition...starting with the BIG SCREEN TV's and now \\"drones\\" being used over American air space...scary!The book itself is rather slow reading (haven't finished)written in the 1st person with attention to details so very good for the imaginative mind.

Why? because of his unique way of writeing and his views of what life would be like in 1984. The book does, however get boring. Eben though the book seems boring and uneventful you should continue reading, because it gets more exciting the further you read. The story opens with the main character Winston Smith and he describes several of the things he sees, such as the bizarre letters or words he sees on walls.

The setting of the book is Airstrip One, formerly London, England, and is ruled by a totalitarian ruler with the title Big Brother. The book is a commentary on communism. For example, the features of Big Brother are close to those of Stalin's, and their political group is referred to as the party. The story line follows a Winston Smith, who is wary of the party's rules and is thinking of rebellion. He first starts writing a diary, which is strictly illegal of the party. He meets up with two allies who share his quest, one a beautiful women and the other a member of the inner party, or the head of the group. But other than that, I can't say. This is as far as I've gotten before this review was dueWhat I enjoy about 1984 is the suspense. You are never quite sure about what is going to happen next. The plot is a bit slow in the first few pages, but then gets faster as the book goes on. As for the characters, they are people you can relate to and you can always picture them in your head. The book will keep you on a train ride of suspense and intrigue as you read of the demolished world that could've been in 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"OK, maybe Mr. Orwell intended it to be this way, but it still doesn't hide the fact that this book moves incredibly slow compared to the author's other works. I read this book because I remember thoroughly enjoying and understanding Animal Farm years ago, and this work was recommended by several of my friends. If you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing, check this out. Yes, this is science fiction, and just because some people call it a classic doesn't mean I like it. If you want some of the best in this genre, I recommend 'Dune', by Frank Herbert, '2001: A Space Odyssey', by Arthur C. Clarke, or 'Enders Game', by Orson Scott Card."},{"Title":"1984","review":"really slow service..... took me almost 3 weeks. And the cover is different the one displayed so are the page numbers."},{"Title":"1984","review":"If you've yet to read this masterpiece, hurry. When you get tired of reading or think that what Orwell writes is unrealistically drab, then flip on CNN and catch your daily dose of propaganda. The world of 1984 is modern America, bin Laden is Goldstein and the book is terrifying. John Ashcroft on 1.29.02 ordered a semi-nude statue of Justice in the Justice Department to be covered by a sheet (check the nydailynews.com archive - No Nudes Good News at Justice). 1984 depicts a world in which the populace suffers but suffers because a war is being waged, a war against faceless terrorists whose existence is only proved by the occasional bombing and \\"telescreen\\" broadcasts of the Brotherhood's evil leader Goldstein. Life in Airstrip One (UK) is a miserable existence with barely enough food, many people going without shoes, no art, no free speech and cheap, rotgut alcohol. Give the recession and the Bush administration a few more years in their 'war against terrorism' and see if you can even still find this book outside of illegal personal collections.After you're done with 1984 check out \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" Orwell's account of his time spent in the Spanish Civil War on the side of the Communists and Anarchists (which means believing in no central government by the way, the way the Native Americans, Druids and numerous other peoples lived, not all out savagery like the American thought police would have you believe) versus the Fascists. Homage to Catalonia will help you have a better understanding of what WWII was all about, how the advent of technology set the stage for the top nations in the world to battle of raw materials, slave laborers and market share. Do some research and see that nearly all of Europe was Socialist or full on Communists at the time of WWII and then realize that American Fascism and Soviet Communism (really Soviet Fascism) defeated Nazi Fascism and that the Cold War was necessary for American Corporations to grow and take over the world with every country that didn't want to be bent over by the US Corps. being invaded outright or overthrown by American backed troops for being Marxists. The collapse of Soviet Russia was disatrous for America because no bad guy meant we had to pay back debts and answer for the daily suffering of millions of Americans.

I find it really funny, however, how so many people inject their own political ideas into their interpreations of the book. It's a very far stretch to say that this book is about the Bush administration taking away all of our rights in the name of counter-terrorism."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A very meaningful book. I was taken back at how intense it turned out to be; socially, politically, psychologically and existentially. And it really gives one the awful nausea that Sartre spoke of and the angst of Kierkegaard, the existential despair, emptiness, loneliness, the awful outcome that leaves you with a sour pain in the pit in your stomach. But that is only if you remain too attached and subjective. On the other hand, if you can detach yourself from this book and view it objectively, it is the most meaningful and explanatory lesson in awareness to the distinct and very real possibility of a utopian world gone bad. This book is a valid warning.The book is brilliant, portraying an authoritarian government that recreates all thought, erases all history, negating it all into solipsism, that all reality is simply the creation of man - The Party of Ingsoc- and in doing so melts into a radical blind relativism. Ingsoc, the Party of Big Brother which rules, also attempts to create an entirely new form of language - Newspeak - that reduces the variations of meanings to prevent people from independent thinking. In this new language, the word called, \\"Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them . . The process has to be conscious, or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt.\\"It's ironic, but ultimately the fundamentalists are blind relativists in that they violently enforce their view and then change to a completely new view - new history, and then re-enforce this view in staunch, one-sided fundamentalism. This is truly blind relativism, which is different from cultural relativism and pragmatism, where there can still be a limited form of relativism that retains values, but not in the world of Big Brother. This is important because there is a huge difference between mindless relativism and the compartmentalization of absolutes in pragmatism, which maintains value retention while tolerating cultural differences. But in Big Brother, all becomes a relativistic void for the Party, which uses hate, fear and torture to achieve its end goal, the goal of power; power for the Inner Party.The government of Orwell's 1984 is different from all the previous authoritarian governments, as it does not fool itself that it trying to help the people. At the end of the current edition is a short essay of Erich Fromm, with an analogy in comparison to two other negative utopian novels with three other positive utopian novels and how society went from such positive idealism to the recognition of negative possibilities in the direction of our future and how our responsibilities and the limited amount of time humanity has as a species to make the necessary changes towards heeding this warning and directing itself towards the positive outcome.Despite the outcome and utter despair the book leaves you with, the valuable lesson speaks for itself. And I think in America, we must recognize our free-market fundamentalist mentality, our military bullying and authoritarian nature that puts the dollar and large corporate control over the proletariat. We need to value Orwell's warning and work towards repairing the great democratic dream of a equalitarian society that puts the rights of the individual ahead of monetary gain and looks towards the preservation of our environment - to restore the ideas of Emerson, Whitman and James and pragmatist values of democratic government actively engaged by the educated working classes.The year 2005 represents a major time for America (Amerika) to wake up from the partisan, unilateral decisions of the Bush Administration's lone ranger policies, which include torture (congress just re-defined this word!) and lies. And in addition to the United States Imperialism, there is another major serious global development resembling Big Brother which has already begun; the WTO (World Trade Organization), well underway with a pseudo-democratic, secretive, powerful, small elite group of plutocrats (mostly United States corporations) enforcing global limits on protective government regulations, reducing environmental protections and proletariat rights, all so under a \\"newspeak\\" (rhetorical-beneficial) language of \\"free-trade.\\" Orwell has become a superior prophet over Nostradamus.\\"Is not a matter of whether the war is not real or if it is. Victory is not possible. The war is not meant to be won. It is meant to be continuous. A hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance. This new version is the past. And no different past can ever have existed. In principle, the war effort is always planned to keep society on the brink of starvation. The war is waged by the ruling group against its own subjects. And its object is not the victory over either Eurasia or Eastasia, but to keep the very structure of society in tact.\\" George Orwell, 1984\\"In a way, the world-view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it. They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening. By lack of understanding they remained sane. They simply swallowed everything, and what they swallowed did them no harm, because it left no residue behind, just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird.\\" p. 156WAR IS PEACE - and great profits are gained by large corporate military contractors and the vast oil supply (Halliburton). The economic gain is not for the working class, but for the corporate elites and their private ownerships. Thus the government remains financed and ready for further imperial maneuvers.FREEDOM IS SLAVERY - and we now have tight security measures, wire tapping, censorship and the Patriot Act. All of this enslaves us and removes many of our liberties and private rights, all so for the sake of keeping our freedom secure, slavery to protect freedom. Ultimately, censorship prevents the working class from Socratic inquiry of government policies, thus the government remains in tact. Labor parties, Poplulists-Farmers, Feminists, African Americans/Civil rights, evironmental protections, minimum wage requirements and the working man and woman themselves loose their rights and voices of active participation. They are simply \\"prols,\\" while the corporate elite, the plutocrats increase their rule, working their way towards totality. Open Democracy and human rights die, aristocracy enslavement lives, all so to protect the freedom of the country.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH - and to remain in ignorance is keep the proletariat quietly content in his mediocre existence, either in poverty or struggle, ceasing the time, strength and desire for Socratic inquiry of government policies. The result; mindless flag waving nationalism. Ignorance masked under the newspeak of \\"Free Trade\\" and radical privatization without regulatory control leads to monopolistic corporate state owned society. And the flags keep waving. The breakup of a Hollywood couple takes the headlines, while WTO is quiet in the media background. The elite in Control increase and maintain strength. Ignorance is strength."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Through out the coarse of my reading carrier I must say that I have found only a few novels that may compare with &quot;1984&quot;. The cunning realism that is embedded upon every page is something truly worth reading. Personally as a writer I feel that after reading this novel I have grown and improved my own writing technique. Not to mention the actually genius involved in contemplating the elaborate world of restricted freedom and no piece of mind. George Orwell completely shatters all walls of possibilities when he introduces many variations of mass control as well as mass acceptance of lies. The complexity of the main character Winston Smith in itself is simply astonishing. So tragic and heart felt is his predicament that sympathy is quickly given to the fictional character. This is mostly because of the fact that certain freedoms that we have are taken for granted. While in &quot;1984&quot; the lack of freedom is equally accepted and taken for granted by the people of the novel. Which reminds us to think and judge for our selves what it is right.

This book was shocking to readers in 1948, but to those of us who have seen the Soviet Union and even modern day America, it is not really shocking. Oceana, in the book, has an exagerated toletarian system similar to Nazi Germany or Soviet Communism, but with the sexual attitude of the Shakers, or some other group that twists Christianity into a miserable heavy-handed religion. Obviously the author was writing based on events in his time. What is amazing is how the goals of the regime in the book have actually been accomplished, and more easily, in American democracy without the heavy handed approach. The approach in the book is unlikely as they limit human sexuality to a level never acheived by puritanism, except for groups like the Shakers, who died out. It is more effective to break down the family the way it has been done in America, through promoting sexual immorality, divorce, abolishing parental rights, and university brainwashing against parental values. Of course this breaks down society as a whole, but passifies the subjects, and the breakdown of America is necessary to establish a world wide form of democratic facism, or, \\"the Plan\\". The futuristic telescreen, would be called an interactive flatscreen TV in our day. While it has not yet come to pass, fully, the internet does much of the same, where people's movements are being tracked and recorded, largely for market purposes at the present, but aside from entrapping people seeking presently illegal forms of sex, its full potential as a law enforcement tool has not yet been utilized. Large search engines have used it to censor speech and thought in some regions, as well as rewrite the past. New speak would be hard to acheive in a democracy, but schools and the media have attempted the separation of word and thought through programs such as the failed Evonics course in California. Words have lost meaning, such as when my son calls something \\"bad\\", it can mean good or bad. When he calls something \\"sick\\", it could also mean he likes it, or he hates it...or both. Double speak is prevaelent, and the thought police exist in the spirit of \\"politcal correctness\\". An example of double-speak is when President Clinton stated, \\"we will re-define the immutable\\". Thought crimes are labled as \\"hate crimes\\" and are being enforced in order to bring harsher justice to enemies of the state. Threats of terrorism are used to convince the populace to eagerly forfeit their freedoms, though the government is doing the same things they always did, the media is publicizing it as something new to make people consciously aware of the activity in order to accept it. The US Constitution is being reinterpreted and called a \\"living document\\" in order to change it's meaning and use doublespeak. Examples are \\"separation of church and state\\", a phrase commonly believed to be in the Constitution, but not actually there. The words that are there to prevent government interferance in church affairs, have been twisted to mean the opposite, and is commonly used to erase certain forms of religion (mainly Christianity) from the public sector. The reading of founding documents is forbidden in some state schools due to the mention of God and other ideas which are conflict with the revision of history. Students are also taught that the Pilgrims came to America because they liked to travel, or they wanted gold. The former reasons of fleeing religious persecution and freedom are no longer historical fact as it would interfere with the forthcoming persecution. Another example is the supreme court ruling which supports the confiscation of land by a government body if it can be sold to a source offering higher tax revenues, something clearly forbidden by our founding fathers. In the book there was one party. In America, it is limited to 2, but they are much the same, but appear to argue over inflamatory issues to create the illusion of difference. One example is abortion, which the balance of the Supreme Court comes close to tipping to make illegal, but never quite makes it. The next presidential election is planned to ensure that, regardless of which party wins, or is planned to win. Abortion, being a symptom of a greater cause, keeps people focused on it's own battle, thus preventing them from interfering with the root of the cause which is part of the Plan. In reality, secret agendas are co-operated on by both parties, such as de-industrialization of America for personal profit and the Plan, and the formation af an American Union. Not even the media is allowed in on such negotiations, and the lawmaking procedures are bypassed. Science is allowed, but thought in the scienific community is one of the most strictly controlled, comparable perhaps to the Catholic Church during the days of the inquisition, though penalties are limited to ruining ones career, rather than martyring them. A specific scientific theory of origin, not proposed by a scientist, but a bitter son of a clergyman, is taught as fact, not theory, and increasing scientific evidence against the theory or its obvious flaws, and equally or more viable scientific theories are forbidden for discussion, and lawsuits and severe punishment awaits any state school teacher who disobeys this order. No questioning or free thinking is allowed in this area, as it is considered almost as a blasphemy towards the unofficial state religion of Humanism. This theory is also the basis for racism and ethnic cleansing, and has been the foundation for more death in the world than any other religious dogma. While racism is not tolerted in the realm of political correctness, the concept of different races despite genetic proof of only one human race is supported by all government forms asking which race you identify with. This is because there are many in power who secretly benefit from racism and cultural divisions. While Christianity is forbidden in the state schools, Islam is tolerated and often promoted. It is unclear if this is out of fear, or part of a larger plan, when that religion will replace the vacuum created by the elimination of Christian thought and freedom. An interesting perspective is the essay \\"Will Islam Be Our Future\\" by Joel Richardson. Thought crimes today also prohibit the distribution of medical literature published by organizations such as the AMA warning agianst the consequences of practicing certain unsafe or deviant sexual behaviors. In fact, such activity is being taught and encouraged to young school children, and parents can face stiff penalties for interfering with such doctrine. While most Americans once believed the government should keep out of the bedroom, the liberal proponents of these practices will themselves be eliminated after they help to usher in the next phase in the Plan, where human sexuality and the role of women are strictly controlled by the Government. This will precede the third phase where a world leader will come into absolute power. The Mhadi, caliphate, Anti-Christ, the name varies depending on the religion. The transformation of American state run achools from among the best, to among the worse in developing nations, is largely due to the emphasis taken away from acedemics in favor of social engineering this will ensure the weekening of America in order to balance power and bring about the results of the Plan. The way things are brought about in 1984 cannot happen, as human nature will not allow it. The failure of the Soviet Union is an example. It is much easier to manipulate people theough false religion. People will get tired of a political system, but will die for religon. America is unique as it was founded on true \\"religion\\", though false notions have tainted it with evils such as slavery, but true freedom can only survive with true Judeo-Christian values, history has proved, and is proving this point before our eyes today. While history may have been colored in the past, it is being changed in today's books, just like in Oceana..."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book for the first time in high school and found it mildly interesting. I read it again recently and realized what an incredible piece of genius it really is. The other thing I realized is that this book makes perfect sense as a satire of Christianity. Big Brother.

It's as well an essay on the human nature and human condition. It also reminds us that sometimes the cure is worse than the poison. I highly recommended it together withAnimal Farm."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When I began to read 1984, I had my hesitations. In the past I have found that books like this were never really my \\"thing\\". Animal Farm, Slaughter House Five, Fahrenheit 451, and other books of that sort I always found a bit too slow moving for the taste of the average high schooler.Opening up 1984 was a risk for me, if I don't like a book the first time around, I probably never will, but I was pleasantly surprised to find myself sucked into George Orwell's cleverly crafted world of Winston Smith, Big Brother, the Party, and rebellion.Like every great science fiction novel, 1984 takes place in a world where everything is controlled by the government, in this case Big Brother and the party, and free thinking is the worst crime one could commit. We've all read a book or seen a movie about conspiracies with the government controlling every aspect of our lives, and this is definitely the most well done. Everything from the telescreens to the thought police was so believable it almost made me suspicious I was being watched!Not only did the writing make it seem realistic, but the writing was a bit more fast paced than some other \\"classics\\" and it kept me turning the pages. I understand that many classics seem so dull to us high schoolers merely because we don't have the patience for anything we have to think about. I think that 1984 is definitely a better read for high schoolers because it keeps moving and stays interesting but still manages to make you think a bit about the world we live in and it's future.I definitely recommend this book for anyone, even those reluctant teens that don't usually favor books that are published before they were born."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read Animal Farm back in high school, but had not been exposed to Orwells other works, quite good.See these others by Orwell:Animal FarmComing Up For AirBurmese Days"},{"Title":"1984","review":"It's amazing how close this book reflects the Governments of the World today.

A great example of a \\"negative utopia\\" novel. It's message holds true to this day"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Not only is this an unforgettably great story, it's also a presented here beautifully.I had somehow reached the age of 28 without having ever read 1984, and I was struck by not only how poignant the world of Orwell's 1984 is today, but just how gripping the story of Winston Smith is. Orwell's style here is compassionate in its matter-of-factness and poetic in its rigidity, which could not be more fitting for the classic tale of Big Brother, Newspeak, and the Thought Police.A surprise for me was not only how brutal Orwell can be, but also the level of humor present in this text - dark humor, to be sure, but comedy nonetheless. This, again, is very befitting of the famous context in which the narrative is set. In oppressive times, laughter is one of the best defenses we have, and it can sometimes be surprising what seems humorous when we take a step back from the situation.As mentioned, the presentation here is beautiful. This \\"centennial edition\\" by Plume (a division of Penguin Books) is a facsimile of 1984 as it was published in it first edition. The \\"aged\\" look fools the reader into thinking they are handling an old and dear text. The paper quality of both the cover and the pages is excellent as well. Also included is an excellent new introduction by Thomas Pynchon.All in all, a very rewarding literary experience. I can't recommend it highly enough!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"The book 1984 is quite simply one of the best books that I have read, period. The book was written by George Orwell (real name Eric Arthur Blair) short after World War 2. Similar to myself, Orwell fought in a war as a Sergeant for the British Army. According to Orwell that purpose of the book was to \\"to alter other people's idea of the kind of society they should strive after.\\" With that goal in mind, I believe that Orwell did a wonderful job in constructing a society that would definately alter any idea about a totalitarian society.The reader is introduced to Winston Smith who is a citizen in the imaginary super-state of Oceania (present-day Great Britian and the Americas). Under the strict totalitrian rule of Big Brother (the \\"ruler\\" of Oceania) Smith becomes increasingly anxious about \\"being a human being.\\" The novel follows his journey to overthrow life (and government) as he knows it, in his quest to become a human being.In the book, Orwell does a wonderful job of introducing his character and creating the surrealistic world of 1984. One would guess that is characters came from real life experiences as a working class individual under British Imperialism in his homeland of India. Orwell's ability to develop his characters leads the reader to sympathize with (or maybe hate) those in the novel. The characters are nicely placed under the all-seeing \\"Big Brother\\" and the reader does feel this tension throughout the story.The theme of is straight forward, as stated eariler Orwell want to paint a picture of what he believed might become of the different political and social organizations of his day. While the way Orwell presents his thoughts might seem outlandish at first, a through reading of the book does give the reader a erie feeling of the current political situation of America. For example, Orwell discusses the need for war to maintain society:\\"The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of humna labor. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.\\"While the reader may disagree, Orwell understood all to well the function of \\"war\\" in our society. In addition, Orwell discusses \\"classism\\" and other relatively socio-political aspects of government formation in this novel. Within all of the different discussion of these things, Orwell still manages to produce a wonderfully entertaining story.While we have not (in America) reached a totalitarian state, the novel does present an erie allusion to the current state of the world. Nonetheless, I believe that this book is a must read for anyone who loves books. You definately will not be disappointed! Orwell's style makes this book an easy read and a highly intellectual lesson. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength.\\" A statement in 1949 intended for 1984, and reality for us today. Reality can be your own interpretation. In reality who really controls your life? According to George Orwell's classic novel 1984 the thought police and big brother were the ones to control our lives. Big brother is a power structure that regulates not only information, but individual thought and memory.Big brother is not watching. He is singing and dancing. He is pulling rabbits out of a hat. Big brother is busy holding your attention every moment you are awake. He is making sure you are always distracted. He is making sure you are fully absorbed. He is making sure your imagination withers until it is as useful as your appendix. With everyone's imagination useless no one can be a possible threat to your world.The book speaks about control and being a unitary party instead of individuals. It speaks out about the ways of people and their hunger for world domination. I believe that this is his best book written, although his topics are all about human nature and where it takes us in life. Everyone should read this book in order to open your eyes and think for yourself rather then think like the rest of the world."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It is often disputed as to what Eric Blair, under the pen name of George Orwell, was trying to communicate through his now legendary masterpeice, 1984. Some say he was warning the world to the dangers of the Soviet Union and it's totalitarian policies. Some say he was warning governments from allowing power to be shifted over to obscure, bureaucratic oligarchies. Ultimately, I would not enforce any of the above or any other theories an anybody. It's a subjective matter, as is all. But, by the time you emerge from the world Mr. Blair creates around you, you will be certain of the worst a government is capable of. You will have cold shivers, your jaw will drop and you will sit in awe of the appauling, yet frightenly plausible, deeds the \\"Party\\" will go to in order to control the thoughts and memories of it's populace.From simply a literary standpoint, Blair proves himself a writer of the highest caliber. His artful use of syntax draws a graphic image, as well as the ambiance of the book itself. His words flow together perfectly, each one complementing the last. The poignancy of his work does not lie in fast paced action, or \\"edge-of-your-seat\\" thrills, but in total immersion into his world and a glimpse of what could be.Ultimately, this book is worth all the time in the dictionary you will have to spend in order to understand this book fully. It will change the way you look at the world and the way populations allow themselves to be governed. A vital book for anyone in our modern world."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is eerie, almost prophetic. It will take more than one read though to understand it; since each time you read it, you will THINK you understand the point; however, trust me, you dont. This book is by far deeper than other dystopias such as Brave New World, The Chrysallids, and even Animal Farm. Another book i would recommend would be the Picture of Dorian Gray. All who read this have an obligation to set themselves apart from the lost and ignorant and to change the present system we have today, a system where you can only get so rich but those at the top have unlmited access to the world's wealth. This is a system which breeds human to live on the streets, daughters to dishonour thier fathers, and sons to beat their mothers. This system is wrong and cannot sustain itself.

I am a big fan of utopian literature, I found that this book had some deeper, darker elements that more recent novels lacked. It left the reader feeling violated and angry. Angry that today over twenty years after the looming threat of BIG BROTHER has passed we still may be heading down the wrong road. Many people say what is the point of reading a book written in the 1940's and not to mention the infamous 1984 has passed. The date is of little relevence, Orwell meant to warn his readers of a time not to soon to be discarded and not to late to be forgotten. All those individuals who say that 1984 is a waste of time either did not finish the book or are missing some basic human traits. I never am startled by books, I expect rape, murder etc. but 1984 so disturbed me that I begin to look around and see that Orwell's fiction may not be a work of fiction but in a few decades another piece of paper destroyed in the erasing of our pasts. The only reason that I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because I so very much detested the end. The ending is suiting its just too damn suiting. I leave with this haunting refrain that sums up the book...\\"Under the Spreading chestnut tree,I sold you and you sold me.Here lie they and here lie we,Under the spreading chestnut tree.\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"Winston lives in a world of constant survelence and secret police. Truth is what the government says, not what actually happened. According to the \\"facts\\" produced by the government, the country is getting better, but according to memory, the country is getting worse. Society has been brainwashed by fear of its own government and also by incited anger at its enemy country.1984 yields the (very) far extreme of a society that many fear some current societies are headed. Although fiction, it is fascinating to look at certain similar aspects to current societies (again, nowhere near as extreme as the book's society), and is a good book in terms of where we should keep our society from heading. Truly a great read in terms of perspective.The only downside that I took from the book was that I was so bothered by what Winston endured and especially the last 50 pages of the book. Never a regret reading it, but definitely not a \\"happy book.\\" I like my eyes wide open."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I just finished 1984 and was blown away by the final chapter and the book's conclusion. Orwell's brilliant ideas, especially those told through the object of the book (which, in 1984, is in itallics, but I can't write in italics here) The growth of The Party, from the creation of the super nations to the ideas behind the purpose of the war, all are completely and frighteningly believable. The Party, incarnated and personified in the end of the book, is one of the most horrific villains ever, especially durring the scenes between it and Orwell's personification of humanity. Although it took Orwell about a third of the book to set up the whole idea of society under the party, once he has gotten his world set up, he procedes to propel the reader through it with frightening realism and a sad sense of hopelessness.The thing that frightens me most, though, is the question of how correct Orwell might be. Is this where we are heading? While I don't think anything now could be similar to what is in the book: war continues to be an ends to achieve peace (for the most part), not an ends to keep down society, you can't be arrested for a look or thought, and you still can choose to love who you wish, sometimes I see in our society traces of a path to 1984. Perhaps you'll agree with me if you read the book, perhaps not, but I am convinced that, although 1984 has come and gone, it is the end of the path society treds."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Before I had a chance to read this book I read \\"The Giver\\" twice and watched the movie \\"Equilibrium,\\" I'm readily convinced that these ideas were spawned off the book \\"1984.\\" I started hearing about this book from numerous friends as a book they read in high school. I was amazed by the fact that I had never read the book but I think people having sex is something they would want to filter out of people's minds at such a young age.The book started off with a feeling that made you miserable which is a great way to start a book because you have a notion of curiosity that makes you eager to see if the situation gets better. Over the course of the story you delve into the horrific society that kills people for having an independant thought. A downgrade in society if you think about it. I would have never thought evolution could go backwards; however the situations in \\"The Giver\\" and \\"Equilibrium\\" seem more plausible since technology gets better as they go along.The middle of the novel you get even more fascinated by the fact that so much good starts happening and you just cheer on the characters. There is so much tension and you wonder what good will come next and you can't sleep until you finish the next page. Then you finish the book with a mouth dropped open and having strong emotions.I personally hated the ending but that is exactly what the author wants you to feel, hatred like everyone else in this book feels. Some people will applaud at the ending saying it's clever and others might be in deep awe about what just happened.

Orwell had so many twists at the end of the book that made the it worth reading. He flawlessly used foreshadowing to literally make this book. All the twists, if you could pick up on the foreshadowing, wouldn't have come to you as a surprise. But since I took the foreshadowing for something different, what really occured was thrilling!I would suggest suffering through the first many pages to get to the last hundred.

Big brother could be watching (wiretaps with no court order) and if you don't share his view you might end up in room 101 (Guantanamo) as an \\"enemy combatant\\" with no rights.It's a telling story about control and fabrication of information, fear mongering and make believe triumphs (top secret documents, proof of wmd, color label terror alerts, mission accomplished) sounds ridiculous - or maybe not."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.\\"Winston Smith lives in 1984--he thinks. He's actually not sure what year it is, as the Ministry of Truth, the agency he works for as a minor member of the Party, keeps muddying up the records. The past is malleable, the nation is always at war, words are disappearing from the vernacular, everyone is monitored through telecasters, bad thoughts are a crime, and Big Brother is always watching...How have I not read this classic dystopian novel until now? I've poured through Brave New World, started but never finished We, watched THX-1138 and Brazil, and recently finished The Handmaid's Tale, but somehow 1984 has avoided being in my to-read library. Until I finally got my hands on an audiobook version.This book is eye-opening, a bleak picture of the future, a scary nightmarish world where nothing you do is ever private--and in this age of the internet, doesn't that seem even more likely than ever? Throughout the entire book, I couldn't help that feeling that someone was looking over my shoulder, that any moment someone was going to spot me.The characters aren't particularly brilliant, but they function for the exact purpose that Orwell created them: to explore and poke at this world. Winston Smith comes across as your typical 50's sci-fi hero: he is smarter than many of his peers, aware of his surroundings, and discontent. However, he is also incredibly paranoid and a somewhat weak-willed pathetic man (you see this ESPECIALLY at the ending). What I disliked most about him was how he related to Julia. He tended to treat her like she was a sex toy: a person he had sex with regularly but who had limited intelligence and had to be patiently told each detail that the hero can, of course, immediately understand. While this is not as prominent and annoying as, say, Ringworld, it was still present enough that it grated on my nerves.The only other prominent characters are Julia and O'Brien. Julia, as I mentioned above, tended to feel like only a sex bunny; however, she does in a way, incite Winston to embark on a journey that will change his life and is in control of her own world. For that reason, I do have more respect for her than many other females in books of this era. O'Brien is Winston's coworker and possible fellow dissenter. He's an incredibly complex character, mostly seen from Winston's (clouded and highly paranoid) perception.But what makes this novel isn't its characters, as I said above. It's the story, it's the world, it's the warning about what could happen if nothing happens. And this is what impressed me most. This world is startlingly real. The possibility of a diminishing language is scary...how many words am I currently using in this review would be banished by New Speak (kudos to Orwell for all his work on this language, btw)? How is that similar to the text speak that is occurring right now?What about the idea that your television could be recording you, sending your image to some guy, in some cubicle who is making sure you aren't doing anything wrong? That your neighbors could be spying on you, ready to report you at the drop of your hat? That wars are being faked (okay, so many people believe that is already happening...)? That the past can be changed with a pop into MS Word and Photoshop? How about the thought that your entire day is planned out for you, so that you have no alone time for your own thoughts? That writing in a book (or a review...) could be cause for arrest? If that sort of future doesn't scare you, you are much stronger than I am!I really have only two \\"criticisms\\" about this book. The first is the characters/way that women are treated. The characters are fairly bland/stereotypical of the time. Women, similarly, end up on the short end. They are often described as easily led by the Party's ideals and wholeheartedly embracing them. And most of the women we see are sex bunnies or naggy wives.The other criticism is the long sections delving into Goldstein's book. In my opinion, Orwell did a fine job describing this world, so that I really didn't need the Book to explain how this society worked further. The torture scene also somewhat dragged (though this is somewhat more understandable).If you consider yourself a fan of dystopian novels, this needs to be at the top of your reading list. It is a brilliant study of the future, eerie and intimidating.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"1984","review":"So much has been written about Orwell's classic dystopian novel that it is tough to add anything new, many reviewers having offered well-thought of critiques. Orwell's futuristic novel makes one contemplate a world in which various elements of humanity--memories, important events, identities, personalities, family experiences--are rendered obsolete and transparent. 1984's afterword poses a question that is at the core of the novel: \\"can human nature be changed in such a way that man will forget his longing for freedom, for dignity, for love--that is to say, can man forget that he is human?\\", a question that the book's protagonist, Winston Smith, struggles with. Unlike some other dystopians (Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, The Giver, The Hunger Games), which share glimmers of hope for mankind, 1984 is a novel that leaves you shocked, upset, depressed and cold. Reading 1984 is a paranoid, hopeless kind of experience, particularly part three of the novel, but, to apply the oft used expression, it is a \\"cautionary tale\\", a dark parable to what could happen in a society devoid of humanness and ruled by oppressive forces.Orwell uses his main character, Winston, as a scapegoat to this disillusioned society. A sort of everyman, Winston experiences a rush of revolt during early on in the novel during the Two Minutes Hate, where the people stop to decry and lash out against Goldstein, an individual who advocates free speech and liberty. Winston takes measures to silently rebel against The Party: he scribbles thoughts on paper; he ventures outside the district; he buys an \\"ancient\\" relic, a glass piece, a link to the past. Despite his fatalistic attitude that he will eventually be caught and persecuted, he longs for information--and signs--- that will contradict the preachings of Big Brother; he ventures into a pub to engage an old man into a conversation about the world before the revolution, but is frustrated to find that the man only knows meaningless facts about the past. Winston later meets Julia, a woman who he distrusts initially, but comes to trust, as she despises everything about the Party. Winston enjoys the liaisons with Julia, and continues to try to understand more about the past and the possible existence of the Brotherhood. Instincts tell him that O'Brien, a man who works in the department, is the key.Orwell's 1984 is a work that epitomizes futuristic fears of a brainwashed society, evoking emotions on the part of the reader to root for the individual over civilization. As others have noted, 1984 depicts a pessimistic world view with a bleak message. It is, therefore, a bit of a downer to read. However, 1984 is powerful and has redeeming qualities, as evidenced in Winston's valiant struggle and attempt to retain his identity and his hatred for Big Brother; however, we see an inevitable, unalterable conclusion that still leaves us a little bit shaken.Similar to many of you, I was \\"forced\\" to read 1984 in high school; after rereading in college, the book's message was so much more powerful. It's a book that we often have to read, but it is a book that we should read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"There have been some great reviews written on this book. I will keep mine short.This is a true classic. There are probably 10 books in my life that I would give the acclaimed \\"5 star treatment\\" to. This is one. Orwell was way ahead of his time and this book will influence people for generations to come."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I have looked closer into our own current events since I finished this book, and I've found that we are not far off from our own sort of government tyranny, if not already there. It's pages are riddled with very real characteristics of totalitarianism. Should be read by every citizen."},{"Title":"1984","review":"*** Caution -- contains spoilers.***Immediately before I read \\"1984\\", I read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\". I do recommend reading these books back-to-back, and if I hadn't already read \\"Brave New World\\", that would be next on my list.\\"1984\\" chilled me. I've grown up hearing the quote \\"Big Brother is watching you\\" but never fully comprehended the depth and breadth of what that actually meant.Portions of the book ran dry for me, and a tad long on the philosophy. However, just as I thought I'd start skimming, things would pick back up and I'd get involved again with Winston's life and his burgeoning relationship with Julia. I found myself rooting for them to get out, to perhaps join the \\"proles\\", to start and uprising. Keep in mind, I had absolutely NO idea how this story was supposed to end.I had a physical shock when Julia and Winston were discovered. That voice coming out of the wall as I was reading about their quiet interlude literally shocked me to the core. Perhaps deep inside I knew they were destined to be caught, but not in so abrupt a manner! And that, actually, is what's terrifying about the book -- how Winston had been watched for years and years, how he was so easily duped, and how quickly life as he knew it came crashing down around him.Reading about his torture and brain-washing was nauseating, because I can so easily see how that happens even now in prison camps. Seeing how people can break another person, reading about how hopeless a situation can be, how thoughts and memories can so easily be changed -- scary stuff. Some may scoff at that ever happening. But a slippery slope isn't called slippery for nothing.This wasn't necessarily an enjoyable read, but it was a necessary read. Recommended."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I have read everything Orwell has ever penned, even his essays, and this is by far his best piece of work. The efficiency of his prose, the imaginative use of language that has become part of our daily lexicon (how many times have you used the term \\"Big Brother\\"?). This is truly a treasure and a novel that I read at least once a year."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Eric Arthur Blair, under the pen name of George Orwell, wrote 1984 because of his concern of the spread of communism. It is a dark, gothic look at what society could become if the spectre of communism led to totalitarianism. Essentially, it is a more graphic and adult version of his Animal Farm, with people. It is told by a nameless narrator who knows all the goings-on in the world of the future, and follows the life of a middle-aged citizen of Oceania, Winston Smith, who is an employee in the Ministry of Truth.1984 is not plot-driven, nor is it based on character development (these aspects are still present, however). The primary focus of the book is the setting. We are given the world as it could have become in 1984. Of course, we are not in a situation like that, but the threat of such a situation is still present. This differentiates it from other books, although there is never a reason to dislike or fear something new before trying it. Orwell believed it to be the most effective way to explain the world of 1984, and I think it is effective. If the focus were on the characters or the plot, a high proportion of the messages would have to be interpreted, rather than explained in detail. Different interpretations could mean that certain events make no sense, and discussion would be difficult. Some people may have missed some meanings altogether. By explaining his 'apocalyptic' vision of the future in complete detail, Orwell is able to get the entirety of his message to his readers. Orwell is a very articulate and imaginative writer. The world he depicts is divided into three world powers - Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. The Party controls Oceania, the setting of the novel.Big Brother (a parallel to Napoleon from Animal Farm, or Stalin in real life) is at the apex of the social pyramid. He is the father-figure worshiped by the citizens. The Inner Party comprises 2% of the population, and the Outer Party 15%. The remainder consists of the dumb masses, or 'proles'. Any sign of unorthodoxy is dealt with swiftly and harshly by the Thought Police (a parallel to the dogs, the American secret service or Russian KGB). The telescreens that are planted in the walls receive and transmit information simultaneously. The Thought Police use these to keep their citizens under surveillance. Children are turned against their own parents through the use of spy camps and worship of Big Brother. 1984 is partially a look at how easily children can be manipulated and what happens when it goes wrong. Ironically, the people with the least intelligence are given the highest degree of freedom. They do not pose a threat. The chances of an uprising are non-existent because the proles believe anything they are told, and do not take material facts into consideration.Three of the Party's main slogans: 'War is Peace', 'Freedom is Slavery' and 'Ignorance is Strength' are swallowed without question by the majority of the population. The reasons for this, and how the Party pulls it off, are explained in detail later on. The Party was meticulous in its planning. Any totalitarian system requires a scapegoat. In Oceania, it is Emmanuel Goldstein (John Lenin), the subject of the Two Minutes Hate. The Brotherhood is the rebel group that follows Goldstein's teachings, and undermines the Party at any opportunity. The narrator shows us the thoughts that run through Winston's mind, and how he longs for freedom of thought. He meets the book's love interest, Julia, whom he disgusts at first glance and lusts after, due to his own failed marriage and her beauty. She wears a chastity scarf, symbolising her (supposed) contempt for sex, part of the reason for his lust - he believes he can never have her. The message here is the desire for that which is forbidden. He later learns that Julia is a rebel, but in a different way, \\"only from the waist down\\", according to Winston. They find a secret hiding place without a telescreen, and are invited to join the Brotherhood by O'Brien. As it turns out, this is when their troubles truly begin. Orwell describes in detail how the Party came into power, its motives and its true objectives.The full implication and repercussions of these revelations are unfurled in the final riveting part of the novel. However, there are flaws in the exploration of the society. We are not given a sufficient view into the eyes of the older generation that lived through the Revolution. Winston only questions one old prole in a pub, and appeared to give up his inquiry too early. 1984 is a very mature book, and I would only recommend it to people who can grasp similar concepts. If the reader is too young, they may dismiss the book as boring. It may seem so at first, but the novel will make more sense with some thought and, possibly, subsequent readings. If you enjoyed Brave New World, you will enjoy 1984, and even if you didn't, you may still like it. This is a philosopher's book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Don't know how else to say it... One of the best books of all time. Will truly make you think about Big Brother. Are we so far away from this? And he wrote this book way before our time. He was a visionary."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When I started this book I was a bit skeptical that it would hold up to its reputation. I had talked with a few family members/employee's regarding the book and was informed that it was quite dull and boring.I'd have to disagree to the fullest. The book was great. It was one of those rare stories that I connected with the protagonist and really liked and cared about him. There were times when I would find myself thinking how careless and stupid Winston was being. I can imagine that if you didnt like or have a connection with the main character that the book would be rather slow and uneventful. So, if your one of those readers that require optimism to its fullest and happy endings then Id advise that you stay clear."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I have read this one twice.

I want to start off saying everyone needs to read this book. I originally read this on my kindle windows phone app. As you can see it's no longer available electronically. When you read the book you'll understand why they don't want it to be so readily available. Although most of what's happening in todays world is beyond 1984.I ordered & read this three months ago. Then approximately a month ago Amazon deleted it from my phone!!! Totally elligal. They did not refund my money nor did they offer to. Not only did they delete 1984 they deleted ALL my books!!!

Listen to Infowars.com with Alex Jones"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 ia a depressing and frightening book because it has been such an accurate prediction of the future to date. It illustrates the danger, alluded to by Dwight David Eisenhower, of the military industrial complex of a paranoid state running out of control. It seems ludicrous to think of the Ministry of Peace as concerning itself with matters of war until we reflect that in the US the Department of Defense (DoD) was formerly the Department of War (maybe soon the Department of Peace?). Ignorance is strength? Silly? Just look at our public school systems. Peace is War? Impossible??? Afghanistan is the longest war in US history intended to protect the homeland and give us peace and you can tell the current right wing \\"Oceania\\" is chomping at the bit to get us embroiled in Syria, Iran, or North Africa (preferably all of the above simultaneously). Slavery is freedom? No way??? Just watch the masses enthralled by the words of the right wing media not so un-remeniscent of the old news reels from Hitler's Germany. All we need to finish it off right is to have a daily two minute Hate and a Hate Week like in 1984 and we'll be good to go! Yes, Orwell saw it all coming back in 1948. He got one thing wrong though when the protagonist Winston claims the only place you can't be seen is in the dark (he never thought of infra-red cameras and satelites that can read a pack of cigarettes from earth orbit). 1984 is like reading tomorrow's newspaper today. Great piece of literature! The only fault I see is that it was advertised by Amazon as a novel when, in fact, it is a documentary."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I bought this book about 3 weeks ago and I'm still \\"trying\\" to read it. It's depressing and the theme is kind of old, so I'm not that enthusiast with it. I was born abroad and this was not a required reading material while I was in school. I'm just very happy that I've never lived in a place like that. Hope it gets better towards the end."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I was excited about reading \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\". One of Orwell's two best known fictional works (the other being \\"Animal Farm\\"), this is by far more well-known and influential. However, I found \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" to be less engaging as a novel.I guess it's hard not to start off talking about the themes, which at this point are almost inseparable from its cultural influence. It's one of the defining dystopian novels, and is more or less an extension of totalitarianism that existed while Orwell was alive. I think the best way of describing this book is that it's an extension of \\"Animal Farm\\", except from the perspective of someone within the Party. In this world totalitarianism has progressed further.The world-building is, for the better part, believable. Telescreens, Newspeak, doublethink, the Ministries, the Junior Spies, etc, are all well-conceived and realistic within the context of the underlying history. And above all else, the all-encompassing nature of Big Brother looms. (Although there is an exception to this, in the proles.)This comprises a significant portion of the first part of the book. (\\"Nineteen Eighty-Four is divided into three parts.) In combination to this, there's alot of foreshadowing and set-up for later. We get exposed to the protagonist's life, his thoughts about this world, and how he tries to reconcile this with all else he knows. Basically, it's a combination of a character study and a world study. Orwell also takes the time to examine why this society is the way it is.The second part, I feel, is where the real story is. Some of the set-up in the previous part begins to be used, and we're taken through a rather compelling relationship. Looking back, I have some slight issues with believability, but I don't think these hold. At the end we get a big slab of infodumping via the protagonist reading several chapters of a book. This takes up 25-30 pages; the entire part is 100 pages. While this gives background into the history of the world, and I suppose also some of Orwell's personal thoughts, and was also informative, I don't think the length of it was warranted. For me, it detracted from the story at hand.The third and final part was great in some places and flat in others. At times it runs into what is almost a polemic, often with large chunks of flat dialogue. Think of the metaphorical head and sledgehammer. And while other parts were quite engaging and powerful, they were less so because of these large divergences. As with the reading of the book in part II, it's far too long and blunt for my taste. It takes what's already implied, or what would better be expressed through implication, and brings it out into the open. I can't help but compare it to \\"Animal Farm\\", and the restraint Orwell showed there; \\"Animal Farm\\" comes out on top.Orwell's writing is superb, as ever. As in everything else he's done, the writing is clear and precise, and his thoughts are deep, complex and detailed. He describes things in a plain, understated way. However, I still feel that the large sections where Orwell brings everything into the open diminish the rest of the story. The continuous critique of totalitarianism is overwhelming, and as such, in my opinion, undermines the remaining story. Alot of the moments in the book, particularly the last chapter, had the potential to be really powerful, but because this story wasn't the focus of the narrative they end up being far less moving.Basically, if you want to read a treatise against totalitarianism, this book is for you. Personally, I wanted a greater focus on the story that was set-up and then begun in part II. The story being told isn't bad, but it gets lost in the long, unsubtle diversions. If you disagree, I would love to discuss the book in the comments section.3/5"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I think this book is probably one of the most important social commentaries that one can read to this day.To one degree or another, any and all forms of government make use of the kind of tools of cohersion and disinformation described in the gloomiest parts of the book. The book however, centers around the description of what the writer perceives to be the ultimate destiny for any nation that embraces communism. Orwell himself, believed in the ideals that even in its infancy -Socialism- \\"seem\\" so sublime in theory, but ultimately and inevitably end in the total control of information, and abolition of the personal rights of the people, as well as the distruction of individuality in all of its forms. After having fought and bled in battlefields for the said \\"ideals\\", he had a rude awakening from his dream, and had to face the terrible reality of living in such a system, in the soviet union.It is after this crude realization of his blunder, that Orwell pens down this 'must read', devastating slap of the mind.I believe this book is particularly appropriate for the times we live in, when many inAmerica, including some of the most popular politicians, are beginning to flirt with socialism.Weather you take this piece of literarure as a cautionary tale, or simply a deep and engaging piece of reality based fiction, this will surely be one of the most memorable books you ever read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"There are spoilers in my review.Orwell's 1984 is essential reading for any educated American citizen. The brilliance of this work, and the reason that it remains relevant to this day, is that the depictions of the dystopian London seem ridiculous at first, but are actually rehashings of many government practices found State-controlled countries. These depictions contain enough truth in them for us to reflect upon the practices found in our own governments with a cynical eye. In the twenty-first century, the issue of the state asserting its power into personal facets of our lives is more relevant than perhaps thirty years ago. This book has not become dated in the last sixty years, and because its depictions of oppressive state practices have become literary tropes in of themselves, this book will not become dated for quite some time.However, the brilliance of this book lies in the first two chapters. The detailed deceptions of the inner working of the government and the rebellion via love and human interaction end there. The third and last chapter is the weakest. The third chapter acts as a logical extension to the first two. Big Brother first enters your home, and then your love. The last thing left is for him to enter your mind. The problem is that the first two chapters have counterparts (at least in influence) to real life. When you push something to its logical extreme, you always run the risk of losing the feeling of relevancy that comes with sticking to real world analogies. I can't help but feel that the third chapter had somehow left planet earth and was more concerned about the logical extremes that Big Brother would force, rather than exploring life under Big Brother's regime. The first two chapters had just enough truth for us to question the practices of our own government. The last chapter seems to have lost that brilliance and was more focused on giving us an old science-fiction-inspired view of the government controlling our minds."},{"Title":"1984","review":"C,mon, why do you think it's a classic?I will say this, I was glad to have finally read it.

Granted, it's very important that they SHOULD read it, especially at such a young age when there is a chance they can actually grow up to change the world. But let's face it: kids don't care. And they especially don't care about the subject matter when the school cirriculum FORCES them to care. No, no, making kids study this book is a disservice to the book. They simply do not have the life experience behind them to relate to the profundity or symbolism of it.I read this book in the '90s, when I was in high school, and hated it. HATED it. I thought it was sci-fi crap. And had it not been for 9/11 several years later, I likely would never have touched this book again. But in a post-9/11 world, reading this book was literally like reading the newspaper, with Bin Laden personifying O'Brien and Afghanistan and Iraq taking on the roles of Eastasia and Eurasia. 1984 is not a prophecy on the future; it is a report on the past. History simply repeated itself, and will again.9/11 was my generation's Kennedy Assassination in that it was the event that instilled generation-wide doubt in its government. We were idealistic before then.

Winston's job is to erase past defectors of the party, all while promoting Big Brother. Big Brother dumbs down the population by incorporating a national dictionary with words that severely limits any real discourse. The novel is a dystopian masterpiece.

IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH! These are the slogans of the party. Written by George Orwell, 1984 is set in a futuristic London where a totalitarian regime holds all in check. Cameras observe one's movements and telescreens broadcast news flashes with periodic two minutes of hate while monitoring activities and speech. The language of Newspeak is invented to eliminate free thought. None are safe from the grasp of Big Brother. In this classic piece of literature, George Orwell is able to point out the terrors and follies of a rampant totalitarian juggernaut through the eyes of Winston Smith. As a member of the ruling party, Winston conjures thoughts of a revolution from the oppression of Big Brother while fearing the might of the Thought Police, the ultimate institution for eliminating free thought. With Winston's strong desire for the fall of the oppressive totalitarian government imposed by Big Brother, constant fear of the Thought Police and the numerous stories of their late night abductions strike less fear in his heart, for he already thinks of himself as dead.With a detailed narration of Winston's surroundings, actions, and thoughts, Orwell is able to present to the reader the concept of the oppression caused Big Brother and the possibilities of the injustices caused by the tyranny of totalitarian regimes. Winston's contemplative nature is emphasized by his many decisions to fulfill the rebellious fire ignited by a series of observations. Many of his numerous menial observations revolve around the examination of individuals around him, including his future love interest Julia. His rebellious nature, along with his hopeless value for life, forces Winston to take irrational risks such as involvement in a sexual affair with Julia, all done to spite Big Brother and its omniscient oppressive temperamentOrwell's enchanting storyline with numerous plot twists allows the reader not only to enjoy a well written story of a battle against oppression but to experience it first hand through the eyes of Winston. Emotions will run high in this rollercoaster of a novel as readers are forced to turn the page and even question individual thought. This provocative dystopian novel filled an unforgettable chain of events makes George Orwell's 1984 a must read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I believe there are some people--many of whom are artists-- who arrive on this earth to warn us of the future. George Orwell--a Humanistic Socialist--is one of those people. I write in the present tense because although Mr. Orwell has left us, his masterpiece works such as 1984 and Animal Farm, remain, and probably will--as all great artistic works--for a very long time.The warning that 1984 represents is that of impending dystopia--evil in its abject, Senseless, Self-Serving brutality--that threatens to take hold of our human society whenever people become complacent. The question is will we heed the warnings and begin taking responsibility for creating heaven on earth-- or will we wallow in this dangerous complacency and thereby enable the bullies to take over for the sheer love of power?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"It is very difficult, if not impossible to write an original review of a novel that has been as thoroughly examined as '1984'. However it is a novel that has not lost any of its political relevance and thus maintains its power almost 60 years on. The fact that 'Orwellian' is now a recognised word in the English language shows the extent of its influence.What is most notable about this novel is the intensity with which Orwell wrote it. In every single line there is no escape from the surroundings of the protagonists, which makes the reader feel as though they are every bit as much captives of the regime as Winston and Julia. The power of this central idea of an omnipresent and omnipotent government is a power that is unrivalled in literature and possibly cinema also. Although this idea was formed in the aftermath of world war 2 and was based on musings on the potential of facism, the idea of the existence of such a state still terrifies certain sections of the international community.When it comes to political commentary there is no better writer to attack a political ideal than George Orwell. From 'Down and out in Paris and London' to 'Animal Farm' to '1984' and throughout his prolific career. George Orwell always remained one of the 20th century's most formidable political satirists."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is the story of Winston Smith, an unsatisfied member of the party. The party has control over everything--life, death, action, thought, present, past, and future. Winston grows to hate the party, but is able to avoid suspicion. He is a \\"minority of one\\" with his views against the party, but he claims \\"sanity is not statistical.\\" This book is a warning to society today as we are slowly becoming more and more like the world Orwell predicted. In a world where humans have become more like machines, Winston is an endangered species. He is the last of his kind, and alone he is doomed."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I can hardly put it down! It is suspenseful and captivating and written in a way that makes me feel as though I am constantly on the edge of my seat. I did not expect a love story. I did not expect to care. I can't believe this was written in 1949, about a future Orwell envisioned in 35 years. A powerfully sweeping and believable future. (The only thing I keep looking for is email...though it has been pointed out that the Party would not have allowed it.) My favorite line so far: \\"...she had torn her clothes off, and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated.\\" (Are all women capable of such power?)Finished the book, and just keep thinking of how believable a brainwashed society really is... and in many cases parallels some of the ideals we as a people have already swallowed. The final chapters were gripping and brutal and made me wonder if I would do the same.Altogether I feel that this is a very well-written book about a reverse Utopia... A false Utopia? A 'modern society'?I come away with a final thought: If you take away the things that (seem to) make a man human, such as passion and beliefs and love and independent thought... is he still human?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Nineteen Eighty-four is one of those slow starters, but this does not mean it is not enjoyable. This novel takes place in 1984 when the whole western hemisphere (Oceania) is over-taken by Communism. Everything you say and do is monitored by the thought police through telescreens (television screens that have cameras built into them that monitor the place where they are placed). Winston, a man in his thirties who is against Big Brother, decides to secretly do small actions that go against the law, trying to avoid getting caught. One of these things he does is write a journal for the future describing the life now and his thoughts about the situations. During his out-lawful actions, he meets a girl named Julia. Together they commit small crimes and avoid the law. After the first part of the book, the author really gets you into the story and the environment. You feel like you have to be as quiet as possible so is not to get caught by the thought police as Winston and Julia avoid the law. I give this book three stars because though it has a slow start, it is very interesting and fun to read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is a great read, but is also quite disheartening. The society described in the book is inconceivable to some, but it's hard to argue that we aren't moving in that direction. I challenge anyone to disagree after reading this with an open mind.The highlight of the book is a manifesto that the main character, Winston Smith, must read. It shows Orwell's ingenious insight to mankind's role in it's own oppression. I couldn't help but agree with so much of what was said, at the same time realizing how much it seemed to trivialize the work of all civil rights activists.Highly recommended, particularly if you enjoyed stories such as \\"V for Vendetta\\" or movies like &quot;American History X&quot; and \\"The Matrix\\"."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984, written in the late 1940's, is a shocking look at a possible future. This future is one where independant thought is outlawed and &quot;Big Brother&quot; rules over the people of Oceania with an iron fist. One man stands up against this totalitarian government. Can he topple Big Brother, or will he be one who falls? This book really makes the reader THINK while they read. Today, with our ever-expanding government, this future is not a far-fetched possibility. Do not take this book so much as an entertaining novel, but rather as a warning of events to come."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book, first published in 1949, revolves on a couple of lovers, caught with their independent and suspicious brains and memories in the grip of a ruthless totalitarian r&eacute;gime that claims complete control over bodies and minds of its subjects, and considers as a criminal and a crime whomever and whatever does not toe its line. Not only had its author already written about imperialism and totalitarianism, but he had also fought for freedom (Spanish civil war, on the republican side) when he published it. WW2 had recently finished, the cold war was at its beginning and the world had been fully informed about the horrors of Nazi Germany and of the communist Soviet Union. Orwell was one of those Western writers who, though communists, had grown disgruntled with the massive crimes of &quot;real socialism&quot; in the USSR, such as the killing of dozens million people: a feat, against which even the shoah pales. Another one of these writers was Arthur Koestler (&quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;), who however kept to the events in the Soviet Union. Orwell's perspective extends to the whole world in a dismaying prevision; his lucid political and historical analyses, as well as his prophecies on future technological developments from major to minor ones (many of which have been realized), were terrifying. The world was lucky that, eventually, its 1984 did not have to see the forecast of the book, while, indeed, it saw the prelude to the failure and downfall of several of its totalitarian r&eacute;gimes. However, we only have to look around ourselves to realize that the danger still exists, and that the number of people wishful, though not yet powerful enough, to enact it is growing FAST. This book actually is one of the masterpieces of XX century English literature, and should be saved for the future. Whoever calls it &quot;a piece of garbage&quot; can only be either too young and inexperienced, or too ignorant of history and politics."},{"Title":"1984","review":"See? One-line reviews are easy! I think everyone's entitled to offer their opinion of this book without some idiot chiming in condescendingly to enlighten us. And thanks for making the assumption that no one but you knows the difference between totalitarianism and communism -- Such an assumption reveals an over-inflated ego coupled with actual ignorance: Two things that go together quite often!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. It was weird. It was somewhat clever. I especially enjoyed the real-life aspects of the story. (eg. Winston and Julia) N E how, I was slightly disturbed by the communism/socialism factor of Big Bro - Jewish ppl rule in various ways - and this was not one of em. I can't get a mental note of Winston, but I'm sure he was a handsome fella - too bad the lifestyle was so darn crass."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I thought that 1984 was a pretty good book, except that I think it would have been better if I would have read it before 1984. The begining was dull and kind of boring, but I thought that ending was pretty good. I recomend it because it shows what could happen in the future if the government ever got a lot of power."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Do not make the mistake of thinking that Orwell was predicting what might come. He was already aware that Big Brother was here and not so well. Since the publishing of this fine book, BB has perfected his techniques. We are about to relinquish with little fight the last remnants of freedom and privacy our parents once had.I read front page articles of people saying that they don't mind the government opening and reading their mail! &quot;I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.&quot; This is the mentality that leads straight to the gulug or in our case privately owned and operated prisons (the next big franchise business!)In the name of NATIONAL SECURITY we bend over and spread them with trembling fingers. americans no longer should be allowed to refer to themselves as the land of the free and the home of the brave. We are neither!If you want to read a book that is even easier to understand, that connects the dots for you, read How to Save America and the World by Joseph Francione. Or do nothing and wait for your your chains."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is one of those books that I had always meant to read, but never got around to. Finally, one of my college classes required it, so I was happy to pick it up, though not without some reserved skepticism beforehand. I knew it was one of those books that is constantly referred to by people who are paranoid about government and distrust everything the government does, which wouldn't really describe me, in general. But, I have to admit that Orwell's writing is masterful. Right from the start, the world he presents is mesmerizing. I think I am safe in saying that in the first third of the book, almost nothing happens. Yet, I can also say that the first third of the book was just as interesting as any of the action that comes later. Every detail, every description, every movement is analyzed in the most fascinating way. Orwell is no idiot. He has that very rare ability of few great authors to show the workings of the inner mind of man in such a true and believable way that you very well believe that he could look at you and know what you are thinking. After the first third of the book, when the story actually progresses, it gets exciting almost in the way that a thriller does. You keep on wondering what move will be next and how the character is going to strategize the demise of the enemy. Then the last third of the book is a devastating, but still masterful analysis of the human mind, free will, and reality. At almost every stage, Orwell presents his ideas with a written clarity that is a language all in its own. In spite of this whole experience and my recognition at how skillful the writing and analysis was, I cannot say that I liked the book, or even if I would recommend it. The main reason for this is that I believe Orwell cheated at the end. The protagonist was putting up a fight against the machine, and in spite of its all-powerful, seemingly omnipotent status, he held off. Now, Orwell had two options. The protagonist either would capitulate under the increasingly intelligent pressure put on by the oppressor, or he would outlast and maintain his own free will to the end. I think that the ending Orwell chose was contrived, and what he did to get the protagonist there was unbelievable. Maybe it's my own principles or feelings, but I suspect that if Orwell had done it well enough, I would have at least respected his approach. But as it is now, I had to shake my head and say to myself: No. That's not true to human nature. I don't buy that. And what's worse, I felt that Orwell must have known that himself. His writing was too brilliant before, too logical, too well-reasoned. The person who wrote all of that can't possibly believe in this moment either. So, I suspect, that in order to get the ending that he wanted, he contrived the tipping point and then returned to his brilliant form to bring the story to its conclusion. One misstep is a harsh way to judge a truly exemplar book, but I believe that it was a key moment and it unravels all the true elements Orwell had so carefully set up before. Overall, however, it would be difficult to say to not read the book, because this type of writing and insight is difficult to come by. So if you are looking for a meaty intellectual treat, read it. But don't let him cheat you in the end."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book becomes even more topical in light of the events over the past year (those elusive WMDs, your great nation kept in fear with constant terrorist alerts, the latest airport fingerprinting of visitors 'security' measure) and it seems strange to me that people think this book should makes us wary of the evils of communism.I'm totally the opposite, I feel the book gives us a warning of what can happen if you are made to feel fear to the extent that you are prepared to lose that 'freedom' you are rightly so proud of. With the introduction of the Patriot Act (couldn't fail with a name like that, could it?) totally blasting that freedom out of the water, this book has never been more relevant or more scarily real. Yes, it's fiction but considering it was written more than 50 years ago, so many things are actually happening now and we are accepting them because we are 'told' we are in danger and it's for our own protection - the book even has it's very own Bin Laden.It makes it extremely convenient for anyone voicing their disagreement with policy to be silenced under the Patriot Act and not receive any rights whatsoever. Because it's dressed up with a cool name and there's the constant fear of terrorist attack, all of a sudden it's acceptable and what's more, welcome with open arms.If you haven't read this book yet, please read it. It's an eye-opener as to what freedom really is, or was, and far from being depressing, it shows the strength of the human spirit to desparately try to protect what's good and search for the truth."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The book 1984 by George Orwell was a very interesting yet different book. I had read Animal Farm and thought it was decent so I figured why not try 1984. The book takes place in the future in a time when everyone must obey the law. There are hidden telescreens that are around to view anyone who goes against the law. The book was kind of hard to understand at first because of the language but after the first few chapters I was able to slide right through out. I found it to be very enjoyable because I like the science fiction type genre. Also, it was a different kind of science fiction since it wasn't based on aliens; it was based more on futuristic type inventions and the pros and cons that arose. I would definetly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in sci-fi type books. There really isn't a required reading level but it is probably better for advanced middle school readers and high school readers because of the language and topics covered."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is by far one of the best books I have ever read. The whole idea is ingenious. What would be the worst possible life be 25 years from now? It's just incredible and horrific at the same time. The whole idea of the Party is great. Orwell takes almost every tyrannical regime, unfair religious doctrine, corrupted practice and form of government from history and compiles it into one monster power; in hopes of deterring people from following the path, he fears, the world is travelling in towards totalitarianism.The best part of the book is the range and amount of depth there is in each page, just waiting to be picked apart by some curious mind like myself. Though despite all these wonderful qualities, 1984 has some gruesome images so it might not be one of those bedbooks for traditional soccer moms. Overall 1984 is incredibly well written and a history lesson in itself."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In his novel 1984, Orwell confronts the fears of the 1940s that communism would take over the world. Although the issues found in the novel are framed using hyperbole, his overall message carries much significance in our culture today. He confronts issues such as pride, power, domination, and defeat through his description of a dictatorial \\"party\\" lusting for power even to the point of controlling a person's thoughts and emotions.The main character of the novel, Winston, is an ordinary man who is haunted by his distant memory and driven by a suspicion that there is a reality other than the propaganda of the party. He longs to discover the world of friendship, trust, and love of the olden days, which the party has completely erased from all records. But instead, he discovers the cold, harsh, yet bland world in which he exists.My favorite characteristic of Orwell's writing is his use of imagery. This world that he creates seemed vividly real in my mind, and thus emphasized the desperation of Winston's situation. Orwell effectively uses settings that are real today, differing only by the fictional people living there and their actions. Thus the story comes alive for the reader. He also uses many symbols for freedom, encouraging both Winston and the reader with hope in a bleak situation.And finally, Orwell's ingenious mind shines through his work as he displays his intricate idea of what the future would hold. He explains and defends his rationalization, not only through words, but also through the actions of his characters. He ingeniously incorporates these ideas into the fundamental ideas of society, thus creating confusion in the mind of the reader similar to that of his main character.I highly recommend this outstanding novel to anyone who enjoys reading. I personally did not believe that I would enjoy it as much as I did from what I knew of the story line. But, contrary to my expectations, Orwell captivated my imagination through his storytelling. He both challenged me to consider new perspectives on totalitarianism and enthralled me with his methods of writing."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's book is one of those masterpieces that are not only entertaining but are also educational. Author's ideas have many references to Marxism, Stalinism and Fascism. Orwell himself said that he wrote the book after watching political trends around the globe. Many could also find similarities to the Foucault's biopower or Baudrillard's simulacrum. The book depicts life in the totalitarian regime where government not only has control over your physical body but also over your mind. I am not sure if we can compare this book to today's political situation although there are plenty of interesting predictions that are in some way prophetic. For example book describes how the government used war to create fear and fanaticism in it's individuals. How the hatred was inspired by selecting various targets in the form of enemies which could either be real or imaginary but nevertheless provided good basis for manipulating the minds of people. The book is both a science fiction and at the same time a social analysis of modern political atmoshpere. Government of 1984 motives for power was simply power in itself. I don't believe such motive will cause you to destroy human nature within your society to establish control. After all such control is analogous to farmers control over cattle which don't possess free will and are under total influence of its owner. Why would a government choose to control a mindless body of individuals, zombies that offer no interesting input to society. There must always be a degree of freedom in order for creativity to exist and progress endure. Without any channels present where individuals can let their steam out such systems will collapse on itself since members will become oblivious to the world they live in. The book mentions that government wanted to destroy human nature but in doing so it destroys the very thing that it governs. Anyway the book is a great food for thought and allows a reader many insights into modern day politics and mind set. Anyone even remotely interested in science fiction or politics or just looking for something intellectual should read it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is very likely the most important political novel of all time. George Orwell's classic essentially seeks to portray life in what amounts to the ultimate totalitarian state. The most terrifying thing about the novel is that nothing in it is at all far-fetched. Other totalitarian states have approached Orwell's \\"Oceania\\" in the thoroughness of their oppression and the ruthlessness of their grip on power. Soviet Russia, Maoist China, and Nazi Germany all come to mind, and all shared many traits with Orwell's fictional tyranny. In 1984 Orwell describes precisely how the ultimate totalitarian state would operate, what life under it would be like, and why it might never be possible for human beings to overthrow it.The novel shows life through the eyes of one individual, Winston Smith, a citizen of Oceania, living in Britain, now renamed \\"Airstrip One.\\" Life in Oceania is unspeakably bleak, with even most of the elite living at or near the poverty line. Shortages of everything are the norm, as the government controls all aspects of the economy with no free market even dreamed of. Love is forbidden other than love of the \\"Party\\" and \\"Big Brother,\\" the Party's leader. Loyalty to the Party is enforced by the Thought Police, whose job is to ferret out anyone who does not conform to the requirements of fealty and single-minded devotedness to the Party. Since Winston is such a one, in the novel he is in trouble. By the way, despite being a political novel intended to make a point, 1984 is also a very readable story in its own right. Orwell's prose is excellent, and the storyline moves along briskly. This is a very dark story, however, with suffering characters and an unspeakably bleak outlook. Part of this is said to be reflective of the fact that Orwell himself was in failing health when he wrote the novel. In any case, this is not an uplifting novel, for all its importance. The theme of the novel is more or less summarized when a Party leader explains to Winston that the image of the world for the rest of all time, may be summarized as a booted foot stomping on a human face.1984 has had a powerful effect on Western political thought, as a warning about the effects of giving government too much power. Concepts such as the \\"Thought Police,\\" \\"Doublethink\\" and other artifacts of the novel have passed into common usage and political discussion. This is a very important novel that shows what could happen to mankind if we fail to nurture and cherish liberty and freedom, and instead allow government to dominate our lives."},{"Title":"1984","review":"More or less, most things that could be said about this book, have been. So, I'm going to limit it to an interesting coincedence that I found between 1984 and current day America. The coincedence is that between Goldstein's \\"The Book\\"(a \\"history\\" & sociology text on the party systems/countries in 1984) and modern political books. I'm referring to the glut of books on the market these days like Franken's and Coulter's and Savage's and on and on. The scary thing to me about The Book is Winston's reaction to it. He reads it, finds his views validated, and then, ego sated, he goes to sleep and thusly delivers himself into the hands of the Thought Police. Modern political rantings seem to have a similar soporific effect on many people. They buy a book that they know they will agree to a high degree with, read it, congratulate themselves on being active, and then fall to even greater passivity. All one has to do is compare the sales figures of political books to voter turnout on both ends of the spectrum, and you'll see what I mean. Don't get me wrong, I don't believe that everyone is this way, but I've seen enough of it to catch my attention. This seems to be the real lesson to me, that most people will become sheep if their basic needs are met while they are simultaneously kept under a wet blanket of fear & suspicion. Most people in the world of 1984 simply needed security and food, while Winston and Julia required varying degrees of manufactured rebellion and love/sex before they were comfortable enough to surrender."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This story is based on a futuristic form of government mostly based on the ideals of a communist government but taken to an extreme. Many would argue that if our own government is allowed to intrude in to our private lives through vehicles such as the \\"Patriot Act\\", we will continue to lose personal freedoms, and find ourselves in a 1984 situation. This book describes a world controlled with fear and kept clean and neat by the brain washed population. All have been blinded by the shadows of big brother and kept there by an enormous army ready and willing to die for their cause. George Orwell the author of 1984 and \\"Animal Farm\\" displays in both books how a society controlled by a totalitarian form of government oppresses the people iti is supposed to govern. If we allow the government to take away our freedoms in the name of fighting terrorism, \\"big brother\\" will be here. I enjoyed the way Orwell described the people as nothing but brain washed zombies mindless and more than willing to follow without question. The book shows how easy it is for a government to lie to its people, and manipulate them. This book speaks a lot of truth and that's like a cold bucket of water in the face in the middle of a warm slow peaceful dream. The way he hits you with the truth of what could happen if a government is allowed to ru amock. This book should be required reading for all freedom loving Americans. Overall this book was an absolute delight to read it was interesting and suspenseful."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Like most kids, I was forced to read 1984 in high school. Like other books I was forced to read, I was predisposed to dislike it. Compelled reading is rarely fun - especially when the book has a \\"message.\\" Coming back to 1984 all these years later, I am struck not only by how spot-on Orwell is in his analysis of human society, but what a good read the book is in its own right.There is a tendency to be snobbish in literature. 1984 CAN'T be a science fiction book because science fiction books are trash. 1984 is not trash, therefore it is not science fiction. This is Orwell's principal of \\"doublethink\\" in action. Not only is 1984 science fiction, it is the best dystopian novel ever written (I would place Fahrenheit 451 in second place - something about books with numbers in the title). Orwell vividly creates a nightmare vision of the future more realistic than anything we've seen before. The future in London does not look advanced because technology has stopped. The telescreens are the only omnipresent gadget. Instead London looks like what it is - a destroyed Victorian England.It is hard to come to 1984 fresh because so many of the terms Orwell invents have become iconic: Big Brother (is watching you), Three Minutes Hate, Doublethink, Newspeak, Thoughtcrime, The Thought Police, and Room 101. I won't go so far as to say that 1984 is coming true - in many ways, humanity is going in the opposite direction - but it is unsettling how many things are coming true. Are there not TV screens everywhere and don't they watch us as much as we watch them. Revisionist historians are all around and, as the Party says, \\"who controls the present, controls the past.\\" Is modern politics possible at all without Newspeak and Doublethink? In Iraq, until recently, it was the face of Sadam Hussein that was everywhere watching everyone and that face bears a remarkable resemblance to Big Brother.It's easy to equate the Party in 1984 with our current government, but I think that is a bit too simplistic. What makes Orwell more than merely a liberal is his pessimism about everyone. \\"The only reason for power is power.\\" It doesn't matter who is in control - it is all doublethink. What makes 1984 truly great is that we are not given a happy ending. Orwell is not a humanist - humanity doesn't stand a chance against the Party. Instead, our vision of the future is \\"a boot stepping on a human face-forever.\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"Brandon Alspaugh's review is by far the most intelligent of all the reviews, but he really missed the point. In 1945, Orwell saw the signs of things to come. He was not a prophet in the sense of the Old Testament prophets but a man who could relate seemingly unrelated things, what we used to call prescient. 1984 was a year arbitrarily chosen. Of course, some things had come true by 1984, and others had not and never would. One big mistake Orwell made was to make Big Brother an appendage of the government. Alspaugh is exactly right that Big Brother is the media. He's a little skewed in leaving out the rest of the media and concentrating on Fox, but he has the idea. The chief notion of the book is embodied in the character of Winston Smith and his occupation, which is the rewriting of history. As an historian, I am vividly aware of how much history has been rewritten in the past half century by the revisionists. But we may yet escape the world of 1984. There is in the making a rebellion of the proles. They are beginning to object to themanipulation of facts by the media. There are some things the proles know, and they will not accept alternative &quot;facts.&quot; Odd, isn't it, that the folks who think for themselves these days are not the most educated class?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Imagine if the only thing you had control over, or owned was your mind? But, even that has limitations. You are not given the freedom to love, learn, or think of yourself. You lived your life in constant fear, knowing that Big Brother was always watching you. This is Winston's prison. But Winston was a \\"freethinker\\" - he wants to find out what life was like before the Revolution. He is willing to risk being \\"vaporized\\" to find the truth. This book is a classic, but the story is amazing - the strength to risk everything to find the truth and learn to love."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Thanks so much, the book was in great condition and came soooo fast I really appreciate it!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"The 'big brother' world of 1984 as imagined by George Orwell has only become more frightening with the passage of time. The Patriot Act, Guantanamo Bay, and the erosion of privacy in the last 10 years have all smacked of totalitarianism of the ilk presented in this science fiction classic. It's not very hard to foresee the logical conclusions of sacrificing freedom for safety. Benjamin Franklin said it best:\\"Any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both.\\"Politics aside, this is a book that has aged gracefully thanks to its excellent prose and themes that are as salient today as they were post WWII. This is a novel that still stands as one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written. Should be required reading in High Schools everywhere."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The views expressed in the book 1984 are very unique and yet still relate to today. The story shown in the book accurately portrays the needs of the people and how they will never be met in the face of an oppressive government. It paints a clear yet disturbing picture that must be experienced. Very good read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Often cited by many as a central text in the fashion of twentieth-century dystopias, 1984 remains a classic in spite of its inextricable connection to Soviet-style communism. While the work does not have the sociological poignancy of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, 1984 does remain a telling oracle of the psychological tendencies which could destroy the human soul even in the post-Soviet world. While the text only cursorily treats the rise of the zeitgeist, one can easily glean several dangers which are oracularly pronounced by the narrative.First of all (and most obviously), there is the danger of a lack of human questioning which, given enough coaxing and time, can render man nearly impervious to the spirit of questioning which is necessary to prevent the enslavement of man. While this condition is basically taken a priori by Orwell as a setting for his work, this is the closest point of contact between 1984 Bradbury's aforementioned work. Additionally, the psychological ramifications of breaking free from such thralldom take two distinct paths, that of hope for change (even if that becomes somewhat mitigated into the hope for change in an indistinct future) and one of self-indulgence in the midst of an unchangeable zeitgeist. These, coupled with the final realization of hope which is found (albeit meekly) in the lower, ignored (and therefore free) class, are the true content of 1984.While the text is markedly tied to the state of affairs found in a state of established Soviet-style communism, it also narrates the psychological situations (and outer-methods of psychological suppression and control) which still remain poignant to a Western society which is on the brink of destroying its own notion of liberty. For this reason, I can easily overcome the misgivings which I have for the text's nearly direct connection to already-dead Soviet Union. The message does indeed exist beyond that historical fact and therefore comes with my personal recommendation."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Not too long ago, I read an author's account of his trip to North Korea. While there he gave a copy of 1984 to a citizen he was temporarily working with. This North Korean worker took it home to read and then hurriedly returned it the next day. A book like that could get him killed, just like 'the book' in 1984 could do the same to the main character, Winston.It doesn't take much time for a society to fall into a dictatorship or a communist regime. We've seen this happen throughout history, even to once democratic societies. 1984 is a fitting read for our time. It is a warning to all free societies; this could happen to you! It is very easy and disconcerting, to see the similarities in Winston's 'Big Brother' and our own governments. Big Brother has 'Newspeak'. We have 'Political Correctness'. Big Brother has 'Doublethink' and we have conflicting thoughts that are upheld as well; Racism is bad: we cannot discriminate in hiring employees on the basis of their skin color. Racism is good: we should discriminate in hiring employees on the basis of their skin color (racial hiring quotas active in the USA now: Hiring dark-skinned folks is good. Hiring light skinned-folks is bad). There are too many examples of current Newspeak and Doublethink to list in this review. Also there's 'Big Brother'. In the UK there are surveillance cameras popping up everywhere. On these cameras are speakers that the observer can blast orders through 'Stop riding your bike on the sidewalk!' is just one camera-rebuke that I heard about from a UK paper. This parallels with the telescreens in Winston's world which blast rebukes at the slightest offenses 'Sit on the bench! Hands in your lap! No talking!' and etc... Is this really a better world to live in? What gives the man or lady behind the camera the right to bark orders at the man minding his own business on the street? These questions and much more will surface as you read this intellectually stimulating book.In conclusion, I believe '1984' is a must-read for everyone. However, there are some sleazy moments in this book which I found unnecessary to the book's message. Because of this I believe this book wouldn't be appropriate for anyone under the age of 16 (this also depends on the maturity level of the 16 year old). Also, the message of '1984' would probably fly right over the head of a child; one must have a decent understanding of history before reading it. Therefore, I do not recommend this classic for children, but instead for mature teens and up."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Although 1984 has come and gone, this book is still just as plausible and important as ever, if not more so. Orwell writes about a future British police state in which Big Brother (the government) is always watching your every move. Winston, the main character, innocently tries to learn the truth behind his government's lies only to find that he might have been better off remaining ignorant. What's particularly disquieting about this book is that we still see aspects of this dystopian society appearing in our world today. As technology improves, government and businesses have more and more opportunities to monitor what people are thinking and doing. After reading this book, you can't help but question anything said by the government. This is absolutely my favorite book, the best of science fiction and a classic as well."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I first read this book in high school in 1974.

Never has a story angered me so much. Never have I felt so livid towards a set of characters. Never have I felt so utterly depressed, hopeless, and betrayed. All of this, of course, can only mean one thing. It's the greatest book I have ever read in my life. The truths are so beautifully structured that it brings one to tears. There's no doubt that Mr. Orwell could have been the most miserably, bitter, and lonely SOB to ever walk the face of the Earth. No, much of this book did in fact turn out to be fiction, but I take little comfort in that. There's still just enough truth in it about the human condition to make me want to step into the bathroom and slit my wrists.Yes ... oh yes! EVERYBODY NEEDS TO READ THIS BOOK. This is what we are folks. This is human nature. It may not have happened yet, but the race is young. How much time do we have? Another hundred ... two hundred years? Our only hope, I think, is that maybe a huge asteroid will hit the earth and destroy the entire planet before the year 2050. That's my hope, because after reading this book, quite frankly, I no longer have any hope in anything else.Travis"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a book based on the main character Winston Smith.

This book is a pretty easy read and it really gets you thinking about some things. What if something like this ever happend?

While Communism isn't exactly the &quot;threat&quot; that it was when Orwell was writing this, the topic is still potent to today's society because it's all about power, and what better topic to represent society when the control of the government is rocking back and forth between the Democrats and Republicans? The book has one vice, and that is the rambling. Take my advice, do not read all of Emmanuel Goldstein's &quot;The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism.&quot; It will only bog you down, and most of it is unnecessary to the plot. The first few pages of it give you a clear picture of where and who Oceania is and is composed of, respectively. It will also give some info about Eastasia and Eurasia, but otherwise, just skim. Otherwise, the book is fascinating, vivid, and mind-bogglingly poignant. Do yourself a favor and read it, for your English class, if nothing else."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is probably the best book I read... Although it was a bit repetitive in the middle, the plot kicked in. It was pretty frightening, since many things that happen in the world today also happened in the book. The way that the government worked in the book was through fear and torture. They manipulated the way everyone thought by telling them what to think (much like children are told to finish their meals) but then torturing them if they disagree. If you read this book, you may feel like you are actually there, and maybe get frightened too.I recommend 1984 to everyone!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"1984\\" is a book which perhaps needs no introduction. It is a dreadful, dreary tome which evokes the very nature of despair in the attentive reader who is also aware of how close civilization teeters near Orwell's fictional precipice. In a very real sense, George Orwell futuristic view of a world dominated by three superpowers perpetually at war is actually a treatise on the destruction of an individual's soul.Winston Smith is a lonely man employed by the nation of Oceania's Ministry of Truth. His job is largely the correction of documents which were written incorrectly; i.e., have information pertinent to the doings of a person who does not exist--or rather, a person who does not exist anymore and who the government wishes to phase out of existence altogether, past, present, and future. The what of this job is making someone an unperson, a concept which is both noun and verb.Citizens are always watched and closely monitored by Big Brother, an omnipresent, omniscient representation of the Party leader. Even dissenting thoughts, thoughtcrime, are punishable offenses. Winston Smith is cursed with an above-average intellect and ability to remember things...such as, in direct opposition to Party rhetoric, Oceania has NOT in fact always been at war with Eurasia (one of the other three superpowers). This, slowly, eats into his psyche until he commits two grand offenses contradictory to Party dogma: he falls in love and rales against Big Brother's dictates in his own mind. These two acts of resistance set the stage for the book's climax where Winston's status of plebian worker bee versus enlightened man will be ultimately decided.This book, in the vein of \\"Darkness at Noon\\", not only explores the idea of life under a totalitarian government, but also how persons of power, through threat, force, intimidation, logic, or seduction are able to literally change one's thinking. Manipulation of thought, as suggested by these two books, is simple for a dedicated, organized, and powerful entity to accomplish, as all human's beliefs are essentially as malleable as gold, though less valuable. This idea is the real heart of \\"1984\\", while the futuristic environment, Newspeak, and illustrations of single Party influence are only interesting backdrops. Manipulation of an individual's thought, even as these new beliefs contradict old beliefs or even known reality, constitutes the destruction of the individual's soul.*spoiler*The 20-30 page interrogation of Winston Smith in the final portion of the book shows, through vivid dialogue and Smith's own internal monologue, our protagonist's gradual acceptance of Big Brother's truth as his own. In Soviet Russia, before a dissenter's execution, it was important to the Party that one publically announce all one's \\"crimes.\\" In George Orwell's \\"1984\\", Big Brother wants much more...he wants you to believe what you are saying as you publically renounce yourself and admit your crimes. The interrogation and oft-borrowed \\"Room #101\\" scenes are some of the finest writing in modern literature.*end spoiler*\\"1984\\" is a must-read for everyone on Earth. Once we realize how truly easy it is for organized groups or charismatic individuals to get us to believe virtually anything they want us to believe, we will finally become more careful about what we \\"know\\" as \\"fact\\".As an aside: this book is often placed in the same category as Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World.\\" I am extremely familiar with both books and personally believe that grouping them together is similar to saying that \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" and \\"The Island\\" should be grouped together simply because they both have the word \\"island\\" within their title. \\"Brave New World\\", while not valueless, is a markedly inferior book to \\"1984\\", almost juvenille in it's depictions of social isolation of the quasi-protagonistic \\"Outsider\\" and in the protrayal of future life in the ethically-challenged, biologically-dictated caste structure of Huxley's future vision. Spare a moment to read \\"Brave New World\\", but group it not into Winston Smith's dire future world."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When I was an undergraduate at UCLA many years ago it was fashionable to compare and contrast the two famous dystopian novels, 1984 by George Orwell and the earlier Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Orwell was writing in reaction to communism with which he had become disillusioned while Huxley wrote in reaction to eugenics and the classical conditioning ideas derived from Pavlov and the behaviorists.Which novel more realistically predicted the future? Which one gave a better critique of the world at the time of its writing? Which novel was more fun to read? All science fiction is grounded in the present of course and reflects to a lesser or greater degree not only the author's extrapolations from that present but his or her understanding of the world in which we live.Orwell wrote 1984 in 1948. His was not strictly intended as a prediction of any kind but a warning. We thought of it as a prediction though, and in the mid-sixties when I was at UCLA there was a tendency to favor Huxley since 1984 was less than a generation away and it didn't look like the dreary hell of Oceania and the thought police had any chance of materializing that soon. Clearly the feel good, feelie, drug-infused mindlessness of Brave New World was much more likely even if probably much more than a generation away.So we decided Huxley had more realistically predicted the future (great seers that we were). But as to which one gave a better critique of the present, we were in agreement: it was Orwell's 1984. Not that we personally, as privileged members of the great American middle class had been reduced to drinking victory gin and going to rallies for two minutes of hate or had girl friends who were members of the Anti-Sex League. What we knew though was that a football rally, with just a little malevolent direction, could easily turn into a hate rally; and the Big Brother of Oceania was not at all that different in some respects from the Johnson administration that had (we believed) killed Kennedy and was now engaged in a senseless war in Vietnam from which we were spared as long as we maintained our college deferments. Orwell's idea that by reducing the words that one could legally speak, by a government imposed reduction in vocabulary through Newspeak, and by an indoctrination of our thoughts through the enforced concept of \\"thoughtcrime,\\" and by maintaining a constant state of war from without, the populace could be controlled--this was something that seemed so very true. We had only to witness the relatively recent examples of what had happened in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The twentieth century was indeed the century of totalitarianism, and although it did not seem to affect us now, with flower children in the streets and free love and doobies on our waterbeds, it was clear that the danger was there lurking in the distance.Furthermore we greatly identified with the secret and illegal tryst of Winston and Julia, who like us, stole hours away from Big Brother (actually we stole them away from parental authority) to meet and make forbidden love. But what I think really sold us on the psychological truth of 1984 and shocked us greatly were the rats about Winston's face that forced him to betray the only love of his life and in doing so lose his humanity and whatever smidgin of self-respect he had left. In other words what we saw was the overwhelming power of torture to completely subdue, and as it eventually happened, transform the vital human being into some kind of compliant animal filled with fear and the wretched worship of brute, physical power--humans reduced to defeated creatures glued to the telescreen, smoking government issue cigarettes, drinking government issue gin and cheering government issue soldiers on to the slaughter of distant, hated peoples, while all the while over every vacant space on a wall or billboard was pasted not the Marlboro Man but the face of Big Brother whom the populous had come to love as a beaten dog might love the sadistic human that beats it.As to which novel was more fun to read it was a tossup and depended on your personal choice of genre. Those who preferred horror to fantasy chose 1984. Those who could take some secret delight in soma and free sex and in the security of knowing who you were in the stratification of society, chose Brave New World. A consensus view was that if you were a history or a poli sci major you tended to prefer Orwell's vision; and if you were a psych major, Huxley's.One of the unanswered questions about 1984 is whether it really is possible to reduce the human ability to think by restricting vocabulary and distorting history. If some words are not allowed to exist and if history is constantly erased and rewritten in order to conform to the current party line, is it not true that we will more and more lose our ability to think independently and become more and more like cogs in a great repressive social/political machine?Final thought: what would Orwell have made of the possibilities of the Internet to enslave the populace?--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"Being the 1231st person to review Orwell's classic, I doubt there is much I can say that hasn't been said already. Then I will simply say that this is the best book I have ever read. I never read for pleasure until I picked this up and started reading. Then, I was hooked. Since then I've been a certifiable bookworm and have rediscovered the power of reading.And you should read it, for Orwell's classic has seeped into popular culture, from the \\"1984\\" Macintosh commercial, to the constant accusations of Orwellian abuses of power by our sanctimonious politicians. Read this book and see what they're talking about. And, despite some people's beliefs that traffic light cameras, security cameras, and wiretapping of terrorists is the start of a precipitous descent toward \\"1984,\\" I thank my lucky stars that we live in a free society. I cringe to think of what life must have been like in Stalinist Russia, where \\"1984\\" was much closer to a reality."},{"Title":"1984","review":"There are only two type of people in the world. Those who have read 1984, and those that should. That's all the recommendation I'm going to give, as either you've heard of this book or there's no hope for you at all. Buy it, borrow it, steal it ... whatever it takes, all thinking people owe it to themselves to experience Orwell's classic.So I'm not going to summarize the book, it's that much of a classic. If you don't have some dim idea of what Big Brother represents, my review isn't going to help you. Instead, I want to talk about my impressions, my ideas, and my thoughts about this amazing vision.I think that Orwell's book is gaining more relevance in the modern American world, and that's a really frightening thought. We live in an age of the Patriot act, which allows the government to monitor its citizens in what they do, allowing unprecedented access to private information. Yet, what is a patriot? An individual who performs exempliary service to their govenment as an ideal ... yet, the first patriots were criminals. They were hunted for rebellion or for spreading harmful propaganda against the British monarchy. Now we have a government that could theoretically punish 'patriots', yet calls up images of protection and defense ... I don't know about you, but that sounds like doublethink to me.We live in the age of newspeak. Police actions instead of wars, government jargon instead of truth ... decidedly, we have been so blindsided by the new language of the administration that it is hard to understand just what is meant by what they say. And this has been the truth of all administrations since early in this century. Not a new thing, but it is getting worse. All jargon does is obscure the truth. With the fog of langauge separating reality from speech, honesty becomes impossible.Autonomy is dead. Individuals cannot operate in our society. It has been set up that only groups and parties can exist, and individuals are drown out in the voices of larger parties. People are given their say, and that say is to continue their slavery. People as a society do not know how to shrug off the status quo. Thus, democracy does not know how to shrug off the status quo. The people don't know what's good for them, and that creates the situation of 1984. There is a simple truth ... if people didn't want to be oppressed, they wouldn't be. The public is too many, the oppressors too few, but democracy rules and we are oppressed because we allow ourselves to be. The future is in the proles, but the situation is still the same, and they do nothing.And what solution does Orwell give us? A possible awakening of the proles years and years from now, maybe. But other than that, there seems to be no end to the trap. Indeed, I think the only freedom is that offered not by Orwell, but by Huxley in Brave New World. But that's a story for another day ...I urge you to read this book, and above all to think about it, and form your own opinions. Because individualism is the only freedom we have left. And to give it up is to become the enemy of all intelligence, freedom, and hope."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is an excellent book that really makes you question the type of a world you live in. You will question your own existence, and what you stand for and represent. For those of you who have thought that you live in a \\"free society\\"..think again! This is a book for you to read and tell me Are you really FREE?To me, it was amazing to see that Orwell had the foresight to capture what the world would be like...and when you read this book you realize that we are heading more and more towards the way he thought the future would be.What I will always remember about this book:\\"War is Peace,Freedom is Slavery,Ignorance is Strength\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is one of those books you're supposed to read in school, the kind that all the weird, geeky kids with Chuck Taylor All Stars and too much acne read while ranting about The Man. It's a well-known manifesto of those playing at anti-government, anti-establishment, brandishing about their membership cards for the Society for Creative Anarchy. This isn't for the kids that read trashy romances or pulp novels: it's not for the Collins, Grisham, Crichton, or Clancy fans out there, and it's definitely not something a Harry Potter kid is going to pick up in a few years. 1984 is depressing, it's dark, and as most devotes will tell you, it's happening right now. After all, this is the book that defines what \\"Orwellian\\" means-a word so specific in its meaning, even a spin doctor being interviewed on The Daily Show couldn't put it in a positive light.Considering my choices of literature, it probably comes as some surprise that this is only the second time I've read this book, and really I wouldn't have even been motivated to do so if I hadn't picked up a copy of the movie version of 1984 on DVD. I read the book back when I was a senior in high school-this and Metamorphosis were two works that the teachers at my otherwise fine high school just couldn't be assed having us read. I protested after reading both books myself between Junior and Senior year, and in the end talked the English literature teacher into allowing me to teach \\"The Hunger Artist\\" but it was a rather one-sided compromise, especially when you look at recent statistics. According to one report, the majority of students do not understand or value the first amendment, think that freedom of speech is too unrestricted, that the press has too much say, and that in effect, Americans are too free.It is in this environment that 1984 is more relevant than ever. Look at the National ID cards passed last week without the main media outlets blinking an eye or raising a voice. (Dan Rather, oh distrustful ally of the anti-Bush liberals and libertarians, where are you now!?) In a world where we can go from being at war with Afghanistan to Iraq in the blink of an eye (Er, I mean, we were never at war with Afghanistan. We've always been at war with Iraq. We were never not at war with Iraq. Big Brother Bush says so) and where September 11th is brandished about like a giant banner to take away every freedom known to man, the only difference between the Republicans and Ingsoc is the extent of power and religiosity. While Bush follows a god only he can hear (and really, isn't that signs of a mental disorder, having an imaginary friend that only you can hear that tells you to do things and then acting on that friend's word?) he has yet to understand that to captivate all power, he needs to be God.Of course, the United States isn't the only country with gross miscarriages of justice and invasion of privacy. In addition to China's censorship of the internet, the uniting of England with the US against the unifying European Union (read: Eurasia), there's the almost-but-not-quite-telescreen announcement system in Japan known as \\"The Box\\" to some residents and \\"Off Box\\" to others. Technology was meant to make our lives easier, but as Orwell predicted, it is only being used to impose class systems more rigid than they were fifty-years ago.On the way home from work on Wednesday, David and I were walking past Hyde town hall when we heard the bell begin to chime. He mentioned to me that the bell was given to the town by Joshua Bradley, an Industrialist and self-made man who worked his way up from a mill worker to owner. Rags to riches, the kind of JP Morgan and Andrew Carnegie American dream where hard work pays off if you pull yourself up by the bootstraps and put your axe to the grindstone-it doesn't exist in twenty-first century America. Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Richard Branson: they were born into the world they've simply modified. There was never a chance they'd be a factory worker somewhere, watching over robots as computers were assembled or working as a flight or train attendant. Donald Trump was never going to be a bartender in a casino. They were born into their class and remained there, entrenched in their wealth.In the past, this would have sent up a cry through the students and middle classes, charging the revolutionary-minded among us to action, to take our piece of the pie, to work harder. Instead, we see lawsuit after lawsuit as people who feel they deserve something for nothing become litigious instead of industrious while the rest go on with the drudgery of the world in which they live. We've become sedated by our technology, dependant on mass media and the Internet for our information. How many Americans first believed we were going to war with Iraq because of Weapons of Mass Destruction? How many people still believe that? More importantly, how many of those Americans still believe Saddam Hussain was responsible for 9/11? How many media outlets bother pointing this out?In the end, we have to look back at Orwell and realize that he knew this. He saw it all happening, saw where we were going, and gave us a picture of a world in the not-to-distant future that is depressing, bleak, and immanent. His book is more important than ever, and if you cannot believe it, take a look at the film version of the book. Admittedly, it was four years after reading the book for the first time that I happened upon the movie, so my memory of the book was foggy at best. So I picked it up and watched it with some skepticism. Surely, so much of that was changed to meet modern standards. Surely, as it is with Hollywood, the only thing it had in common with the book was the title and characters. It was for this reason I put 1984 on my list of books to read-to see how much had been changed. And to my surprise, not much is different at all, to the point that I could see scenes in my mind not because the movie colored my perception (as the film version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest did, so that reading the book is nearly impossible) but because it was so accurate.In the end, there was no need for them to change, modernize, or update 1984 because it was spot-on. This is a book that is too important to change, and far to relevant to be relegated to dusty bookshelves in the unused school libraries of the United States, or anywhere else in the world for that matter. It is a book that needs to be read, not banned as it has been in some places. If you didn't read this in school, I urge-no, implore-you to read it now. Even if you did read it in school, a good re-read is always enjoyable and considering the way technology and government are evolving, there's no better or more pertinent time than now."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell wanted to warn his readers about the danger of totalitarian regimes. The promises of the fascist and nazi ideologies had misled millions and thrown the world into the ravages of the second world war. Stalinist Soviet Union was seen by many as a model state. Orwell knew far too well what was hidden beneath the promises of security, bread, and jobs for all.1984 has become a household name as few other books; who does not know about Big Brother, or the Thought Police, nowadays? Even the title has become a catchphrase. I do not know any other cult-book that has been so thoroughly ripped apart by other famous authors; I remember Isaac Asimov thrashing it in the nineteen-eighties for instance. Many seem to believe that the society described by Orwell is an impossibility. The problem with the book is that Orwell thought his society would be a product of revolutions. When instead, in reality, the changes creep upon us. A new law here, a small change to statutes there.The most obvious paralell to the book we have now is, of course, the war on terror. We have from top officials that it is going to go on for a long time, and that it is, essentially, unwinable. Readers of 1984 of course recognize the eternal war described in the book. Another paralell is how history changes; Winston Smith's job is to rewrite history so that it suits the present situation. Don't we recognize that? In the ninetenn-eighties, Iraq was our ally; now, Iraq has always been our enemy. Thought Police, I need not even mention this; the administration knows everything about us, and is prepared to use it.We even have paralells to the Anti-Sex movement! The list can just go on.Orwell's book was a cry for reason in the aftermath of a world gone mad. As with so many other cries for reason it disappears among the siren calls of our leaders.I first read it over twenty years ago, in a different world; it was good then - it should be essential reading now!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is a literary explosive, drawing the reader in and then exploding in his face with the realization of how terrifyingly accurate it is. And though it may be dismissed by some as far-fetched, I believe it is more important now than ever before, and should be required reading for kids in public schools. Yes, the famous novel that spawned the famous slogan, \\"Big Brother is watching\\" is quite realistic.\\"1984\\" tells the story of Winston Smith, a jaded denizen of a nation controlled by a totalitarian government led by the enigmatic \\"Big Brother\\" that monitors the people's every action and uses truly original methods of torture and punishment to keep them in control. He begins to break free of the confines of the Party by having a forbidden love affair with a woman, and soon they both become involved in secretive efforts to join a supposed rebellion against \\"Big Brother\\".One of the most interesting points that the book makes is the government's manipulation of the English language. In the book, \\"Big Brother\\" is working towards creating a bastardized version of English called \\"Newspeak\\", in which political deviance is simply incapable of being expressed (for instance, instead of \\"bad\\", the word would be \\"ungood\\"). This, I feel, is hard-hitting in the sense that our language is slowly being manipulated to teach us to say and think things that are far from the truth, only it is political correctness that is causing this and not Newspeak.I recommend this book to everyone, especially those who believe that Communism could work.

It gives a deep insight into the human mind, the fears which lead to failures in society and a bone chilling look at a very probable future."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 began pretty slowly, but I got into it more towards the middle of the book. It takes place in 1984 in Oceania (London), where Big Brother and the Party have complete control. Everyone must agree with Big Brother and the teachings of the Party, and there can be absolutely no evidence that contradicts them. In the Ministry of Truth, our main character Winston alters such documents to keep them consistent with the Party's lies. The people's minds are completely controlled by the government, to the point where they would not even question an obvious lie such as \\"2+2=5\\" if they were told so. It's all pretty terrifying, but it was interesting to see the many parallels between totalitarian states in history, our world today, and other dystopian/utopian literature like Fahrenheit 451 (although I thought that novel was far better). Hitler's followers during the Holocaust were completely brainwashed by his propaganda, embracing socialism and nationalism as the people do in this novel. Hitler seemed like a savior to the people, as did Big Brother, no matter how harmful they were to their societies. The Party gave them a false sense of security and comforted the people, but the government was still feared. They were constantly monitored through the telescreens, and could not make a single move without being seen, making it impossible to oppose the government. Because they have to constantly monitor themselves, they start to believe in the things they are doing, and they learn to love Big Brother. This was my one disappointment. I expected some huge rebellion, or at least a little more from Winston, after all of the suspense. I was waiting for that F451 Montag-escapes-the-mechanical-hound-and-goes-free ending, but I did not get exactly what I expected. Nevertheless, it was an excellent read and I would still recommend it, especially if you enjoy dystopian/utopian literature as much as I do."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Having read this book many times in my life, I have to admit that the most recent occasion (this year) found me feeling that Orwell's vision of the future was closer than ever to coming true.My first reaction when discussing \\"1984\\" with anyone is that it is NOT a political novel. I insist it is a philosophic novel. It asks fundamentally the question \\"why are we here?\\" It also, however fantastically, provides a striking and disturbing answer: we are here to serve the rich and/or (for they are the same) powerful. Period. No other possibility can arise. It is about society and a general critique of the human condition.It is NOT about Russia or the Communist system, nor does it in anyway extol the virtues of our present-day government. To believe that it is about \\"them\\" instead of \\"us\\" is to mistake the entire purpose of the allegory and, essentially, live in the dark. George Orwell had already taken his swipe at the Soviets in \\"Animal Farm\\" and while it might be fair to attribute many of the primary, simplistic visual cues or devices to the USSR (Big Brother as Lenin, Goldstein as Trotsky, terms like \\"party\\" and \\"prole\\", etc,) it is a great injustice to the author and his masterwork. It is also to live in pig-headed blind ignorance, which is made all the more worse the more you praise something you don't understand.This is the story of an individual in a society that devalues the individual so much that no one lives in anything resembling comfort and everyone lives in fear. It is about the predominance of the social class system in the world (the upper, middle, and lower classes) and a nightmarish possible scenario of what would happen if the Upper Class decided one day to take the final step to secure their power forever. The world of Oceania is NOT the Soviet Union, it is the western power block (Britain combined with the United States, in particular.) This point is made perfectly clear and shouldn't be forgotten. It is not about Communism in the west. In fact, it is both a critique on Communism, Socialism, and Capitalism.Orwell seems to offer a world where the distinctions have long since eroded away to the point where only the \\"TRUTH\\" remains: \\"Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other. The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable ... \\" So begins Goldstein's subversive book. But, here is where you have to pay attention ... Goldstein doesn't exist. Big Brother doesn't exist. Only the class system exists.We are given the perspective of one person, Winston Smith (not coincidentally named after another famous Winston.) Through Winston we learn that he is constantly observed by a television screen, that history is changed and even wiped out completely from one day to the next, that even thinking something which does not correspond to what the government wants you to think is a crime, that language can be distorted to such a point that by eliminating a word for a thing ... you destroy a thing itself. This is a world in which personality is destroyed for the benefit of the whole, while the whole is slowly degraded to an abysmal filth. The stink and grime of Oceania is almost tangible. The decay, the fear, the awful sense of futility. Orwell writes as if he were physically in the place.1984 is a book that baffles many people for another reason. Science Fiction as a genre is never given proper respect, but when used to the fullest extent possible, the power is almost dangerous. Orwell may have deliberately chosen this forum to implode his dystopic vision because he knew it might be overlooked. It is, however, far from simplistic and, if fully digested, quite possibly the most explosive and important piece of literature ever written.But, if you want to believe its political and be caught forever in the \\"trap\\" be my guest."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I love 1984: I think it's one of the most powerful, chilling books I've ever read. As such a big fan, I thought I'd alert other 1984 enthusiasts to a new book that updates Orwell's classic for the PATRIOT Act era. The book is John Twelve Hawks' electrifying, impossible-to-put-down The Traveler. In it, Twelve Hawks introduces us to the Vast Machine, an omnipresent surveillance entity every bit as brutal as Big Brother. With all the political poignancy of 1984--and Hollywood-caliber suspense to boot--The Traveler is a must-read for admirers of Orwell's masterpiece."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It's been on my list for a couple of years so I finally broke down and just bought it. It's thick with philosophy and politics but these rarely overwhelm the gripping narrative and impressive characters. I've been around the spinoffs and derivations of this story all my life, so I thought the original might seem tame, but what was most compelling about the novel for me was just how terrifying and vivid Orwell's world is. I mean, I could TASTE it. Grim and relentless, yet thrilling and emotional. The some key parallels between Ingsoc and U.S. \\"democracy\\" today are pretty chilling. \\"Endless war for endless peace\\", anyone?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. How prophetic and relevant to the times we live in. Not only does it scare the hell out of you, but the characters are so well developed that you really care about them. It is a tragic story on two levels, both for humanity and for the individual characters. But make no mistake, although it is a great story of fiction, it is also a warning. It may never happen, but it can, and we are heading down that path.So much has been said already in these reviews, I will just add my endorsement and say that \\"1984\\" should be required reading for every high school student, and then it should be required again in college. If you have read it some time ago, read it again, you will find more the second time through. Peace."},{"Title":"1984","review":"nineteen eighty four was written by the wonderfull author: George Orwell. He was the author of the famous book called Animal farm where he attacked communism metaphorically by using farm animals to represent Humans.Nineteen Eighty-Four is a darkly satirical political novel and love story by George Orwell. Nineteen eightyfour is a similar book. it is about Totalitarianism where the government controlls everything, even the people and how they think. The government has total control on newspapers and practically everything you can imagine. They have the power to spy on people and those who oppose will get in trouble...Citizens have no right to a personal life or personal thought. Leisure and other activities are controlled through strict mores. Sexual pleasure is discouraged, with females being taught not to enjoy it; sex is retained only for the purpose of reproduction.The mysterious head of government is the omniscient, omnipotent, beloved Big Brother, or \\"BB\\". Big Brother is described as \\"a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features.\\" He is usually displayed on posters with the slogan \\"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU\\".This sense of invasion effects the main character: Winston and his secret hatred towards big brother.The book shows the life of winston and his troubles and how BB controls everyone's life. Winston has to \\"struggle\\" for survival in a world of war and totalitarianism while finding love to Julia.to me, 1984 was and still is a very depressing book. It is so sad how BB controls everyone and how Winston gets effected by this.We really get into the story by orwell's fantastic writing with lots of description so we can imagine what it would be like.This is such a good book, this is my first Orwell book and after that, I read Animal farm and was also great!ORWELL is such a good writer and 1984 is one of his best books about love, survival....., and betrayal.\\"We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"In 1984 George Orwell tells the story of Winston Smith. Smith lives under the rule of Big Brother. His every move is monitored. On the outside Winston is a loyal member of the party, but within Winston rebels. He does not except the propaganda of the Party. Winston needs to be reeducated and taught to love Big Brother.This novel provokes a feeling of helplessness. It expresses the power of oppression and the simplicity of creating truth. Orwell is constantly playing with the emotions of the reader, taking them on a ride with surprises around every corner. The reader questions its views on love, politics, and truth. Orwell's masterpiece forces the readers to examine their own world in order seek out any lies that they have been presented with."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is one of the scariest books ever written. It's a story of a society where the government is everywhere and controls everything. Big Brother is what they call the government, and they want the people to think that Big Brother is looking out for them, when actually Big Brother is watching every move they make.It takes 20 or 30 pages to get into the book and start to understand the language used in it. Nothing in this book is what is seems to be. For example, they have a memory hole, which is used to destroy documents and erase the memory of the words on those documents. The Ministry of Love is where they torture people, The Ministry of Truth is where they produce their lies, and so on.The hero of this book realizes that things are not what they seem and are not quite right. He longs for freedom, without knowing just what it is he's missing. It's a bleak book, but one of the best I've ever read.If you enjoy this one you should also check out \\"Animal Farm,\\" by Orwell."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This 1949 classic has lost none of its punch. With his descriptive depiction of the future, Orwell really puts the fear into the reader's heart. With his description of a totalitarian socialist regime, Orwell's masterpiece stimulates a fear that is reminiscent and matched only by The Red Scare of the late 1950s.The most amazing feature of this book is that it still holds relevance today. With America's War on Terrorism, the Bush Administration has started restricting American's basic civil liberties, such as a right to trial. This action almost seems to be a precursor to the restricted socialist atmosphere described so well by Orwell. Still if this book has one message, it is that the individual mind is stronger than any government and that humanity and freewill are things to cherish, not taken for granted. This book is a crystal ball into our country's future and deserves to be read. The founders of our Constitution would be appalled at the current state of the USA and what the Bush cabal is doing to it/us.The ideas in this book are ones that are as appropriate now as when Orwell first wrote them. In this time (2001), we have our &quot;Two Minutes Hate&quot; with Osama bin Laden. Newspeak, the language created by the ruling party in 1984, is amazingly detailed and seems feasible in light of our dyslexic Bushisms.It is based on the English language, and its vocabulary grows smaller instead of larger every year. An appendix, included in the book, enumerates some of the terminology and syntax of the language, and explains how the language is designed to control the thoughts of those who utilize it. To bad it can't be updated with all the words our low IQ president has created.Many of the principles that Orwell writes about (e.g., thought control) are done in a quite blatant way in the book. In the real world of the 20th/21st century they're done, only much more subtly. That way, we don't know they being perpetrated on us. But with the Patriot Act, the boldness is destroying our Constitution.Here's how 1984 applies to current events:WAR IS PEACEThe new &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; is being sold as a guarantor or our safety. While this war is being waged, we're to accept permanent war as a fact of life. As the unavoidable slaughter of innocents unfolds overseas, we are told to go back to &quot;living our lives.&quot;FREEDOM IS SLAVERY&quot;Freedom itself was attacked,&quot; Bush said. He's right, though here's the twist: Americans are losing many of their most cherished freedoms in a frenzy of paranoid legislation. The government wants to tap our phones, read our email and seize our credit card records without court order. Further, it wants authority to detain and deport immigrants without cause or trial. To save freedom, we have to destroy it.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHAmerica's &quot;new war&quot; against terrorism will be fought with unprecedented secrecy, including press restrictions not seen for years, the Pentagon has advised.When you read this book, you'll be better able to see the signs around you. The world portrayed by Orwell is \`HERE AND NOW.\\"If you think it's all a conspiracy... then check out these books also: I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program \`insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban, and always read the Amazon reviews."},{"Title":"1984","review":"WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. Theseare the three slogans that Winston Smith hears every day. When I first read this book 35 years ago, the threat of such a freedomless world seemed impossible to me. After all...we are not Russia. Today, the words of the book are dangerously true. WAR IS PEACE. Have we not started a preemptive war against another country for the ostensible purpose of peace? IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. Don't some of our public schools and libraries censor books or resist the teaching of contemporary biology? What about the THOUGHT POLICE. Today in America, an individual can be convicted by introducting into evidence information that he or she reviewed from his computer in the privacy of his home. The books we read, the videos we rent, the clothes we wear, the cars we drive are all easily accessible by lw enforcement agencies. New technology allows scientists to scan our brains to determine if we are telling the truth. Yes...BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING US.

It holds many parallels to the real world. And for some of the other reviewers who said it was boring, Orwell is a terrible writer, and its not at all realistic...

Its not boring if you understand it, if you are too ignorant to get it, then of course its boring, I'm sorry your teacher MADE you read it, I'm sure youll be quite content with Dr. Seuss. And as for the comment about Orwells ability to write, you aren't allowed to talk, I had a hard time making out your review it was so badly written.If you are insterested in the government as well as psychology, I advise you to read this."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I decided to re-read this book, since I can't really remember reading it in High School. I'd seen the move years ago, and barely remember it. However, the notion of \\"1984\\" and \\"Big Brother\\" are such colloquialisms, it feels like this book has been engrained in our culture somehow (which is ironically weird). Anyway, I enjoyed the book to a degree, but it now seems way over done for this day and age. I can see how this book would have helped spurn on 50's era McCarthy-ism anti-socialism. The writing style is excellent, and the main character, Winston, is very well done. He is completely believable, even if the setting and the premise of the book are way out there. Beyond that, everything in the book is just so over the top, it's hard to take seriously. The author does make a good point, which is something I didn't expect from this book. The idea that powerful people would occupy power, and construct a societal system which would allow them to stay in power, strictly for the purpose of power, is very profound. I remember thinking long ago how ridiculous it was that we could have video cameras and microphones all over the world, and some kind of network to allow monitoring of everything. Today we purchase devices from Google, Samsung, Motorola, and Apple with just such a capability, all of which are hooked into a world wide network where Google, Amazon, and others electronically analyze every bit of internet data they can get. I'm not into conspiracy theory, but I find it ironic that private industry seems to be moving in a similar direction that the INSOC government went in 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"As a read, it rates quite well, until you come to the stodgy pages of the Goldstein book, supposed to reveal so much (more on this later). But now let's consider the reader who thinks as well.I find that a lot of people simply don't read this book properly. 'Chilling exposure of totalitarian future'? 'Takes you to a nightmare world of totalitarian domination'? Yes, that's what I had heard too when I opened this book as an adolescent. But my overwhelming impression was of the sheer seediness of the world depicted. Winston and Julia's rebellion is directed at least as much against their degraded lives as against the Party's control of them. Years later, I noticed my students didn't see this. And of the first ten reviews I read, only one had as much as half a sentence on it.There's a lot of grimy, gritty realism in this book. But it isn't, finally, a realistic novel. First, it depends on huge silences. Winston Smith is clearly a man of some culture. Yet how, given the circumstances of his life, did he obtain it? Also, how could the party possibly have changed from the winner of some sort of socialist revolutionary struggle before to what it is in 1984? How come Smith has some sort of amnesia about all of this?The overdetermined nature of the story is also unrealistic. O'Brien seems to be able to read Smith's dreams. The place he gets the notebook from just happens to be the place for Winston and Julia's love nest, the owner of which just happens to be a member of the thought police. In Smith's interrogation, O'Brien has the ability to read Smith's thoughts. Of course, all this enforces the doom that hangs over his rebellion, but it has the quality more of a dream, when the dreamer's fears immediately become concrete, than a book that says much about our actual world full of chance and contingency.The social structure depicted in this book is not that of Soviet communism, but of Soviet communism spliced together with the British class system. Notice that Party members do not, in that classic giveaway phrase, 'speak with accents'. The Party did not function as a class in the Soviet system; it pervaded the whole of society and was stridently and sincerely for the proletariat and proletarian values right to the end. The society of 1984 wouldn't have worked without the economy being far more permeated by the party than would have been possible in the book: it would have ticked once or twice and then stopped. Orwell's proles have no culture of their own: everything is dished out to them by the Ministries. His patronising attitude is the worst sort of contempt.Now let's say something about the great book, that is supposed to explain everything. The first lines tell us that the Middle want to replace the High, but the Low dream of universal brotherhood. Even when I read that as a fourteen-year-old I knew that was false: why shouldn't the Low want to replace the Middle? Isn't that what vast numbers have done? Then the inmost answer of answers - was there ever such a damp squib? The Party do as they do to satisfy their lust for control and dominance? Come off it. I can believe in a once revolutionary or idealistic party that has become hopelessly mired in corruption and self-seeking, and I am sure that some members of the security services take a sadistic pleasure in doing their jobs, but rulers as a whole? They've got better things to do. O'Brien's mind encompassing Smith's (it says this at one point)is a figure of Orwell's encompassing both - which makes this a very sado-masochistic book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A b c d e f g h j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z"},{"Title":"1984","review":"A timeless book, especially in todays world. I had read it years ago, and enjoyed reading it again. Recommended for all."},{"Title":"1984","review":"If you want to laugh, cry, and be scared at the same time, then this is the book for you. The Guardian by Nicholas Sparks is a book about love and suspense. This novel involves a young woman named Julie who is a widow because her husband Jim had recently died; he had left her a dog named Singer who acted like her guardian angel and was there to protect her. All Julie wanted to do was be in love again, so when she began dating again, she began falling for the perfect guy named Richard. Richard was truly perfect for her, but his constant demands and his bipolar attitude made Julie realize that he wasn't the one for her. So, Julie broke up with Richard and began falling for her best friend named Mike. Little did Julie know that this deeply angered Richard which made him do some things that he's not really proud of. As Julie and Mike had to get through all of the things Richard did to retaliate, they both stuck through it and made their love stronger. This book was immensely suspenseful because Richard's actions are unpredictable and keeps one on their toes.The author's viewpoint and main idea is to educate readers and young teens about the art of love and obsession.The author uses a technique of allowing there to be two different perspectives in the book: thoughts of Julie's and thoughts of Richard's. He showed evidence of the book by interpreting Richard's thoughts and the plans of attack he plotted in his head to make Julie's life miserable, which made the book that much more interesting. He also lets the reader to understand how and why Richard does the things he did to Julie. Also, Sparks uses evidence for the love between Mike and Julie by showing them sticking together and getting through all these rough plots that Richard has set up to get them to break up, but they have stuck through them all clearly showing their love for one another until the very end. The stress Richard put upon their relationship was enough stress to break them apart, but their true love for one another outgrew the threats thrown at them.The author's argument is convincing because he clearly shows and provides evidence on concluding his argument which is that love truly does conquer all. When Richard was angry at Julie for so long and did many things that I can't say or else id ruin it for you, Mike had stuck with her even when Richard sabotaged them in order to break them up, but their love conquered all and they found a way to stick with each other through it all.This book isn't like other novels written because of its suspenseful and twisted plot. Most love novels are about two people who fall in love, break up, and then get back together and live happily ever after; this is no typical love story. However, this book is different in that it provided insight on how strong their love was because of the twisted plot Sparks created. This love story also included horror, deaths, obsessions, and made the reader's heart pound intensely, not only because of the love scenes but also for the scenes in which Richard plotted his plans to make Julie miserable and showed he did what he did.I feel as if this book would be interesting to people who love Nicholas Sparks' books about love and love sorties. However, this book would also appeal to any type of aged person who wants to find a book about not only love but also suspense. Most people don't like love stories because they believe in the stereotypes said about them, but this book gives a mixture of many different genres that would appeal to any average aged person. However, this book appeals more strongly to girls and women than guys and men. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a thrilling book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"By Blake Padveen:George Orwell's novel 1984, could possibly be one of the most influential books of the 20th century. Its references to communism, capitalism and totalitarianism chill the body to the bone in an unimaginable way. The main chilling fact, is that the events in 1984 could possibly happen. Many of the reoccurring themes throughout the novel such as love, and freedom are quickly abolished almost in an instant, giving the reader insight on how important these ideas are, and how they should be cherished. Orwell also grants the reader insight into many different parts of the world where people are currently enslaved by their governments and how their lives differ from the free world. The book being written in a time where the world was consumed by fear and hatred of communism shows how a civilization can be easily manipulated by these feeling of hate and fear. It is true that in 1984 Winston's and Julia's final fates are quite possibly worse then death. They lose their hatred for the party, and the means to rebel and become lovers of big brother and of the party as well. To lose ones passion and love is a fate that could be seen as worse than death. Even though I appreciate George Orwell's writing style, it is hard for me in the modern age to enjoy a book mostly consumed by pointless dialogue even though it was essential to the story. I much more enjoyed the movie."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I was required to read this in high school, I'm now a college student and I still love it! It is one of the best books I've read.

Think about the actual dictatorships regimes in North Korea, Irak and Cuba and you have an idea of the portrait given by Orwell. In 1984 the world is divided in three super-powers, each one of them exerting total control of the lives of its inhabitants via all the means avaiable, turning the lives of them into real nightmares. The mechanisms of control are the total repudiation of love and its demonstrations between human beings, the incentive to finger-pointing, specially among family members, etc... The politics is based upon a permanent state of war againt external enemies, with alliances alternating themselves almost in a mechanical way. Thus, power has to be exerted with its utmost potency. A sci-fi still valid many years after 1984 and the fall of the Iron Curtain. A real classic."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is definitely a book that can generate discussion. The topics form strong and sometimes unexpected opinions. A few parts are a bit dull, such as the beginning, but the plot is quite intriguing. George Orwell utilizes superior language and I loved the way he used one example of &quot;mind control&quot; throughout the entire story and ties up loose ends with the concept. MAny different themes are all taking place at the same time, but everything associates with the main &quot;Big Brother&quot; government. I truly enjoyed reading the novel. It was a refreshing change of pace for me because I'm not normally a science fiction reader.

Years later, I read it again. I will most likely do so again.Winston Smith, the main character, is a man who lives in constant fear of the Government. His job is to break down the langauge we once had into smaller words. History is kissed goodbye....Yet Winston holds on. He doesn't want to be subjected to the vision of the party. He holds on to what he remembers...will Big Brother catch on? You will have to read this book to find out!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Just how far off was Orwell with the possibilities that communism presented. This novel was written so far ahead of its time its scary. Even today, many years after 1984, we are reminded of this story through qoutations of the book that have become everyday sayings. I would tell you more but I mustn't doublethink, Big Brother is watching. Read the book, because when you've finished you'll want to read it again."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I loved this book. I reccomended it to everyone I met. I went to a restaraunt yesterday and reccomended it to 15 people, yes 15. I choose a book every year. A book that I am going to analyze, this year it was 1984. I love this book I just really really love it. For any7 read this is the perfect book. For Sci-Fi, for Histroical readers, even me, a fantasy buff find it wonderful!Any way I will leave fellow readers to decide its true worth!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"We thoroughly enjoyed 1984 by George Orwell, and feel that is it a warning to citizens of the consequences of power. The novel provided an eye-opening account of the affects on the individual in a totalitarian system. Orwell vividly depicts the loss of individualism and the conformity that results among the citizens when government is given too much power. We recommend this book to all high school students because it not only deals with the harsh reality of the government, but also with the feelings of the narrator, Winston Smith, towards the system. 1984 has encouraged us to take an active role in our government as voters, and has helped us to realize the full extent of our freedoms in the USA."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is perhaps one of the best books i have read- Not for It's literature. Although it is fantastically written, it resounds with warning. Anyone who sees this book as simply &quot;a book about communism&quot; may as well set the book ablaze, for he has already destroyed it's message. The book tells of humankinds self-enslavement, where people are nothing more than machines doomed to produce and consume endlessly for the sake of further production and consumption. The only prevailing human emotions are greed, hate, distrust, sorrow, and loyalty to invisible characters. Any word, thought, action, or a mere facial expression that might make other Party Members nervous results in instant termination. History is nonexistant in the sense as we know it. The Party controlls all records-as the slogan goes &quot;who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.&quot; There is no escape. The book does not give a solution to the enslavement, but in its bold and frightening forecast, gives the reader the means to prevent it. Never let yourself be silenced. I highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The book is a fantastic read of Orwell's projection of a future in which three totalitarian governments (all equivalent) rule the earth. I would say the book has two sections, the story, which follows an Outer Party member's struggle to rebel, and philosophy, which is Big Brother's Manifesto (or, one could say, Goldstein's but really they are one and the same). The book puts the story on hold when Winston, the protagonist, reads the manifesto; I would say that there is flow problem with the abrupt nature of this switch. Certainly the Manifesto is endemic to the book and provides another perspective and history of the rise of Oceania, the state in which Winston lives."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Have you ever thought what it would be like to have a central government monitor everything you do? To live in a world where you are limited in what you could say, or even think? Or how would you feel if your government assigned you to a partner, and you had to breed, for the sake of the government and nothing more. In the book 1984, by George Orwell, a character named Winston Smith lived in a society very similar to this. He lived in the city called Oceania, during the year 1984. The book centered around Winston's life in this communist-like society. His life and everyone else's around him was controlled by someone or something only known to them as \\"Big Brother.\\" They were surrounded by signs constantly reminding them that \\"Big Brother is Watching.\\" Telescreens, or 2 way TV screens were mounted in almost every room, and street. Microphones were everywhere, monitoring every step you took. They lived their lives in constant fear that they would do something wrong, which would surely sentence them to the wrath of the Thoughtpolice, a task force organized by the \\"Party,\\" to keep order. This \\"Party,\\" supported, and represented Big Brother. A modified version of the English language called Newspeak was developed which completely centered around \\"The Party\\". Its vocabulary was limited to words that only supported the Party. All other words were eliminated. I thought this was a very good book. It was written very well, with strong imagery, and an interesting plot. It was a quick read, despite it's 300 pages. It touches on everyone's fears of communism, and gives you a different look at government."},{"Title":"1984","review":"What else is there to say? Even those that didn't like this book must at least concede that it's extremely well-written - and I would wager that the overwhelming majority of those that didn't like this book are either 1) too young, or 2) simply didn't understand it.1984 is one of the classics of Western literature. If you're going to read an Orwell novel, read this before Animal Farm. Read both, but read 1984 first. It's entertaining and incredibly engaging."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I am particularly fascinated with Orwell's prophecy that the government would control the masses with pornography and support LOW class prostitution!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"What an amazing book. It is much better book than both We and Brave New World. Besides, Emanuel Goldstein is the greatest!!!!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell succeeds in capturing the reader's mind's once again as he did before in &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. Wheras Animal Farm might be considered a comical satire, 1984 takes another step in as a fictional perspective. In this case, George Orwell takes a stand as an oracle...he seems to conclude that sometime in the future communistic ideals may come into total control. I believe such ideas evolved throughout his influence during the World War II. It is not a wonder such dire predictions have been described. The book is a amalgamation of fiction, romance, politics, however beautifully combining them into a captivating and original novel. Definitely worth the time to read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When my English teacher made a reference to 1984 I knew I had to read it and that was the best decision I ever made! 1984 is so deep with many twists and turns. Just the idea of &quot;crimethink&quot; and &quot;telescreens&quot; and &quot;big brother is watching you&quot; expresses the deep and futuristic feel of the entire book. Really relating to Winston and Julia helped a lot and when at first I thought it would be to deep for me as I am 13 I actually really enjoyed it alot. But you are warned. Once started you wil not be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"&quot;Thought Police.&quot; &quot;Big Brother.&quot; &quot;Orwellion.&quot; These words have become part of our national vocabulary because of George Orwell's classic novel &quot;1984,&quot; the story of one man's nightmare odyssey through a world ruled by warring states and a power structure that controls not only information but individual thought and memory. A minor functionary named Winston Smith joins a covert brotherhood and pursues a forbidden love affair against the cold, gray backdrop of the Republic of Oceania-only to become a hunted enemy of the state-and of Big Brother."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In George Orwell's '1984' he describes a world that might someday be. Maybe even a hightened view of today's 'democracy'. In '1984' there are really only two classes- that of the party members and that of the proles. But no matter which you belong to, you are really the same, because you are born into a world where freedom is unknown. Born into a world where your future is pre-determined, and therefore, you are 'happy' in your ignorance. All of your actions and conversations are constantly monitored, and if you dare to challenge the rule that you are put under from birth, dire consequences are known to follow. So you grow up in only one world with only one option- that of obeying. And in your mind and in the minds of those around you, you become so accustomed to this system of unchallenged rule, that you begin to believe that it's right. This is a story of a man who suddenly awakens to the injustices of the Party. He examines the phsychology of the system and comes to understand just how the Party has manipulated and altered the past in order to control the future. I'm quite amazed at the depth of Orwell's knowledge and how he see's the precense of a ruling class in it's entirety. Throughout the novel he remains completely unbiased, and therefor gives us a true view of the mentality of government rule and how the working class comes to accept it. The only way that one could possibly dispute this book is if they came into it with an altered opinion, which is exactly what the book describes. This is really a work of genius and can change the way you view your life entirely. It's something that everyone should examine and study and try to understand. It really is an amazing piece of work."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This was the first time I had tried the &quot;futuristic&quot; genre- and I loved it! 1984 really made think- it was in-depth without being totally confusing. The characters are realistic and Orwell does a great job of describing how the citizens are controlled in the republic of Oceania. If you ever get the opportunity, read 1984- you will not be disappointed!!!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"An extraordinarily original and powerful novel, George Orwell's chilling masterpiece remains absolutely convincing, from the first sentence to the last four words. This book is a remarkable achievement. Sincerely, Diana Dell, author, \\"A Saigon Party: And Other Vietnam War Short Stories.\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"...you should read every 10 years of your lifeThe 1984 and Animal Farm are the best two books I've read recently...they consider totalitarism in the very readable language, and show the frightening future of the world (creating large blocks such as USA, Europe, USSR, and everlasting war between them). The 1984 also talks about basic principles of freedom (&quot;It is freedom to say that 2+2 equal 4&quot;) and involves some other thematics such as birth of love and feelings in general in totalitarism which tends to be free of any kind of feelings.I fully recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book offers very compehensive views for people who want to learn about how life inside the IronCurtain is like. IMHO, it is so well written that reading it beats reading tons of magazne articles on this subject. As a former citizen who lived in a communist country, I can testify that almost everything that Mr. Orwell wrote in his '1984' is truth to the point. Reading this book brings back all those nightmares that I had experienced and witnessed there myself. The thing I really like about this book is that although it's a very detailed piece of work documenting on the evils of a communistic social system, but the large amount of information presented in it had not bogged down the pace of the book at all. In fact, this book is a relative easy and fast paced read, thanks to the good writing skill of the author, the good structure of its presentation, and that sparkling but doomed romance that Orwell had geniously imcorporated into the story. All in all, this is a very worthy book for everyone to read about."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a rather grim prediction for the future. The new world that it creates is frightening and surreal. The main character, Winston Smith, does not seem like the usual hero, yet at the same time one can't help liking his small rebellion. However, the total control excersised by the Party is alarming in its reality. Although George Orwell wrote this novel as a prediction for 1984, it is as significant today as it ever was. This book is definately worth reading. The style grabs you, and although the totalitarian society created could be confusing, the novel reads in a way that helps you to slowly understand each aspect of it. I would definately reccomend this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This Book covers \\"The Theory and Practice of Oligarchic Collectivism\\" which is rule by the oligarchic plutocracy with or without rigged elections or a \\"choice\\" of 2 corporate owned candidates. This is fascism: the open terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary components of the oligarchy and finance capital. The regime is protected by dumbing down the population, scapegoating demagogues, fake terrorism....anything to focus the attention of the populace on anyone but their real enemies the looting parasitical oligarchy. The only socialism involved here is socialism for the rich (bale outs for the rich, subsidies from the state). Free enterprise for the working class. George Orwell got it right. In response to the person who claims that this is a book about \\"socialism\\": socialism is collective ownership of the means of production by the working class. We obviously do not have this in the US. The oligarchs own the means of production and the government and the tax payers subsidize them and their corporate fist known as the pentagon. Also, saying that Russians have a dead look in their eyes from living under totalitarianism: would it suprise you to know that in the 2002 Russian elections that the largest bloc of votes was for communists??? The oligarchs then removed the communists from the Duma (Nazi DICTATORSHIP style or USA style). This was not reported in the US corporate media cartel propaganda outlets because it blows the lies that the Russians are happy that the oligarchs are in charge again and have looted 40% of them into poverty in just 10 years."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Few books I have read have captivated me as much as 1984 did. In the two days I read it I actually stayed up near midnight and it took me all the willpower I had to put it down and finally go to sleep. I would highly recommend this book to any reader and personally consider it one of the greatest political statements agains communism ever written.George Orwell's grim tale begins after a future government's attempt to create a utopia goes awry. We start the story as it pertains to Winston Smith, a man who works in The Ministry of Truth, which, despite it's misleading names, works on the 'correction' of 'false' records. Despite his desires to fit in, Winston is at risk merely because he can remember what life was like before 'Big Brother'. He knows that much of the party's propogands is fluid fiction; he realizes that the party controls individuals by brainwashing them with lies and alienating them from each other.Winston soon begins having a love affair with a woman named Julia. In their hatred of Big Brother, they both decide to join an underground resistance call the Brotherhood. However, the organization is not quite as Winston had conceived, and he and Julia realize just how hard it is to resist Big Brother and the Thought Police."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is simply one of the most important and powerful books of the 20th century, plus is a great read.A lot of people I know have read 1984, and no one ever considered it less than &quot;great&quot;.Buy this."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is a true classic. Orwell's megastate Oceania is a truly frightening dystopia. Winston Smith and his girlfriend, Julia, rebel against a monsterous police state bent on controlling the very thoughts a person may have. Thoughtcrime,doublespeak, and Big Brother are terms we have come to use to describe our real life governments attack on our own liberties. Smith rebels against the maddness and oppression of Oceania by having a secret love affair with Julia, a woman sworn to celibacy for the &quot;Party&quot;. After being arrested by the Thought Police they are brought to the &quot;Ministry of Love&quot; where Winston is submitted to unremmitting torture and brutality at the hands of his torturer, O' Brien. O'Brien is the consumate collectivist.He loves and worships pure power and enjoys &quot;destroying minds&quot;. He informs Winston that the Party determines ultimate truth and that truth is whatever the Party says it is. He chillingly tells Winston &quot; Here is a picture of humanity, a boot stamping on a human face, forever.&quot; a truly wonderful, frightening, but appropriate classic in these tmes of assaults on our liberties. A truly great book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I just finished reading CONQUEST OF PARADISE, a brilliant book about the decline of the entire world into a totalitarian dictatorship that seemed as real any I've ever read. It reminded me of the prophetic Orwell's 1984. As the years pass on, the foresight of George Orwell's book becomes more and more amazing. He writes the book as if 1984 is a distant future year when the government and the press run the present, past, and future. Are we not getting to that point now? I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to wake up and see the state of affairs we are in presently in this country, and CONQUEST OF PARADISE paints a frightening picture of how technology may take us there."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is not just a science fiction story, or a political book, or even a fantasy story, but a book on ideas, a book of thought and philosophy. Winstin Smith is us, men and women who believe in Truth and history, family and love and sex, if such things can be linked together. And Orwell shows us they CAN be linked, because they are freedoms, as important as the freedom to vote or speak. Without the basic rights that even many ANIMALS have, without the foundation of current passions and private memories, a free world can NEVER exist.Maybe I am reading too much into it. But I feel the book goes beyond fears of the industrial elite within Western societies, big corporations and Communism. Or maybe it goes beneath these fears, to the root of them all, which is our fear of losing our way."},{"Title":"1984","review":"If you want to know what the title of this review means, you really do need to read the book. A technical translation is &quot;very very good&quot; and &quot;very very bad&quot;, but that is inexact.It is difficult to review this book without making comparisons to current events or using the word &quot;prophetic&quot;. It is a world where all freedoms have been eliminated in favor of the bureaucratic order. It is totalitarian, as occasionally one or two people wake up to this fact. There is only one crime, to think bad thoughts, and the main character is guilty, because he remembers the unofficial (and therefore non-existant) version of the past.What is most interesting about the book is how, in the end, they completely warped the thoughts of the protaganist so that he goes from wanting to rebel against the government to the last line of the book &quot;Winston loved Big Brother.&quot;That a government could progress to the point where it could twist a person's thoughts is frightening. That people can read this book and compare it to any modern government is revealing.Yes, this book is all the things people say it is, which is why it should be read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"If you're buying this book and you don't know much about it then you're in for a trip down a pretty disturbing road. The obvious questions it raises about society, government, control, power, unity, trust, and faith in the human character might leave you thinking critically about humanity's direction (if you haven't before). Ultimately I felt like the book's strongest point was it's exploration of what &quot;reality&quot; becomes when manipulated by the mind's interpretation of it. But I think people's reactions to 1984 will vary according to their own insight into the books topics, especially within the political realm. Without a doubt, a great book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read Animal Farm in junior high and then picked up 1984 because Animal Farm was such an interesting read. Needless to say, I was not ready for the horror of 1984. Animal Farm tells the tragedy of a revolution against tyranny sliding into its own tyranny but it tells the story through the eyes of pigs and horses and dogs. 1984 not only tells the story through human eyes, but it tells a much more horrifying tale of the ease with which people with modern propaganda and technological tools can form a seemingly invincible totalitarian government with popular support.Although this may sound a bit trite, Orwell also gives everyone reading 1984 a wake-up call about how easy it is to give away freedom and how easy it is for a government to use any decrease in people's vigilance regarding their own freedoms and turn the world into a nightmare.One of the interesting parts of the book is the fact that the government in 1984 is creating a new language of drastically decreased vocabulary and increased technobabble that will stop people from being able to think and speak creatively or to find the words to rebel against totalitarian rule.However, in writing the book, Orwell himself created an entirely new vocabulary to discuss overreaching and totalitarian government. Terms like \\"Big Brother,\\" \\"thought police,\\" \\"thought crime\\" and, to a lesser degree \\"double think\\" as well as the title of the book itself have become parts of our vocabulary in fighting against totalitarianism. Thus, in imagining a world in which the government is doing away with people's ability to speak out, Orwell helped spawn a whole vocabulary to help people protest."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 ReviewGeorge Orwell's novel, 1984 is classic, thought provoking literature that everyone should read. 1984 relates to many of the radical ideas of the communist era. Orwell points out the fake reality portrayed by the government with his incorporation of such things as \\"victory cigarettes and victory gin.\\" This story exhibits the reality of life in many small, exploited countries.The exaggerated ideals 1984 expresses, represents the oppression felt by many in the world that is gilded by a thought of true freedom. The story is very descriptive and allows the reader to feel the true emotions that the main character, Winston Smith is feeling. Orwell shows that in our world everything is deceptive to reality. Conformity is the main concern for the masses working for the elite and even the name Winston Smith is symbolic for this lack of individualistic qualities. This book shows the militaristic tactics used by the government of \\"Big Brother\\" to inspire people to work and keep an interest in the common good. Every four years the government of Oceana started a fake war with one of the other two super powers to maintain the work ethic and inspiration of the slaving people in the middle class. Winston represents all people who rebel against the system and know that the illusions presented by the government of aristocrats are wrong. He represents the middle class which work as tools of the elite and the proletarians are the people who the government leaves to their own ignorance. 1984 holds a great amount of symbolism and connects fiction with the real world. This book is a must read for everyone and to me, quite possibly one of the greatest books ever written."},{"Title":"1984","review":"For those of you who wrote that this novel does not make sense as a vision of the future, and could never happen, I would just ask you to look at Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union from a historical perspective. But, then again, there are 2 billion people in China who can not speak there mind without fear of being arrested and the government has control over how many children they can have. Thank god you live in a country where you can be free to read this novel. The themes are as true today as when Orwell wrote them. The governments desire to control what people will think (See Clinton). Mans inhumanity to man (See Serbs and Kosovo). Children please read the newspaper once and a while."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I don't read many books, but the second I read the first sentence of 1984, I knew I was teleported to a new world. &quot;The clock struck 13&quot;, &quot;National Hate Day&quot;, these are words strong in their own that aren't in any normal novel. Even though it was written so long ago, this piece of work has a true effect on anyone who reads it. There is no doubt at all that Orwell himself was scared of a communist society, but he put that fear to good use when he wrote this World renown masterpiece."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I, along with (probably) a few million other high-school students read this recently, and I must say, this is one of the best books I have laid my eyes on. This will be a book that I'll remember. Although it may not be very realistic in the present-day free world, It was a very good vision. I would be VERY interested to see what changes and additions would be there, had Orwell known how powerful computers and surveillance equipment has become, although, according to the beleifs of the culture portrayed, development of the computer would have halted by the 70's at the latest. Oh well. Read it if you haven't yet."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is the most profound book I have read. At its core is control of the masses. In a free, democratic society this occurs to a more ahorrant extent than in socialist or communist countries as the public is unaware it is happening, whilst a &quot;clean&quot; facade is maintained. The ominous image of 1984 is facilitated by our modern day, technological society, and as such its warning is even more general and relevant than it may intially seem. You can know only what you're told and believe only what you're lead to believe (directly or indirectly). I'll get off my soapbox now and let you wipe the blood from your ears. 1984 is a magnificent book and will change the way you think, indicating the genius of Orwell."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is one of the most book now, but as ficition it's also fantastic. If you liked it, and if you're open minded, than you should read other great books, like The Trial. Both of them are very important and clever, read it only if you want to think, it's not some kind of trash like The Alchemist."},{"Title":"1984","review":"&quot;1984&quot; is indescriptable. It does not fall into any categories except for that describing an inhumane society. Winston Smith needs the girl and I think it's beautiful when he discovers that she loves him. That's beside the point of the Thought Police and O'Brien. A very sad book with a sad end. Smith comes to love Big Brother."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read it in a day. It was a great story, but where people come up with &quot;must read&quot; and comments on how true it is is confusing to me. Orwell has some interesting ideas, esp. the vocabulary thing. However, it is fiction. If it is regarded as such, enjoy it. If a philosophetic novel is expected, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is a truly amazing look at a world of the future. A world where no one has a mind of their own, where a power-seeking Party controls everything. No one escapes the control of Big Brother, not even those with rock-hard beliefs against it.From the first page to the last sentence, this book draws the reader in, and the reader comes out with a new awareness, a new vantage point from which to view our modern world.Capturing Orwell's convictions about Communism and Socialism, the book is more than good suspense, it is a lesson."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Possibly my favorite book. It truly makes you think about human nature. The setting is a dystopia that is unthinkable, yet not implausible. There is a section on Newspeak, the language of this world, that is extremely interesting. Not a light read, but one that must be read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"You may think this is about Stalin and his Purges... it may be... but it's much more. The date is irrelavant, except that it's in the future of the author (Orwell). Our hero, Winston Smith (no accident that Winston Churchill and the most comon name, Smith, were used by Orwell), has all the right qualities: a questioning mind, a distrust of authority, and an oddball fascination with the truth...to get himself &quot;cleansed&quot; by the Thought Police, who torture and kill, out of &quot;love&quot; for Big Brother's lot of Outer Party Members. Smith has the temerity to question the nature of this power exuded by the Inner Party - for it's own sake, which seems fragile. Built on embracing &quot;DoubleThink,&quot; where any two diametrically opposed statements are both valid, and where citizens are told which version is the truth - for that moment. Smith asks, &quot;Does Big Brother exist?&quot; while Inner Party member O'Brien tortures what's left of him into believing 2 +! 2 = 4 or 5, depending what the very same Big Brother decides is Truth, for today, now. Why is &quot;1984&quot; important? Keeping an alert eye on any government that exudes power by control and manipulating information, where the individual is sacrificed to the needs of the many, where the press is owned by the church, and where the state is unapproachable and abstract, is not only the province of the American CIA, but of any individual professing adherence to democracy. The enemy may just be our own complacency. Orwell's anti-utopia novel is a warning: we must engage in our democracy or be prepared to believe 2 + 2 = 5...and all else will follow...!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"When you finish reading 1984, you don't know what to do with yourself for the next couple of hours. The themes of the novel are so thought provoking and powerful that it leaves you stupefied. However, the book is more than just a philosophical message. One of the reasons that Orwell's message is so powerful is because the characters are rich and the plot (forbidden love in a loveless world) is captivating. Not only did Orwell have some incredibly penetrating ideas, but he knew how to express them in a very well written story. 5 out of 5!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a book I first read in the 8th grade for my English class. I liked it then, and I love it today.1984 is a book you have probably heard of, even if only in passing. And if you haven't heard of the book itself, you have definitely heard some of the concepts that appear in this book. Big Brother, thought crime, doublethink, newspeak. All these came from this book and have entered into the modern lexicon.The best part about this novel is that it provides us with a look at a very real and possible dystopian world. As we follow Winston through the society in which he lives, we get to see what happens when a government is allowed to rule society, and the picture is anything but gumdrops and smiles. One of the elements of this that always sticks with me is the way in which the government goes about controlling the people. Done through technology and the mystique of omnipresence, Big Brother controls his peoples' lives and the people are unaware that they are just rats in a maze.Of course, the primary reason I would recommend reading this book is because it forces you to take a closer look at the world around you. In this novel, George Orwell seems to have predicted some of the technologies we have today, and also seemed to foresee how society would use them. Seeing the world he described, and then seeing the world we live causes there reader of this book to take a step back and look at what's going on in the world today."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is a wonderful book that describes a dramatically dark world ruled by Big Brother. Orwell uses vivid imagery to show you an exaggerated world where government has been given too much power. Orwell warns the reader of what government could become without the balance of power. A brilliantly written piece of literature that everyone should read at least once."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In terms of exploring the human condition in the modern era, this is the great novel of the twentieth century. I first read this book in 1968, when 1984 seemed far in the future. Now it's 26 years in the past. The totalitarian regime of the Soviet Union which so much concerned Orwell is also long gone. But the novel lives on for good reason.Orwell's book will be read for centuries -- when the totalitarian regimes of the 20th Century are as distant in the past as the 30 Years War is from us -- because Orwell is concerned about the nature of reality and the nature of power. Reality, after all, is a construct. We must strive to superimpose some narrative on the events and data swirling around us. This requires the use of language and the use of a context. Therefore, if one controls language and one controls the historical record that gives everything a context, one can control and manipulate everyone's reality. One can, in short, achieve absolute power.In the future dystopia imagined by Orwell the state controls language and constantly rewrites the past. Words are systmatically eliminated from the English language so that there are no longer any shades of gray. Absolute control over information is achieved so that however ridiculous the latest message from the party, it must be believed -- and if it is not believed, one begins to question one's own sanity.Much of debate surrounding this book centers around whether the precise dystopia predicted by Orwell will ever actually occur, thereby missing the point. Given the information revolution, the shrinking of the world, and the fall of the Soviet Union, we are less concerned today about the threat of a totalitarian regime than we are by resource limitations. The dystopia we now imagine concerns a constant state of war over shrinking resources complicated by the ability of small fringe groups to use terror as an effective weapon against highly centralized and complex modern structures.But Orwell's vision is more fundamental. Given the profound ability to manipulate and control the individual, what is to prevent humanity from ultimately degenerating over the next millenia into systems resembling the ant heap? For Orwell, the individual's duty is to be constantly vigilant about manipulations of language, ideas, and history that occur in every society so that we don't take any steps toward the world of the ant heap.This is an absolutely brilliant book, written with great passion in 1948 by a dying man concerned about the human condition. It is one of the few books that everyone must read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"bought this book after i heard about references to it. this book makes sense now seeing the way our country is going. it starts somewhere...."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When I first picked up 1984, by Eric Arthur Blair (George Orwell), I thought it was going to be a boring book that would be hard to understand. I was completely wrong, 1984 kept me on the edge of my seat always wanting to read one more page. There was action, rebellion, politics, torture, and love all thrown into one amazing novel.Winston Smith, a man in his late thirties, lives in dark grimy London (London is now a part of the state Air Strip One; which is now a small section of Oceania) in the year of 1984. He experiences an extreme dislike for his government of Oceania with its leader Big Brother. Oceania's governmental beliefs is considered Insoc which rivals the two other countries of the \\"new world\\", Eurasia and Eastasia. Winston believes he is the only one in all of Oceania who feels that the government is corrupt and ludacris until he meets Julia.At first, Winston thought Julia was a member of the thought police and was trying to spy on him and uncover his hidden beliefs. Evidently, the two start to interact with each other and Winston finds out Julia is not a spy but another person who shares his hatred for Big Brother. Winston and Julia start to talk politically more and more until they finally decide to join the \\"brotherhood\\" and try and start a revolution.Will the revolution happen? Will Winston and Julia be caught and vaporized? These questions will be answered when you read this thrilling and prophetic book that George Orwell believed the world would be like just decades after the release of 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Until last year I had never taken the time to read this book, even though I was familiar with many of the now iconic references (ie big brother, newspeak, groupthink etc.). Let me say that I was missing out. Whatever you may think of the realistic nature of the society he portrays etc. the reason I think this story is a true work of art is because you cannot remain the same after reading it. The narrative is so unpretentious yet so powerful; the description so concise and vivid--I had a complete picture of the entire story without Orwell having to describe every nook and cranny of his world. This book will reach out and grab you and not let you go. It will twist and grind you, make you care about the characters, fill you stomach with fear and paranoia, and give you a taste for what it is like to live in a totalitarian regime.The only thing which has come close to me is when I took part in a totalitarian regime simulation in high school. I was in a class entitled American Problems, where we took a look at...well...problems in American society. One of our activities was to have a taste of no democracy for a week and take part in a mock totalitarian regime. I will never forget this week. I was randomly chosen to be the third highest ranking official in class next to THE CHAIRMAN and her assistant. I was the high judge. I was a member of the party and could sentence people for breaking class rules. We all had to memorize 15 party articles and recited them every class, sing the party song, have meetings, elect new party members, wear our uniforms to class, solute each other in the halls (this was the funnest, other people were like WTF?). Violations of any of these things would bring severe punishments (not real of course, no lawsuits). Anyway, the pressure was incredible and I actually felt myself getting more paranoid. I tried to get the assistant to THE CHAIRMAN demoted but my two assistant judges voted against me and I got booted.I also successfully ran an underground paper that I posted around school every few days with the help of a friend. We made it look like we had many members in our \\"resistance\\" but it was just me, heh. Anyway...you get the point. Nothing compares to that week but this book.A true work of art not only invites you to take part but demands your attention, and will leave you a different person. 1984 is one of the finest novels ever written in this regard. I will never be the same after reading this masterpiece and I cannot recommend it enough."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell wrote 1984 as a warning to the Western World against the terror of totalitarianism and loss of personal freedom. Through personal observations of Spain, Italy, Germany and the former Soviet Union, Orwell saw how state control of the economy, and eventually fascist political regimes subjected their people to totalitarianism with political terror that included threats of physical and mental torture.Using a fictional story about Winston Smith and his lover Julia, Orwell spins a tail about government regulation gone awry, and compliance with government mandates brought about through threats of torture, imprisonment, and loss of social status. Orwell wraps into this story the intrigue of not knowing who to trust, whether that person is a high level inner party member (O'Brien), a shopkeeper (Charrington), a lower level party member (Parsons), or his children. Having served in the US Army, this book vividly reminded me of the former Soviet Union prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall.In addition, the Appendix explains \\"Newspeak\\" whereby the political elites change the meaning of words. Newspeak reminds me greatly of modern day's \\"political correctness\\" campaigns, wherein \\"truth\\" can be manipulated or changed by whomever is in power. This brilliantly written book uses a dark, frightening backdrop of a \\"negative utopia,\\" which reminds readers to cherish the freedoms that we currently enjoy, for the time may come when our freedoms cease to exist, if we do not remain vigilant.Dr. B Leland Baker, author of Tea Party Revival, The Conscience of a Conservative RebornTea Party Revival: The Conscience of a Conservative Reborn: The Tea Party Revolt Against Unconstrained Spending and Growth of the Federal Government"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is one of those rare books that really affected me right down to my very core. I was actually a little shaken up after reading it. Going in I knew this wasn't going to be a happy story but I didn't realize the lasting impact it would have on me.1984 is a book about totalitarian control over a society. Big Brother is always watching. Always.This story follows Winston Smith. He works for the Ministry of Truth. The Ministry of Truth is hardly as truthful as the name implies. His job is to fabricate history and rewrite it. History has been rewritten so many times that nobody seems to know true history - Winston perpetuates these \\"truths\\" so that the party is always correct.In Oceana there are no real freedoms. You don't even have the freedom to think. Right from the beginning Winston shows signs of going against the party. He covertly writes in his journal, which is not allowed but at the same time he blends in, he does his job and he does his best to keep the spotlight off of him. Soon enough he meets a young energetic (and oblivious) girl named Julia who is also going behind the back of Big Brother.I'm not going to go much further into the story, this is something you just have to read yourself. This book hooked me right from the beginning and I charged through it in just 2 sittings (something a bit abnormal for me, I'm a little bit of a slow reader). I just couldn't put this book down.I'll try to leave the story be, but I do want to bring up one of the more disturbing aspects of this book - newspeak. Newspeak is a language (or dumbing down of the English language) that is being developed throughout the book and its the only language in the world where words are being stripped away from the lexicon, rather than added. The new language strips away the feeling of words, for example the phrase \\"All men are equal\\" doesn't make sense in newspeak because \\"equal\\" would only mean equal in size, not equal in freedoms. The greatly simplified language is being developed to dumb down society, to control thought.1984 hit me like a ton of bricks. I was actually quite emotionally drained after reading it. I'm typically not too much of a softy with these types of things but 1984 successfully made my eyes well up a bit and may be the only book that has done this to me. At times I almost wanted to tear this book apart, only because I didn't want it to even exist in my imagination - not because it's a bad book. Yes 1984 is frightening. Very frightening.I'm currently playing catch-up, trying to read all of the books I should have read in my younger days. If I ever read a better book I will update this review, until then I must say 1984 is the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's book 1984 is a great, symbolic book that makes you ponder the reality of a manipulated world. This book tells a story through the horrific presence of the unknown dictator, Big Brother.I am a freshmen student and after reading this book I can honestly say a message has been received. I now understand what a manipulated world would be like in the hands of a figure such as Big Brother. 1984 is a classic, fast read book that will have you surprised, shocked, and disgusted.The story is told through the life of a man named Winston Smith. George Orwell's goal to make a negative utopia has been achieved. As stated in a review, this book has become one of the most terrifying novels ever written. Big Brother exploits the citizens of London through television, speakers, guards, violence and power. Through the terror and stress of every day life, Winston Smith, alone and misunderstood, seeks to find the good in life and the bad in Big Brother.This book moves at a great pace and has riveting scenes that make you shiver. George Orwell depicts each character with such detail which adds to the tension and anxiety building up throughout the book. This book cautions us against the gaining power of the media and of the government. The only downside to 1984 is that much of Orwell's writing and references are hard for high school students to understand. I do realize that many people will understand this novel and be able to interpret the detailed meaning but I am looking at this book from a high school perspective.1984 is a great book that will leave you shocked and troubled. I highly recommend this book as you will experience a thrilling story, but also benefit from its message. This is a bestseller which deserves the honors it has and continues to receive from readers everywhere."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I found this book to be very revealing, and also a bit scary.

What a vivid imagination Orwell possessed as he created a futuristic world in which everything is strictly monitored. Everyone in the book seems to be frightened to death to go against the system. I had heard my,&quot;Big Brother,&quot; speak of this book in my younger days and decided to explore the novel myself. Complete enjoyment is what I experienced while reading this wonderful piece of literature. Experience it for yourself whenever you can because it's well worth the time.

A few, however, I have been unable to put down and one of those is 1984. This book compelles the reader to think, something so few people do today. It is incredibly frightening to think about living in such a tightly controlled society where one cannot even hold one's own opinions! To live without love and sex and opinions or emotion of any kind is truly terrifying. The book is so enthralling, I could not finish it the first 2 times I read it. Imagining the depths of the Ministry of Love and thinking about what would await me in my own personal Room 101 gave me nightmares. No other book has produced such an effect on me. It doesn't matter how accurate he was about communism or whether or not communism is really bad. The fact remains that it is a wonderfully written and incredibly creative piece of work."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I first read this book 4 years ago, at the age of 13, and it became one of the most important influences on my life. When I finished it for the first time, I was simply amazed, and have read it four times since. One thing I'd like to say about this novel: stop regarding it as 'political'! People make alot of references to it when talking politics (ie the relations between PC and Newspeak, etc) but this isn't the book's main purpose. This is a book about a man struggling to find freedom, happiness and truth under an oppressive government of power freaks. It also asks philosophical and psychological questions, such as 'what is truth?', and 'what does it take to break the human spirit?' , which are masterly integrated into the plot. The aesthetics and reality of this novel are also great. It really adds to the suspense and mood of the novel. That's all I have to say. When you're done and feel like something a little more uplifting, read its 1994 sequel, &quot;Orwell's Revenge&quot;"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is an excellent book but it has been misinterpreted.

It stands out with books like Ulysses by James Joyce and Gone with the Wind. This book was a frightening prediction that will probably come true. I'm not saying that it'll come true in the near future, but in, maybe, 1000 years or so. I don't want to give away too much of the story, but this book does contain many fictional things, but those fictional things might become factual 1000 years from now. Like, for example, telescreens, mind reading, vaporizing (which is something you'll learn about in the book) which includes brainwashing. I, personally, thought that this was by far the best book I have ever read. But when you read it, read it with an open mind. If you are not thinking strait you may miss out on an important plot twist or quote that can change the story. Again, this is one of the greatest books in the world, and it'll be bad if you don't read it with an open mind; it would be a major shame if you didn't understand this material. The story line could change the way you see things, almost completely, as did mine and my other, sane, may I add friends who also read it.

I just can't believe a 1949 novel turns real in 1999, that's 50 years! If you don't know what I'm talking about.... that's because I'm just too exicted.

Orwell's depiction of a world that would result in total governmental control was a horrifying vision that was all too close to a reality.

I am glad that I read this book becuase it gave me an insite into what will result if we give our government too much power."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When I first read this book, at first my head was filled with suicidal thoughts, at that extent the ending fills one with desperation. Then, I thought: &quot;no, I want to live&quot; to live in order for this world never to become reality. I have read many reviews of this books, and some have dimissed it by giving it one or two stars. Saying that this book is either unrealistic or too depressing. Too depressing? One must take into consideration the fact that this was written a year when everything was seen pessimistically, people were not sure of their future, and a myriad people thought the future not to be a brighter place, but even darker. Under such circumstances the result is not going to be Cadbury's roses. For the so-called unrealism, when you say that the rat scene is highly improbable for a governement to implement, you must not be aware of what is going on in the world, not only is it very likely to happen, but has already happened. Torture does exist, by the way, and if you think that what goes on in the protagonists head is &quot;unrealistic&quot; then the book's words: IGNORANCE IS FORCE is probably true. All in all, one of the best books of this century, that I advise all to read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book, which should be canonized, in definitly the best book ever. I carry a copy of it with me everywhere. But the thing no one seems to understand is that the book has absolutly NOTHING to do with Winston Smith, but is rather about a self sustaining dictatorship and how it functions. Smith is merely a vessle, a exsample. People who say &quot;I hate this book&quot; simply don't understand it. The Government should hand out copys and make every one read it(also known as school), but those of us intelegent enough to appreciate, enjoy, and understand this book already have.

There's a lot more to this novel than what is on the surface level. It's not that it's a true outlook on what 1984 was actually like but it's a look at humanity and what civilization could be (is) like. It's best put as a &quot;negative utopia -- not dramas of what life could be ... but nightmares of what it is becoming.&quot; I reccomend reading Imagining Argentina by Lawrence Thornton after reading this novel. That will truely show you that this nightmare that Orwell has envisioned is a reality in parts of our world."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Brilliant, simply brilliant. I will resist the temptation to make my review the shortest one here by saying that I think that 1984, for all of its literary value must be regarded as one of the greatest literary works of all time. The way in which George Orwell composes his purposeful sentences makes us reminisce of the style of Daniel Defoe. Here is a book, similar to Brave New World and We which shows what we may be coming to. A definite read. I couldn't put it down for a moment."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I disagree entirely with the review from &quot;Chinaman&quot;--not only is this a great story, but it IS happening in his country--and has been since 1949--that's the whole point!

Without giving out the ending, I didn't feel that Orwell used the characteristics of his character well. Maybe I'll need to re-read the book to understand the true meaning of the book because I didn't get it in my first try.

The motto of the book, \\"WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.\\" These are the statements used by the party to make ocenias society abide to its laws. Orwell uses this novel as a passage to describe the blind patriotism that powered dictatorships, such as Adolf Hitler, Soviet leader Joesph Stalin. Orwell uses Big brother its revered leader of Ocenia, just as the Germans cheered for hitler and respected him as their beloved father. Ocenia uses big brother as their all mighty protector who will watch over the citizens. Pictures can be found everywhere which is a reminder of Chinese communist leader Mao Tse-sung. A fantastic novel"},{"Title":"1984","review":"The novel, published in 1949, takes place in 1984 and presents an imaginary future where a totalitarian state controls every aspect of life, even people's thoughts. The state is called Oceania and is ruled by a group known as the Party; its leader and dictator is Big Brother. Winston Smith, the central character, is a thirty-nine year old man living in London. He secretly hates the Party and decides to rebel by starting a diary in which he reveals his rebellious thoughts. These humble beginnings lead him to greater thought crimes, until he has an organized secret love affair with another enlightened woman. Soon, he is caught by the ever watchful thought police, hence he is tortured and turned into yet another mindless subject of the Party, feeling only love towards Big Brother, and hate towards Oceania's enemies.My reaction to this book was most likely much less appalling than the average reader in 1949, because at that point in time this speculative future for humanity would have seemed much more possible. With today's powerful democracies, I believe that this dreary potential for humanity has very little chance of happening in reality. It was fascinating to think about, though, and raises the question \\"what if\\" many times in my head. What if Germany had held its territory in Europe in World War II? What if the world was greatly influenced by the fascist and communist governments, and split up into three totalitarian super-states? These thoughts racing through my head was very delightful. As for the book itself, it is wonderfully written, with you constantly wondering when or if Winston will succeed, or when or if he will be caught. It is fast-paced, exciting, and ends with an extremely depressing conclusion, that turns Winston's rebellios actions to nothing, as he turns into the exact thing he fights. This book will entertain, because its fast paced futuristic storyline and intriguing background will make you think about it for days, and speculate as to what really could happen. Highly recommended-I loved it for all of these reasons, and easily finished it in the small amount of time that I needed to for a school project. A definitive page turner.-Alex Bogrand"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I found this novel extremely thought provoking. It is a book every young and old American should read to learn what could easily happen to their civilization or rather what is happening. George Orwell is acting as a visionary in telling a story that is becoming reality more each day. It is frightening to think if the government in our society is not stopped they can become equally as corrupt as the Party in Oceania. The thought that the government not only controls what you are doing each day, but also controls how you think is terrifying.The brilliant novel kicks off with Winston Smith, a member of the Party, climbing up flights of stairs with his throbbing varicose ulcer aching. The thirty-nine year old goes through his life second guessing the Party and all it stands for. Winston starts by recording his thoughts in a diary. After reviewing his thoughts he even wondered if he himself was indeed a lunatic. Through the book he is running from the dreaded Thought Police. Winston became involved with Julia another enemy of Big Brother. They met up secretly in multiple hiding spots. There they exchanged words about their combined hatred for the Party which followed with romantic pleasantries between the two. Inevitably the two are captured and brought to the Ministry of Love where their minds were molded into the stupid followers of the Party. At the conclusion Winston gives his soul up to the Party.This is a must read for all individuals. Even though written as a fiction novel the story 1984, can be linked to parts of today's society despite the fact that the year itself has since passed. The way the novel is able to draw in readers and immediately involve them in what events are occurring in the novel, is simply mind boggling. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a sense of excitement for the book they are reading."},{"Title":"1984","review":"OK I have been reading some reviews of this book. The book itself, is a fantastic story of a man (Winston) who is beaten down by the society he lives in. Unable to accept the Party, he commits a Thought Crime. He gets away with it for a while, but then he meets up with a girl and this leads to his down fall. Now lets not take the story at face value. The book was written in 1949 (??) just after world war 2. Orwell didn't actually expect his future society to happen by 1984, it probably seems like a nice far enough in the future time. We could rename it 2184 and it will have the same effect on its readers and be just as relevant.Big Brother in the book does not relate to some silly 1990's (2000's) fad TV show. BB is a political party. Now look around at our society. We have CC TV Cameras, a person can't use a phone of an ATM without the government knowing. You can't catch a train without cameras watching you. Neighbour sying on you looking for terrorist activities. (Like the Macarthy era, and now today)This book is a warning to us from the past about allowing government into our private lives. Will we be a free peole, of a society of slaves to a goverment party? This is what Orwell and Huxley (Brave New World) are trying to tell us."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I've been on a mission to read the all time best 100 novels chosen by the \\"experts\\" and by the readers. 1984, of course, is high on both lists, so I read it sooner rather than later.I enjoyed the book. I think it's hard for a book like this to live up to all the hype and the expectations, but 1984 is undoubtedly a masterpiece. While I don't think it's perfect, it certainly is close. The only bad thing I can say is that I don't care much for Orwell's writing style. It's a bit formal. I can say the same thing about Huxley, and it is, perhaps, the way English authors wrote during this time. I prefer an author a little more candid, like Vonnegut, or, a little more fluid and beautiful, like Fitzgerald. However, the formality works for this story. The three main characters are very well developed and you are drawn in. I really liked O'Brien, and can see that he is the symbolism of Big Brother. I love fictional books with messages, and 1984 is full of them. It's amazing to me how well Orwell could predict the future.1984 should be high on your list. Big Brother is watching."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Out of all the books surrounding the issue of communism, George Orwell's 1984 seems to stand out the most. Although the year 1984, the setting of the book, has passed and the author's predictions have not come true, readers are still frightened by the totalitarian government displayed in the book. 1984 is arguably one of the most controversial books of its kind. Readers question whether or not countries today will ever escalate to the super-states in the book. When the book was released almost sixty years ago, people were drawn to the book because of the growing threat of the Soviet Union. In this thought provoking, realistic, and well-written book, the experiences of the main character illustrate the evils of a controlling, totalitarian government that Orwell warns us to avoid.Winston Smith is an honorable member of the Party. He lives in London, in the year 1984. He does his job well and follows all of the rules, until one day when he begins to question the government, which is breaking the rules. Winston realizes that he has always subconsciously hated the Party, and he purposefully breaks the law. His thoughts against the Part escalate to the point where he and his girlfriend, Julia, desire to join the underground resistance called the Brotherhood. They are successful in this but are shortly caught, which they expected living in such a controlling government. Winston and Julia promise not to betray each other, even if they get tortured. Unfortunately they are tortured, almost to death, and do end up betraying each other. Apparently no one wins against the Party. Winston hears one man pleading with the guards:\`Do anything to me!' he yelled. \`You've been starving me for weeks. Finish it off and let me die. Shoot me. Hang me. Sentence me to twenty-five years. Is there somebody else you want me to give away? Just say who it is and I'll tell you anything you want. I don't care who it is or what you do to them. I've got a wife and three children. The biggest of them isn't six years old. You can take the whole lot of them and cut their throats in front of my eyes, and I'll stand by and watch it. But not room 101!' (p. 240)After being tortured for countless days, Winston finally submits by admitting that two plus two equals five if the Party says so. After this event he comes to love the Party because he is completely brainwashed; he is, in sense, a slave. This science fiction story is different from many others in that it takes a hold of the reader and does not let go. 1984 is also one of a kind; its plot is unique so it will definitely be attractive to readers whom have read many books.George Orwell did a phenomenal job making his book seem realistic. 1984 can be interpreted as a warning against governments alike to the one displayed in the book. Orwell wanted the readers to understand that they must learn from history and past mistakes or else become victimized by their government. The main lesson Orwell was trying to get across is that if authority is not questioned or challenged, authority will take advantage. Some people might say that 1984 is irrelevant because communism has already fallen, but they fail to realize that the \\"Party\\" can also symbolize corrupt leaders, the media, or even technology.1984 is an exceptionally well-written book. It seems to draw the reader in and get better as you read further. The reading is very suspenseful. Orwell also knows how much detail to use, which is rare in authors these days. He is praised for his literary devices and even his poetry in his books. Animal Farm, another famous book by Orwell, is basically one big metaphor with personification mixed in. An example of poetry in 1984 is in an old book Winston finds. This poem is symbolic of the future concerning Winston and Juliet: \\"Under the spreading chestnut tree / I sold you and you sold me: / There lie they, and here lie we / Under the spreading chestnut tree\\" (p. 77). Combining great prose with a controversial and interesting theme will undoubtedly make a good book.Making the reader think deeply is what makes a good book great, and that is exactly what 1984 does. The main science fiction theme this book displayed was perception of reality which makes the reader think; something that the television rarely does. 1984 is a necessary read for those interested in science fiction and should be read in high schools everywhere. Many of the concepts Orwell predicted almost sixty years ago have become normal in our lives and that is why everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell, one of the finest writers throughout the depression and world war two, has so brilliantly created a novel based on a prophetic concept of totalitarianism. From \\"Thought Police\\" to \\"Big Brother,\\" Orwell has defined the potentiality of a future government gone mad. This novel is a classic with all the right aspects.1984 is based on a man's curiosity of change turning into an adventure through a power structure we come to know as Big Brother, and his obsession of rebellion, however silent, which later turns into a nightmare. George Orwell puts you into this man's shoes to experience what psychological and physical torment such oppression would bring. You read the text as though it were a history lesson in the future. In the story Orwell demonstrates what it would be like in a power-driven socialistic society. For example: Winston Smith (the subject) works at the Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and fine arts. His job was to correct, or retype, all the history books, or any literature of historical facts for that matter. This was because the Republic was trying to erase any history, and memory, of the past; the way things were before the rise of Big Brother. This demonstrates the ideas and intensions of the regime; to have complete control over the truths, freedoms, and thoughts of humanity.That is really what this book is about; the regime, the power, the insanity and possibilities of an authoritarian rule. Now I'm not saying that you have to be a total anarchist in order to appreciate this book, it is, however, important to understand how power, or total control, can overcome and obliterate the freedoms and ideas that make us who we are. George Orwell has expressed this daunting initiative and should acquire the respect he deserves."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell is the name of a modern equivalent of a prophet. He deciphered the writing on the wall and adapted it to novel form.When I read this book I could practically see, smell, taste and detect the sterility of his surroundings as well as sense Winston's numbness. Not only masterfully crafted, it is stark and chilling social commentary. Had I not learned better by reading this book itself I might have deemed it required reading.In my view Orwell offers what could possibly be seen as a critique of Ayn Rand's warnings of collectivism and redirects her warning at authoritarianism.Recommended companion reading: Orwell's other classic \\"Animal Farm\\" and Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\"."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a book of great importance, no matter the time or socio-political period that we live in. It is a bizarre and somewhat scary piece of literature that relates closer to our current social situation than one may think. I am a college student who has just read this book for the first time. The parallels between Big Brother and our current political administration is astounding, I had no idea. I would recommend this book for everyone. This book makes the reader think critically about our current political environment."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"Big Brother is watching!\\" This phrase has been so popularly used that the meaning is now synonymous with issues like \\"manipulation of truth\\", \\"violation of privacy\\", \\"conspiracy theory\\", etc. \`1984' is a cleverly written political satire often induced with dark humour, exploring life in a would-be fascist-like totalitarian future where everyone was being monitored and compelled to keep in line ('thoughtcrime' is a crime!), where the individual could no longer differentiate between truths and lies (through the practice of \`doublethink'), where history was being constantly re-written to suit the prevailing political agenda, where language had been simplified to the point of uselessness (through Newspeak), where war had to be kept ongoing to reduce economic surplus so that the population could be held under control, and where party ideology had absolute power over a society dominated by fear, suspicion and distrust.We follow the story of Winston Smith, one who disagreed with the party and was secretly envisioning a different kind of life without being under the ever-watchful eye of Big Brother. His hatred for Big Brother and his attempt at joining the rebelling Brotherhood ultimately ended in tragedy and he was captured, tortured and brainwashed. Orwell's gloomy depiction of life in Oceania (his future version of London) is realistic and convincing. The last section of the book is especially thought provoking and really sends chill to the spine. Overall, Orwell's vision of the future in 1984 is intense and highly disturbing. Although we all know by now that our 1984 (dominated by the MTV/big-hair/yuppie culture) has occurred very differently and that the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s marked the final triumph of liberal-democracy over socialism/Marxism, Orwell's \`1984' remains relevant today as a warning against a post-global age of resurging absolutism and religious fundamentalism. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Other Side : L'altra Faccia","review":"this book shows the work and the sensibility of a incredible photographer.so many emotions your can see trough these eyes.Merci pour ce merveilleux partage et pour l'homage rendu a ces Hommes sans abrit dont le regard est si profond. livre magnifiquement troublant. thanks..."},{"Title":"The Other Side : L'altra Faccia","review":"I saw this book for the first time in a restaurant in Manhattan, last night.

At the time, Barth wrote a book for specialists, not for general readers and his work has become a minor classic in the field. However, anthropology has gone through many a twist and turn since then. It is doubtful if many anthropologists want to read the same book today. I recently did. I have no idea whether nomadic life continues in Iran today, or, if it does--- (the New York Times recently reported a 'nomad conference' that took place in Ethiopia with some Iranian participation)---if it resembles the description in this book. We might call Barth's work \\"social history\\" now. It is a book that gives no quarter to non-specialists. If you can't use industrial-strength kinship terminology, you will have a hard time following several chapters. However, there are a number of interesting matters, for example, the nomads' animals thrive best if kept to a nomadic life. Staying all year at one place increased mortality dramatically. More centrally, nomad women had a stronger role to play than those in villages because their cooperation was an economic necessity. Decision making at the lowest level of nomadic society (chiefly about moving or not moving camp) was complex and subtle, due to the relative independence of everyone and complex family relations. The connection of the Basseri nomads with other nomads and with the larger, sedentary society was equally interesting. The tendency of richer nomads was to invest surplus money in land; the tendency of poorer nomads to leave the nomadic life and settle down as landless labor in villages. Barth contrasts nomad and sedentary, not as separate ethnic groups so much, but as different life patterns extant in the same country. A vast social gulf existed between powerful village landowners and the subject landless laborers, but among nomads, though all were subject to the chief, each household maintained considerable freedom and, as long as they had enough animals, economic independence.Barth concentrated on describing economic, social, and political organization. There is virtually nothing else in the 153 pages. You can admire this focussed approach so typical of the time, or you can regret the lack of a more humanistic style which would have allowed the nomads some voice, given a reader more sense of people and place, examined symbol and ritual to a far greater extent, or provided some clue as to Barth's own role among the Basseri. Alas, self-revelation was not often thought of in that era, we can hardly blame him. What startled me was the information that the author spent only three months with the Basseri. I finished the book wondering how accurate his description was, and how much reflected a fine theoretical mind with an innovative cast. Barth did seem to be properly cautious about what informants said, but with three months, he would not have had enough time to observe actual life. Thus, if the author had stayed longer with the Basseri, a different book might have been written. Like Margaret Mead, Barth seems to have made the most out of a short period of field work. I can only admire him for that, but questions do remain."},{"Title":"Nomads of South Persia: The Basseri tribe of the Khamseh Confederacy","review":"Had a paper to do in school and this was one of only around two books I could find. Definitely worth the purchase. Told me everything I needed to know."},{"Title":"Nomads of South Persia: The Basseri tribe of the Khamseh Confederacy","review":"As is the custom of Barth, this book is informative but incredibly boring. The story of the Basseri is detailed and interesting but Barth has a style all his own and to say the least it is not engaging."},{"Title":"A Low Life in High Heels: The Holly Woodlawn Story","review":"A madcap race through the sixties, and a must for those who are into pre and post stonewall sixties, and all of the mayhem that was involved. This is one of the best additions to gay and lesbian history, because for once it gives credit due to one of the first trans-gender actors in cinema history (Andy Warhol's Trash).Holly gives us the gift of what it was like living amongst all of the glitter and the headlines of the pop culture decades...being picked up (as a homeless person) from your squat in a limo only to have lunch with Diana Vreeland (an event Holly once told me about when interviewed) shows that all it takes is the right shade of lip colour and some chiffon and off you go! Holly was the third in the trinity of Warhol girlettes that paved the way for RuPaul, Lady Bunny, and even you and I to be able to live our lives, and to be free.One will want to grab a cocktail, and share in Holly's memoirs of her race, to beat the sandman as she went from one life inspiring moment, to a piece of queer history. Thanks Holly, for sharing with us!"},{"Title":"A Low Life in High Heels: The Holly Woodlawn Story","review":"I'm a big fan of the Warhol Superstars and the \\"underground\\" films he made in the late 60s and early 70s. Holly Woodlawn is one of Warhol's most beloved and long-lasting of the superstars. She really only stands out in one film--\\"Trash\\" but it's a performance so memorable that it's all she needs for everlasting underground star status. This book really captures the \\"Woodlawn Persona.\\" Wisecracking, self-depracating, uncouth, dishy, bitchy, delightful! It's proof positive that Woodlawn is her own greatest creation. How much credit should go to the ghostwriter (billed as \\"with Jeff Copeland\\") I can't say. But Holly graciously gives him plenty of credit--and whatever his input, he certainly knows how to write in Woodlawn's \\"voice.\\" The Holly Woodlawn story is like no other. She was a product of mixing with the right people and good timing and a ballsy attitude. It could have only happened in the 60s and Holly certainly took advantage of all the crazy things that era had to offer. This book is a romp. An epic. An extraordinary journey. I recommend any admirer of camp, pop art, or orignal, madcap personalities to read this."},{"Title":"A Low Life in High Heels: The Holly Woodlawn Story","review":"This book is interesting and at times very funny, but don't expect anything too shocking.

In an optimistic treatment, Polidoro has produced a fictional chronicle of the cloning of a sports legend from hair collected from a barbershop floor. The relationships between idol, fan, businessman-scientist and wealthy donor are very plausible, and are, most likely, predictive of the type of group that will eventually achieve the first human cloning, although I doubt that the Nobel Committee will pronounce a favorable judgement of it -- and the millionare would most probably want to clone himself."},{"Title":"Project Samuel: The Quest for the Centennial Nobel Prize","review":"my 17 year old son and i both have read all of jack's book. we think he is a great writer and always look forward to the next. this book was outstanding!!!! he just keeps getting better and better!"},{"Title":"Project Samuel: The Quest for the Centennial Nobel Prize","review":"Another great read by Jack Polidoro.

You will just have to read it yourself."},{"Title":"Project Samuel: The Quest for the Centennial Nobel Prize","review":"Project Samuel is truly visionary and scary. It deals with baseball, genetics, cloning, athletes and science. It just comes so close to reality that it is spooky. The author writes a great story - as with all of Polidoro's novels. He knows how to spin a tale and make it both entertaining and even educational.This is a page turning book - once you open it up and begin you will not be putting it down until you finish it.

Polidoro's tale shows how this is possible."},{"Title":"Project Samuel: The Quest for the Centennial Nobel Prize","review":"Polidoro has captured one of the hottest subjects being discussed today: Human Cloning. This book weds the scientific aspects of biotechnology with the unscruplous desires of a wealthy Texan and incorporates the author's love of baseball to produce a highly believable text for hijacking the human body. The technical data are presented accurately, yet clearly so an advanced degree in medical science is not necessary to grasp the technology being described. A perfect book for the sports enthusiast as well as the current events fanatics. The potential for the movie industry is obvious!"},{"Title":"Project Samuel: The Quest for the Centennial Nobel Prize","review":"The premise of cloning from a living celebrity kept my interest all the way through.

Well, he didn't... in the story as he presented it, there was no controversy, with the exception of a few animal rights activists. Are you kidding me?!? The entire story was unbelievable, baseless, naive and repetitive. On top of that, it was also incredibly poorly written. Which brings me to the question I ask in my review title. Did anyone edit this book? The dialog was cringe-worthy, the story flowed horribly and there were numerous grammatical errors. Not to mention the huge errors in timeline continuity! My favorite involved a character telling her husband that she's just found out that she's pregnant, and attributes it to a sex act that took place over 8 months earlier in the story. How does an editor not catch that? All in all, it's typical of a book by someone who has what could be a very interesting topic, but thinks that all you need to do to write a good book is put together a happy ending story, and randomly plop in a bunch of lame pop culture, historical and geographical references (what do the swans in the public garden have to do with anything??) While clearly, based on other reviews presented here, there are people who enjoyed this book, I myself can't think of any audience for whom this novel would be appropriate.

This novel is pure genius ... the plot, the writing, the location (San Diego is my favorite city in the world), the biotechnology, and the characters. The biotechnology alone was fascinating, written in layman's terms as to not overwhelm the reader with the real heart of the story. The plot was a refreshing change for this medical thriller junkie who has grown tired of the \\"uncontrollable virus in the hospital\\" or \\"corrupt mega pharmaceutical company\\" stories that tend to be the norm for today's medical thriller authors. The only thing I found a little annoying is the inconsistency with the characters' names. For example, within the same paragraph or page, Mr. Polidoro would refer to Mr. E. Royston MacDonald as \\"Roy\\", \\"MacDonald\\" and \\"Royston\\". Not a biggie, but for me, it flows better if the names were written consistently.My New Year's resolution for 2005 is to read the rest of Dr. Jack's literary works.

Dillinger then gives a detailed comprehensive explanation of VLSI. Beginning with the design and layout of integrated circuits, because VLSI circuits are massive combinations of these. There are discussions on how to scale up from the IC to a full VLSI layout. The pros and cons of a modular standard cell library versus using a full custom approach. The latter can give better optimisation in some aspects, like performance or area on the die. But often at a cost of greater complexity and development.There is good coverage of placement and wiring algorithms. The latter are significant because often nowadays the area taken up by wires might exceed that of the cells themselves.Test methods and design rule checking are also covered. The book ends with a chapter on VLSI processing steps.The book is from 1988 but most of it is still germane. If anything, issues like design for testing are even more important now than then. An update of the last chapter would be useful, giving details on deep submicron processing that did not exist in 1988. Plus, current state of the art layout may have quad metallisation, instead of at most dual metallisation in 1988.

Each Atlantic record breaker since the SS Great Western of 1838 is described in detail and depicted with an original profile drawing, most of which are in color. Some notable ships are covered in less detail even though they were never record breakers. A small section tiled &quot;Super-liners that never were&quot; covers several shipbuilding projects which were never completed.Liners of all eras (Kludas identifies three distinct periods of Atlantic steam travel) are covered more or less equally, and thus the ten 20th century liners have fewer pages devoted to them than the 26 19th century ships.

Fiore (Assistant Dean of the College of Education, State University of West Georgia) is a straightforward guide written especially for teachers, principals, and others who share a mandate to educate young minds. Individual chapters capably address how to deal with parents that prove difficult in any number of ways including abrasive personalities, hard to reach, excessive anger, and a host of other ill traits and situations. Dealing With Difficult Parents is a solidly recommended emotional and verbal self-defense manual for fostering the best possible learning environment."},{"Title":"Dealing With Difficult Parents And With Parents in Difficult Situations","review":"The authors of this book have provided excellent insights for educators, both at the administrative level and the classroom level, for dealing with parents. One of the key benefits to this text is that it provides clear and practical ideas as to how to prevent parents from being difficult to begin with.Most educators are keenly aware of the critical nature that early communication plays in maintaining parental support for the school's role in their child's life. However, many, due to time constraints don't follow through and things wait until issues have become emotional. As a result, dealing with parents can be an unpleasant experience. Whitaker and Fiore show how with a calm nature, teachers and principals can defuse these situations. Some of the ideas require that the educator remain calm and not become emotional themselves, a difficult task to say the least, but not becoming emotional, as the authors point out, is one of the keys to being viewed as a professional.In my opinion, no teacher education program should let their students get by without having read this book."},{"Title":"Dealing With Difficult Parents And With Parents in Difficult Situations","review":"The book has many very good points and suggestions for educators to deal with difficult parents.

This book describes how one goes about becoming an expert in the field of cartridge case and bullet comparisons to determine if the one used in a crime came from a suspects gun. It describes all the available equipment, like the comparison microscope, and how to use it.This was used for many years by the FBI as their basic training textbook and went through many editions as more and more sophisticated equipment became available.This is a replica of the first edition and is highly interesting reading, although it becomes quite technical at times. It is amazing how much equipment there was available at that time. Like all of Hatcher's work, it is well written.

So Louanne sets out on her quest to find her admirer, but it's harder than it looks, and Louanne keeps hitting dead ends. Now she'll never know who her secret admirer is.Nancy Carlson has done a wonderful job of creating an adorable Valentine's Day book for young readers, in which they can identify with the character. Her short, yet sweet prose on each page is easy-to-understand, and her lovely illustrations depict what is going on perfectly, making it easy for even the youngest reader to know what is going on.

I was disappointed with the book to say the least. Every character that Louanne \\"investigates\\" as her possible secret admirer reacts to her very negatively. I think the story could have been told without shouting, name calling, food being dumped on her head and knockng her down. I would have much preferred more positive outcomes from each inquiry she made and don't think it would have detracted from the story at all. In a day and age when we lack positive role models and struggle with ill mannered children, a book that reinforces that these behaviors exist and are acceptable is a disappointment. The only saving grace of this book is that it presents an opportunity to teach and emphasize that these behaviors are not acceptable."},{"Title":"Louanne Pig in the Mysterious Valentine (Nancy Carlson's Neighborhood)","review":"Louanne the pig has an age-old problem: She's received a beautiful valentine from an unidentified admirer!

This book, along with the Chinees Maze Murders, is probably the best of the Judge Dee books.The plot of this story involves three disparate events, a rape/murder, shenanigans in a Buddhist temple where women with fertility problems are apparently giving birth due to divine interventions, and a corrupt businessman who is involved in a bloody family feud. Along the way, Judge Dee and his assistants have an encounter with the bell that is the title of the story. Van Gulik ties up everything in a tidy package that is engrossing and gives the reader an insight into ancient China.What is impressive about this book is the historical accuracy and insights about the Chinese character given by Van Gulik, no doubt due to his service in the Dutch foreign service and his credentials as a Sinologist. The Buddhist influence in T'ang Dynasty China and the corruption of monks was a constant problem and Van Gulik is not complimentary in his portrayal, which is similar to the unfavorable portrayals of Buddhism by Chinese writers throughout history. Also, the corruption of businessmen in China and the conflict between northern and southern China is well portrayed. Only a Chinese or somebody who is familiar with China can understand the nuances and conflict.As one of the original five Judge Dee books (this one is the second book in the sequence), the detail and the plot are very much in line with the famous Chinese stories of the day, albeit in a more compact form. This lends authenticity and makes these stories better than the later Judge Dee stories, which are still good."},{"Title":"The Chinese bell murders (Avon books)","review":"Rebeccasreads highly recommends THE CHINESE BELL MURDERS in which Judge Dee solves the mystery surrounding the death of a young girl, where all the evidence points to the guilt of the deceased lover. on her wedding night.Judge Dee-Jen Dijeh (630-700 A.D.) was a Magistrate known for his wisdom & wit in China, & his stories were a part of the local folklore. Robert Van Gulik, who had a historian's interest in China in the early 1950s, was fascinated by the tales of this judge, & finally collected & fictionalized them into four volumes.The wit, ingenuity, & genius of Judge Dee is well reflected. Remember the old tales of King Solomon the Just -- well, give them an Asian flavor, a touch of Old China -- & you get Judge Dee.All of Judge Dee's books are most pleasurable - - worthy of 10 stars!"},{"Title":"The Chinese bell murders (Avon books)","review":"This book is part of Van Gulik's Judge Dee series of 'historical fiction' that chronicles the cases investigated by the famous magistrate from classical Chinese detective stories. Despite being written more than 40 years ago (first published in 1960), the book remains surprisingly readable even today.The story is well plotted and full of historical details of Chinese culture and practices of the period (the author having been a diplomatic envoy based in China for many years). A refreshing change from typical detective novels, this book is and others in the series are unique and deserves a place on the shelf of every mystery fan."},{"Title":"The Chinese bell murders (Avon books)","review":"Admirers of Robert van Gulik's always delightful Judge Dee mysteries have another treat in store with The Chinese Bell Murders. In this novel, Judge Dee is newly arrived in the city of Poo-Yang, and he begins by re-investigating a case that his predecessor, Judge Feng, could not complete since Feng had had to leave when he was reassigned to a new posting. In that case, an impoverished literary candidate named Wang was on the verge of being executed for the rape and murder of a butcher's daughter; however, Judge Dee cleverly and immediately realizes that the real culprit was someone else!As in all Judge Dee novels, there are two more mysteries for Judge Dee to solve before the reader happily comes to the end: the case of a decades-long feud between two families who hail from Canton and some nefarious goings-on at a Buddhist temple. At the Temple of Boundless Mercy, barren women who spend the night, as often as not, later conceive. While the temple's abbot, who goes by the name of Spiritual Virtue, gives credit to the goddess Kwan Yin, Judge Dee suspects otherwise. Although in most Judge Dee novels the three mysteries are intertwined, in The Chinese Bell Murders, the mysteries stand alone and are solved consecutively.In solving all three crimes, Judge Dee is ably assisted by his loyal and enterprising staff: a longtime family servant turned sergeant, Hoong; two former highwaymen, Ma Joong and Chiao Tai (whom Judge Dee first met inThe Chinese Gold Murders) and the former conman, Tao Gan (who joined Judge Dee inThe Chinese Lake Murders). What a pleasure to meet up with Judge Dee and his lieutenants again! While The Chinese Bell Murders was the third book that van Gulik wrote, the novel ranks eighth chronologically. None of that matters, however, as -- unlike with some mystery series, which must be read in order so as to make sense -- readers will enjoy Judge Dee novels in whatever order they read them.Unlike most Judge Dee mysteries, The Chinese Bell Murders begins with an odd supernatural set-up. Readers new to Judge Dee should not let that put them off. The mysteries aren't the least bit twee, and all of the novels provide an illuminating glimpse into the 7th century China.Judge Dee is based on a real-life Chinese magistrate during the T'ang Dynasty named Ti Jen-chieh, a name van Gulik simplified to Judge Dee Jen-djieh. Van Gulik first introduced Judge Dee to the West inCelebrated Cases of Judge Dee (Dee Goong An) (Detective Stories), first published in 1949 (although not translated into English until 1976). As in the other novels, for the three cases in The Chinese Bell Murders, van Gulik took his inspiration from original ancient Chinese cases and 18th century Chinese detective stories, although van Gulik changes the case enough, removing much of the coincidence and supernatural elements so that he makes the stories his own."},{"Title":"The Chinese bell murders (Avon books)","review":"Yet another strong entry in Robert Van Gulik's series about a crime solving Imperial Magistrate in seventh-century China. In this book, Judge Dee has taken up a new posting in the large and flourishing district of Poo-yang on China's east coast. The district seems prosperous and relatively crime free, so the judge's retinue consisting of his faithful retainers Sergeant Hoong, Ma Joong, Tao Gan and Chiao Tai are all looking forward to an easy posting. But contrary to all expectations, the team has to deal with several crimes in the district soon after arrival. A young girl has been raped and murdered with her killer absconding and the judge is also asked to look into a long series of crimes committed by one of Poo-yang's wealthiest merchants Lin Fan by one of his victims who may have her own hidden agenda....To make matters more complicated, the judge soon learns that the monks in the wealthy Buddhist temple in the area may be preying upon unsuspecting women and cheating them of large sums of money by promising them that they will be able to conceive a child by offering prayers and money at the temple! This may seem like an overwhelming series of problems, but Judge Dee with the help of his assistants is able to clear up the various crimes with his usual flair and wisdom. Enormously entertaining, both for its wealth of historical detail about ancient China as well as for its finely plotted mysteries. Highly recommended for fans of the series and even those who are just looking for a good mystery read."},{"Title":"The Chinese bell murders (Avon books)","review":"This lovely mystery shows Judge Dee, the Chinese Sherlock Holmes, hard at work as district magistrate in Van Gulik's ancient China.

But Dee notices an anomaly...and sets out to find the real murderer!One of Dee's assistants notices something fishy about the wealthy Buddhist temple in town. Dee tells his subordinate that the Buddhists are too powerful in the Imperial Court for an investigation to be pursued. Even more shocking, he appears to accept a bribe from the monks...but it turns out Dee has a clever plan to get at the truth!An old lady comes into court with a complex legal case and a complaint of murder against a wealthy Cantonese merchant.

In fact I have purchased every one that Amazon offers. These are superb Asian-flavored legal mysteries, impressive because of the historical accuracy and insights about the Chinese character given by Van Gulik. In this book one of the cases the Judge solves (there are 3 different cases) is the mystery surrounding the death of a young girl on her wedding night. Needless to say Judge Dee gets to the bottom of the murder and solves all 3 mysteries. It's important to note that Judge Dee-Jen Dijeh (630-700 A.D.) was a real Magistrate known for his wisdom in China, and his stories became a part of the folklore of China. Robert Van Gulik was fascinated by the tales of this judge and wrote a fictionalized series featuring the Judge in the early 1950s. If you enjoy well crafted myteries that are full of wit, clever plot devices, action and adventure as well as great descriptions of food and culture, you'll love all the Judge Dee Books just as I do."},{"Title":"The Chinese bell murders (Avon books)","review":"I have read all the Judge Dee mysteries at least twice, and really love them. However, I have just read a number of books on China and discover that van Gulik has purposefully mislead readers to make ancient Chinese justice just like Western justice and rather appealing. The truth is almost the exact opposite.If you are interested, a standard history of china by harvard professor John Fairbank and Merle Goldman, China A History, explains that the Chinese justice system was openly corrupt (corruption did not have to be secret - it was and is the accepted way), relied on torture of both plaintiff and defendent, had no consistent laws, no equal punishments for the same offence (everything was based on class and kinship status) and bascially was just like modern Communist law: it was a vehicle for the state to control behavior. The goal was not 'justice' in the Judeo-Christian sense but state control.Also like Communist China under Mao, imperial law relied on collective punishment to terrorize the populace. The entire population was divided into groups of ten and one hundred families, and if anyone in the whole group was condemned, the entire group could be executed. For serious offenses against the state, thousands of families could all be executed.Van Gulik is always showing citizens bringing disputes before the court. In reality, this was never done (as both sides could be tortured and both sides had to pay the court and both sides had to bribe the court). Instead, people relied on their village elders or clan heads to rule on disputes, as the court system was too dangerous.Most of the ideals that Van Gulik gives to Judge Dee of fairness, protecting the weak against the strong etc. are Christian values that go back to the Jewish Bible (God creating all men equal, protect the weak and the stranger, equality before the law etc). They are antithetical to Chinese values from imperial to modern times. It is very important not to pretend that foreign cultures are the same as we are...or that our values are universal. They are very special treasures that we should be incredibly grateful for.The Judge Dee books also mention women's tiny feet at times, but he never tells the reader that until 1900, all upper class and middle class women in China had their feet broken and maimed leading to their being crippled for life, unable to walk normallyeuphemism - binding their feet). From the 19th century, this custom of torturing and crippling women spread among the peasants also. 10% of girls probably died from this treatment.Van Gulik prominently features 'courtesans' and 'prostitutes.' A more accurate term might be slaves or sex slaves.We are often told that China was 'more advanced' than the west until modern times. In truth, they were most comparable to ancient Rome, a cruel and despotic slave-owning culture with admirable roads and art. But Rome at least had rule of law, something China never had.So, enjoy Judge Dee - but take it for what it is, bascially a fun Western mystery story set in a lovingly recreated period piece, kind of like most Hollywood movies - great costumes, great settings, fun plots, endearing characters - all basically unrealistic."},{"Title":"Web Site Construction Tips & Tricks (1001)","review":"This book could be useful if the examples actually worked.

Suffering from a lack of long-haul mileage from its freight operations, which would have provided more revenue generation, the CNJ was in and out of bankruptcy throughout much of its history before disappearing into the Conrail system.CNJ rostered a wide variety of diesel locomotives from most of the builders.

Pamphilus, the main character, is torn in a realistic way and buffeted by tragedy he cannot express. He falls in love with a tragic and beautiful hetaira, a highly cultured courtesan who recites plays and poetry and encourages young men to examine how they live. This beauty of this kind of character must have been quite differently perceived by the ancient Greeks because the main problem with her according to Pamphilus' family is that she is not Greek. After her tragic death, the members of her household are sold into slavery but her younger sister is rescued by Pamphilus' very just and reasonable father after learning of his son's love for the girl (Pamphilus has impregnated her but will not be permitted to marry her). This is the portrait of a young man attempting to capture some answers about love and meaning. There seem to either be a scene or two missing or Wilder intentionally left critical events out of the narrative and there is a slightly awkward foreshadowing of Christianity. Pamphilus' out is presented as a very Christian type of acceptance of his situation informed by Christian love and this feels a bit forced. Other than these minor blemishes, this is a nice little novella even if it's not terribly filling."},{"Title":"Aging Defiantly: Meeting the Challenge at Any Age","review":"This is the real deal!

The beauty salon context, i.e., &quot;getting a haircut&quot; is a section that is not in this book but could be very useful. This book is very affordable and helpful...just keep in mind some of the phonetic transcriptions, which already difficult in Thai to English, could have been more accurate."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Thai Phrasebook (Lonely Planet Language Survival Kit)","review":"My husband and I found this small book to be a huge help as we attempted communication in the marketplaces of Thailand. I prefer to use books like this as a reference, pointing to the Thai phrase next to the English phrase I want to communicate. Conversely, my husband actually studied the book from the beginning. He was able to learn to pronounce and understand many useful phrases in addition to numbers (which came in very handy while bargaining). We enjoyed this book so much that I am already ordering the Mandarin version for our trip to China in 2005."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Thai Phrasebook (Lonely Planet Language Survival Kit)","review":"I wouldn't bother with this one. Although I am a big fan of LPs guide books, this phrase-book was not particularly helpful. 9 times out of 10 they didn't have what I was looking for and when they did it was a real hassle to find. The pronunciation guide was not that helpful but the food section was good. If you already have the guidebook you could probably get by w/out this, but if you feel you need something, get a used copy over there(or maybe an Amazon auction.) If you do get fed up with it (as I did), it makes a very nice gift for a Thai friend. Next time I'll bring a pocket dictionary. Hope this helped."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Thai Phrasebook (Lonely Planet Language Survival Kit)","review":"After traveling using a Berlitz phrasebook in Italy, I went to Thailand, and bought the only one available -- Lonely Planet. It is terrible.The tone markers don't make much sense. They are not intuitive.The Food section has something advertised as a &quot;menu decoder&quot; when it is really just the same section all over again. Compared to Berlitz's food section for Italy, the LP guide is rather lacking.The Dictionary section is very lacking. It doesn't even have all the words listed elsewhere. The index is the same way. It makes finding information in the phrasebook next to impossible.Unfortunately, this phrasebook has just been whipped out as a companion to LP's monopoly on guide books.

Which makes it all the more impressive considering the amount of information that is contains. My only real complaint of the book is that though it is organized into sections like \\"checking into a hotel\\" or \\"ordering food\\" it can sometimes be difficult to find the phrase you are looking for at the time you need it. However, after having made a few trips to Thailand now, I now realize how good this book is. What I would recommend is that you read through the book before you travel and highlight key phrases you think you might use. Normally, for a phrasebook that might be painful to try to read through it, but this book has a lot of interesting information on Thai culture, customs, food, history, etc. that it isn't simply a list of phrases or a dictionary. And if you are like me and a little slow to pick up languages, you will find the book even more useful after a few trips to Thailand."},{"Title":"Readings from the Perspective of Earth (The Earth Bible Series)","review":"The Earth Bible Series represents a daring and timely new interpretive approach: listening and responding to Bible texts from the standpoint of Earth. This first volume in the series, with a foreword by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, explains the six &quot;ecojustice principles&quot; that underly the approach and contains 14 chapters by an international team of biblical scholars that illustrate how Earth-centered readings can yield interesting and challenging new perspectives on selected Bible texts. The selected texts represent the books of Psalms, Amos, Jeremiah, Tobit, Wisdom of Solomon, Matthew, Luke, Romans, 1 Timothy, Hebrews, and Revelation. Some results: Terence Fretheim's retelling of the Earth story in Jeremiah 12 leads to an increased appreciation of Earth's central place in the creation theology of the Hebrew Bible. Keith Carley's reading of Psalm 8, by contrast, shows how a biblical text can downplay and devalue Earth so that Earth might want to offer its own counter-Psalm in response! Vicky Babalanski offers an Earth-reading of the Lord's Prayer in Matthew 6 which shows how the prayer focuses on God's kingdom on Earth in such a way that the present time (not just the future) may be an arena for new life-giving possibilities. An inspiring collection, suitable for personal reading, discussion groups, and the classroom. I'm looking forward to the succeeding volumes in the series."},{"Title":"The conditioning of distance runners,","review":"I believe this booklet was originally published by Track and Field News Magazine Press in 1966.It is now available on line - see Tom Osler's website.At the time, late 1950's and early 1960's, I ran Cross Country and Track in High School and College. When I wasn't hurt, Cross Country was fun and Track was sometimes nerve wracking and sometimes rewarding.I had a small handful of good results but was not a success by any measurement.It turns out that what I learned later, from Osler's book, about endurance training was priceless - 25 more years of running and 20 more years of cycling and swimming.Osler's booklet was a big part of that learning.As I saw it, there was little organized coaching available for distance runners. Most Track and Cross Country Coaches seemed to rely on natual talent and often, inavertently, contributed to overtraining, overuse injuries and inconsistent, disappointing results.I believe there was a large amount of systematic study of this subject in the USSR and East Germany. Results were published in \\"sports science\\" journals and were often not available in the US or not translated.In hindsight, I don't know how much might have been usable vs. how much might have been dangerous for serious athletes (unacknowldeged use of steroids and other experiments in \\"doping\\") or inappropriate (for fitness runners).I had heard the term \\"periodization\\" but could not understand what it meant.Osler's little book addressed all of this - how to rest and how to know when to rest, how to push towards better conditioning, and how to avoid setbacks like overuse injuries and mental staleness.There are now large and often good volumes of work on the subject of conditioning distance runners and endurance athletes of all types.In my view, they add a great deal of useful detail, but haven't added many principles beyond what Osler long ago explained very concisely."},{"Title":"America The Beautiful 2001","review":"It matched the description to a tee and I think it is so important the young people are exposed to the full poem and song. &#34;America the Beautiful&#34; is a wonderful honorable memory of what our country was meant to be."},{"Title":"America The Beautiful 2001","review":"Kathleen Lee Bates wrote America the Beautiful in 1895 on her way to the 1400 ft Pikes Peak, Captain Zebulon Pikes died young like Wolfgang Mozart (Wikipedia). Pikes was an American explorer who found the Red River (really it is the name, does it remind you of the film Mosses?). It run along the border between Oklahoma and Texas. The Red River joins the Mississippi River in Baton Rouge near LSU. The redness of Red River must come from the red boulders of Pikes Peak. Speaking of Louisiana, New Orleans has the same mascot as Nova Scotia Canada. Of course, the early New Orleanians were French Cajuns moved south from Nova Scotia (Wikipedia). These French immigrants ran from their life in Europe, then to New Orleans. We visited Pikes Peak many years ago, it was indeed beautiful. There is a Pikes Peak national park created to protect the artifacts passed down from the Colorado cliff-dwellers. We rested at Manitol Springs to acclimatize. Manitol Springs reminds me of what Leonard Berstein said about some people lived in Winnepeg Canada had never seen the ocean. He played Debussy la mer for them. You see. Monitol Springs and Manitou Lake in Winnipeg are pretty much the same, they are places for the wearied and the sick to rest. Bates went to Oxford University for a year after college. Before Oxford, she wrote O Mother Dear, Jerusalem. 15 years later Oxford, she wrote America the Beautiful. She took yearly train trip for about 30 hours to the Pikes Peak for her summer vacation. At 32 years old she married her husband who was the first president of Wellesley.

Simply put, Chris Gall is one of my favorite artists of all time. His style is bold, campy, and original.Today, I received the books and I was AMAZED.The book, \\"America the Beautiful\\" is BEAUTIFUL. What is even more beautiful is that Chris Gall shares in the preface how a framed copy of Katharine Lee Bates' verse, written in her own hand, inspired him so much as an artist as he was growing up.Gall bestows a MAGNIFICENT tribute to his great-aunt's stirring song. Each line of Bates' meaningful verse is paired with a beautiful illustration by Gall. These works of art depict a nation blessed with God-given gifts; a nation built on justice, optimism, hope, and a shared love of America's land.After viewing this book, which is pristinely made with thick paper and rich colors, I intend to buy several more as gifts. There are wonderful images of the Statue of Liberty, Pike's Peak, immigrants, the Apollo II, and my very favorites - the firemen of Sept. 11th, and the WWII Tuskegee Airmen.Because \\"America the Beautiful\\" is not just a book which is great for artists or children or to grace the coffee table (although that is where MINE is going!), it is a work of art - which magnificently stirs the patriot within us all..."},{"Title":"America The Beautiful 2001","review":"The odd thing about this book is why it took so long to come out. Chris Gall is an illustrator and the great-great-grandnephew of Katherine Lee Bates so I wonder why he had not created these pictures ages ago.The sixteen stunning pictures were engraved on clay-coated board which makes them very graphic rather than watercolor soft and I enjoyed the little design touches here and there, for instance a picture of some Shoshone Indians in a boat passing a very streamline looking waterfall or a small town snow scene with the buildings placed at different angles to each other.The choice of image is also refreshing, to illustrate 'A thoroughfare for freedom beat. Across the wilderness!' has a family with their Airstream parked in the open landscape or 'Thine alabaster cities gleam, Undimmed by human tears!' showing a window cleaner eating his lunch and sitting on one of those Art Deco eagles on the Chrysler Building. This kind of originality and warmth comes across from each picture.The book is well produced and it occurs to me that these illustrations are so good and all the same size that they are worth framing, depending on one's favorites."},{"Title":"America The Beautiful 2001","review":"This book is an excellent depiction of the song. We have been reading it with our daughter since she was 2 years old, and now she is quite familiar with the words of the song as well as with many areas of the country, major landmarks, and significant events. This is a great addition to your library."},{"Title":"America The Beautiful 2001","review":"Wendell Minor has been busy this year, having illustrated picture books documenting 2 American heroes, which were published only a few months apart. INTO THE WOODS and RACHEL tell the stories of patriots, John James Audubon and Rachel Carson, respectively, who struggled to preserve the beauty and health of their native land. Now Mr. Minor has produced another picture book of equal radiance, focusing on the country that those heroes, and he, obviously love. The author is, like Audubon and Carson, another American legend, Katharine Lee Bates. Although her name is not familiar to many people, the poem she wrote certainly is. Here the entire song--not just the first few lines that most Americans have memorized--is emblazoned above Mr. Minor's spectacular paintings. Were she alive today, Ms. Bates would surely find this book comparable to the beauty of the country she wrote about in the first place. AMERICA depicts not only the \\"purple mountains\\" and \\"amber waves of grain\\" of the first stanza, but breathtaking landscapes from every corner of the nation. The monumental natural landmarks--enormous cliffs of the West, Niagara Falls, the Grand Tetons--are shown as well as quieter, but equally striking, scenes of farmers harvesting wheat in Iowa and steamboats pushing across the mist-shrouded Mississippi River. Even the light beams in Manhattan where the World Trade Center once stood are captured forever in an elegant painting. AMERICA allows readers to visit the most far-flung and spectacular areas of the nation in only 5 minutes, so realistic and compelling are the illustrations. And seeing Bates's poem in its entirety will rekindle readers' feelings for our musical heritage, no matter how many patriotic tunes they've heard since 9/11. This book is a dignified and vibrant testimony to the greatness of this nation, worthy of being shared with all kinds of patriots, young and old, for years and years."},{"Title":"America The Beautiful 2001","review":"The book has good illustrations and it has the song five times.

We have read it so many times over the past year, that she is the only child her age that knows all four verses of this wonderful song."},{"Title":"America The Beautiful 2001","review":"This book is a wonderful way to introduce the song \\"America the Beautiful\\" to a child, and enjoy it yourself at the same time. Wendell Minor has done an outstanding job of illustrating the words to this song by painting pictures of real places to match a couple of song lines at a time. It makes one feel like they are being swept across the country as they read or sing the words, as if we were seeing exactly what Katherine Lee Bates was seeing when she wrote the original poem. I also like the fact that at the end of the book there is a spread which again shows a small picture of each of the illustrations and then tells the reader where this place really is. Overall, a very good way to learn/enjoy the song."},{"Title":"America The Beautiful 2001","review":"A visual record of a cross-country trip that was inspired by the poem America the Beautiful with vibrant, expressive watercolors set in pastels and earthy tones.There are fourteen panoramas in this thirty-two page book that covers east to west and north to south. One line of the first verse is placed on one side among the two-pages. The waterfalls appear misty with the dark clouds looming behind. This image was captured in rainbow colors tapering off as the water hits the bottom. The rolling hills are dotted in pinks, purples and greens as the spacious skies flow across the page.Then we have the calm ness of the bulls or buffalo grazing before turning to find the purple mountains majesties. The fruited plains consist of teal green and blues showing a few people working in the fields. This is a beautiful picture that gives the image of working in the fields as rewarding and serene. The second page with America! as the text is spectacular with tall bare trees as if you were standing down at the bottom looking up at them. It appears to be a moment captured of a father and son looking at the forest.This is a beautiful one-of-a-kind book that deserves to be sitting on the coffee table to highlight the splendor in these images set to this patriotic song. Inside are man-made wonders, natural ones, ancient dwellings, glaciers, desert, sea and rain forests. The colors evoke a range of emotions as you flip through the pages of America the Beautiful. Now that I have these portraits nestled in my memory the song will take on such new meaning.Readers young and old can delight in the beauty that can be found along the roads traveling inside the United States. This would make a great gift for anyone planning summer excursions within the country. America the Beautiful would be appreciated by older relatives to remind them of the locations they have visited as well as offer the younger ones a sense of the beauty that is found at these places while learning the words of the poem and singing the song."},{"Title":"America The Beautiful 2001","review":"Samuel Ward (1847-1903) was the organist at Grace Episcopal Church in Newark in 1882. One day a melody popped into his head as he was riding the boat back from Coney Island. He called it \\"Materna\\" and it was first published in 1888.Katharine Lee Bates (1859-1929) was an English professor at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. In 1893 she made a trip by train to Colorado. From the to of Pikes Peak she saw the Rocky Mountains in one direction and the Great Plains in the other, and she felt inspired to write about the beauty of America. Her poem was published in the Fourth of July issue of The Congregationalist in 1895. Her poem was popularly sung to Ward's tune, and they were first published together in 1910.(...)Later in the 1900s Neil Waldman was staying at a kibbutz in Israel. His friend Moti Shuvai insisted that they take a road trip together through America. They traveled from New York through the Northern Rockies, down along the Pacific Coast, back through the Southwest and the South to New York, 13,000 miles. Waldman combines his sixteen paintings, \\"a visual record of that first cross-country trip\\", with the words to \\"America the Beautiful\\", written by Katharine Lee Bates, to make a children's book that celebrates the scenic glory of America. \\"...it should inspire readers with a desire to see these wonders for themselves.\\"(School Library Journal)In the foreword he says this, \\"...I have traveled to four continents and more than a score of countries, but nothing I have seen can match the magnificent splendor that lies within our own borders.\\"Parents will have a chance to tell about when they have visited these places, or make plans with their children to do so, because an appendix describes all of the places featured in the paintings. They include Niagara Falls, The Great Smoky Mountains, The Grand Canyon and the California Redwoods. Families also could talk about the beautiful places in Michigan or even Livingston County that Bates and Waldman unfortunately never had a chance to see. Or other places you have visited that are not included like Florida, Alaska, or Hawaii.This book also helps to make art and poetry accessible to children of all ages, and each child can relate to it in his own way. The folks at Publishers Weekly relate to it like this: \\"...he renders each vista in thick, impressionistic strokes from a predominantly violet palette, choosing his colors as if from a paradigmatic sunset.\\" (If that helps you at all.)Also included are all four stanzas and sheet music."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I think Anne Rice started out writing one book and it just happened to turn into something else. I personally found this to be an interesting book and have loved it since it was published. Here's how I see it: Lisa is someone who has always been a little lost and out of touch with others. She is even more out of touch with herself. She seems to have no close friends, has uneasy relationships with her family and is basically an unhappy person. However, she finds something - BDSM - that excites her powerfully and makes her feel like she belongs at last. \\"Exotic\\" (described as such by Ms. Rice) seems like a revelation to her, and she immerses herself in it by creating a fantasy world that is highly successful for a lot of people. But utlimately it doesn't fulfill the need she has to love and be loved and to truly belong. In fact, there is always the part of her that remains ashamed of what she does and who she is, despite the fact that she knows very well that there is no real reason for it. Then she meets Elliot, who has similar issues apart from the shame, and they fall in love and run away together.Mostly, it's about belonging, and not wanting to feel like an outsider or an outlaw."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Although I am an avid Anne Rice fan, I initially bought this book because the back cover proclaimed it to be &quot;the modern Story of O&quot;. Since Story of O is one of my favorite books in the genre of erotica, I just had to buy it, but then it seems that such sweeping claims hardly ever turn out to be true.... The book starts out strong, with intensely erotic scenes focusing on Lisa and Eliot and the beginnings of an interesting love story, but as the book progresses the characters seemed to become less and less realistic: by the time I finished it, I felt extremely unsatisfied. If you're an Anne Rice fan, this is a good book to read, if just to see how she fares in a genre other than horror, but overall there's much better erotica out there, and this book definitely does not live up to its claim of being as good as the Story of O."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"As other reviewers have said, this book certainly doesn't compete with other erotic classics as the back cover claims. It starts out strong with some of the most tensely erotic scenes I have ever read in a book to date, with Anne Rice's usual amazing writing style, but quickly fades from erotica into a simple love story with many dimensions, as much of her work does.While I must confess that this is certainly one of my favourite books that I have ever read, it does not support the claims that are made with regards to the work within the pages. It is not a 'modern day \\"Story of O,\\" although Anne Rice has certainly done much work in examining the S/M scene.Unfortunately, those who are experienced in this particular scene will notice a few glaring errors in the claims that she makes in the novel, and may very well cringe to see these mistakes made by such a profound author. While Rice certainly believes in her work with some great zeal, those with experience in their own lives will see that her own experiences perhaps do not match their own.The books real saving grace does, however, come towards the end of the book, as we begin to follow Elliot and Lisa more closely, realizing the true sparks that have flown between them. The characters are intensely real and believable, so much so that the reader may feel as though they have entered into the very hearts of the characters about whom they are reading.If you are looking for a good erotic read, then this probably isn't the book for you. If you are interested in the S/M scene and are hoping for more information and ideas, then this is also not the book for you. If, however, you are interested in getting deeper into Anne Rice's amazing world and love her writing, then this is a worthwhile read for any fan."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"A friend of mine told me to read this book,so I thought why not. I just fell in love with it. I liked it so much I reed it twice. I also recommend her Sleeping beauty series. If you like this book you will love the series to."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Anne Rice has surprised me with this novel, although I found some passages hard to understand and even harder to read this makes for a very quaint love story in the end. I found myself laughing at the basics of Lisa because even as complex as she was she couldn't be complex enough to understand love and its many traits and faces. Elliott Salter is a handsom and riveting character...he was well planned in my opinion and even well written. One can just imagine how he would have really looked if they would have done the movie \\"exact\\" but then again they never do.I found this book a little more mellow and easy to read then some on Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles that I had started before. Then again I found Tolkien a bit hard at times as well...maybe it's just me. But she brought out another side of herself as a writer in this book and I enjoyed the story. The sex scenes weren't as graphic as I would have liked, I expected serious S & M and I found only mild play at some points. I would have liked to have seen the arcade described a little bit more. Just small things. This book is not for the light hearted though...if sexual acts still remain taboo in your mind and family then stay away from this novel."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"The book is heavy. Sexually heavy. Written with a serious tone. Exciting. Riveting. I cannot praise it enough.This is a must read - and if you liked any of this modern sexual series (Fifty Shades, Silvia Day books, etc) then you may not like that you have to think in this novel.But if you are smart and you want something that really grabs at you, then pick this up and leave all these light toned fluffy series alone."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I found this book very odd. NOT for the bd/sm subject matter but more for the fact that the first half of the book seems to be running in one direction and about mid-way thru it it takes an entirely different turn. It kind of starts out as a *virtual erotic club med* vacation and switches to an almost old fashioned simple love story (two people, who against all odds find each other kind of thing).. Im not sure why I found this so disturbing...probably because neither promise (erotic story vs. true love story) was really ever fulfilled.I suppose either premise would have made a good book. Ms rice is an elegant writer who can make some of the most unappealing things seem palitable. Her discriptive style is excellent and you *are* transported where ever she takes you. Perhaps this book would have been better as two books. Or maybe its just that the original premise of the two main caracters, their whole personalities...styles..personas all of a sudden changed for each other...and neither seemed to jusify the change in the other. And I never really got the feeling that either of them was eachothers soul-mate...The first half of the book had more promise as an intriging read probably despite the erotic premise not because of it...but the second half seemed like a modern day romance novel that never did *gel*"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Eden, a secret, mysterious and elegant island in the Caribbean is a play-ground for the rich. It is the place where those with enough money can come to fulfil their fantasies about dominance and submission. A paradise where willing slaves are available for those who would be masters, where pain and pleasure intermingle and nothing is forbidden or impossible.Lisa is the perfectionist mastermind behind Eden. She has set the rules, invented the games and oversees the smooth running of the whole operation. Eden is what Lisa has been yearning for all her life, the answer to all her sexual and spiritual needs and yet, when she returns to Eden after a vacation away, Lisa finds herself restless and, for the first time ever, unsure of what she really wants.Elliot is a client. Suffering from severe burnout he has been trained to be a slave in Eden and has recently signed a contract to stay there for two years while he flees the life that no longer satisfies him.When Elliot and Lisa meet sparks fly. Neither of them expected to find real attraction in Eden and neither of them, but least of all Lisa, is prepared for the conflict and confusion these new feelings bring with them.When Lisa flees Eden, taking Elliot with her, she's not only breaking all the rules she so carefully set herself, she is also opening herself up to the sort of turmoil she's ill equipped to deal with.This is very much a book in two parts. While the first half of the story is very much about sex, submission and dominance, the second half is more of a psychological study, with sex firmly in the background.In the first half the reader learns, in rather graphic detail, about the training slaves go through before they get to Eden and about the pain, pleasure, humiliation and power they experience from that training and life in Eden.During the second half though, all of that fades away. The story now takes us into the minds of Elliot and Lisa. And while Elliot has a pretty good idea what he feels, what he wants and how to deal with his emotions, Lisa is lost. When Lisa finds herself in a neverland between no longer feeling at home in Eden and deep fear of what a future away from the world she created might mean, she is in real danger of ending up with nothing.I found this to be a fascinating book because it goes beyond what could so easily have been a purely erotic story. It is obvious that Rice is a talented and experienced author. Her sentences and the story flow with ease and she captures the reader as much with her erotic descriptions as she does with the non-sexual scenes.Both Lisa and Elliot are wonderful characters to read about; flawed and struggling to find their way. They are made for each other yet unprepared for that discovery.I would have loved to have the opportunity to read more about the two of them, would have enjoyed seeing them return to Eden together and what they might get up to as a team. Since that particular book hasn't actually been written I will have to be satisfied with what I found in this story and that which my own fantasy can come up with.Yes, it would appear that I have developed a taste for Erotica in my \\"old age\\"."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I first read this book when recommended to me by a friend who termed it as &quot;beautifully sexual.&quot; At the time, I agreed with her - to a lesser degree. However, after having read it recently (along with an added maturity), I am surprised to see how typical the structure of the novel is so that it resembles a popular romance novel. Does this sound familiar? The plot is that of the initially strong woman who has (kinky) sex without guilt and controls the dominant &quot;gaze&quot; in her work. Yet she has this &quot;gaze&quot; threatened by a more dominant male to whom she succumbs to such an extent that she momentarily loses sight of her life and work. She is thus rewarded with marriage as there is nothing more rewarding for a powerful woman than to be dominated by an even more powerful man. There lies the psychology behind the success of the romance novel - the ultimate fantasy for the woman to be dominated and the man to dominate with rewards of lifelong sex i.e. marriage or the equivalent. The question is will the powerful husband let his wife continue on with The Club as before, or will maternal duties or the powerful man's instinct to seek ultimate control somehow see him at the the top of The Club?Lisa and Elliot (who is supposed to be a Ph.D holder!) sound, in the best sense, pseudo-intelligent and typical (too perfect in all respects), giving them the essence of plywood. Anne Rice jumps all over the place, not developing any of her interesting points (i.e. Lisa's conflict within herself, S&amp;M as pain to experience pleasure, etc.), and it is hard to see what point she is arriving at, if there is one at all. I especially dislike her use of Catholic symbolism as I find it one of the most banal and unimaginative ways to depict repression. As always, she has an interesting premise but her endings are awful. The fact that their love is consummated by a marriage (!) sounds hollow and hypocritical.So be warned that this is not literary erotica but a drugstore romance novel set in an unusual place but otherwise adhering to a formulaic structure."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Anne Rices' lush descriptive prose is what makes this book a personal favorite. Erotic in some of the best ways, the storyline never lacks for an interesting moment. I might warn the faint of heart that this book is not your run-of-the mill erotica, nor is it wholly reminiscent of the movie. The narrator point of view changes throughout the book, which I found a refreshing change from most books of this genre. If this book doesn't stimulate you, then you may wish to check your pulse."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I enjoyed the setting and details of this book. BDSM folks will really enjoy the beginning of the novel. It could easily have made a great book by just staying on the island. Once the characters leave to New Oleans, I felt the book kind of fell apart. The ending is poor and leaves you wanting to return to the island of slaves. I'd say buy to book for the beginning parts but don't expect those yummy parts to last throughout the book to the end. It loses momentum and ends without any sort of bang. Disappointing, but I still recommend it nevertheless."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I found this book to be rather silly. Never mind that the protagonists work at sex club, they are just two crazy kids in love. If you want to read a traditional romance novel where the character's pasts as S and M enthusists are hinted at, this is your book. I was trully surprised at how convential this book was and expected more from Ann Rice. The ending was particularly silly and Harlequin-esq."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I'm a huge Anne Rice fan, and I bought this to add to my collection. She has a style of her own. If you are a fan, I would recommend adding this one."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"This is a lovely erotic fantasy. There are glimpses of BDSM but it is not \\"hardcore\\".Do not compare this book to the movie of the same name ~ The movie version is camped up & changed to make the story light & funny ~ The actual story in this book is not light and not funny, it is more of a complicated romance, between two people who don't realize how much they need each other.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hopefully, you will too ~ and if you do, you may seriously want to pick up the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Exit To Eden was a okay read for me. It had a very dark and strong tone. I must say it kept me wanting to read on in the first few chapters.....However, somewhere in the middle of the book it lost me. But, I figured if I paid for it might as well keep on reading.The book is not for everyone just like everything else in life. Personally I don't think it was better than Fifty Shades of Grey. Can't wait for the movie!"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"The novel was kind of groundbreaking in its time in that it took subject matter (BDSM) that until that time had been completely hidden in more or less underground publications. It was written with commercial slickness, a quality that is sometimes off-putting in Rice's work. The characters are basically sympathetic. Ultimately, the novel is not as subversive as it would like to be taken for, suggesting that the characters will only be happy once they escape their alternative sexual practices. It doesn't give this impression unequivocally yet there is a linger whiff of conformism in this book despite the subject matter."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I gotta say that I was a little bit dissapointed in this book. I really liked the descriptions of the places and how colorful and vivid it all seemed. The part that made me dissapointed was when they left the island. The woman was a basket case and was very rude to people for little to no reason and I don't see how the men would have ever truly tolerated that. Once the left the island and the resort it went down hill and I found myself wishing for the rest of the book that they would go back and I was waiting for that moment and it never came. It was good but certainly not great."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I had never read any romance or erotica books before this one, so it was shocking and intriguing. I have read it again through the years, and I find, for myself anyways, that this is a 1-time read only, but that's ok. It was fantastic the first time I read it. It has very interesting characters. Forbidden love, erotica and bondage, a fantastic plot, and strong characters."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"If you have watch the film based on this novel more then once, then you'll find this book an interesting read. As usual film is very different from the novel, but this only makes it a good read if you are into S & M.Spoiler warning.Many of you probably want to read the chapter when Lisa was having sex Elliot. This is very different from the movie. In the novel Lisa is \\"doing him\\"."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Anne Rice wrote \\"Exit to Eden\\" under the pseudonym Anne Rampling. Unlike the Dan Ackroyd / Rosie O'Donnell film adaptation, Ms. Rice's novel is elegant pornography. \\"Exit to Eden\\" describes The Club, a Caribbean island resort where members can experience their sexual fantasies in a safe and luxurious setting. \\"Exit to Eden\\" is the story of Lisa, the boss lady slave trainer known as 'The Perfectionist'; and the story of Elliot, a free-lance photographer who contracts as a sexual slave.The Club is exclusive -- members are prescreened and purchase expensive annual memberships. The Club's trainers visit invitation-only global auctions where experienced adult sexual slaves offer themselves for hire. Club trainers bid on the best slaves, and slaves typically sign a two-year $100,000 personal services employment contract. [Serious omissions: No discussion of safe sex precautions, safe words or pierced jewelry. No discussion of penalties for serious discipline breaches -- e.g., monetary fines or unpaid contract extensions.] Slaves are transported belowdecks on the Club yacht to begin their Club training. Trained slaves are dominant or submissive according to Club members' wishes.Ms. Rice's novel describes BDSM elegantly and should appeal especially to women who fantasize about sexually dominating men. Ms. Rice's novel also provides psychological insights into conditioning humans for submission. I believe these psychological insights give \\"Exit to Eden\\" value beyond mere pornographic entertainment."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"...and besides all that, the writing is gorgeous, and the New Orleans settings are so wonderful. Ann Rice is truly a writer of many talents - and many and diverse interests.Kinky? Yes. Erotic? Yes? Fun? Yes. Should you read it? Yes."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I read this book in the late 90's and after reading 50 Shades of Grey, Exit to Eden makes the Grey series seem like \\"kid's stuff\\". (No not literately). E.L James has nothing on Anne Rice. This is adult erotica, the Gray series seems like erotica \\"lite\\". Maybe I was jaded by Exit, like a nubile, fresh faced first timer and a much older, experienced teacher. I still wouldn't go back."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Ann Rice writes erotica like no one else!! A must have for your library. Other favorites are her Sleeping Beauty series. Definitely not for the prudish. She has the ability to pull you in and connect to the characters. I couldn't put them down!"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I had only read Rice's Vampire Chronicles when I saw this on a book shelf - what a change! The writing seems straight out of a bordello on a Saturday night. By turns it is sensuous, informative, exploring, erotic and tender. The prime factor deciding my vote when I read a novel is this: &quot;Will I still remember the characters long after the book is over?&quot; In this case the answer is definitely yes.The relationships with the respective fathers and the play on the religious (Catholic) and Southern aspects are Rice staples but it was the latter part of the story that really made the book. There may or may not be such an isle in the Gulf but after a while you sorta get the jist of what happens. The escape and consequent action lets the book spread its wings and the author to again display both her love and knowledge of the ultra-languid New Orleans.The movie is a hoot but don't expect any kind of erotic feelings since it is strictly tongue in cheek."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"This book is a wonderful muli-layered novel... the depth of the characters is amazing. By the time you are finished, you know every desire and thought of Lisa and Elliot.This is a classic love story at the heart... however, it doesn't come with the romance novel sappy-ness or morality that curse many love stories out there today. Every page makes sense and advances the story... there are no &quot;filler&quot; sex scenes just for the sake of sex. It's erotic, not cheesy. I love this book more every time I read it."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"As with her other books, Anne Rice writes Exit to Eden with passion and superior knowledge of human feelings and emotions. With this book, she has created a stage for sexual creativity, lust, exploration and human emotion. Her portrayal of Lisa and Elliot, and their raw desire for eachother, is purely erotic. Each chapter keeps you wondering what might happen next and what is going through the mind of each character. The book makes me wonder what fire Rice has in her to make her write such a book."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Read By: The X-Files' Gillian Anderson and Ally McBeal's Gil Bellows.Breathy, amusingly shuddering reading of an S&amp;M romp that's much naughtier than the sanitized 1994 film version starring Rosie O'Donnell.Listen For: Bellows occasionally slipping into a laughable rico suave accent and Anderson waxing poetic on how her &quot;nipples throbbed.&quot;The Lowdown: Mulder and Georgia would be appalled.Grade: B+"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Movie was okay, I liked it. Never realized there was a book for it. I was buying more Anne Rice's books and saw Exit to Eden, I picked it up knowing if Anne Rice wrote it, it would be good. But... it was even better! A MUST READ! It was completely different than the movie! But totally BETTER! I recommend this book with no problem. You must be open-minded. I like the fact it went from The Club to real-life. I have read most reviews. I agree with people saying its the best. For those who say it &quot;trash,&quot; you may need to open your eyes and see the true world out there. It's not the 50's anymore. You have your opinions, but I have mine and this is an EXCELLENT BOOK TO READ. I have read the Witching Hour and the books to follow for the series. Anne Rice continues to amaze me with her works, specially considering this is a earlier written book! Amazing. Read it!"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Even with a good book, life still goes on. I would have loved to just read and read and read. I did pick up this book every time I had a few spare moments!The characters came alive and I found myself wanting the best for them. The ending came as a surprise to me. I wish there was a sequel- would LOVE to know what happened next!"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"[close] I was one of the fortunate people who was able to read this book before the film came out. I would like to open by stating that if you liked the \\"movie\\" starring Rosie O'Donnell, DO NOT READ THE BOOK. Likewise, if you read the book, avoid the movie like you would avoid a rabid dog showing signs of ebola.This is not Rice's greatest erotic work. It lacks the expansiveness of the Beauty trilogy or the vividness of Belinda. Those facts aside, this is an interesting work from a psychological standpoint (understanding the \\"top\\" and \\"bottom\\" or \\"Master/Mistress\\" \\"slave\\" relationships), and not a bad read for its sexual content and scenes. However, it is not the pathetic, vaguely slapstick comedy that the film made it into, and is nowhere near the quality of most of her other work."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"A friend recommended this book to me. Once I started, I couldn't put it down - it captured so many ideas I'd already been thinking. I then gave it to my wife, who, to my surprise, also loved. Needless to say, it has completely changed our lives for the better."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I have read almost all of Anne Rice's works and this is by far the best. It has similarities of the Beauty series yet adds a more modern and believable twist. I highly reccomend that all of her fans new and old read it at least a million times."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Exit to Eden is one of Anne's Best works, in my opinion. Many people were turned off by the film adaptation (why hollywood decided no one would want to see a bondage film is beyond me &lt;eg&gt;) but this book focuses on the relationship of Master and Slave and what happens when the tables are turned. Anne has many sides and Lestat is just one of them. True Rice Fans will adore this beautiful work of fiction."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"This is just the vehicle to make you forget that horrid movie, which unlike the book, had only one redeeming factor. The movie's saving grace was the costuming (except for the Dan Akroyd Character and Rosie could have lost about 50Lbs), the book however, a thrill ride from beginning to end! If you like your reading to be erotic, visual and entertaining, then THIS is the book for you. If Ann Rice has more like this on her shelf I want to read those too."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I was not able to put this book down.

Anne takes you to the point of being sexually submissive like no one ever will!"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I like to read erotic fiction from time to time. But if it doesn't have substance, it's nothing more than another trashy pornography novel. &quot;Eden&quot; was better than Anne's &quot; Beauty&quot; novels, but was definitely not for readers who want the zest they received from &quot; Interview with the Vampire&quot;."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"The story of a lucky Guy who had the time of his life with Mistress Lisa.

Like all of Anne's books, this one was very tastefully done. Well worth it!"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I picked up this title based on the recommendation of a friend, and I have to say I was rather disappointed. I expected Ann Rice to be a virtuoso. She turned out to be a hack with an anal fixation. The dialogue and narration is only slightly better written than Penthouse letters, and the effect is less erotic. The only reason I rated the book as high as I did is because it read quickly, so at least I didn't waste a lot of time getting through it."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I read Exit after watching the lousy movie with Rosa O'Donnell.

The scenes are stimulating enough to get even the most ice cold heart boil"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Exit to Eden has a serious tone, even a dark one - but it's an incredible, mind-blowing exploration of not only the erotica but of the psychology of B&D.;I mostly agree with njbookworm's review of Exit to Eden from 2001, with only a couple of exceptions. Note that Exit to Eden and the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy are not about Sadomasochism (S&M;) - they're about Bondage & Domination (B&D;). BIG difference. Look up \\"Bondage & Domination\\" in Wikipedia. An oversimplification of the difference is in the degree of pain inflicted/received, and the underlying mindsets of the Sadist/Masochist vs. the Dominator/Submissive.I especially agree with njbookworm that if you have not read any of Anne Rice/Rampling's books, don't start with this one. I personally prefer her Mayfair Witches books to the Vampire LeStat ones.I also disagree with njbookworm's comment that Anne's descriptions of the day-to-day workings of the Island and Lisa's responsibilities thereto are distracting. I found that those details didn't affect my suspension of disbelief, unlike njbookworm who was distracted by the legalities and even the possibility that a private island could exist solely for the purpose of a B&D; resort. (Although to be fair, perhaps in the late 90s those were hard to believe.) But without those details and the resulting depth of Mistress Lisa's character, Exit to Eden would simply be a run-of-the-mill bodice-ripper - albeit a dark, intense, and \\"kinky\\" one for the those unfamiliar with B&D.;In fact, I've found Anne's character development to be arguably the most important aspect of her talent. That, coupled with her talent for suspension of disbelief I can easily *become* the protagonist in her books, male or female.The \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" trilogy, however, is much more lighthearted in its tone, similar to Anne's \\"Beauty\\" trilogy (which truly are \\"kinky\\" bodice-rippers, though almost poetic in nature). Like Anne Rice, Ms. James has a flair for character development - provided you're reading at approximately an 8th grade level as does the average reader. No insult intended.Fifty Shades is told in the first person, also from the perspective of a young, naive virgin whose first lover is a Dominator. I love the internal dialogue the main character carries on with herself. A much lighter read, Fifty Shades mostly leaves out the psychological aspect of initiation to B&D.; The trilogy is most definitely erotic and a good read, but I prefer the more intellectual (dare I say literary?) tone of Exit to Eden.In summary, compared to Fifty Shades I found Exit to Eden to be by far the better book - provided you're open-minded and prefer more depth to the characters in your erotica. I give this one 8 out of 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I have read quite a bit of Anne Rice/Anne Rampling before. This book marks both a departure from her thougtful, sexy horror fiction (e.g. &quot;Lestat,&quot; &quot;Inverview with a Vampire,&quot; &quot;Mummy&quot;) and her fantasy-themed, erotic Beauty series (e.g. &quot;The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty&quot;). It kind of falls in between.The book examines the relationship between an intelligent, conflicted, strong proprietor of a S&amp;M-themed island (Female) and a passionate, creative photographer (Male). (As you may have already guessed, this is not a book for those with conservative sensibilities!)The relationship/chemistry between the main characters is interesting, believable, and sexy. Rice makes you feel as if you know each of them -- and are in the same room with them. You feel their passion and understand their internal struggles.My less-than-stellar rating speaks to the book as a whole -- the story arc, in particular.&quot;Exit to Eden&quot; reads like two books:Book 1: An interesting love story about a couple who's erotic pursuits help them tap into their feelings about each other, relationships (in general), and power.Book 2: A story detailing the maintenance and baggage associated with being the proprietor of a S&amp;M resort. (Think: &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; with velvet-covered handcuffs.)Also, because Rice chose to set it in modern times, you have to have a *major* suspension of disbelief. You must believe that an island like this is legal, feasable, profitable, &amp; enjoyable. I had a difficult time doing this.Summary: If you enjoy Rice's books and are looking for a departure from her typical themes, read this.However, if you're a person who would like to read your first Rice book, don't choose this one. I think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"When I picked up this book and scanned the back I caught that it was a sex club and a romance type book. I am not into S&M at all and at first I was nervous to enter into that world. But I really loved this book and have read it multiple times. Some one said it is a romance novel for people who dont like romance novels and I totally agree with that. Nothing felt cheesey, it felt heart felt and honest in its characters. Its not too hard core. If your looking for that, look elsewhere. Its just an exciting story that basically says love can find you anywhere. I am a very satisfied reader. Thank Anne."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I just need to say that this book started out quite s&amp;m like. Full of exciting sexual happenings.... but ended up as being just a really good 'happily ever after' story. Theres nothing wrong in that, because mind you i loved the romantic side to the story, it was beautiful. But it would seem that after the first few chapters, the whole s&amp;m or Master/slave aspects were just totally lost and gone. And if you've read the 'Beauty Series' by Anne Rice that is probably why you picked up this book. Well if you are hoping for something as satisfying as the Beauty series then you've chosen the wrong book. If you are into reading love stories and love to see happy endings where people run away and fall in love, then your in luck!"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I have read so much about Anne Rice - and finally managed to read one of her books - since I dislike anything with vampires thought I would give this a try. All I have to say is \\"where is the Club?\\" and where can I meet a man like Elliott?? wow! This is a very sensual tale about two people Lisa and Elliott who have enjoyed to the hilt such a heavy dose of an alternative s&m life style but when this couple finally meet - PASSION!! Much more powerful and intense for both of them than they have ever experienced. They both find themselves willing to risk anything to persue this opportunity with \\"love.\\" Rice actually allows you to see them fall in love in their flight from the Club. This is a strong powerful book and I found it a page turner."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I'll admit that I haven't read Fifty Shades. I refuse to. All the hype about it made me want to see what else was out there that was similar but well-written. This is a winner. I read the first Sleeping Beauty book, and while it was well-written, toward the end of it, I thought it was more torture porn than anything else -- not sexy, and then I couldn't get through the second book for the same reasons.\\"Exit to Eden\\" is different. The simplistic explanation would be that it's tamer than the Beauty books, but really, the big difference is the character development. It's almost a psychological case study of kink. What makes people gravitate toward it? Is it deviant? Can it exist within the realm of a healthy, loving relationship?Anne Rice is a genius with words. She manages to give Lisa and Elliot distinct, believable voices. The prose is both lyrical and conversational, and I never had a thought like, \\"Oh, no one would really say that or think that in that vocabulary.\\" So many passages worth underlining and rereading over and over. And it was HOT. Not to mention fun. I read somewhere that the rich are far more interesting to read about, and in this case I have to agree. Recession or not, I didn't mind hearing about the luxury at The Club or Elliot and Lisa's cushy backgrounds and disposable incomes.Now, this might be a judgment I can't legitimately make without having read the Fifty Shades trilogy, but I'll go ahead and say that after reading \\"Exit to Eden\\" and seeing a complex, fully developed story that has so many layers and a satisfying conclusion, I don't see how dragging out a story like that in Fifty Shades across three books could possibly be as fun to read when you can get so much more in this one quick, provocative novel."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I was told that Anne Rice's Exit to Eden was similar to The Sleeping Beauty series. While there are various similarities between the two offerings, the eroticism and BDSM scenes are far more subtle in this one. The novel centers on how the romance between Lisa and Elliot flourish amidst painful and confusing pasts. Lisa is one of the mistresses at The Club -- an exotic and erotic getaway for bondage enthusiasts. Sadomasochism has always been the center of her life. But then Elliot comes along. An insubordinate photojournalist, Elliot is always searching for the next thrill ride. He takes a two-year training program in The Club to vent out some of his submissive fantasies. But life in The Club is far more hardcore than he had anticipated. To make matters worse, he falls for his beautiful trainer...Anne Rice has once again showcased the psychological implications of the human heart. She delves into the aforementioned implications in a deeper level this time around. My only complaint is that Exit to Eden isn't as taboo and sexually charged as The Sleeping Beauty series. This book is more bodice-ripper than smoldering erotica. It's brilliant nevertheless. Even though her erotic novels aren't in the same caliber as Story of O, they have a profound sensuality all their own. Highly recommended..."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Don't confuse the movie with this book. There are no detectives chasing diamond thieves and this is not a comedy.Anne Rice took a break from writing her Vampire Chronicles series to pen \\"Exit To Eden\\" under the pen name Anne Rampling. This novel explores the subject of BDSM within the context of a romantic relationship between Mistress Lisa Kelly and Elliot Slater. Kelly manages an isolated BDSM resort that offers its high-end clients an exclusive setting in which they can experience the life of a Master or Mistress. Likewise, the slaves are there of their own freewill in search of fantasy exploration.Mistress Lisa gets first pick of the new slaves and chooses Slater. Their chemistry is undeniable from the start and intensifies throughout their time together. As the story unfolds, they fall in love with each other and must come to terms with the power dynamics of how Mistress and slave can become mutual lovers.Although fiction, this book reveals the potential correlation between BDSM and romance. Anne Rice is a wonderful author."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"This is my first Rice novel, and I have to say that I found this book to be terrifically written with all the splender of erotica and romance with a plot. I fell in love with most characters and found their instincts quite remarkable and to the point. That is to say, I was quite surprised that a woman author was able to capture the true essence of the male psyche so richly as Rice has done here. I loved the book and am looking forward to my next read. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"This book describes an island that I'm sure the author would like to visit and how she would like to spend her time there. While the SM is described with some detail it is still lifelike. I particularly liked the part where the dominant felt nervous about coming up with new things to the blindfolded, waiting submissive. I've been there!This book is a good work of fiction. I also enjoyed reading The Story Of O and some of John Norman's Gor books. For good SM nonfiction, I like &quot;Screw the Roses&quot;, &quot;SM 101&quot; and &quot;The Sexually Dominant Woman&quot;."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"This wasn't at all what I expected. Once I was done I understand what Anne was trying to do but while reading the book I was wondering what she was doing.It's not a bad book, just not what I expected.She spends lots of time spouting about why people become masochists. To be honest I wanted more of what went on in the club - not why they were there."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"This is my all-time favourite by Anne Rice. I have read it at least 10 times! My main reason for liking it so much is not because of all the sexual situations involved, but simply because of the main character, Lisa. She is someone I would like to be. She has created an island that is the ultimate escape from reality."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. When I was reading this novel, I felt as though my own sexuality was becoming open for exploration and evaluation. The Club (where most of the novel takes place) is a place that many people long to find in life. A place where you can be sexually &quot;free&quot;. I think that this is a novel which should be read by anyone open to exploring the farthest reaches of human sexuality."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Elliot is this exquisite man, amazing in all aspects. Lisa, the dominatrous finds herself falling in love. The whole aspect of the book to me, was a hard controlling woman and a soft sided man falling in love. Is it possible? One of the most erotic tales I've ever read. It is full of history, modern love, erotica, and just an all out wonderful plot. I loved every minute of this book and have read it several times thereafter."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"An extremely accurate view of the thoughts and feelings of people into the light s/m scene. Although the setting and plot are (most likely) fictional, Rice has done something here I've never seen before - realistically portray the eroticism and appeal of this sexual lifestyle. Much better than her over-the-top Beauty series.One flaw, though, was her tendency to hang people by their hands for long periods - definitely dangerous and never done by responsible &quot;players&quot;. Don't try this one at home!"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"The concept of the story, the &quot;S/M Club Med&quot; was an interesting one, but didn't seem to be taken to it's full potential. A good story of the relationship between the two main characters gets mired between not knowing if it should be an erotic novel or a harlequin romance. Her sexual writing is more vanilla than in her other writings (Beauty series, etc.) and she never gets to heavily involved in the sex scenes. The lack of attention to the sexual parts and the confusion of what it was meant to be is what keeps it from a higher rating. It is a good read however, if you don't expect too much from it but a good &quot;human&quot; story"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I enjoyed Exit to Eden for the simple reason that I love Anne Rice. But on a more specific note I would say that the character development really pulls you into the mystery of this island paradise/training facility. The subject matter is completely appropriate for the love story which unfolds towards the end of the book.I particularly like the way the book ends for the obvious &quot;happy ending&quot; reasons but also for the &quot;bring you back down to earth&quot; feeling it leaves you with, after being taken so far from reality it deposits you right back into everday life.Very enjoyable reading. Perfect for the beach or a rainy day."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Dissapointing compared to Anne Rices other works such as Interview With The Vampire. This story I found to be much to long and tedious. The concept of a &quot;bondage vacation &quot; was much to comical and contrived. If erotica is what you want to read pick up an Anais Nin book. Anybody that can read her work without starting to get a rapid heartbeat is gotta be senseless!!"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"It was great! And it had a little something for everyone, too.

I love how she changes from first person to third person. I love Anne Rice."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"This is one of those times when I have to say: the movie was better than the book. I say this for two reasons. The first is my own personal dislike of any fiction that protrays rape as a precusor to a loving relationship and there are a few rapes in this book. The second is that I'm an educator who works with a university and a student organization to promote and explain BDSM as viable form of sexuality. While I'd happily recommend seeing the movie version, I'd be hestitant to say to a newbie \\"watch this\\" for fear they might think the book is reflecting an actual BDSM relationship. A complaint I've heard about the book is not true: The main characters do not say they give up SM at the end; instead it is greatly downplayed leading to the common assumption that SM is seen as inferior to vanilla."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I can't really say that I liked this one. But honestly, it was about what I expected. I bought this because I like Anne Rice, but I'm not really into the subject matter. I think she went off on a tangent here. But if you like that sort of thing, you will like this book. The middle to last part of the book was much more interesting to me than the Club Scene detailed in part one. All in all, if you are into S&M then this book might interest you. If not, you might want to skip it."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"This book was marketed as an S&M romance... but instead it is the fear and process of returning to normalcy. Romantic-- yes, erotic-- no. I was very disappointed!"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I have read many of Anne Rice's books, including the books on the lives of the Mayfair Witches and Vampire Chronicles, and have loved every one. However, I was not impressed with Exit to Eden. I felt like the passion and literary talent evident in Anne Rice's writings was totally absent. I found it to be very harlequin-esque at some times, and pointlessly crude at others. I think the heart of good erotica is the ability to write in a way that transcends the immediacy of cheap porn. Unfortunately, Exit to Eden did not deliver.I plan on reading her Sleeping Beauty books in the hopes that they will be a better representation of Anne Rice's boundless talent.If you are looking for the sensual and dark romance of the Vampire Chronicles, or Lasher and Taltos, don't expect to find it here."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I kept thinking that Elliot and Lisa would really get down and dirty at the &quot;Club&quot;. Was I disappointed when they actually only had sex once, and in New Orleans to boot!!! I will say that the one time they did have sex was worth the price of the book. But the rest of it was very poorly written."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"The book just did not hold my interest very well. It was long and tedious, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. The characters were not believable nor were they erotic. They came across quite clown-ish. Anne Rice is an excellent writer, but from this novel you would never believe it."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"TO SAY THAT THIS BOOK IS A TRULY EROTIC EXPERIENCE WOULD NOT BE GIVING IT JUSTICE. I WAS LEFT ON THE EDGE OF MY BED, PANTING AND FANTAZING OF AN AMAZING SEXUALLY FREE LAND, AS IN THIS BOOK. ANN HAS A WAY OF DRAWING THE READER INTO HER EROTIC WORLD AND NOT LETTING US ESCAPE (BUT THEN AGAIN - WHO WANTS TO?"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I have to say that this is one of the worst novels that she has ever written. I just didn't think that it was that entertaining. After finishing the book, I went out and rented the movie, and It is far better than this novel. I am sorry Anne rice, but I can see why you used a pseudo name when you wrote this book. It stinks!"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Please, SOMEBODY, comment on the &quot;introduction&quot; written by Lisa. Written in hind-sight, it says that what follows is an account of something that happened at The Club, and that (end sentence) it's really about The Club. (I'm paraphrasing, since I do not own a copy of the book.) The sense I got reading this was that it &quot;undid&quot; the ending of the story -- that what really mattered the most was The Club, not Elliott. That Lisa considers the story of Elliott to be JUST an episode in her life. Yet in the course of the book, Lisa and Elliott come to understand that their fixation with S/M is a symptom of love/companionship/acceptance missing from their lives, and that they complete each other without the S/M (remember, once they're away from The Club, they have regular sex together, and have a real relationship, SHARING the &quot;power&quot; -- talking, shopping, eating, sleeping, just being together).Also, if it's Lisa's story (she claims ownership by writing the intro.), what about the half of the accounts written by Elliott !Anyway, I loved the book, and loved the end of the book -- I'd certainly marry Elliott !And there's the real final question that Anne Rice poses by including Lisa's intro.: does marriage/happily ever after happen and fulfill them -- or not ?"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"The abridgement of this otherwise wonderfully delightful and wickedly sensual book is a huge disappointment. There was little of the drama nor the depth of character found in the actual novel. I read this book years ago and found it quite profound. The tape, which barely last 1.5 hours covers none of the motivation, the anticipation nor the quality of Rice's intentions for placing the characters in this specific situation and performing these activities. Incredibly shallow reading by both actors, also."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I've tried to read Anne Rice's novels since after &quot;Interview with A Vampire&quot; was made into a film. Granted I am currently *almost* 18 years old, it's not shocking that at 13 and 14 I couldn't finish it. But browsing amongst the shelves of a used book store sat a beat up copy of &quot;Exit To Eden.&quot; I thought, what the heck. I am literally addicted to this book. I don't want to put it down. I'm reading it, soaking up every word. After finishing this novel, I hope to read the Beauty trilogy, in hopes of finding more solitude in Rice's astoundings masterpieces."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I read some of the reviews before I really got into the book, and I was afraid I would be disappointed with the book. I was wrong. This is one of my favorite Anne Rice books to date, and that is saying something, because I love everything of hers I've read. That Lisa is the last to recognize the fact that she is in love was so believable, and the struggle both she and Elliot had with their feelings seemed very real and very human. As for whether the marriage becomes boring or Lisa has to give up her place at the Club, I seriously doubt that either would happen. I think, in the end, they both enjoy the S&amp;M world too much to give it up, and why should they, so long as they understand where S&amp;M stands in their lives?"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"This book wasn't what I expected; never read an Anne Rice, but after reading what others had written, thought I'd buy a book of hers.Should have saved my money; this story was too far-fetched. Didn't finish it."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I like this book more than a lot of Ann Rice's books. It is not so full of sadism, and homosexuality. It is an interesting story, and holds the attention."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I bought this book after seeing the movie, and boy was I disappointed! This was the 4th book by Anne Rice that I read, and have since gone on to read 2 more. After 6 books I have finally given up on Anne and her ability to write an ending."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I was not happy with this book. Luckily I checked it out at the library, so I did not spend the money on it. It was filth, trash, and poorly written at that. I wanted the erotic sensations like the vampires get when drinking blood. Instead I got nothing but sorry, flabby writing that went nowhere. If the book had belonged to me, I would have burned it!"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Gillian Anderso"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I have read all of Anne Rice's books that were released under her real name and have thoroughly enjoyed every one. One day I decided to try one of her earlier works written under a pen name to see what it was like.I was somewhat disappointed. I understand that this is early writing and it shows in that she has not yet developed her prose to the levels that you find in her vampire, witch, and other novels. I agree with one of the other reviewers that the novel reads more like a romance novel than erotica. I actually find some of her passages in her latter works that skirt with the subject of the erotic more exciting than this less veiled attempt.In all honesty, I didn't finish the book. (By my own scale, I should have given it one start, but I'm cutting some slack here because it's Anne Rice.) The reason: boredom. There just wasn't enough here to hold my interest. I'm not particularly into bondage or S & M and the storey itself didn't interest me enough to continue on to the bitter end.My star ratings:One star - couldn't finish the bookTwo stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the authorThree stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection. Would judge other books by the author individually.Four stars - Liked the book. Would keep the book or would look for others by the same author.Five start - One of my all time favorites. Will get a copy in hardback to keep and will actively search out others by the same author."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I am by no means a prude but I find no interest in women or men &quot;whipping&quot; someone for reasons I can't fathom. To dicipline, arouse ,or to train them; it escapes me. Too 'kinky' for my taste. In all fairness, I never made it past the first few chapters either in this book or the first of Sleepy Beauty's triology. The theme was obvious. I will assume there is a message in these books but I didn't care to find it. I gave this 1 star because it was required to submit the review. Rereading this, this review DOES make me SOUND like a prude! In synopsis, if you like whips and chains and that sort of thing, you like the book; if not don't waste your money. I don't even want to donate them to our local library."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"This was a wonderful book which was a combination erotica and love story. Anne Rice vividly brings to life the characters in thi novel. She makes me want to run off and join The Club"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Readers will be pleased to know that _Exit to Eden_ is one of Rice's early works, and one of her best. It is erotic, sexy and gently perverse. Rice brings to life the sadomasochistic fantasy of middle America. Her language is rich, and the sex is explicit.That it is pornographic is beyond any doubt, but it's pornography of the highest calibre. The novel is deceptively metatextual, borrowing from gothic classics like Stoker's _Dracula_ and Radcliffe's _Romance of the Forrest_. But the premise of the genre is delightfully twisted. Rice calls readers to question the true nature of perversion and sexual monstrosity by illustrating that these terms are necessarily cultural. In a world of extreme sexuality, perhaps simply holding hands is a subversive act."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I bought this book because I thought it would be similar to her &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; series. It isn't even close. This is more romance novel than BDSM, and even then the romance is a little cheesy.If you want a romance novel, go ahead and get this book. If you are looking for good BDSM, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"First I should note: I am a Professional Dominatrix. I have been a lifestyle Domme for 11 years, a pro for 3. And i am an intelligent human being; on all those aspects I am equally offended by this novel.The plot: a \\"domme\\" who owns a fantasy BDSM sex club island meets a \\"slave\\" falls in love, kidnaps him, and they blow more money than the national debt while she alternately whines/cries.Issues: 1) the psychology of BDSM is WRONG. The best slaves SOMETIMES make the best masters, but that is rare, very rare. Typically you're oriented as a Top, bottom, or switch; in this universe everyone is a switch, meaning both submissive and Dominant. Does a Dominant woman enjoy being blindfolded and teased? For the most part, no. And by a slave? Never!2) the techincals are wrong. Does a pro Diomme have sex with clients? Not in real life. On a fantasy island, sure, why not? However, Lisa never \\"queens\\" Elliott the #1 sex act between a Domme/slave. When it comes to the strap-on sceene I almost vomited. It was so wrong and done in such a way in real life A) it could not have physically worked and B) she would have gotten an infection.3) As a love story it's weaker than weak. Elliott falls in love with shocking ease and spends the rest of the novel explaining why. Lisa spends most of the novel as a Histrionic woman crying and raving so much I'd expect her to be on anti-psychotics.4) It's really a story about rich people jetting all over the world, living a spoiled, pampered life and being douches about it. It seemed to me like reading a modern-day journal of Tom & Daisy Buchanan for \\"The Great Gatsby\\" - the tale of careless spoiled people ruining everything they touch.5) For Anne Rice this is sub-par writing. It has many pitfalls of a college writer trying to turn a sexual fantasy into a literary story. Long lists of authors and art movies are provided to give characters intelligence even as their actions prove them stupid.6) Her understanding of professional BDSM is wrong. it's not prostitution; it's fetish play. The definition of a fetish is something that takes the place of sex. There are Houses/Dungeons in every town and the only people engaging in sex under the guise of BDSM are prostitutes who think by calling themselves Dommes they can hide better from the law. and pro male Dommes are very rare, it's primarily women out there. You'd never knowit, reading this.Seriously, if BDSM erotica is your thing try her \\"Beauty\\" series or stick to the classics."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I bought this book not only because Anne Rice wrote it but because it was being compared to 50 Shades of Gray. It sounded like it was full of sexual scenes when in reality there weren't very many. So that was a little disapointing. Then there was quite a few boy on boy mentionings so that also turned me off a little as well. In addition I thought that she would go into deep detail about S&M...more scenes that kinda thing. I do have to say that the detail in this book was very adequate. She explained every detail as if to make you feel that you were really there. Also the underlying love story was kinda sweet in a twisted way:) All in all this was a good book...not a waste of time...but different than what I'm used to reading."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"It's not as erotic or engrossing as I thought it would be. There are parts where it begins to get really sensual, but then it ends rather abruptly or doesn't continue long enough for things to develop. Try the Sleeping Beauty novels."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"this book starts out on an island full of sex slaves, it's incredible, then it moves on to new orleans, i really enjoyed this book, it's great. i'm not entirely sure why i liked it so much, but anne rice has always been one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I saw the movie &quot;Exit To Eden&quot;, which gave me the idea to read Anne Rice's book. Although I really don't have an interest in the S&amp;M lifestyle, I loved the book. I liked the characters of Lisa and Elliot, and I liked the locations in the book- from The Club to New Orleans to Texas. If you liked the movie, you'd like the book. Don't expect a printed version of the movie, though. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"This is some of the worst trash I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. The language is overwrought, the plot far-fetched and shallow, and even the readers sounded embarrassed to be involved in the project. However, it did make me laugh out loud quite often. Maybe the book was better. For a good S&amp;M story, try Alasdair Gray's &quot;Something Leather&quot;"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Perhaps in it's time this book was cutting edge, but for those of us within the lifestyle, it's tame and contrived to a very unsatisfying degree. It's ironic that the film adaptation was watered down even more, and turned into one of the worst movies you're likely to see. Ann Rice didn't deserve such treatment.There are books that capture the true essence of the BDSM fanatsy that are much more engrossing, and interestingly enough, Ms Rice has written them as well. (writing as A. N. Roquelaure, see her trilogy in the Sleeping Beauty series)"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"When I bought Exit to Eden, I was expecting a rather graphic, intense novel more along the lines of the Beauty trilogy. What I got was a whirlwind romance bracketed by The Club. The Club is much akin to the Beauty trilogy; however, The Club is played up, then drops almost completely out of sight. If you enjoy romance novels, minus the kinkiness that Anne Rice has a reputation for, then this might be right up your alley. It's got just a dash of kink, but predominantly it's a tale of two lovers. As in the Beauty books, it gets a bit repetetive after a while. Unlike her Vampire Chronicles, where the end seemed to come all to soon, by the time I made it to the end of Exit to Eden, I was good and ready to get there."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"Even after a few years, this book still tops my list as being the hottest book I have ever read. It literally had me on the edge of my seat and excited through the whole book. The descriptions and method of writing hold you captivated, and left me wishing it were a series."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"This is my least-favorite of Rice's works. It begins boldly, with an over-the-top sexual adventure in the fringes of s&amp;m, but ends up with an unlikely and boringly banal marriage.It is as if Rice had an attack of conscience (or publisher?) half way through. So the book ends up being neither a satisfying piece of erotica or romance. Neither fish nor fowl...I preferred her Beauty books for her somewhat unique brand of b&amp;d erotica, and on the literary side, her best are not the Vampire Chronicles, not the Mayfair witch books, but the little-known Cry to Heaven, and Feast of All Saints.This is neither good nor typical Rice."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I was a skeptic at first when I bought this book, but my opinion soon changed. Simply the best by Anne Rice in my view, even though it was written before her Vampire Chronicles. It's very sensual and VERY erotic; but at the same time, it plays with your heart. You feel as though you are Lisa or Elliot, and it pulls you into the pages like none other I've read. I've loaned it to four people who each bought their own copy after reading mine....you won't be disappointed!!!!"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"A well written book that is very easy to read. Content is exciting and makes you \\"not want to put the book down\\".This is my second copy to loan to friends! Inspired me to buy other books by author (Anne Rice), but this is still the best in my opinion."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I bought a copy of this book about 15 years ago and read it many times. Unfortunately, I loaned it to a friend and never got it back, but also never forgot it.A few weeks ago, I was on a message board and this book was mentioned. I decided I had to read it again.It was a treat to read again after all these years. Ms. Rice does a brilliant job of relating Lisa and Elliott's feelings to the reader. My heart was breaking for Lisa as she came to terms with her feelings and realized all the problems they would bring about. Elliott is so charming, sexy, and intelligent that you can't help but fall for him! And New Orleans is described in such detail that I felt like I was there.This book is the perfect mix of eroticism and romance. I'm sorry that Ms. Rice didn't write more in this genre."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I guess you know by now that Anne Rice doesn't just write vampire stories. Well, Exit to Eden is anything but that and it is a delight to read. I liked the characters and it just flowed well for me. The bdsm wasn't too overdone and the sex was red hot. I am a fan of the authors and have been for some time, though I've mostly read her paranormal stuff. So glad I took the chance. I am looking forward to reading more of her erotic work, among themBeauty's Release: The Conclusion of the Classic Erotic Trilogy of Sleeping Beauty."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"I can't believe I read this book in one sitting. This is the first novel by Anne Rice I've ever read. Her words are so descriptive, I found myself just painting the images in my mind. Even my body shivered as I read some of the encounters between Elliott and Lisa. It's a good story. I don't really get the S&amp;M stuff, but still a good book. Most memorable section...the butter and cinnamon in New Orleans."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"This isn't like the movie but centers on the relationship between Lisa and Elliot and why Lisa does what she does. The sex plays a back seat. It does make you start to wonder why people do what they do.At first, I didn't care for the book but I do find I think about it every once in a while and wish I hadn't given my copy to the local book sale. I'd probably re-read it."},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"With a respected author like Anne Rice, what I had hoped for was some erotic, imaginative reading. I will say that the settings, the environment, the background material were well-narrated and enticing. The characters, however, are another story. A nice way to describe them is that they are one-dimensional Harlequin Romance characters who trade in their corsets and leather pants, for, well, corsets and leather pants. Truly, the characters, aside from their extensive participation in the s&amp;m scene, are classic romance novel pulp: the unbelievably gorgeous, unavailable rogue meets the unbelievably gorgeous, willful woman, blah, blah, blah. They just happen to do their bodice ripping at an an s&amp;m resort instead of at some foggy Moorish castle. The bottom line: this book may very well float your boat if your interest is on the s&amp;m scene descriptions, which are pretty creative without being blatantly pornographic, just don't expect anything resembling realistic character development. As far as recommendations of similar reading, I wish I could make some. I'm not sure there is such as a thing as literary erotica. Maybe for the same reason that there are very few good X-rated movies?"},{"Title":"Exit to Eden","review":"The Book Exit to Eden was shipped to me in a timely manner. The book was in excellent condition. Thank you for such a speedy time frame. I received it faster than any express mailing."},{"Title":"Enlightenment against Empire","review":"We are so beset with Enlightenment critiques that we can fail to look closely at the depth of its defining events. In this engaging book, and surprise find, we discover a veiled side to the Enlightenment in its broad spectrum of seminal anthropology and philosophy of history, as in Kant, Herder. A mysterious balance is built in, witness the counterpoints of Kant and Herder, and the very themes we bring against the period are often born in that period. And that would seem to be the case with the very Eurocentrism brought in evidence against modernity. That a critique of empire emerged at the very moment of expansive imperialism is an important history, and this work exhumes a brighter corner of that.

I don't believe in worksheets and don't think the worksheets in this book should be given to students in exchange for instruction. This is a great book to use for direct one on one instruction for students because it is so visual. As an ESL teacher, you will need to teach your beginning students about all of the content inside this book. Thus, this book takes away the hours of trying to develop your own materials.

Her dreams of graduating from college reach a sudden halt when a professor humiliates her in front of the entire class, leading to her withdrawal from the university. Even her job at the local diner becomes a tremendous challenge when she must fill in for a waitress who storms off the job. Then in a stunning moment of bold attitude, Robin overcomes her inability to speak by allowing her body to speak for her.Johnny Dayton does not know the horrible day Robin has endured. Nor does he hear the whispered gossip from the students at another table. He only focuses on the legal papers in front of him as he prepares for a board meeting the next day. Then suddenly the most beautiful woman he has ever met stuns him with a lip lock from heaven. When he comes up for air, Johnny recognizes his best friend's kid sister, and suddenly Robin becomes the bridge to a time when life was less complicated and more understandable. And he wants more; a lot more.Colleen Collin's unique approach to communication lends TONGUE-TIED a dynamically erotic twist. On one hand, Robin may not be able to speak her mind, but her body expresses her needs and desires quite clearly. She also has a gift with her pen that allows intense self-expression. On the other hand, Johnny dislikes himself for the corporate man he has become, but Robin allows him to become the bold thinker had been before pr campaigns determined company lines.Author Collin's meets the unique challenge of a mostly silent heroine with pizzazz, keeping the narrative lively even as she exploits the challenges of silence with grace. She carefully balances the mundane world with a sizzling world where words are unnecessary. Further, she gives her heroine a unique, powerful voice that combines sweetness and heat in a vibrant mix. Add TONGUE-TIED to your keep shelf! Winner of the WordWeaving Award for Excellence."},{"Title":"Tongue - Tied (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"A little slow start but it picked up the pace.Johnny Dayton was an annoying but likable fellow.Robin transformed surprisingly well.I did not expect to enjoy it this much - thumb up!"},{"Title":"Tongue - Tied (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"A sever speech impediment makes it difficult at best for twenty-six year old Robin Lee to communicate with anyone one on one. Having to stand in front of a classroom as demanded by the University of Denver in several of her classes is impossible for her stuttering has left her extremely shy thus her fantasy of a college degree in literature seems impractical. Even working at the Davey's Diner as a temporary fill-in waitress proves demanding on the TONGUE-TIED woman.When the other students whisper loud enough for her to hear their pity, Robin turns bold and kisses a customer. Johnny Dayton is stunned that this lovely vision is kissing him even as he reviews legal papers for a contentious board meeting the next day. Soon Johnny recognizes that the lips belong to his best friend's kid sister, Robin and that he wants more from her, but her timidity may prove stronger than their growing love.Readers will delight with the way Colleen Collin cleverly blended a verbal communication challenged female within a strong erotic tale of love. Though in this age of the Disabilities Act, readers will question the professor's humiliation of Robin, the story line shows her as a capable person able to communicate in other ways other than verbal. She makes the tale and Johnny is a likable hero struggling between meeting the corporate image and his audacious concepts to improve business. The audience will realize that TONGUE-TIED is a triumph for fans as Ms. Collins pens an enchanting heated tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The charismatic movement","review":"In this thoroughly scriptural volume Bro.

If you omit the things about Ataturk's private life (the writer wrote too much things that there is no way he may know) this book gives a good idea about how much he loved his country and how incredible he is. But I suggest you start with Lord Kinross's book if you would like to read about Ataturk. Also the last sentence of the book was a good one:&quot;He is Dictator in order that it may be impossible ever again that there should be in Turkey a Dictator&quot;.I guess he did what he had to do to save Turkey."},{"Title":"Gray Wolf, Mustafa Kemal: An intimate study of a dictator","review":"A dictator ??

Calvino is an ex-lawyer, ex-cop who does private investigation work - when he can get it. He is a drunk and also uses whores, smokes, etc. His dream is about a friend who was recently killed and in the dream someone is coming after him as well. He wakes from this dream/nightmare at his apartment next to a Thai whore whose name he has forgotten - again. That is because he was so inebriated he couldn't remember. His housekeeper, Mrs. Jamthong - who is a hoot all by herself!, wakes him yelling at him that he is late for work and to come eat breakfast. The prostitute leaves and Calvino (known to the Thais as \\"Khun Winee\\" since they can't pronounce the \\"v\\" for \\"Vinee\\") gets to the table to read the paper. He sees a photo of a man slumped over a desk - dead. His assistant, Ratana, calls and tells him to call her as soon as he is through with his meal. He recognizes he knows the dead \\"farang\\" - white man or foreigner to the Thais. He is a Brit named Ben Hoadley. He gets to his office and finds that Ben Hoadley's father in England wants Calvino to investigate his son's murder. The Thai newspaper reported that a \\"thinner addict\\" had done the deed. Into his office comes Kiko, friend and romantic interest, who knows the thinner addict, Lek, and swears that he could not have done it.Thus begins an amazing string of events as Calvino works with Kiko, Pratt (a friend in the Bangkok police) and uncovers the motives and events of why first Jeff Logan and then Ben Hoadley and during the course of the story several others were murdered. How Calvino gets to the resolution amid the extreme dangers he and others around him face is a fantastic tale of suspense, mystery, intrigue and the underworld.As a woman, I would say that Vincent Calvino is a true man's man and the kind of detective that men more than women would enjoy reading about. The Spirit House is the first of the many novels that Mr. Moore has written about Calvino. The details and descriptions are very image and thought provoking. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Spirit House","review":"Through the underbelly Bangkok, Vincent Calvino confronts crime bosses, corrupt cops, prostitutes, slum dwellers, and addicts to unravel this murder mystery. Where the truth often takes the back seat to other other cultural values, Thailand is a perfect setting for the novel. The reader is positioned right on the edge between the expat life and local community- getting real insight into both worlds. It feels like you could get sucked into the Bangkok mess at any moment.To this end, Christopher Moore is a very clever author, with a style closer to Film Noir rather than the everyday P.I./mystery writers. His protagonist, Vincent Calvino, is an unassuming hero who regularly drinks, visits the red lights of Patpong, and barely scrapes by. Yet, he preserves relentlessly where few others do (or are willing to go). He is certainly not against rolling up his sleeves and getting dirty, or bloody, whatever the case may be."},{"Title":"Spirit House","review":"A typical, modern, conflicted \\"gumshoe\\" story is made all the more interesting by the exotic (and erotic) backdrop. If set in LA, the hero's personality would border on trite. In Bangkok, it is a stark contrast to the wasted expats, elitism of the rich, and despair of the destitute.I found the story engaging, fast-paced, and interesting while being informative about the culture and subculture of such a famous foreign city. The plot made sense, and the characters were believable and identifiable despite being foreign. This is very much an American perspective against a foreign backdrop, and the story does a very good job at keeping the two separate.It is at times a little rough, and most likely not for those easily offended by sexual violence or those looking for a \\"Murder She Wrote\\" mystery. If you want to explore some of the darker aspects of the human spirit from an American perspective in an international setting, and get a good mystery thrown in, and maintain some hope for humanity in the process, then this is a read for you.WORD OF WARNING -- this book is the first of a series. I stumbled upon it accidentally by fat-fingering an order for a Christopher Moore (without the G.) novel. I would very much like to continue the series on my Kindle, but like some other series, NOT ALL ARE YET AVAILABLE FOR THE KINDLE at the time of this writing. I would strongly suggest that you check the availability of the other books in this series and weigh that in your decision.

If you can watch CSI or have read some of Patricia Cornwell's novels this one is certainly no worse.I only wish I had a Thai/English dictionary while I was reading it because there were many words I wanted to look up.

When a book offers me both entertainment and the opportunity to learn something new, well, that is just about as close as I can get to heaven, here on earth.I think this book would also appeal to male readers, either as well as, or maybe even more so, than to female readers.

Moore has a well-earned reputation for his attention to detail, to the gritty background of the Thai capitol, beyond just the bars and the general fluff that gets publicized, to the wider variety of the city that makes it such a great place to be.That attention to detail and realism, though, is just the backdrop to what are very well plotted and riveting detective stories. Spirit House develops, in proper crime fashion, from a murder in the paper, to a case, to a puzzle, to an abattoir; with bodies cheerfully bobbing in the waters of Chao Phraya; katoeys slit to pieces; the police hovering in the wings; and a final denouement I wont give away.And there's that image of the rat-scabbed cat on its last legs licking passionately at the thick liquid oozing out of the bottom of the junkyard truck."},{"Title":"Spirit House","review":"On lazy days I look for a novel that will take me into an unexplored world, will carry me along so that I don't move from the chair.

Get on it."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"The title of Gilman's novel may be a bit misleading. The novel is described as a feminist novel. Yet, this is not exactly acurate. The absence of men in the utopian society may seem extreme to some, and it is. This is how Gilman makes her point. She does not create a world without men because men are terrible creatures who have corrupted the world. The utopia which lacks men is a clean peaceful place, excelling in every way American society fails. But, it is neither the absence of men nor the presence of women that faciliates this.Gender, in this novel, is symbolic for the most part. Gilman does separate the two genders to destroy steroetypes, but also to establish a concrete difference between the two worlds. The male world is not bad, and the female good. The world in which people are defined by others and limited to these defined roles is bad, while the world in which people are free to grow without being defined or compared to others, and are able to see the oneness of all people is good.Comparing Herland to the reader's own world, Gilman begins destroying gender based stereotypes. Because there are no distinctions of gender in Herland, nor any superficial characteristics which accompany gender, Herland women take on the roles of all people without considering any limitations. These women are strong, agile, nurturing, intelligent, cooperative, and able to rely on themselves. They are not &quot;typical&quot; females. As Gilman explains through the male character Van, &quot;Those 'feminie charms' we are so fond of are not feminine at all, but mere reflected masculinity--developed to please us because they had to please us, and in no way essential to the real fulfillment of their great process&quot; (59). In the same way, stereotypes about men can be discredited. Such ideas have been made up to help people deal with the differences between men and women. Gilman shows the reader that if people stop basing their identities on what others want, they will no longer be slaves to limitations. They will be free to discover their true selves and will allow others to do the same.Gilman shows readers that men and women are distinct people, but reminds us that they are people first. This can be seen when Somel, a woman of Herland, innocently questions a male visitor, &quot;But surely there are characteristics enough which belong to People, aren't there?&quot; (89). Focusing more on these characteristics, those belonging to &quot;People,&quot; allows humans to fulfill their personal potential without fear of jealousy. The women of Herland are able to live in &quot;such universal peace and good will and mutual affection&quot; (99) because &quot;they lacked the sex motive and, with it, jealousy&quot; (99). The women of Herland are free and equal because they are secure enough in themselves to offer and accept help for a joint cause, the betterment of their world. All readers, men and women alike, can learn a great deal from this humanist utopian novel."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Charlotte Perkins Gilman was arguably the most important American author of the women's movement in the early 20th-century. In addition to editing a newspaper, &quot;The Forerunner,&quot; she wrote &quot;Women and Economics,&quot; one of the first studies of the role of women in the economic system. Gilman also wrote a number of utopias: &quot;Moving the Mountain&quot; in 1911, &quot;With Her in Ourland&quot; (1916), and her best-known, &quot;Herstory&quot; in 1915. In &quot;Herstory&quot; Gilman creates a homosocial (one-sex) utopian society made up entirely of women in which the culture, political system, and families are the result of having women as the basis (instead of merely stemming from the absence of men). However, while other American utopian novels, most notably Edward Bellamy's &quot;Looking Backward 2000-1888,&quot; were standard reading for decades, Gilman's &quot;Herland&quot; was pretty much forgotten until it was rediscovered in the 1970s. Even after four decades Gilman's satire was seen as still speaking to the conditions faced by American women.Following the conceit first used by Sir Thomas More in writing his &quot;Utopia,&quot; Gilman's &quot;Herstory&quot; tells of three American explorers (male, of course), stumbling upon an all-female society in an isolated mountain valley in a land far away on the even of the first World War. Since they find this strange land to be civilized the explorers are convinced there must be some men hiding someplace, and set out to find them. As they search high and low for the male of the species they learn about the history of the country, the religion of motherhood, and the other unique customs, while trying to seduce its inhabitants. Many generations earlier the women had found themselves separated from the human race, with the men dying off. The society evolved, organizing itself around raising children and living in harmony with their surroundings. In the end, the three mail visitors end up falling in love with three of the women and are essentially converted as naturalized aliens.&quot;Herstory&quot; is less science fiction than many of the utopian novels written during this period, and clearly its primary value is in terms of its provocative commentary on gender roles in the United States in the early 20th-century. Not surprisingly, Gilman questions the roles assumed by men and women in the &quot;bi-sexual&quot; society by showing the relative perfection achieved in Herland with its uni-sexual society. What Gilman sidesteps, of course, are the issues of sexuality: the women of &quot;Herstory&quot; are asexual beings, although they are capable of parthenogenesis (asexual reproduction). Also, by talking about these women as being descended from good Aryan stock she raises the specter of racism as well. But clearly Gilman's purpose is to provide a critique of the social order of the day, using humor as a way to mask her telling barbs and to provide her unorthodox views of gender roles, motherhood, individuality, privacy, and other issues. Then there are the parts where the inhabitants of &quot;Herstory&quot; are amused and horrified to learn about the conventional aspects of courtship, marriage, families, warfare, labor relations and even animal husbandry in the &quot;real&quot; world.Because &quot;Herland&quot; is essentially a novella, running only 124 pages in this unabridged Dover Thrift Edition, it is fairly easy to work it into a class looking at 20th century American utopian literature or the women's movement. In many ways, although it is not as well written, &quot;Herland&quot; is a much more provocative critique of women in American society than Margaret Atwood's &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; or Marge Piercy's &quot;Woman on the Edge of Time.&quot; &quot;Herstory&quot; also stands out because it is a true utopian novel, written at a time when the dystopian emphasis was about to redefine the genre of utopian literature."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Obviously, many people who read this book -- including most of the reviewers here -- clearly misunderstood Gilman's tone and objective in writing \\"Herland.\\" The purpose of the book is NOT to say that women are better than men in every aspect of life, or that women can survive without men. Indeed, the inhabitants of Herland realize that without males, their society is incomplete, which is why the three young women are encouraged to court the three male visitors. Gilman portrays two of her three male characters sympathetically and intelligently, and even the chauvinistic one is portrayed as intelligent, just misguided.Gilman has two purposes, neither of which is to show the 'inferiority' of men. One, she wishes to show what a society would be like if everyone were treated equally. Two, and related, she wishes to show what society were like if people put the greater good above their individual goals. In that sense, Gilman's society is not socialism but more like anarchism -- there IS no central government; Herland operates like a large utopian family, in which everyone's role is equal and everyone has a very important role in society. No one's role is more important than any others, be they male or female.The reason for the Herlandians' physical besting of the men is to show that women are only 'weak' because they are sheltered, and in turn are sheltered because they are weak; also, while the Herlandians were natural women living in the natural world, the men are essentially 'sheltered' by technology (all of them being specialists in an area) and thus are not physically trained as the women are. It's like a female Olympic runner beating a male who runs for his college in his spare time.Of course, the book has flaws -- the utopian society of course, is without chink or problem, and Gilman ironically venerates traditional aspects of women, casting them into the stereotype of communal, compassionate, sacrificial mothers. The veneration of 'motherhood' almost religiously is hypocritical, as if every woman desires to be a mother. Predictably, no woman in the history of Herland seems to have a problem with denying self for the greater good, or the lack of tradition, or the taking away of her own children for communal rearing. For that, I have to say that Gilman -- while trying to deconstruct the typical notion of a woman -- inadvertently BUILDS it by assuming that all women have these characteristics naturally."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Like most utopias, Herland hasn't aged well. What sounds like heaven to one generation seems more like hell to another. What makes this book most interesting is its artifact status in the evolution of feminism.Most modern-day feminists would, I believe, be horrified to be plunked down in Herland to spend their lives: a world without coitus, where motherhood is the end-all and be-all of a woman's existence. There is no Sapphic hanky-panky going on among the inhabitants of this uterine utopia; the very concept of sexual pleasure is foreign to these ladies. Where feminists once wanted motherhood without sex, today they are more likely to want sex without motherhood.In addition, Herlanders are unabashedly pro-life and horrified when the idea of abortion is raised. A woman's right to choose is as unthinkable in their world as a topless bar would be.On the other hand, there is plenty of it-takes-a-village-to-raise-a-child; every inhabitant of Herland is a career woman; and when the men raise the issue of their wives taking their names, the brides-to-be scornfully refuse.As a political manifesto, Herland cannot be taken seriously in the modern world, yet it maintains its importance both as historical artifact, illuminating the thought of the early 20th century, and as evidence that -isms are not static but constantly evolving."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Have you ever wondered what our world would be like without testosterone? Herland gives us some insight into such a hypothetical world. What would the crime level be like? How about wars? Rape? All of these terrible things are often initiated by men. Although a female-only society would probably be much less utopian than Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Herland, it is still interesting to speculate. Even the late Dr. Richard Dehann, a doctor and Bible teacher, speculates that original sin is inherited through the father; so maybe Ms. Gilman's land is not so far-fetched. It still makes interesting reading. If you are interested in female-dominated societies, check out Suzie McKee Charna's Holdfast Chronicles, Marion Zimmer Bradley's Free Amazons of Darkover, and/or Joanna Russ's Female Man."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"This book was assigned reading for me back in college 12 years ago and I have been thinking about ever since then. Last week I finally broke down and decided to re-read it and see if it was as fascinating now as it was then.It is the story of three male adventurers who discover an unknown land that is virtually impossible to get to inhabited only by women. Scientific and curious by nature they plan a mission to fly over the country in a plane to investigate further only to be captured and held prisioner in &quot;Herland.&quot; While captive they are tutored by and taught to speak the language of the inhabitants. Once they have mastered the language they learn that their captors do not mean them any harm, but rather want to learn from them about the outside world as they have been cut off from it for 2000 years by their natural barriers. The men learn from the women and the women learn from the men. We see how different life could be in a society ruled and inhabited only by women.As a utopian or fantasy novel, this one is outstanding. There were parts I liked better and was more appreciative of now that I am older than when I first read it, and others that had me thinking &quot;as if!&quot; If you can get past the whole parthenogenisis premise its an easier pill to swallow, but this time around I wasn't buying it. I also found the over zealous religious tones near the end to make this short novel drag out far too long.All in all I am glad I re-read it and encourage anyone who hasn't to do so."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"The premise is interesting enough: after a combination of man-made and natural catastrophes in a remote area, only a handful of women remain alive. Through some miracle, one woman becomes parthenogenetically pregnant - without normal fertilization - and civilization is rebuilt.But without men.The story opens 2000 years later, after the culture has flourished and stabilized, when three men of very different temperaments arrive. This brief story sketches the Edenic society. The women have their entire country under the most intense cultivation, and it is lush and productive. The women have a stable population, and a rich culture built around progress, peace, and single-minded devotion to the creation and care of the next generation. That is the cental axis of Gilman's world. Religion and everything else revolve around that.The women themselves, through Lamarckian and social evolution, have become strong, wise, happy, and oddly sexless. They seem not to have discovered the happiness of physical affection, especially when separated from procreation. I find it odd that there is not even a hint of that physical intimacy in this otherwise attractive world, even though the women could easily share it between themselves.Of course, one of the men commits an outrage, and they are banished back to the evil outer world - Eve casting Adam out of the garden, this time. Nearly nothing is said about the economy of this world, and just a little about their system of justice. As utopias go, it's a bit one-sided and bland, with one chilling exception. In the very last sentences of the book, there is a hint that their justice can include capital punishment. It would be carried out by overdose of anesthesia, a 1915 prediction of today's \\"lethal injection.\\"//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Herland (Dover, 1909)I always found it odd that Gilman, a prolific writer during her life, had become so obscure less than a century later as to be remembered for only a single short story, \\"The Yellow Wallpaper.\\" Now, having had the distinct displeasure of having read a second piece of Gilman's writing, I have to wonder if that obscurity isn't well-deserved.Herland is everything that \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\" is not. It is boring, overly expository, dry as dust, and most importantly, didactic. It is didactic in the same way your history teacher who spoke in a monotone is didactic; you end up hating the delivery so much that whatever's being said gets tuned out along with the noise. It doesn't help that Herland is a vastly inferior knockoff of such nineteenth-century fantastic-journey novels as Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, James DeMille's A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder, or Doyle's The Lost World. All three of those novels had the same generally socially conscious bent as does Herland, and held up a dystopian land to our own to show us where our own civilization is lacking. But all three of them (even Poe, who despised the novel form and never wrote in it again) had a basic understanding of the structure of the adventure novel and how to keep things moving while passing along their message about what's wrong with society. Gilman lacks this facility, and what's worse, she's of that strip of author who feels that, in order to make sure the message is clearly heard by the reader, she must go out of her way and add a clarifying sentence. After all, the reader is far too stupid to pick up on inferences.The popularity of The Yellow Wallpaper and the obscurity of Gilman's other work cannot, of course, be dismissed as understood after reading only one of her other works. But Herland certainly doesn't have me straining at the leash to go looking for anything else Gilman wrote. Uniformly awful.

Why would a female-only society, where dress is utilitarian and reproduction asexual, tart themselves up in pink eyeshadow and mascara that would make even an overly-flamboyant drag queen quail?"},{"Title":"Herland","review":"In her novel of a positive utopia made up only of women, Gilman gives us a vision of what perfection would be like, if only the inevitable power, money and sex did not get in the way of things. In Herland, there are no men thus eliminating the sex motivations. And they live a highly socialized communal life within which most of the problems of modern society have been conquered or mastered.The ladies of Herland have been isolated from the rest of the world for about 2000 years and during the early part of that period all the men in their society were killed or died off. This left a society of women only. To go on, they developed the ability to have virgin births, (in the modern wild turkey this exists today and is called Parthenogenesis, where in the absence of male turkeys, they may produce eggs that turn into female chicks) through an unusual biological quirk. But all the offspring are women.Throughout the book references and allusions to Edward Bellamy's famous positive utopia book \\"Looking Backwards\\" are evident. Yet Gilman's treatment of the topic is fresh and interesting in that the element of sex is removed from the utopian environment. In addition, the concept of the story is that 3 men happen to find the utopia and this allows Gilman to engage in a long discussion with those men and the women of Herland; comparing their worlds.Interestingly, even though Gilman wrote the book in 1915, not much seems to have changed. There is still injustice, greed, hate, love, war, peace and poverty. The book is a virtual wake up call to all societies, especially the Western Developed countries that there are yet things to be done in this world.The book is recommended to those who are interested in a vision of a better world. While Gilman's vision is an impossibility, as was Karl Marx vision of perfect Communism, nonetheless, it gives us a real reason to think on the bright side of life, as it may yet be possible to achieve."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"I got the book in a timely manner and it is in adequate shape"},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Herland, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, tries to take the view of a world without man.

A wonderfully written book about three men who enter a strange world populated by women only.The story of how the two sexes view their roles as male/female are intriguing and point out many focal points that theorists argue about: men controlling women, women being mothers, and the power between the two and how they survive in society.I highly recommend this book, it's an smooth read that applies more to today's world than it seems possible!"},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Anybody who truly studies the historical situation surrounding this book, beyond the scope of feminism, will find the avenue towards the kind of Eugenics that even Teddy Roosevelt and his wife, as well as a large part of society had started to engage in. A Utopian view, which controlled who could have children--a cleansing of American Health, in other words--became a cultural goal. We're not talking about condoms or birth control pills here. We're talking about the idea of WHO is the right person to have children--and if those unwanted people have unwanted children, then those children are generally undesirable too, genetically. A good book on the use of Eugenics during this period would be well worth it.Charlotte Perkins Gilman had incredible gifts, and won much deserved respect for her short story/half-memoire, The Yellow Wallpaper. I highly doubt she and many of the \\"good\\" women who wished to reform society into a more feminine and nurturing (and also more equal) refuge for all humanity would have ever guessed what can come from a book like Herland. The overall picture, in hindsight, is truly frightening. Add an influential writer or two, a few politicians, and soon you have those small county or local museums across the country eventually owning up to what has been a long-forgotten Eugenics movements practiced in their local communities by well-meaning reformers.On a nationwide scale, these \\"good women\\" were not just focusing on prohibition and temperence or suffrage, but also trying to sweep up the scum and keep them from breeding. Talk to a well-educated Biologist about the history of Eugenics in the United States and you will begin to see how people went from spaying women of perceived \\"low-character,\\" to making sure those who were poor, low on the pole, or handicapped would not be able to marry or reproduce. Nor was that the beginning, nor was it done with consent, nor was it entirely humane.... Human rights were made more and more fragile in favor of a Utopian principle, and with a lot of churchy-womanly (and manly) zeal.Granted, Gilman never used the word \\"Eugenics.\\" Gilman's book shows a fanciful world wherein men have not existed for quite some time, and where women can just \\"have\\" a baby when the magic is right or whatever....yet, this makes for a lot worse than wishfully innocent early feminism...it makes for another detail in her book that is QUITE disturbing: the idea that only some women are GOOD enough to be mothers, to even BECOME mothers. In this book, those women who just wouldn't be the best mothers naturally just \\"know\\" and decline the possibility...only to become co-mothers and caregivers to the other mothers' children. It takes a village to raise a child, but these villages won't let you have one. Sure, this sounds wonderful to a jaded person in our society who thinks only of overpopulation or the terrible abuses against unwanted children by horrible undeserving parents....It sounds wonderful...until a class of college students starts to ditch intellectual rigor and just downright idolize the book. What Gilman's good thoughts invoke is something that cannot be managed without unrestrained and callous social control and abuses that would overwhelm any good that would have been done. I'll get to my point soon..For me, it was terrible to be so disappointed in a woman and writer so well-loved.Bring up Eugenics and how determining reproductive rights and a person's worth could spawn a mainstream American movement that then INSPIRED the policies of Eugenics the Nazis began to use not long after..and you may find a lot of angry classmates or students, but it is still the truth. Irradiating the genitals or ovaries of Jews to keep them from reproducing, euthanizing the handicapped, the elderly, and the mentally ill...and finally deciding which race of people is more fit to live...that is what happened. Yes, it was the mass outpouring of a grass-roots movement that was invented HERE. Racial Hygeine, Class Hygeine, Cleaning the Health of America, etc..somehow the cleanliness of America seems less because it became so much more in Germany. We can wonder what might have happened HERE given extenuating circumstances. A nation that has already perpetrated mass-genocide and cultural \\"cleansing\\" with the Native Americans couldn't be that far away from what happened in Europe.Granted, Gilman didn't do these things. The policies in the book are elemental to this type of thinking, however. Disposal of the potential or even lives of people regardless of their gender or class or race all becomes a touching point here.Because of these surrounding factors, this book is less inspiring and more repulsive every time I think of it, for years and years now. What seemed like a little innocent piece of quaint feminism with a thin shellac of revolutionary spirit, was little more than another launchpad for discrimination. It supported MORE discrimination against women, and people in general, and for that reason I can only think of this book as a time-capsule of cattle fodder. Do I blame Gilman? Hell no. None of us are innocent in our own times..but that doesn't mean we should set up Herland as an eternal classic. As an author, she endorsed a place where choice was virtually removed and society just fell into line. It has all been thought of before and will be again.Please get informed, and fast, before you go off the deep end with the book. Enjoy it, but with a big pinch of informed salt.Utopias are just that...and to create one usually involves mass sacrifices by SOMEBODY. Whether reading this book, or any other, that is something to always keep in mind."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"I came across this work while researching Utopian and Dystopia Lit in college and it was love at first read. It's rare to find a piece of utopian lit, much less feminist utopian lit written in this period. Yes, some have problems the the lack of modern feminist thought found in Herland, but for me, it was refreshing to find a work in which women are portrayed as intelligent, level-headed and, well, portrayed at all. And the added bonus for me was seeing a &quot;lighter, happier&quot; side to Gilman's writing. It is a must read for all fans of utopian lit."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"This book was not so much a story as it was an essay about ideals. The actual storyline had little to do with what the book was trying to accomplish which was all too obvious. Truthfully, I found that many of the points were very valid but the way that they were expressed made me dislike the book. This story of men trapped in a female only society makes it seem as though women are better than men (which could be the authors opinion?) However there are many ideals which can be learned from by reading this book. I recommend this book not to those who are looking for a story but for those who wish to her ideas about our socitey."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"This was assigned to me in college 25 years ago. I still remember how I struggled to get through the 90 some pages of this book. One reviewer wrote that the point wasn't to tear down men, but to show that women can live without men. She must have missed the part where because me are gone, so are wars. Clearly only men can be greedy/hateful. Women are only nurturing and giving. This book was assigned along with \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" by Margaret Atwood. I can't say enough good things about THAT book."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"I am a fan of utopian literature. It is a great measure of the human soul that we have these books. The spur us on to better ideals. Sadly, we have abandoned these, replacing them with the ugly dystopian literature, and are worse of.\\"Herland\\" is unique in that it is feminist utopianism. It is so off-beast that I was excited to read it. All of the classical cannon of Utopian Lit is all male: Plato, Moore, Bellamy, and so forth. I was curious about what insights Gilman would have.Sadly, I felt left down.First of all, having so many expectation for a book, and then being let down forced me to look deeper at what was going on. I had to reexamine my assumptions and expectations.I realized that so much Utopian Lit is the same: people getting together, decided to stop being fools (in the Biblical sense of the word), and actually doing what then should be doing. Part of templette involves uniform clothing, large mess halls, centralized planning, and the un-Biblical open marriages.Gilman covers all of theses, except the open marriages, which I will later cover. In fact, there was nothing really new in this book. This is not to discredit it, but to to convey the epiphany I had while reading it. The utopias all have common elements, with minor modifications.The problem with Gilman's book is in the virgin births to perpetuate her Amazon society. This dues ex machina fatally shifts the story form Utopian Lit to mere fantasy. All Utopian Lit must, of necessity, be atheistic. Otherwise, it becomes religious social philosophy.There are some other problems, some of which come from outdated science. For example, genetically, all the women would be identical, and the environmental conditioning would not change them. Gilman has them with different features (p. 76, 78), a genetic impossibility.Another problem is the centralized planning without omniscience and omnipotence. \\"The best laid plans of mice and men . . .\\" We cannot control nature, predict earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or predict hurricanes. Herland has none of these. It is a peach of an Eden, but detached from the real world.Centralized planning never works. We have limited knowledge. And even if we know something, we have limited capacity to change things. We have Murphy's Law, entropy, and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Couple all of these with the Butterfly Effect of our ignorance and impotence, and it is a wonder that anything gets done at all.I so not want to get into Praeto's 80-20 Law, except to mention that all utopianists, except the American Founders, completely ignore this principle, Gilman not excluded.Most confusing is the birth control alluded to in Chapter 6 (p. 60). If pregnancies are virgin, are they spontaneous, and if so, how does one control them? This all comes back to the fact that this book is essentially fantasy, and not utopian.Sometimes Gilman gets downright ridiculous, as in mentioning that babies do not cry (p, 88). I understand the miracle eugenics and \\"negative eugenics\\" (p. 59), but this is ridiculous. Crying is not an annoyance, but serves several purposes, and is the root of communication.The religion is a disappointment. It is just Social Gospel, but no power. It has virgin births, but no Virgin Mary.Another problem is the nature of evil. Gilman notes that \\"They had no theory of the opposition of good and evil\\" (p. 87). That smacks of Nietzscheism, and is fundamentally at variance not only with the Laws of Logic, but also common-day experience.By virtue of creating a Herland, she is setting women in opposition to men. That is , she believes that society of Amazons is good, and mixing it with men is evil.Aristotle said,\\"There are some, however, as we have said, who both state themselves that the same thing can be and not be, and say that it is possible to hold this view. Many even of the physicists adopt this theory. But we have just assumed that it is impossible at once to be and not to be, and by this means we have proved that this is the most certain of all principles . . .\\"\\"If all contradictory predications of the same subject at the same time are true, clearly all things will be one. For if it is equally possible either to affirm or deny anything of anything, the same thing will be a trireme and a wall and a man; which is what necessarily follows for those who hold the theory of Protagoras. For if anyone thinks that a man is not a trireme, he is clearly not a trireme; and so he also is a trireme if the contradictory statement is true. And the result is the dictum of Anaxagoras, \\"all things mixed together\\"\\"(Metaphysics, Book IV.4)Herland is not Eden-it is a Fool's Paradise. It is not practical, relies on a dues ex machine to function, and naive. The most corrosive ideas is that men are not only unnecessary, but the chief cause of the problems in the world. This is unabashed sexism, and ignored the fact that men are out there, and have things to contribute. This is as radical as any male chauvinistic nonsense. Changing the genders does not confuse anyone.If we were to implement Herland, what would be Gilman's final solution to the Man question? She does not say-perhaps for the better.Gilman is a pseudo-utopian. This book is not utopian, but more of feminist fantasy, which is just as bad a the male fantasies seen on cable TV.

If you really detest men and you haven't a clue how males think or how real societies operate, you might like this story. However, if you have even one foot in reality, you'll find it childish to the extreme.Author's assumptions1. Men are the root of all evil.2. Anything men can do, women can do better (including writng utopian fantasies).3. Men are unnatural, unnecessary, unattractive, unreformable, and unrepentant.4. Sex should be non-existant.5. Science and society works out just the way you want it. (See Kendal Hunter's prior review.)6. The reader has boundless time to vest in useless novels.It's important to keep in mind that the book and its ideas were coming into print just as the seeds of Nazism and Hitlerism were planted and being cultivated. Clearly the author's ideas would not have been out of place in that era of eugenics as a way to build an ideal society. Furthermore, in her book, the author glosses over a myriad of 'unpleasant' details fitting of a nazi utopia:1. The book contains more than a hint of socialist Aryan one race, one ideal elitism.2. Birth control (!!!) is hinted, which by definition must involve some form of abortion.3. Capital punishment is hinted as this 'utopian' society's way of getting rid of undesirables.4. Women would be identically featureless, classless, and (apparently) humorless. By definition, parthenogenesis is not unlike cloning at the ovum level, so all women would be identical, excepting mutants.5. It left me wondering if even crying babies was too much to be tolerated in this society.I struggle not to be too hard on a novel nearly a century old, a blueprint for a feminist, socialist utopia devoid of men and apparently anyone else unlike the author. If this were a book about a utopia about race, we would condemn it to purgatory. However, since it only trashes men, we 'liberal women' are expected to swallow it reflexively. Unless you are a woman who pulls out her vibrator whenever you think about killing off men, I can't imagine who the audience is expected to be or why this tale was resurrected.A number of good science fiction authors have addressed this same topic with superior stories and I would recommend any one of them over this tale that should have remained buried in the trash heap of time."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"This book was interesting, to say the least. While I didn't particularly connect with the characters, I don't think that Gilman's point was to have readers fall in love with the characters - the message here is deeper than the characters or the story. It definitely gave me a lot to think about, the main thing being that this society, because they have no men, don't see through a lens of gender in any way. As I can't imagine such a thing - women are always compared to men in real life - it is an interesting concept to spend time thinking about. What would it be like if people were just people and gender was completely irrelevant?If you want to know whether or not I would recommend reading Herland, the answer is yes I would if you are interested in classic feminist literature. It is definitely a valuable read but I do need to acknowledge that the book may not be for everyone.

When the three explorers find that such a culture indeed exists, they find such a stark contrast from this society and the civilization they've come from.The narrator is a sociologist, and his companions have somewhat stereotypical roles in the story. The first is a doctor, and a southern romantic, and the other is a classic male chauvinist and the antagonist of the story. I found that parts of the story were a little rough, but the work as a whole was very enjoyable.The basic questions of why our society works the way it does causes the narrator to rethink his entire world view, and his views of civilized society. This novel is a worthwhile read, and an interesting perspective on a Utopian society."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Early 20th Century feminist activist and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman is best known for her nonfiction treatise Women and Economics, which analyzed the detrimental effects of the economic reliance of women on men in American society.In Herland, Gilman takes a different approach: A political satire in the form of a untopian adventure story.Her three protagonists are all male, typical wealthy explorers and adventurers that you might expect to find in the pages of something by H. Rider Haggard. And in fact, Gilman exhibits a strong command of the \\"Lost World\\" and uptopian adventure genres, writing an enjoyable fantasy tale with tight pacing, good action, and enough conflict to keep things interesting even before one examines the political aspects of her writing.The three adventurers hear a rumor of a sheltered valley that is home to an all-female society and they set out to explore it. The narrator's motive is mainly curiosity. He is genuinely interested in the workings of this society, and he approaches the experience as a scholar. His two companions represent more extreme views. One is the typical male chauvinist, a macho \\"man's man\\" who expects to be greeted as a conquering hero as the only man in a land of women. The third member of the group has an idealistic view of women, placing them on a pedestal, but not accepting them as capable or competent.The society they find is described in excellent detail, considering the relatively short length of the novel. It is present as a superior society in the sense that one would expect for a novel to be considered utopian. The women of Herland have no poverty, no war, and almost no crime or disease. Their primary focus is on the rearing and education of their daughters, and the whole society works in concert to improve its base of knowledge and then to impart that knowledge on to the next generation.Much of this is clearly meant to satirize modern society of the time the work was written (and it provides criticisms that remain just as valid today). But many of Gilman's ideas about education are quite well thought-out.Gilman's women of Herland are descendants of a mutant (although that specific term is not used), capable of reproducing by parthenogenesis and having only female offspring. The author gives enough scientific and historical background to at least make the society's origins plausible in the context of a fantasy adventure novel. The three protagonists spend much of the first few chapters debating the argument that there must be men hidden somewhere before they finally come to terms with the true nature of their hosts.From there, they embark on a path of romance and eventually marriage, all of which is condoned by the society of Herland, who are interested in the possibility of a return to a gendered society. In Gilman's sharpest bit of satire, she has the women assuming that they must be missing out on some great benefits by having only one gender in their society, even as her male characters must reluctantly admit that there is little that the outside world has to offer to Herland.The ending follows a fairly predictable path, at least in terms of the resolution of the major plot points. There were a few interesting surprises in the course of wrapping things up.The overall tone is witty, but never truly bitter. Even the male chauvinist character is given a sympathetic treatment, and Gilman does a good job of conveying her ideal of what a society can be if people were to treat each other well and to work toward a higher standard of education and compassion.Rather than an outright condemnation of our society, Gilman gently reminds the reader that society could do better. And she serves it up in a story that is entertaining and amusing."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Oh, this ones just all types of insane fun. Written near a century ago, Gilman has her 3 male protagonists crashland an early plane into a secret uptopia where men don't exist.And what a wonderful world it would be, too. Gentle, highly evolved, all needs met, no pain, entirely communist (you can't even raise your own kids there). No icky sex (babies are born when a woman WISHES super hard for one). The women of Herland ease the men into their blissful way of life, the men come to realize what utter simpleton pigs they are (including realizing sex is awful and subjugating) and likely happiness for all, but Gilman never quite finished it."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"A beautiful and thorough examination of utopia populated entirely by women, through the prism of an intelligent and educated young man. The writing is engaging and entertaining while managing to present the philosophy of the author convincingly. The only shortcoming to the ideas presented in the book is that no reason is given as to why such a utopian civilization would develop simply due to the lack of any men.Most entertaining is the behavior of the women of Ms. Gilman's utopia. In stark and glaring contrast to contemporary feminism, the women of Herland deify motherhood, adore children, and are shocked to horror at the very idea of abortion; androcide is unthinkable, even as punishment for a crime. Indeed, an important book to history and philosophy."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Back in 1915 when HERLAND was written, women were widely considered weak and uncreative and had the sole responsibility of taking care of home, family, and being socialites. So, when 3 young American men in the novel encounter a country comprised entirely of women, they look everywhere to find out where they must have hidden their men. Of course, being emperialist men, they think it should be easy to conquer and subdue a country of women. However, they are looking at these \\"women\\" through the eyes of their own culture, not realizing their full potential as \\"humans\\". These are women who have such little land to support their people that they've only kept and cultivated food-bearing trees like most people would cultivate a garden and who have learned how to have children without men. Some women! Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote this novel after leaving her own husband and home, going off to prove that women are as capable as making a living for themselves as men are. I can only imagine the stir this book must have caused among the feminists of the day. Gilman has written a very interesting book with only one minor flaw. She keeps on building the reader up to this \\"big thing\\" that the women of Herland evidently have in store for the men who have dropped by bi-plane into their perfect little world. It turns out to not be such a shocking thing after all and pretty obvious in fact. Despite this slight transgression, the book is superb.

In my opinion, the work doesn't bear up under these accolades. The story is down right boring, which is disappointing considering how engaging Gilman's short stories and other works are. The plot is odd and the message that Gilman is trying to convey is lost. I saw another reviewer call this work a satire, but I would strongly disagree.

Okay, so Herland was written in 1915. It's dated, but Gulliver's Travels is not dated.Two main areas are so wrong the misinformation gets in the way, and the reader is trying to make it right, but they can't:Some principles of agriculture are the same over time. Even at that time, potato blight blew in from far places and killed all the crops. Today, ambrosia beetles can fly in and transmit deadly fungi into avocado trees. But in Herland such things don't exist. The second law of thermodynamics is universal, but in Herland the forest soil continues to accumulate and to be enriched.The second area that's all wrong is parthenogenesis. The premise is that all reproduction is by parthenogenesis, resulting in all females. This is impossible in mammals. At least one sperm nucleus is required to initiate the second stage of meiosis in eggs, so they couldn't get a viable ovum. Further, birth control in Herland occurs by having a feeling. A candidate for congress was recently defeated for suggesting such a foolish notion.I found it tedious reading. I thought her point about the stereotypical ways in which many (not all) men view women was well-taken. I thought it was astute at that time to realize that if the courtship dance between males and females is off key, the mating doesn't take place. I thought her case for acceptance of a more three-dimensional woman was well-founded. But I sure wouldn't like to live in an all-female society.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Herland","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It's quite small but it is packed with so much food for thought and I'm left in complete awe a week after finishing it. I don't know how I'm going to sum it all up in order to do it justice but I'll give it my best shot.This book is often described as a feminist book but I don't feel educated enough to really speak to that. So I'll just be looking at it from a perspective of how fascinating it was to me as an average reader.The book starts out with three friends on an adventure to discover the mysterious land of women they've heard about. These three men seem to embody different male perspectives. There's Terry who is a playboy and womanizer, Jeff who idolizes women, and Vandyck who is the narrator and falls somewhere in the middle.Of course the men are curious about whether a world of women really exists. When they find it and fly over, they are surprised to find that it looks civilized, that there are buildings and farms and things in order. Terry is especially skeptical that there really aren't any men in this place because he just can't believe women are capable of building things and creating a civilized society.After entering the place the men begin referring to as Herland, they feel threatened by the women and try to escape which leads to them being captured. Although they aren't treated badly, they are contained in a sort of castle where they are given quite a bit of freedom but are constantly watched to ensure they aren't a threat. They are also assigned tutors and they begin learning the language, culture, and history of Herland.They quickly become accepted into the society as they continue to learn. Much of the book entails them exploring Herland and learning about the ways of the women there. The women also want to learn of the outside world and there is quite a bit of comparing and contrasting. It seems the author wanted to create some kind of commentary on the shortcomings of life in the outside world (the world as we know it).What impressed me the most is the world building of this book. The women of Herland answer all the men's (and readers) questions so thoroughly and I found myself totally convinced of everything they did, how they came to certain conclusions, and how their society developed the way it did. After having read The Giver which I thought had a very poorly built world that wasn't well explained, I was just blown away by all the thought that went into creating Herland.This book is incredibly thought provoking as well as it comments on society and the way things are. In Herland the community is very collectivistic and everyone works together to improve their society. They have a collective identity of \\"we\\" and think of themselves as a whole, without individual families or needs. Instead,\\"all the surrendering devotion our women have put into their private families, these women put into their country and race. All the loyalty and service men expect of wives, they gave, not singly to men, but collectively to one another.\\" (pg. 95)When the women realize their land can only support so many people, they work together to control the population. Although some women might desire motherhood, they realize it wouldn't be in the best interest of all involved. Instead, they channel all their motherly love into nurturing other children and caring for the people around them. This seems to be a judgment on our own overpopulation and what some might regard as a person's jealous desire to have their own biological children.Another interesting thing was the way the men perceived the women of Herland. They were expecting them to fit their idea of women and be very feminine. But if there are no men then the concept of masculinity and femininity doesn't really fit. How can a person be feminine if there is no other way of being (masculine) to contrast with? One of the women observed that, \\"in a bi-sexual race the distinctive feature of each sex must be intensified.\\" (pg. 89)So is femininity just a concept and would women really act in \\"feminine\\" ways if there weren't any men? Would they need to differentiate themselves by dressing differently and having long hair?The men also realize how much they view women as women instead of just people. Because the women of Herland aren't feminine, they begin to see them as people, not as women. At one point it is stated, \\"We were now well used to seeing women not as females but as people; people of all sorts, doing every kind of work.\\" (pg. 137)There were so many other things to think about that this blog post could go on forever. But I'll stop there and hopefully I've given you a glimpse of all the things you'll encounter in this book. I personally didn't find it to be overly preachy or declaring that women were superior to men. There were a lot of interesting ideas and I think anyone can learn a lot from reading this book and get ideas about how our world could be improved if everyone looked out for one another, for example.So I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of science fiction, fantasy, or speculative fiction. The world building is excellent and there's plenty of food for thought. I think I could easily re-read this several times and come away with something new each time."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"On an exploratory trip in \\"savage\\" lands, three young American men find a country composed entirely of women. As these men learn about the history and culture of Herland, they are at first dismayed but later impressed at the asexuality and absolute social perfection of these women. For the first time, they notice the flaws in their own society and feel ashamed.I'm having a really hard time deciding what to think about Herland. I tend to prefer plot-driven novels, or at the very least character-driven novels. Herland was neither plot- nor character-driven...it was concept driven. Gilman was trying to convey a set of principles using an allegorical dialog. Gilman felt that women are subjugated by their sexuality. Because their economic happiness depends on their ability to attract men, they resort to jealousies and obsessions with fripperies. In Herland, there are no men...therefore they do not depend upon their sexuality to land them a desirable place in life--they depend only upon hard work and virtue. Since there are no men, they have no reason to be jealous, catty, gossipy, or hysterical. Thus, they are perfect.For the most part, I did not enjoy reading Herland. I found the dialog grating due to the sickening perfection of the women and the irksome sexism of the men. The men's characters were very flat--their purpose was simply to present a contrast to the perfection of Herland. The three men came in three stereotypical varieties: gentlemanly to the point of sexism, brutishly sexist, and imperfect-but-somewhat-objective observer. Other than these characteristics, the men had no personality at all. The women also lacked character partly due to their obnoxious perfection, but also due to their nature as a social \\"we\\" instead of being unique individuals. In other words, the perfection and socialism merged them into one character with many names (with the slight exception of Alima who brought Terry's brutish behavior on herself by having a \\"far-descended atavistic trace of the more marked femaleness, never apparent till Terry called it out.\\")I think Herland was an interesting thought experiment, but I personally didn't enjoy reading it. If your'e interested in concept-driven allegories, especially feminist and socialist allegories, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"I read this book many years ago and wanted to read it again.My order was handled quickly and professionally.Great service. Great book."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Charlotte Perkins Gilman's \\"Herland\\" is a lost-world fantasy in the Haggardian tradition with a decided twist: It functions primarily as a discourse on the supposed but not necessarily actual differences between the two sexes, and as a feminist screed in the utopian genre. Written in 1915, the novel was initially serialized in the pages of Gilman's own monthly magazine, \\"The Forerunner,\\" a publication whose main agenda was to further Gilman's ideas of feminism and socialism. We are introduced to three very different types of men at the beginning of this story: Terry, a chauvinist kind of man's man with decidedly old-fashioned ideas concerning \\"women's place\\"; Jeff, a Galahad type of dreamy idealist, who's fond of putting women on top of proverbial pedestals; and our narrator, Vandyck, a level-headed sociologist. The three discover a land of some 12,000 square miles on a plateau in some unnamed part of the world...a plateau that is inhabited by nothing but--you guessed it--females. The 3 million females in what Vandyck refers to as Herland have, for the last 2,000 years, been cut off from civilization and have been reproducing parthenogenetically; virgin births that come when the women turn 25 or so, and that always result in baby girls. These miracle births are perhaps the most fantasy-oriented aspect of Gilman's tale; an aspect that might have helped secure its pride of place in Cawthorn and Moorcock's excellent overview volume \\"Fantasy: The 100 Best Books.\\" Our three men, after spending many months of learning the language of Herland (an education not easily accomplished, unlike in many other lost-world adventures where explorers, less realistically, seem to pick up a new tongue in a matter of days) and getting acclimatized, are given a tour of the land, and Gilman shows us how well the women work together, how they have raised childbearing and motherhood to a religion of sorts, and how far advanced their methods of agriculture and education have become. It is a true utopia, with all its inhabitants happy and healthy and well cared for. The men perceive this land in conformity with their various temperaments; not too surprisingly, Terry has the roughest time here. But even he is forced to admit that Herland's accomplishments have outstripped ours in many regards, after initially thinking that no \\"civilization\\" could possibly exist without men.Simply written by its author, with many touches of humor and (at a mere 146 pages) short enough to never wear out its welcome, despite the occasional didactic tone, \\"Herland\\" is a winning read indeed. Even in these more enlightened and more PC times, when American women have the right to vote, can hold any job a man can (even president, perhaps?), and earn almost 75% of what a man earns (OK, guess we still have a way to go!), this book serves as a good reminder that sexism is such an easy trap to fall into. I would like to especially recommend this particular Pantheon edition of \\"Herland\\" because of the wonderful 20-page introduction to the book written by Ann J. Lane, who discusses not only Gilman's life, but the history of the utopian novel in general, and \\"Herland\\"'s position therein. Modern-day readers might find this intro very helpful. And speaking of the modern-day reader, if there was one problem this reader had with Gilman's novel, it was one dealing with the question of sex. Is it reasonable to expect 3 million women trapped on a plateau NOT to resort to lesbianism after so many centuries? The gals seem completely chaste in Herland, and even after Terry, Jeff and Van take three of the Herland women as wives, their brides still insist that sex is only for procreation purposes (which brings to mind the old saying \\"There goes paradise!\\"). But here's what I had a real problem with: Van, amazingly enough, is just fine with this, claiming that he'd rather have a virtually sexless marriage with his wonderful Herland bride than be married to a fully active partner back home! Forget about those virgin births...THIS is the biggest fantasy aspect of \\"Herland\\"!"},{"Title":"Herland","review":"The stunning dichotemy of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's &quot;Herland&quot; exists in Gilman's attempt to present her fictional civilization as a type of Utopia, while instead creating a civilization founded on such loathsome aspects of humanity as pursuit of one &quot;Superior Race&quot;, justifying imprisonment for selfish purposes, ecological tampering and perpetuated stereotypes regarding men and women.Herland, a civilization of only women and girl-children, who reproduce through immaculate conception and produce only female children, reflects Adolph Hitler's belief in societal &quot;cleansing&quot; and pursuit of a superior race. Women in Herland, a place where women are stereotypically all longing for no more in life than to reproduce and pop out babies, are expected to produce no more than one baby each, due to limited resources and land. Any woman who posesses personality traits that do not fit the rigid framework of Herland society, are point blank asked not to reproduce. It is made clear that any personality trait outside of the societally-desired norm of unrealistic goddess-like calm, reserve and mommy-ism is undesirable. Therefore, they &quot;weed out&quot; any differentiation and individualism, establishing a clone-like state of &quot;We're so pure we float&quot; women.The narrator of Herland is Van. He and his two buddies have gone exploring the myth of Herland and landed by plane just there. Exercising a stereotype that doesn't seem to fit, three beautiful, young women are sent out to act as sirens, and lure the men. The problem with this part of Gilman's story, is that supposedly the society has not had any knowledge of or contact with men for thousands of years. How then would they know that men would be so attracted and play chump to this lure? --Be that as it may, again, we see Gilman using women and basing this on the stereotype that young women are to be used as jezebels, temptresses, while the older women are naturally the wise ones, described as &quot;the colonels&quot; by the men in jest. Second female stereotype: A mature woman is a crone. She is not attractive to men, but does have wisdom and authority. Of course there are no young, attractive women on the council of &quot;colonels&quot;. Young, pretty women are of course, flighty and stupid and not in positions requiring wisdom and authority (read: sarcasm).Van and his two fellow-explorers, Jeff and Terry, are apprehended by being rushed by women and anesthetized with ether. Does this say &quot;Peaceful Utopia&quot; ? I didn't read it that way. The men are imprisoned and guarded. They are forced to tutor the &quot;colonels&quot; in English and to learn the parlance of Herland, so that they might better communicated with the colonels and be of more use to their self-concerned purposes. It is apparent that the men want to leave and go home. They attempt to escape. The women spy on them from the treetops, unknown to the men, almost toying with them this way. They observe them, hungry and desperate and wanting to go home. When the women's curiosity in observation is satiated, they drag the men back and double up on the guards. The men are held prisoner in Herland for about a year. This imprisonment of human beings for personal experiment/education in sociology circumvents Gilman's attempt to paint a picture of a superior society.In closing, getting through Herland was a labor, not of love, but of college course assingment. I found these women to reflect stereotypes about women (all women love cats, all women want to be mommies, young women are temptress-sirens, mature women are wise old crones) and other unlikable traits: eliminating indigenous animal and plant life that they made judgements about, tampering with ecology. I also thought the three men were very narrow-minded-ly created compilations of male stereotypes. It was all I could do to even finish reading this book."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Three stars: Five stars as a period piece, one as a work of literature.Mine is the 1979 edition whose preface claims it is still relevant. Perhaps that, too, is an indication of a past phase of feminism, because the story has really not aged very well.The writing is awful. Sorry. I know that it was originally serialized in Gilman's magazine, which might account for the shallow, unpolished quality of it, but it makes for tiresome reading in novella form.I hesitate to criticize Herland too much because Gilman was so obviously a product of her time and social class that it's almost impossible to evaluate her in our modern terms. The work is clearly a reaction against extreme male domination of society and is absurd if it is divorced from its original context. It seems as if the best testament to just how limited women were in 1915 is the painfully-restricted scope of what even an ardent feminist could envision for her gender. I was struck in particular by the apparent inability to develop much technology, and the narrator's statement that Herland had been unable to generate much of a science of geology; I'm sure my mother, who did graduate work in crystal physics, would find that darkly amusing. It seems that even radical women saw the talents of their sex as primarily organic and not scientific or mathematical.What strikes me most in this novel is that Gilman managed to depict women in a way that was revolutionary and yet still to stereotype them. The robotic, heterogeneous inhabitants of Herland--all of them beautiful, athletic, rational, and wise--seem nearly as objectified as the shrinking-violet heroines produced by contemporary male authors"},{"Title":"Herland","review":"HerlandIt is truely amazing how far ahead of her time author Charlotte Perkins Gilman was. In this book she anticipates a perspective that is still only a concept today...In a direct and clear style, she cleverly shows us an inverse reality in the context of a very engaging story.I wish that this was required reading for high school students!"},{"Title":"Herland","review":"I first read this book 20 years ago, and it has stayed with me. All fantasy/sci-fi is, at its best, a parable that shows us a way out of a social/cultural problem. If we can read the women here as figures of \\"everyman\\" (since, after all, we are frequently called upon to view male characters as representative of humanity) we get an interesting and provocative alternative to our current problems with the escalation of violence, the growth of poverty, and the disaster that is our planet."},{"Title":"Herland","review":"Three American explorers stumble upon a small country they dub Herland that's populated totally by women. For about two thousand years, the women have developed an intelligent, productive, perfect society, and with the entrance of the three men, they begin learning about the world outside their realm. The three men find that the women of Herland are ignorant (to their minds) of sexuality and gender roles, but the women are far ahead of the rest of the world in terms of education, child-rearing, population control, and agriculture. To fulfill their own curiosity and learn more, three women of Herland agree to become married to the three men. Unfortunately one of the men has not been able to overcome his own prejudices about how women ought to behave, and with one act he brings their time in Herland to an end. This fascinating story is decades ahead of most feminist, humanist works, and gives every reader an inspiring vision of how the world could be."},{"Title":"Campfire for Cowboy Billy","review":"Wendy Ulmer shows the power of imagination and love in this tale of Billy's own private Badlands. Loudly illustrated by Kenneth Spengler's gouache portrayals of New York City touched by young Billy's Western imagings, the book weaves a tricky path between pure entertainment and message. For the most part, it succeeds.Billy sees a broken truck with vehicles waiting behind it as a wagon train needing repair. Spengler draws a big truck, but he cleverly winds the street and vehicles around in a semicircle to suggest Billy's embellishment of the scene. Similarly, the urban hot dog vendor is at once a NYC vendor and a chuck wagon man (implied simply by his handkerchief and scraggly face). When Billy enters the \\"Badlands\\" by way of a shortcut through the \\"arroyo\\" he remembers a trick that his grandfather taught him to hide and then switch back to his destination: The post office.This kind of book is difficult to pull off, but the message of love, rememberance, and continuity may very well comfort younger children. The book is entertaining as well, but it seems that the potential for a truely wild \\"Western\\" experience was moderated somewhat by framing the story within Billy's relationship with his grandfather. Therefore, the story feels a bit restrained, despite the vivid pictures and \\"cast.\\" However, the author explicitly states (in an endnote) that sheer entertainment was not her goal here; instead, she wrote the book to comfort and to evoke the power of imagination."},{"Title":"Campfire for Cowboy Billy","review":"\\"A Campfire for Cowboy Billy\\" is not only a charming tale, it's a resonant one. Cowboy Billy, who looks to be somewhere between six and nine years old, lives in the city. But that doesn't stop him from riding his stick horse, Splinter, all over the place--watching out for rustlers, delivering Pony Express mail, and so on. Author Wendy K. Ulmer subtly introduces the point that Cowboy Bill's grandfather has died, and that Grandpa had once told Billy that stars are the campfires of those we love--those who have died before us. Billy takes comfort in this tale, and it doubles back towards the end to take on new resonance and meaning. Altogether a sweet and subtle way to discuss death with a child. Ulmer's story is energetically illustrated by Kenneth J. Spengler."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is hard for me to understand because most sentences doesn't make sense.

It brings you into the warped mind of a fireman, who burns books rather than puts fires out. This book proves to be very novel and is interesting at times, but at other points it just seems boring and outright ridiculous. When I read this novel it made me think of what the present day government might do behind our backs to censor certain materials, but the novel can be so confusing that it is hard to find the relationship. Despite these setbacks, it shows how a few wrong moves and decisions by humans today can end up in grave results in the future.In this story, the main character Montag begins to run into people that alter his mind and make him think about the ethics of his job, which of course is burning books. Montag used to live his life smelling of kerosene, ravaging people's houses, and setting books aflame, but he wants to know why he is doing these deeds in the first place. It is sort of difficult to see how books could be so horrible that they should be banned and burned. You learn later in the story, if you can read inbetween the lines of difficult language, that the government has put a ban on all books to prevent them from corrupting the minds of the people living at the time. Montag learns this and begins to live two lives; one as a fireman, and the other as a madman hiding books in the vents of his house. While this is happening a war is going on that is so hard to understand and so irrelevant that it should just be ignored. The book continues to become more confusing, and the end is just unimaginable and pointless.If you love books that are outdated and totally science fiction, then this is the novel for you. It is a great piece of work that was new and exciting when it was written, but to most people today it would just seem odd and nauseating at times. It is totally unbelievable, and it was difficult for me to sit down and read this story because it was so complex and involved. It takes a person with an extremely vivid imagination to read this novel. It was meant to show how people can not let the government get out of control because they will eventually corrupt and control the minds of every last person on the planet, but this point is lost somewhere amongst the many plots and twists. It tends to be very odd take on the subject, and I would not really recommend using your time to check it out."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Basically, Fahrenheit 451 is a let down. The drop off ending cuts off the futuristic plot's potential. There is much colorful vocabulary, but some metaphors are so elaborate and sudden that one hardly knows whether something is actually happening or if it's just a figment of the character's imagination. It is more confusing that challenging to read. The main character, Montag, has a fairly interesting conflict. The only problem is that it is not resolved enough by the end of the book to leave the reader satisfied! Plus, the only moral or meaning from the book is given away early on, leaving nothing to motivate the reader. I recommend this book to nobody, because they will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"could not stand this book. hated everything about it. waste of my time reading it. maybe just too out of date for today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I do not want to tell much of the story, as the unfolding is part of the intrigue.

This leads to all kinds of deviant things like reading. What are you doing now?One big rift between the book and the movie [Fahrenheit 451 (1966) -- Oscar Werner, Julie Christie] is that in the movie the \\"written word\\" was completely removed (even from the credits); where as in the book the state was against was literature and not technical writing.Books are just symbols of ideas that could have been on the screen also.

At least the Martian Chronicles was creative, had an emotional core, kept me captivated. The only thing creative about Farenheit 451 is its title. It paints a blurry picture of a simply boring civilization. I found myself not really caring what happened to Guy and Mildred and all the rest. There is no real prophetic vision as there is in say, Huxley's Brave New World, which gives a vivid depiction of a fully-fleshed out and interesting futuristic world, unlike Bradbury's, which is quite similar to any modern town that would exist when the book was written. Also unlike Brave New World, F451 isn't even very compelling, as censorship nowadays is much less of an issue than the genetic engineering and other issues Huxley raises.

The story is quite fascinating but the way Bradbury works it along is a little confusing. The storyline- Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books and is very proud of his job, that is until one day he meets a girl named Clarrisse and an old man. The story is basically what he decides to do in order to find out why books were banned and what is inside a book that leads people to love them or hate them. The confusing part of this book is that it leaves you thinking &quot;Ok, What just happened?&quot;. I recall that more than once I had to re-read a page 4 times and still couldn't figure out what happened. I'm guessing that the reason this book is so confusing is that it takes place in the future yet sometimes it seems so old (probably because it was written awhile ago). You sit there thinking &quot;Is this the real world (in the novel) or are they discussing the past, or are they discussing the future?&quot;.

It paled compared to Something Wicked This Way Comes, but overall, it was fine. I was glad that I could say I read it, even if it failed to provoke a strong reaction from me.So, it's now been about a dozen years since that first reading, and I found myself needing to reread it because some of my students are reading it. So, I started it one evening and had it done by the next. Normally, I don't get anything read that quickly, what with work to go to and papers to grade, etc. But this time, Fahrenheit 451 was something that I could more than appreciate. It hooked me. I both enjoyed it and appreciate it more deeply than I did a decade ago.What stuck out to me Bradbury's fury at the fast-paced, mind-numbing, loud, hateful, drunken, addled culture that we keep making worse and worse. A culture that abstracts us from the earth, from our neighbors, from our history, that hinders us from the contemplation of deep questions that makes us human. I think that working where I work (with cell phone and tv obsessed students) and living where I live (near DFW) Bradbury's vision hit me hard and with urgency.

I got the book just on time and I had much fun reading it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A must read! This book is great,bought this for school, but ended up loving it. Great price, and the condition was excellent. The book is definitely worth trying out."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I didn't read this book in Middle or High school like most people but I loved it! It was recommended to me when I explained how I love the book Anthem.Great read. Interesting society. Fabulously written."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Very few authors have written a book this significant, this succinct, this brilliant. This is one of my all-time favorite books. I love how he describes everything; and furthermore, the ending was astonishing. The imagery, the action, and the meaning of it all was just stunning. Anybody who knows how to read, must read this book. Starts a bit slow, but once I got into it, I began to appreciate it for what it was. Starting with page 100, I couldn't put it down. I picked up the book at eleven o'clock at night, and by the time it was three in the morning, I was finished. It is that gripping. We need more authors of Bradbury's stature around today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This spare novel is as powerful today as the day it was written, painting a rich tapestry of what is to come and what, frighteningly enough, has already happened.I feel for the junior high schoolers who were forced to read this book--it seems that most of them aren't ready for this brilliantly rendered cautionary tale, judging by their myriad spelling errors alone.It's too bad, really. The book is truly stupendous and *meant* to be stark. I only hope that the disgruntled readers hang on to their initial reviews written here for a few years so that when and/or if they're ready to try it again, they'll realize their folly.And to those who burned the book, all I can say is I hope you enjoy asking, 'Do you want fries with that?' for the rest of your days."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A cynical, yet prophetic view of the world as it is today. The upside-down trick (making fire instead of extinguishing it) has been used to great effect before ('freedom is slavery') and perhaps better. Still, this book is worth the read, if only for the moral warning to society it contains."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, was a good yet weird book. The author tells of a story of a man who finds that what he once thought to be true and right was wrong. The story then takes you through some strange events while you meet different characters. Although the book was sometimes random, it was a fun and exciting book. The book was good, it really seemed to relate to the world we live in and the everyday choices we make."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this book was almost as good as Brave New World and 1984, but I determined that this was not quite up to the standard that these respected authors set. i am not degrading this book at all. it presented some very valid arguments, such as the degradation of the human mind through the removal of books, and thus, most of the conscious, independant thoughts. Also realistically presented was the cause of the forced demise of books, through minorities. i am personally very apprehensive of various minority groups compaining about anything that is not what they desire to hear. i personally support equal rights, but many of today's minorities seem to think that equality is not reached until their rights surpass those of everyone else. if any &quot;questionable&quot; material is released that disagrees with their views, the government must do something to maintain that minority's felicity. for more on this topic, i suggest reading Bradbury's &quot;Coda&quot;. however, it remains somewhat inferior to Huxley and Orwell's dystopias because of the tendency of the book to remain at times too superficial. I understand that the author only spent about a week on the novel, so it is understandable that it would rank in just below these paramount paradigms of the dystopic future of mankind. the massive, forlorn, wretched world of hate created by Orwell is just more in-depth and depicts more intense scenes of the injustices that humans face. Huxley's world, as well, allows for the reader to get more acquainted with the main characters, and thus the readers are more shocked when Winston is torn apart emotionally by the man he once thought he could trust as a fellow usurper of the power of Big Brother.if only Bradbury had gone in-depth, such more could have been reached by the book.however, it remains a classic nonetheless, for the accurate prophecies portrayed and the fears of dehumanization and antidisestablishmentarianism."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you want a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat with action and plot twists, then read a comic book. This is one of the slowest books I have ever read. It is one of the best books I have ever read. It is truely chilling, how close this book mimics reality. Free speach may not be outlawed here, but when the news media is outraged at someone who is prolife.. or when a TV show has to have either sex, violence, or very rude humor to get good ratings.. or when the most improtant thing on the new is the presidents love life.. it really makes you think about just how close we are to the world F451. Many people hate this book because it is so boring, but i think it is good because it doesnt rely on speedy action or witty catch phrases."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A book to sit side by side with '1984' and 'Brave New World,' Bradbury's classic on censorship is less bleak in execution than 1984 and more focused than 'Brave New World,' resulting in a thoroughly readable tome that remains as relevant today as it was years ago. Not as good as '1984,' nor as overrated as 'Brave New World,' F451 is a pleasing mix of warning, cynicism, and pure future paranoia. Very nice.You'll note, 9 out of 10 bed reviews of this book on Amazon come from disgruntled high school students who found Bradbury's phrasings too unwieldy or the story to be too &quot;slow.&quot; (i.e., not action-packed enough) Rather ironic, when looked at from a certain point of view...these narrow-minded, ignorant little children would live quite well in Bradbury's fictional future, no?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's novel is about censorship and how a single thought can change your whole life. The main character, Guy Montag is a fireman of the future--paid to set books ablaze. In the beginning, he finds comfort in this. Then he begins to question authority and the sensless laws set forth by a faceless government. From beginning to end, this story is a thrill ride, cover to cover. Mr. Bradbury has you guessing. His characters are so unique, and at the same time, truly everyday people. This book is truly enjoyable. Younger readers will not get the symbolism; however, older readers will see just how close we probably are to this virtual insanity of lies and deception. In the end I was left wondering, &quot;Who saw that books were so harmful?&quot; Was it one man or the whole nation, slowly evolving from our current lawsuit happy world, to this insane world of deception? I just have to wonder. I would recommend this to teachers. For the student's sake, it is a fairly short story but there is a lot that can be done with it. I would reccomend this to students, except that they will probably have to read it some day for school."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As an English teacher who uses this novel in a high school class I may be accused of being biased but this novel is one of the most chilling and prophetic novels ever written.I will agree with some readers that Bradbury's writing style may be lacking but should readers choose to focus on the minor details instead of considering the themes which he addresses then they are sorely missing out on a wonderful experience. With each new reading of this novel, I discover new aspects and facets which mirrors our society in this country and throughout the world. Analyze the novel while looking deep into the problems of our country alone and a reader cannot help but be moved.This book isn't crying to save all books. It goes far beyond that. It examines the power that people have in shaping their culture, their future and their history. What is freedom and at what price do we preserve every single person's individual rights? Is the power in the society, or the individual?Thank you Mr. Bradbury for providing us with such a wonderful tale."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I love to read, always have, and this book has shown me why. The slow build-up Bradbury uses to show the awakening of a numbed mind is almost brutal. Reading along as Guy forces himself through the ashes of ignorance and blind faith which cover his artificial life, and into the stiff wind of knowledge and understanding, I understood. He begins to possess an amazingly powerful tool: the ability to use his mind to understand his world and why it, and we, are the way we are. Farhenheit 451 is an incredible book that, like the Handmaids Tale, is there to remind us (those of us who care) that the world may one day go wrong. I was very sorry to read some of the negative reviews though, like the others that loved the book, I noticed they came mainly from those who were forced to read the book in school. The book requires a certain mindset and understanding of what people are capable of doing. Students still in grade school or even high school are not ready to understand and see what the implications are if censorship is allowed. Ray Bradbury did a marvelous job in bringing home the importance of reading, and the resposibility that comes with it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this for school. The idea of the book at fist sounded really cool and for a moment I thought I might accually enjoy reading this story. In the end, I hated just as much as everyone else in my class. Montag's wife was annoying to me and Bradbury's ideas are really intersting. Too bad he can't write his way out of a paper bag. This book was a waste of time. Never read it unless its required and theres a test on it. Then you could make an exception, I guess."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I enjoy historical fictions, so I knew &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was not my style, but I thought I would give it a go anyway. Well, I hated it. I did not like Ray Bradbury's style and I think he needs help! Who in their right mind would think of our world becoming so controlling and horrible? There are a lot of unanswered questions and undefined terms in this book, so you better get the Cliff's Notes, because without them, you'll be lost. Do not be surprised if you do not finish this book quickly, either! I did find the subject of book banning and censorship interesting, but I think it could have been told differently. I do not recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"the book has a good theme but it just dragged on. i did not like this book. montag is stupid to revolt in the first place he knows its the law and he knows what will happen to him if he does.

Everything is drawed out way to much. when he could easly say something in a couple pages, he takes like 50 to tell one little minor thing. For me, its really boring and stupid.

Ray Bradbury does not describe the story very elaborate and and so e.g. it is very difficult to understand what the people are talking about.Furthermore, the tension the fireman acts with doesn't get clear in the description by Bradbury. This is a very bad style of telling a story and makes me think the author himself didn't like the story.The dialogues between the fireman, Montag, and the girl he meets on the street are forced and do not seem vivid. So it is a great effort reading it.I have to read this book at school and I do not have any motivation to analyze it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this when I was in high school.

There are three sections, and all that the main character, Montag does in the first section is meet a girl named Clarisse and talks to her once or twice and starts &quot;considering&quot; his job as a fireman burning books. This should give you a rough overview of what the book is like: way to descriptive. A lot of my friends in the class didn't even read the second or third sections because it was so incredibly boring. There are so many metaphors and stuff that it is so hard to understand the story.While I hated this book, if you're the kind of person who likes sci-fi books with a lot of metaphors, then you should read Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Before I was forced to read this book by my eigth grade reading teacher, I had heard from people that it was pretty amazing and thought provoking. They were wrong. The only credit I can give this book is that it is the only one that has ever made me fall asleep. Its inconsistent plot and awful use of surreal events were written down in a rambling, incoherent jumble of thoghts, even if you can call them that. Even if it had any type of meaning or hidden morale, this supposed &quot;work of art&quot; was unbearably boring and slow. Maybe I'm not yet old enough to be able to pick out any real substance from the book's paragraph after paragraph of *@#$, but I do applaud anyone who had the strength to get past the first chapter.

Even using the Cliffs Notes didn't help at all. I don't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book for school and I abolutely hated it. To start off with, it wasn't very well written and the characters and situations were unbelieveable and boring. Montag was a very odd character and hard to relate to and it bugged the [STUFF] out of me how he cried about everything! The book didn't really have a very powerful message either. It was basically don't watch TV, read books. The world will be lost without them! And the whole thing about the stupid Harvard degrees on the railroad tracks was cheesy and stupid. If you can memorize a piece of literature so easily, what's the point for books? I compared this book to Orwell's 1984, which I read last year, and there was no comparison. This book was not nearly as chilling and thought provoking and failed horribly in getting it's point across. With all the talk of firemen burning books, you were tempted to put a match to this one. I also disagree with a major point of the book that implies with the loss of literature comes the loss of morality. The book took place in the future but not that far in the future. I got the idea that it took place only one or two generations after it was written. The morality of the world could not be lost in that amount of time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury in my opinion is extremely confusing and difficult to read. The setting is in a futuristic world, where books are banned and anyone who is caught with books are prosecuted. The main character, Montag, is a fireman whose job is to burn books. The world he lives in is plain and dull, and he becomes desperate for something exciting, so he begins to read the books that he burns. Once caught by his fellow fireman, Montag must flee from his home and run away to escape imprisonment or possibly death. In the book, some of the concepts are hard to understand, and the futuristic conceptions in the book may confuse the reader. The vocabulary isn't too difficult, but there are sections of the book that may set the reader off track. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone younger than the seventh grade level, and I would recommend this book to people who like science-fiction. Personally, I thought this book was very boring and it didn't capture my interest."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If it is, then I will imediatly torch the books to bits and pieces.

I still remember the book and how I felt about it as a child reading it. I vaguely remember my teacher at the time saying in certain places they have outlawed this book but have never thought of it until it was in a daily program on disney recently. I have never really watched this program as it is primarily a childrens show but the advertisement caught my eye as I was flipping channels. It was showing a teacher getting arrested along with his students for merely reading this book. This is when I remembered my teacher saying something about its legality in some states. Is this Union such that we have to hide to read such works of art? I think this action is exactly what Bradbery was trying to prevent in society. He may have been trying to show people what the world would become if we tryed to enforce a sort of literature policy. Where would we be if Shakespeare's works had been baned? I believe this was an excellent book and every child should have the freedom to enjoy it. I hope that when my son is that age he will have the same freedom that I enjoyed in school."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Of all of the books I have ever read, Farenheit 451 made me think the most. It's an easy to read enjoyable story, but it also makes you think along the lines of &quot;What would life be like if . . ?&quot;Most books that take place in the future involve alien warfare and voyages through space. This futuristic story, however, takes you to future earth, where books are illegal to own.After reading this book I wanted to go out and read all the classics I could find. It has been about five years since I read the book, and every time I read a classic, I think about the characters in farenheit 451 who couldn't.I've always appreciated books, but after reading Farenheit 451, I cherish them. It's one of those books where after you turn the last page, you say &quot;Wow.&quot; And then you just sit there, contemplating how real this unreal story actually is.It's true that books are still legal, and hopefully always will be. But, I wonder, is it also true that in the age of e-mails, websites, and cell phones, can we lose interest in simple things like letter writing, non-email greeting cards, and books? I would say yes. And, I think that in Farenheit 451, Ray Bradbury says yes too."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"After reading this book, I realize that our society is really destroying itself. I really enjoyed this book, and I think other people should read it, so they can think about ways to help society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is an exelent book. I'm not quite sure why kids don't like it; I read the book when I was 12, and I couldn't put the book down. I found that the author did an exelent job showing the emotions of the characters, and made me feel almost like I was one of them. I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone, but I will give one piece of advise: If you get to the second chapter, and don't like it, stop reading the book. Though it may seem like you have to finish it, if you think the first part is bad, you'll probably hate the book. Though some books have little action at the begining, then change, this book really doesn't change. There are a few parts with action, but only to a small extent. The first part may seem like it doesn't have any action, and it doesn't, but if you are waiting for the real story to start, you probably missed it. Though the entire book has little action, the author constantly adds very thought-provoking ideas, which makes the book intersting even when there is absolutley no action what so ever. One more thing, if the idea of firemen starting fires sounds like the most stupid idea ever, it won't matter. I definatly didn't start reading the book because of this concept. I thought it was a horrible idea, but it turns out, it works very well. So, read this book. If you don't like it at first (and I'm guessing but probably only about 1% of everyone who reads it won't like it) then stop reading it. It won't get much better."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Even though this book was written in the 1950s, it shows life how it really is now in the 21st century.

Fahrenheit 451 offers much more than a usual science fiction classic; it's incredible detail. Just by reading the first page, you will be captured. At points, I honestly could not put the book down, nor look away. The characters all differ so much, and a fine contrast is established between Montag and the Firemen within the first few chapters. Needless to say, Clarisse must be one of the most riveting, and unique characters of all time. This book is well worth the read.

I read it in 8th grade (last year) and I really liked it. Sure, it's a little hard to follow, but there's something there. Its insightful and intriguing. A real page turner. I think the only reason you guys are whining about it are cause you are being forced to read it and don't want to. Oh well, such is life. I read it cause I wanted to. You can whine and complain and trash on this book all you like, but I say its a very good peice of literature."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"F. 451 was an excellent book beacuse it was above and beyond beyond all other books. The world it portrayed was fantastic, as well as horrific, in it's implimentation. The book gives you a view of human nature: good, bad, and lazy. It also shows how these attributtes can alter the way we live. Among the many subtle meanings in F.451 is they strving for happiness, not pleasure. Montag, the main character, strives for happiness-- a sense of pride in learining and accomplishment-- while his wife easily recieves passive pleasure by watching the electronic 'walls' F.451 is a thought provoking book you will never forget."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I give Fahrenheit 451 41/2 stars because the ook keeps the reader on edge.

The ending wasn't too great either...I really liked 1984 much better."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This disturbing classic by Ray Bradbury (born 1920) grabs the reader with its chilling tone. Guy Montag is a fireman in a society where fire fighters don't extinguish flames but set fire to books because books are considered a threat by the powers that be. After meeting a free-thinking neighbor and seeing his sick wife mistreated, Montag begins to question his values and the values of a society that burns books. In time he becomes a rebel, flees from the authorities, and meets a group of vagabonds that memorize the books and then burn them (to destroy the evidence). Finally war breaks out, and despite much destruction there is hope that a new society will be rebult from the ashes.Bradbury hits a number of themes in this compelling novel, penned in 1951. Censorship is one, but so is a sense of increasing automation, the dumbing down of society, disdain for independent thinking, and probably McCarthyism. The dialog is snappy with many slang expressions that perhaps were more relevant in 1951 than today. The result, of course, is a somewhat eerie but gripping classic. Readers might also enjoy THE PEDESTRIAN and THE FLYING MACHINE, two Bradbury short stories that present similar themes."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a classic that should be reread from time to time and pondered. It is interesting and its message is significant. It is a sermon that few clergy would dare make.I read the story as a parable that denounces the ancient but still existing wrong-headed notion that it is better, far better, for people to be ignorant.Governmental leaders and thinkers have known since the beginning of time that most people are constitutionally unable to understand many truths. Several ways were developed to manage the masses. One, discussed even by Plato in the fourth century BCE, was to reveal complex real truths only to intellectuals, but to teach the general population only \\"essential truths,\\" essential to keep them safe, but not really true.An example is the false notion that God becomes angry when he sees people sinning. This is wrong. A superior dispassionate all-knowing God would never become angry. Anger is a human not a divine emotion. God has no emotions. But clerics teach their congregants that God becomes angry because it helps control the otherwise uncontrollable masses who, if they did not fear God's anger and punishment, would rob, steal, kill and commit other wrongs.A second way of handling these people is stop them from learning the truths about the world. This is why the ancient Roman Catholic Church kept people from knowing the Bible, why they fought against translations other than in Latin, which non-clergy did not understand. This is why Europe existed, if we could use a word suggesting life, in the \\"Dark Ages,\\" in ignorance, like zombies, like cattle munching grass in the fields, until they awakened when they smelt the fresh air of the enlightenment. This is why books were censored and burned during the middle ages. This is why people, human books, were burned during inquisitions.Having this terrible dehumanizing notion in mind, the leadership of the future world in Fahrenheit 451 believed that people would be able to live a better life without books because books, they were convinced, cause wrong ideas, disharmony, confusion and unhappiness.Guy Montag was a government fireman whose job was to burn books. He didn't need to stop fires because homes were fireproof. Burning books seemed right to Montag. It seemed natural and rational. He knew nothing else. This is what he was taught by those who were much smarter than him.But one day a girl woke him up. She was like the child in another parable who was able to see that the king was naked. She told him that people once read books, learnt from them and improved themselves and society. She told him that people could think for themselves and did not need others to tell them what to think.Is the book outdated? Have people finally learned that they are closing their minds?

Might be fiction, but we had better be careful. Read the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel is Ray Bradbury's1984 (Signet Classics)orBrave New World (P.S.). It speaks of a society which has rotted underneath through a loss of one of the most important devices ever created by man: the book. In this modern day \\"burst culture\\" of Blackberry's, Wi-Fi, 24/7 TV, and countless mindless entertainment outlets this book could not be more relevant. The story is a short read about a fireman living in a world where his job is not to save but to destroy. He burns books and by doing so destroys ideas. Today as the library becomes more antiquated, and reading and writing skills become increasing less sharpened by the education system, the story reminds us of the dangers in letting such fundamental skills going uncultured in the next generation. This book should be required reading for all students in elementary or middle school, for (like other Bradbury tales)it stretches the imagination beyond the status quo."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 gives readers the shock of a world where literature becomes irrelevant to the world around them. The world of Guy Montag was a macrocosm of the growing society as seen by Bradbury during the mid-twentieth century. Its symbolism continues to fit in with modern-day society more and more. As civilization continues to modernize, the end that is Fahrenheit 451 continues to become more possible.As a fifteen year-old living in the United States, I am well acquainted with technology and modern gadgets. After reading this book, it was hard to not see that Bradbury was showing his readers that the new forms of media are replacing the art of literature. As the book pulled me in further, the world began to match that of Guy Montag, as books and the love of reading is quickly replaced by television and radio. Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent thriller that questions the reader: what will happen when books are no longer relevant to anything? The stereotypic reader of a book that is set into the future often thinks, \\"this will never happen in real life.\\" With Fahrenheit 451, I had to really think about that question. With the world as it is-television becoming more prominent, society's youth becoming less and less interested with books-why couldn't this happen? Bradbury does an excellent job at reminding his readers that literature is the basis of knowledge, and knowledge is the basis for a successful society.For any reader looking for a read that will challenge both your mind and your heart, I highly recommend reading this unbelievable book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"reading to be against the law?In this classic book, Ray Bradbury paints a picture of a future society where it is actually a crime to read. Before you laugh at the thought, seriously think of how, in many ways, reading is actually becoming more and more discouraged. Every day you read where in school libraries certain books are considered as being \\"unfit\\" reading material for young adults. Books are becoming more and more a thing of the past. Have you gone into a library lately? Just 20 years ago, when I was in my late teens, libraries used to be filled with people and now they look like ghost towns. A lot of libraries across the country have been closed down.In the book the firemen do not put out fires, they start them. 451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature that book paper burns. That is an actual fact. The protagonist of the story, is fireman Guy Montag who is at a point in his life where he is really beginning to question what he does for a living. He really doesn't know why books are being burned, he just does it. Sounds like a lot of us, doesn't it? Sometimes we find ourselves doing things or believing things not because we have personally investigated the matter, but we do it because everyone else is doing it, or because we don't feel that we have a choice in the matter. I tell you this, and this may be a little difficult for some of you people to hear, but in every situation we are in, we always have a choice.What are we choosing to do when we hear that schools are banning certain books? What are we choosing to do when libraries are being shut down? What are we choosing to do when other forms of media are taking over reading? I have a couple of friends who are in their late 30s, early 40s, who actually admitted to me recently that they do not like to read. I found it completely appalling.Without our knowing it, we are gradually making it easier and easier for the \\"authorities\\" to decide for us; this book isn't just a piece of fiction, it's a warning. A lot of things in this book have already come true. I'm not going to tell you what they are because I want you to read the book, but it's almost kind of frightening that we, as a supposedly \\"advanced\\" society have allowed these things to come to pass.When we let others tell us what to believe, how to believe, what to read, how to think, we give away our original power. One must become a \\"soul-rebel\\". One must learn to protect those things that rightfully ours to express. We cannot let others do our thinking. We cannot let others tell us what to believe. We cannot let \\"authorities\\" decide what we are to read. Make no mistake about it; this is an extremely dangerous book. I suggest you read it before it, too, is gone from sight."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I sat down to read this book a bit listlessly. I was reading it, not for pleasure, but for school. We had to pick a novel to read, and Fahrenheit 451 is the one my mom suggested. As soon as I'd finished the first two or three pages, I was hooked. Fahrenheit 451 had perpetual tension at every turn. I could never wait to find out what would happen next.Ray Bradbury wove a vision of a future civilization that burned books and the houses in which they were hidden. As The New York Times put it, \\"Bradbury's account of this insane world, which bears many alarming resemblances to our own, is fascinating.\\" And they are absolutely right. Of all the characters in the book, the one I saw most clearly was Guy Montag, a fireman whose job it was to start fires. Guy is the main character in this story. He agonizes over what life to choose: the ignorant one as a fireman or the life on the run. In the end, he must make a choice.Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most provocative and interesting books I've ever read. All things accounted for; I would say that this novel is one of the most amazing novels of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a book that I had been yearning to read for a long time. A friend of mine had been reading it and I borrowed it one day in class to fill up my free time. I was immediatly sucked in after reading the first chapter.Once I picked up the book a second time, I realized that it gets very confusing past the first couple of chapters. The story turns into more of a portal through which you can read Bradbury's thoughts and ideas of what the future might be like, and what he would do about it. There are many different issues brought up and many ideas conveyed through the story of a fireman whose purpose is to burn books.I picked up the presence of a lot of anger while reading this book. Anger towards authority, anger towards the society that Bradbury envisioned. And all this anger was channeled into Mr. Montag's (the main character) story.Everything within this book captivated me, and definately made me think a lot. It takes a mature mind to read and then understand this book, and I know I'm not fully there. I'm still not sure I received the message Bradbury might have been trying to send. Maybe there isn't one. But this is the kind of book that you would want to read more than once in your life. I know that the next time I read it, I will understand just a little bit more, and learn a little bit more."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Imagine this:The world no longer reads. Instead, they sit around for hours and watch giant screens at home, viewing mind-numbing programming with no real intellectual value. Then, they get in the car and drive 90+ mph, not even for a second thinking about the danger that they put themselves in. People no longer care about anything really. They no longer think for themselves. They have no ideas that make them unique individuals.Sound familiar? It can be honestly said that today, the TV has replaced reading as the number one mode of aquiring information for the majority of people in our nation. They have their minds filled overflowing with ideas that the program presents. And this is how people shape their worldview today. After all, all \\"normal\\" women look like Cindy Crawford or Halle Berry, right? All kids have sex before marriage, right? Everyone has to look like they do on TV, and be like the \\"normal\\" families portrayed on TV...right?In the year 2004, the vast majority of what is seen on TV is absolute garbage. No? Well, OK. To each his own. If you think that watching a fashion model having needles pierced up and down her arm in order to win a challenge is perfectly fine to watch, then OK. If you think gay men running around an island butt naked is considered normal during the \\"family\\" hour, or having kids in a game show soaked with green slime, or someone having plastic surgery and cosmetic dentistry in order to win a beauty contest, or...Thankfully, we don't have to worry about losing our First Amendment rights; there are enough watchdog groups around to ensure that our rights don't disappear.

The Bill of Rights ensures that in the corner of the world in which we live, we have the freedom to ignore the \\"idiot box\\" and read a good book, or newspaper, or magazine, or whatever we want to read without fear of arrest or intimidation.In the \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" world, books are illegal. Since everyone got their dose of enlightenment from the big screen and didn't care about reading anymore, the government said, \\"Since no one reads anymore, why do we need books?\\" and promptly banned all of them. Those fortunate ones who manage to hang on to a few tomes for their enjoyment are paid a visit by the fire department.The \\"firemen\\" in this story, unlike their real-world counterparts, start fires, instead of extinguish them. Kerosene shoots out of their hoses instead of water. The FD (with the number \\"451\\" on their uniforms, indicating the temperature in which paper burns) is dispatched to the \\"criminal's\\" home, and not only sets the books ablaze, but also the home in which they are hidden. After all, they have to set an example to the rest of the community that books are bad and if you are caught with them, your books and your home are toast...literally.The central character in the book, named Montag, is one of these firemen. For years, he has done his job setting fires, and he does it well. But after a run-in with a girl who's a free thinker, and a professor who remembers the days when books were taken for granted, he begins to question why the firemen have to burn the books at all.Though written over half a century ago, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is no longer considered science fiction.

But that's not the way that life is."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I recommend this novel for those who like to read interesting things. This novel is about how books cannot be read at all in society; it was against the law. Imagine just listening to the media all day and radio stations, where would they get all their facts and information on human nature, or nature itself? The firefighters in the story create the fire, rather then putting them out. Picture the future with just technology and no books? This book sort of gets you curious about what is gonna happen towards the ends because of all the killings and interesting talks a man Montag had with a seventeen year old girl named Clarisse. I don't usually like to read books but when I read this one, I wanted to know what happened next or why the people in the story were acting like that? It was easy for me to imagine. So for those who would like to read a short book about a hundred and seventy- three pages, I recommend this one. Below is a quote from the story and my commentary about it. So here and take a sneak peak:1.) \\" He gazed, shaken, at that white hand. He held it way out, as if he were farsighted. He held it close, as if he were blind. \`Montag!' He jerked about. \`Don't stand there, idiot!' The books lay like great mounds of fish left to dry. The men danced and slipped and fell over them. Titles glittered their golden eyes, falling, gone. \`Kerosene!' They pumped the cold fluid from the numerated 451 tanks strapped to their shoulders. They coated each book; they pumped rooms full of it. They hurried downstairs, Montag staggering after them in the kerosene fumes. \`Come on, women!' The women knelt among the books, touching the drenched leather and cardboard, reading the gilt titles with her fingers while her eyes accused Montag. \`You can't ever have my books,' she said. \`You know the law,' said Beatty. \`Where's your common sense? None of those books agree with each other. You've been locked up here for years with regular dammed Tower of Babel. Snap out of it! The people in those books never lived. Come on now...\\" (38)The problem here is that they are called to put fire to a woman and her house for having books. Montag hesitates and tries to encourage the women to leave while she. The women, Captain Beatty and Montag have an argument about books and set the house on fire.In this scene, it doesn't seem like Montag wanted to burn the lady and the books. He seemed hesitant by warning the woman to get out before it's too late. Books seem to be some people's most prized possession. In these books, there are problems, trials, death, and unrealistic acts. They feel that there is no purpose in reading these books because it will corrupt what the society runs now. When he states, \\"The people in those books never lived. Come on now,\\" they feel there is no purpose on how these stories will benefit you positively, but only negatively."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's amazing how a book that was written nearly half a century ago continues to captivate the interest of any reader, aand especially that of a fourteen-year-old like myself. Fahrenheit 451 has managed to do this. Now one of my favorite books, I can sit back and wonder &quot;what makes this such a good book?&quot; I feel the answer is that F. 451 is a slap in the face to Americans living in this day and age. The fact that it appears this is where America is headed - wars (war with Iraq, war with Afghanistan), censorship (parental advisories on cds, ratings on movies), and just a general air of disaffection to the world can be seen every day. America: read this book! We'll be better off for it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In an age of pervasive conformity and the overwhelming prevalence of worthless television such as American Idol, I find it refreshing and inspiring to read such a profoundly original work like Fahrenheit 451. If we allow our brains to wither away by watching wasteful drivel like Guy Montag's wife, Mildred, we surrender to the system, and hence, become nothing but another brick in the wall. Ray Bradbury writes as lucidly and fluently with as vital a message as any of the other infamous dystopian novels such as 1984 and Brave New World. Just as Orwell and Huxley champion the cogence of individuality over mere conformity, so too, does Bradbury.Although Guy Montag is the endearing protagonist and his Captain Beatty the intrepid, yet enigmatic antagonist, it is none other than the characters of Clarisse and Mildred that most intigue me. They emanate resoundly as complete foils for each other. Whereas Mildred woefully lacks even any remote semblance of vision, love, passion, or originality, Clarisse conversely possesses an abundant amount of vigor, vibrancy, ingenuity, and genuine zest for life. Guy undergoes an epiphany upon the inscrutable disappearance of Clarisse that, in turn, galvanizes from within his desire to live again. Not only does he begin to read books again, albeit surreptitiously, moreover he also embarks upon a journey to think for himself again, as it were. No longer allowing Captain Beatty or the Mechanical Hound to motivate his conformity through fear tactics, Guy Montag begins upon a new and unchartered path - one that will undoubtedly lead to happiness in the absence of conformity. Fahrenheit 451 is undeniably a timeless classic and should thus be treated as such. 5 HUGE STARS."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is pretty up to date, and reflects society, since the concept of different ideas and philosophies is ignored in favor of TV, and remembering the dull words of pop songs, and the dull and almost pointless existences of some people, reflected rather grimly in this book. It was very powerful, and a very remarkable book to say that least. Probably the most realistic and the least sci-fi influenced of all those 'utopian society' novels."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, a thought-provoking book about censorship centered around book burning, seemed to get off to a slow start by following the life of the main character, Guy Montag, a firefighter who does not put out fires, but rather burns books for a living. Some of the descriptions given at the beginning of the book were confusing at first, like those of the parlor walls, which really turned out to be futuristic video screens, and the mechanical hound, a robot which is used to track and kill people by the chemical scents they leave behind. However, as I got into the book more, I felt that the almost boring way Bradbury wrote the introduction helps give the reader a sense of what Montag's life was normally like, and allows the reader to see the vastness of the changes he encounters in his lifestyle.I also felt that as the plot thickened, Bradbury did an excellent job of giving Guy human qualities, such as making him impulsive and sometimes hot-tempered, and showing how he strove to do what he thought was right. His interactions with other characters are very real, especially those with his boss, Beatty. When Montag starts to regret burning books, and starts to perceive that there is more to the books he burns for a living than he and most other people believe, Beatty senses Montag's change in emotion, and does his best to set him straight, telling him that books are only filled with useless thoughts and people and places created by writers that are long gone. This is the main conflict that leads to the rising action of the novel. Montag is told that books are bad, and thus by human nature becomes even more interested in them. However, the conflict is greater than this, as it is not just Montag versus Beatty. Besides also trying to get his ditsy wife interested in books, Montag faces an internal battle with himself. He has to weigh the consequences of getting caught with books with the rewards of what he could possibly gain by reading. I especially appreciated the effort Bradbury went through to bring the feelings and emotions Montag goes experiences to the reader by his word choice, and the way he showed the reader how Montag was playing a sort of tug-of-war in his mind.I think Bradbury did a good job surprising the reader whenever possible, such as with Montag's actions. Just when you begin to think that you might see how Guy will act in a situation, Bradbury twists the outcome, keeping you on the edge of your seat in some cases, or at least wondering what will happen next. Such is the case with Faber; a man Montag becomes friends with who also has interests in the forbidden world of books. Just as Bradbury leads the reader to believe that Faber will be somewhat in control of how Guy responds to the remarks of his boss Beatty, Montag leaves Faber in the dust, taking matters into his own hands and acting on impulse.Bradbury uses a serious tone throughout the novel, which helps to bring forth the importance of the subject at hand. I liked the serous way in which Bradbury presents the world Montag lives in, a world without books or leisure reading material. This made me question what I would do if I were in Montag's situation, even though in this day and age it is quite unlikely that books would suddenly be totally banned. It really got me thinking about censorship in general, and how at times in the past we made steps toward making Montag's world a reality by banning books from libraries and bookstores. On the other hand, in brought to light the fact that the bans placed on many books were lifted after such acts were declared unconstitutional, which somewhat renewed my faith in the ability of our government and society to recognize and correct some of its mistakes.The novel is still thought provoking, however, because no matter what kind of society we live in today, we can all imagine living in one that is totally different, one we do not feel comfortable in, one that we let our imaginations run wild in creating it, making it painful to think about let alone live in. I enjoyed how the novel made me realize how many freedoms we have nowadays, and how they can easily be taken away.Without spoiling the ending, I just want to say that I thought it was very fitting. As Granger says near the end of the novel, \\"You're not important. You're not anything.\\" Montag and his group would have appeared to be insignificant to any unsuspecting stranger, even though they were the keys to a vast world of knowledge, one they hope someday the world will get to experience again.Though I do think that Ray Bradbury did a very good job of writing Fahrenheit 451, I feel that it has a few weaknesses. First would have to be a shortness of description, especially at the beginning of the novel when the reader is trying to form an image of the world Montag lives in. His short initial description of things such as the parlor walls and the mechanical hound left me somewhat confused about what they really had to do with the novel. Another case of confusion occurred with the mechanical snake that was used to empty Montag's wife's stomach and change her blood while she was sleeping after Montag found out that his wife, Mildred, had swallowed some thirty sleeping pills. It is not so confusing how this event happens but rather why it happens, and it does not seem to be important later in the story.Despite some weaknesses, the main point of Fahrenheit 451 is clear, and makes the book a definite \\"must-read.\\""},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel of the dangers of a world without books is extremely insightful. It follows the story of Guy Montag, a firefighter who starts fires. Burning books is his true joy until a young girl and a professor show him the true light. Althought it is a relatively easy read, it is though provoking and enjoyable. The tale warns of editing and being afraid of stepping on others toes. This book speaks out and is not one that can be kept silent. Its powerful words tend to remain even after the last lines have been read. This is a must read for all, and a novel that will be savored until the very last words."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Brilliant. If you have not read this book, read it.

It drasticly emphasizes ceonsorship and the devestating impact that can take place from it. Some people believe that censorship has advantages in that it prevents exposure of inappropriate media to the youths of society. Farenheit 451 offers a different view on the subject. The many wars that people gave their lives to could very well be considered in vain by the destruction of books in Farenheit 451. The characters played an important role in bringing across this point. I strongly believe that Clarisse McCleannan in the book was that of one who was living in the past in in a way much like our opinions would be towards the sitsuation. She spoke of the past in ways we would speak of our present. I believe that this is a message about the calamities of nesorship that the writer is striving to get across. Although a novel relating to sceince fiction you might consider the various conversations between Guy Montag and Clarisse McCleannan to be heated debates on censorship and what can take place from it. Once again I stand forth and strongy believe that Ray Bradbury, author of Farenheit 451, is not making a science fiction novel for his well being, but to try to put out a powerful message on censorship and the drastic effects it can have on ourselves and freedom."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I began teaching three years ago, I was required to teach this book. Having never read it before, I began reading it just before our winter break. As I soaked up the story of the book, I realized my students were already living it. They begged me daily, &quot;Ms. Hill, why do we have to read this stupid book? Can't we just watch the movie?&quot; As I got deeper and deeper into the book, I grew increasingly depressed about the future of the world.Then I realized: Bradbury has given me a picture of what might be, if we are not careful. His book written nearly fifty years ago peers just twenty minutes into the future now. Technological developments he had no name for then are very real today. For example, his seashell radio is clearly the walkman many of us see pressed in the ears of teenagers daily. TV screens are growing larger and larger and flat screens with HDTV are on the market now. The next step is clearly the full wall television of Mildred's parlor. Robot dogs like Aibo are just a hop skip and a jump away from the dreaded hound.But this is a future preventable. Maybe. But if popular culture is constantly valued above thoughtful consideration and education, we'll march right into a land of burning books and intellectualism on the run.Bradbury's book made me feel defiant. They could never take my books from me. They could burn me with them if they want, but that's what it'll take before I give up my freedom to think for myself.And as for my students, they remind me every day what an uphill battle I have been sent to fight."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. It describes a time in the future where censorship prevails and minds are caged. Nobody has original thoughts; with the abolishing of books creativity was lost as well. Guy Montag, the protagonist, is a fireman (firemen burn books in this story) who has to fight to pull himself from the grip of an overpowering government and tradition, only to see that it is all useless (why teach to people who can't understand?). The novel shows what censorship can do to a society, and why individuals must not accept the norm without questioning its integrity and implications. Overall, read this book immediately and apply what you learn from it into everyday life.By the way, ignore all of the reviewers that gave the book a low score because they could not understand the plot and symbolism. Their comments are similar to saying Shakespeare's works are poorly written because he uses odd vocabulary and the plot is too complex. Unfortunately, these people make of the mass of society, which is why these reviews are commonplace. (The funny thing is, the novel specifically targets these kind of people...)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a simply great book. Yes, it's quite distressing and unpleasant to read - because what Bradbury describes is much closer to truth than we'd like it to be. And that is precisely what makes the reality of the book so alike our own - it's more pleasant not to think about such things, and therefore one can merely say the book doesn't suit one's taste and go 'get entertained' in front of the TV.The disturbing thing about the book is that, unlike many other books that deal with the distant future, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" (written in 1953) hasn't been proved wrong simply by time itself. Not at all. Actually, what is shocking to realize is that we've come quite close to the society Bradbury writes about. Perhaps books haven't been banned yet, but it is indeed the entertainment industry that controls people's minds, the political correctness has reached ridiculous levels, there are ads everywhere and now we even have Segways so that we don't have to walk anywhere... And, of course, we can get a thousand page long classics shortened to a hundred pages - or, better yet, simply watch the movie.The book also has other qualities besides making one think (which is, judging by some other reviews, one of its biggest downsides). One cannot but admire the brilliant way Bradbury uses absurd and creates a completely surreal feeling by using the methods of expressionism to describe the feelings and thoughts of the main character.Bradbury sure had things to write about - and that can be proved by even something as simple as the fact I've spent the last half an hour writing a review on the Internet rather than reading a good book or looking at the world..."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book about 18 months ago, but I am writing a review now because the book came up during a mealtime conversation. We talked about how prophetic a very good science fiction writer can be. This is definitely the case in Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. Guy Montag lives in a world that represses freedom of speech, creativity, and the core of human spirit. People, including his estranged wife, are drones glued to these pseudo realities in television. It describes senseless trivia shows (can anyone say \\"Who wants to be a millionaire?\\") and awfully realistic soap operas that his wife affectionatly refers to as the \\"family.\\"What is most disturbing is that as televisions and technology become more \\"artificially intelligent\\" we will face some of the brainless drivel (we already do) that the major media networks provide us.As a fireman, Guy Montag starts fires with books as the culprit - rather than putting them out. The idea is that books can make some people feel bad and as a result we should get rid of them - in other words books can be controversial and our country does not need disputes. The enforcer is a mechanical dog (which I found a little unrealistic and distracting) that injects a lethal poison into any opponents. Despite the silliness of the mechanical dog - the underlying theme is fantastic - open your mind and save the beauty of spontaneity and creativity of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It was a pleasure to burn. So begins, with this absolutely perfect opening line, Ray Bradbury's celebrated exposition of the dangers of censorship. Everybody knows that Fahrenheit 451 is a novel about book-burning, but this story goes much deeper than those not having read it may suspect. Its message truly does become even more germane and prophetic with every passing day. The skeleton of the plot is rather basic, really. Guy Montag is a fireman whose job it is to burn books and the houses in which these dangerous manifestations of inane scribbling reside - usually hidden. No one even remembers a time when firemen actually put out fires. We join Guy's life as he enters into a cusp of uncertainty. He has dared to pilfer a book here and there and stash them in his house, a most dangerous crime indeed. He soon meets a free-spirited teenager who breathes life into his state of uncertainty and opens his mind to brand new thoughts and possibilities. When she makes him admit that he is not happy, his life is changed forever. He can't take the lack of substance all around him, the wife who thinks of nothing but \\"the family\\" (a type of interactive programming that dominates the living room), the impending war which everyone essentially ignores. He knows there must be something else in life, and he comes to believe that the enlightenment he is after must surely be contained in books. Montag's conversations with his Fire Chief on this subject are quite astounding and revealing, and between this and Montag's friendship with an old former professor, we learn how Montag's world came to be this way.The government did not simply ban books overnight. Censorship started slowly and at low levels. Some minority group complained about this - deleted; another group complained about that - gone; these fellows over here object to so-and-so - zip. So many little pieces of books were removed that, over time, the very essence of books was destroyed. While the government has now come to insist that reading books is a crime, the horrible truth of the matter is that the society itself, in its fractious ways, is the party responsible for this tragic state of affairs. Can there be a more timely topic for our own time? We continually see history books being rewritten, \\"objectionable\\" words, phrases, and (horror of horrors) ideas removed from novels and poems so that no one can possibly be offended by anything under the sun. Censorship is a cancer on society, and the world needs visionaries such as Ray Bradbury to forcefully draw attention to the cold hard facts that a majority of the population seems to ignore or fails to acknowledge. Once the true meaning has been chopped out of the books lining our shelves, it will be too late to reverse the momentum without the aid of some kind of miracle. Fahrenheit 451's message is one that all people should be exposed to, and this novel is such a quick (but powerful) read that everyone really should read it. As horrible as it is to envision, I fear that this type of censorship could indeed happen here."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am teaching &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; as the example of a dsytopian novel in my Science Fiction class, although it is certainly one of the most atypical of that particular type of narrative discourse. Compared to such heavy weight examples as George Orwell's &quot;1984,&quot; Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World,&quot; Yevgeny Zamiatin's &quot;We,&quot; Ray Bradbury's imaginative meditation on censorship seems like light reading. But the delicious irony of a world in which firemen start fires remains postent and the idea of people memorizing books so they will be preserved for future generations is compelling. Of course, there have been more documented cases of &quot;book burning,&quot; albeit in less literal forms, since &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was first published in 1953, so an argument can be made that while all the public debate was over how close we were the Orwellian future envisioned in &quot;1984,&quot; it is Bradbury's little parable that may well be more realistic (especially in terms of the effects of television).The novel is based on a short story, &quot;The Fireman,&quot; that Bradbury published in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in 1951 and then expanded into &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; two years later. However, those who have studied Bradbury's writings caw trace key elements back to a 1948 story &quot;Pillar of Fire&quot; and the &quot;Usher II&quot; story from his 1950 work &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot; Beyond that, there is the historical record of the Nazis burning books in 1933. The story is of a future world in which everyone understands that books are for burning, along with the houses in which they were hidden. Guy Montage is a fireman who has been happy in his work for ten years, but suddenly finds himself asking questions when he meets a teenage girl and an old professor.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is not only about censorship, but also about the inherent tension in advanced societies between knowledge and ignorance. Reading this novel again I am reminded about Pat Paulsen's editorial on the old &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; (a series well acquainted with the perils of censorship) about how we might enjoy freedom of speech in this country but we do not enjoy freedom of hearing because &quot;there is always the danger of something being said.&quot; Censorship, in practical terms, is the effort of those who do not want others to hear what they find offensive, for whatever reasons, basically because it leads to people thinking thoughts they do not want them to be thinking. Through the rambling diatribes of Captain Beatty, Bradbury makes this point quite clear to his readers.Even though this is essentially a novella, Bradbury's work retains the charm of a short story. The recurring use of animal imagery throughout the story, the use of the mythic ideas of the salamander and the phoenix, make &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; more poetic than any other dystopian work. Even if it is predominantly a one note argument regarding censorship, it is impossible to deny that Bradbury makes a clear and convincing case for his position. Besides, there is something to be said for any work that insures that beyond the point at which water freezes the only other recognizable number on the Fahrenheit scale is the point at which book paper starts to burn."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.\\" Thus says FAHRENHEIT 451's Professor Faber in explaining to Guy Montag the importance of the \\"telling detail\\" of books. Montag is ready to hear these words, his job as a book burner in this twisted society of Ray Bradbury's invention no longer makes sense to him.Books are illegal in the world of FAHRENHEIT 451. So is driving under 55 m.p.h. Faster is always considered better. Montag's society doesn't want anyone to stop and reflect, because it realizes that if people stop and think about things, they'll get restless. As Montag's fire captain tells him, \\"You ask why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed.\\" An important difference between this futuristic society created in 1953 and George Orwell's world of 1984 is that Orwell's government was top-down while all the minorities (of every race, color and creed) in Bradbury's dystopia got together to burn everything that offended them. In this case, lack of tolerance for differing voices led to no voices at all--democracy has eaten itself by misunderstanding itself. Problems aren't faced; they are burned. This is the world Guy Montag rebels against; how deeply it reflects our own world is something to think about along the way.Ray Bradbury is a good writer, one who encourages people to ask the question &quot;why&quot;. He wants everyone to have a voice and to be able to express himself or herself, but not in such a way that they drown out other voices--the best ideas, he seems to believe, will naturally come to the fore. A short book of under 180 pages, FAHRENHEIT 451 is often assigned to middle school students. For those--like myself--who missed it in school, it still stands as an important work for all lovers of reading, freedom, and ideas for their own sake."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Sometime in the not-so-distant future, the world will change severely. Soon people's homes will be completely fireproofed, leaving no use for firemen as they are thought of today. But they will not be out of work; their role will simply change. In an ever increasingly television oriented society where yesterday's classics are now thought of as censurable tripe, firemen will be starting fires, not stopping them. Their new role will be of a secret police that search out the hated books and raise their temperature to the level at which books burn, Fahrenheit 451. This is the premise of Ray Bradbury's novel. Bradbury's story is an ominous look into where he fears society is presently headed. It is in many ways a warning against existing increasing rates of demoralization, drug use, addiction to non thought-provoking activities, and illiteracy. He easily communicates how such simple trends could evolve into societal brainwashing and individuals who say they are happy, think they are 'social,' and simply spend all their time in their parlors (the ultimate in new television technology). One of the self-proclaimed 'odd' people of this book went decidedly against the norm in saying, &quot;But I don't think it's social to get a bunch of people together and then not let them talk, do you?&quot; However, this book is not solidly a story of doom and gloom. The main character is a fireman named Montag and he ends up providing hope for the reader. While he is not a godlike hero, made up of courage and thew, he does fit the quixotic template in that he is a sad classicist in a new and frightening time. After only a small jolt of reality from an imaginative child, he realizes the world could be made of truth and beauty, rather than the contemporary cheap thrills and insatiable cupidity. Furthermore, this tale has much in common with two other critically acclaimed classics. Montag's government is merely interested in controlling the people while waging war with other super powers, much like the opression in George Orwell's 1984. Additionally, individuals hold very little sacred, no one cares for human life and everyone is looking for a cheap (often-dangerous) thrill. This is a public where men who handle drug overdoses are not concerned that such matters happen &quot;nine or ten a night,&quot; all of this general apathy is mirrored in the novel Brave New World. But, again, Bradbury is a creative author, and his visions of the future are not nearly as hopeless as 1984, or so alien and drug based as Brave New World. Fahrenheit 451's point is twofold. While it warns against where society is headed, it also shows that it only takes good people like Montag to bring society back from the brink of ruination. This faith in the goodness of the common man does not falter and shows optimism that is not always part of such works. Upbeat themes can be hard to find in such otherwise bleak forewarnings, and even in most normal classics it is hard to find a purely happy ending and/or main point. Seeing as this book was published over forty years ago one would assume that it is out of date, but this is not true. It is a science-fiction book without any unbelievable differences between this projected world and our own. Also, Fahrenheit 451 is easily read. The book communicates its point in a mere 160 pages, none of which are filled with incomprehensible vocabulary. It contains enough action for those who like it, and plenty of Montag's self-realizations for readers interested in seeing characters delve into their own mind's inner recesses. This book should be a joy to anyone who chooses to pick it up. Conversely, this easily enjoyed book carries with it some strong meaning. Montag's experiences are a warning to people who would get so used to their impersonal lifestyle that they would become desensitized to many of the world's horrors. Upon finishing the book, one is sure to be more guarded against choosing an easy path, and therefore becoming less of a human. Bradbury did well in bringing the way life became more and more impersonal and barbaric. &quot;I put up with (my children) when they come home three days a month; it's not bad at all. You heave them into the 'parlor' and turn on the switch. It's like washing clothes.&quot; In likening children to annoying creatures which deserve as much attention as laundry, the character who made this statement both disgusts the audience and says the statement as if it were only natural. The author has a talent for letting his audience see situations both as they normally would and as the characters do. Even through the opening we see some of the book's many themes played out in Montag."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, written by Ray Bradbury, is the chilling, prophetic, science fiction novel of the future. About censorship, it portrays a world where books are outlawed by a totalitarian goverenment, it shows how society's only goal is to achieve &quot;pleasure&quot; through the senses. It tells of a world where petty facts are more valued than knowledge and ideas; a place and time where no one questions what they are doing and why, but just doing it by rote. Guy Montag is a fireman of the future. Ironically, his job is to start fires, to burn everything, especially &quot;corrupt&quot; books that contradict the government, and society's way of life; books that make people think and learn to question things. Like all others, he doesn't ask questions, and enjoys his job, enjoys burning things, because &quot;fire is bright and fire is clean.&quot; He lives oblivious to the frightening realities of life until his next-door neighbor, Clarisse, a young girl of seventeen, teaches him to ponder what might be behind the books that he burns, to learn to ask the question &quot;why?&quot; This causes him to undergo a &quot;crisis of fiath.&quot; Examining his life for the first time, he sees how empty and meaningless it is. His wife cares for nothing else than her &quot;television family&quot; and is sucked into a world of endless chatter, movement, and moving images. He realizes the terrible horror of what society is doing; watching the tube, &quot;oohing&quot; and &quot;aahing&quot; but not really talking nor communicating with one another. Montag grows to recognize what a corrupt society he is living in. When clarisse mysteriously disappears, Montag is motivated to make some changes in his life. During nighttime &quot;calls,&quot; he starts hoarding books away in his home, determined to understand what is behind those pages. Montag also tries to ignore Captain Beatty who tries to confuse him in his search for the meaning of books. Pondering the questions of life, his futile search for the ultimate &quot;truth&quot; leads him to Faber, a retired English professor. With Faber's help, Montag finds the road to justice and restoring the &quot;past&quot; where people are not afraid. Written in third-person, this book is an excellent portrayal of human nature; the good, the bad, and the in-between. Ray Bradbury, the author, paints a vivid picture of a future with no books, and makes the reader realize that without books, creativity and thought would be stifled. Literary devices such as similes, metaphors, and rich symbolism (example: &quot;seashells&quot; are the future generation's discmans) are used by the author to enrich the story. There are many types of conflicts shown in &quot;Fahrenheit 451;&quot; person vs. self, person vs. society, and person vs. person. Montag struggles with himself and tries to distinguish between right and wrong. He also battles with the society around him, and tries to make them realize that books are not to be feared, but worshipped. This is evident when he reads the poem to Mildred and her friends while they are in the &quot;parlor&quot; watching the &quot;walls.&quot; But becuase of their lack of understanding and depth, they do not udnerstand the purpose and meaning behind the poem and regards Montag as being &quot;crazy.&quot; Montag'ss struggles with Captain Beatty is the person vs. person conflict represented in the book. Since the world declining to conditions recounted in the book is hgihly possible, the novel has an &quot;aura of chilling prophecy,&quot; which I like. A sense of the &quot;not so distant future,&quot; with fantastic magical realism such as &quot;spacecrafts&quot;are common in all of Ray Bradbury's work, such as the &quot;Illustrated Man&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit 451.&quot; I enjoyed reading this &quot;thought-provoking novel,&quot; about the future and censorship. It is no small wonder why there are over four and a half million copies in print all over the world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Several reviews on here have given Fahrenheit 451 a low score because they thought the premise was too far-fetched. These reviewers aren't aware of the situations that exist in certain theocracies around the world. Afghanistan under the Taliban outlawed television and women were not allowed to read or educate themselves. In several Middle East countries, merely speaking up against the government makes you a target.Bradbury looked at different phenomena in our society- the desire to not offend anyone, the dumbing-down of a society in love with television, etc., and simply extrapolated these until he reached an end very similar to the conditions that existed under the Taliban.Part of the point of science fiction is to be far-fetched, but good science fiction uses those far-fetched ideas to warn us of the dangers of the present, in this case the dangers of censorship, of political correctness, of television, and anyone who thinks those dangers are not real, that this book doesn't have relevant warnings, hasn't studied the real world enough.Everyone should read this book. It's an entertaining and easy read but also has a lot of idealogical depth behind it for those who are willing to think and read at the same time. If you don't want to think about what you read, well, go watch TV and be done with it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury has created a shockingly realistic future for us, where the desire to be happy overrules the need to be informed. The most frightening part, perhaps, is that this style of censorship is practiced in high schools across the country. As a high school senior, I have witnessed several instances of attempted &quot;book bannings&quot; from school libraries, mostly led by misinformed parents who could not see through the 4-letter words or &quot;disturbing&quot; situations to the true worth of the novel. Unlike 1984 or Brave New World before him, Bradbury's world is closer to ours, and much more attainable.The theme of Fahrenheit 451 is seeing through the clutter and propaganda to what is truly important. Not necessarily books in particular, but the essence of life which they capture and present in sometimes startling ways. Guy Montag, Clarisse McClellan, Faber, and few others can see that butterfly in a landfill essence of truth, and their contrast against the rest of the world shocks the most disillusioned reader into realizing that, in literature, there is truth. In a world where science and technology are increasingly more important, Fahrenheit 451 is a far-sighted message from the past telling us, indeed, the arts are what puts us above the primates."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This isn't exactly a review. I don't enjoy writing reviews for books that already have so many reviews written for them, because what's the point? And a classic like this has already been described so many times, who needs another person to repeat the same synopsis again? But two days ago, after a kid ran into my Science class screaming that Ray Bradbury had died, I knew I had to write something about this book.As said before, I won't describe this book, since if you're reading this, you probably know already. When I first read this book two years ago, I was enthralled. For me at the time, classics were overrated, boring, and way too old to be relevant. Then came Fahrenheit 451. After finding out that it was published relatively recently by an author who had not yet died, I whined in my head, 'But then it's not a _true_ classic.' Eventually, and miraculously, I managed to discipline myself to read it-and I LOVED it. It was so original, and actually SUSPENSEFUL-all of a sudden, my view on classics were changed. I realized I was stupid for not thinking that before, and how childish I was (fine, I was in middle school, but still). Soon I will have to read Fahrenheit 451 for high school, and I actually feel quite happy about that.I'm writing this in honor of Ray Bradbury, in a way. He died on the fifth of June, 2012. I would just like to say, Mr. Bradbury, that your book was truly a masterpiece, and changed my life in more ways than one. I hope that you rest in peace. And wherever you are now, I hope you died knowing that your book would soon become a true classic.--written by a teenager."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Give Fahrenheit 451 a read. It describes a world where people are sucked into tv/media and become drones of the state. If you've ever seen Fight Club or opposed censorship you'll enjoy it. The author Ray Bradbury passed last night, he was 91."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I feel almost guilty giving this book a review like this, it is hailed as a classic and usually when I read books that are considered classics I can see the many strong qualities that put them on the 'classic' pedestal. But I must be honest, I'm not going to make this book sound better then I thought it was simply because it is considered a classic. The only redeeming quality this book really has is the overall idea and like many reviewers have already pointed out - the idea is good, the execution of said idea is quite lacking.This story follows Guy Montag, a fireman. Unlike the firemen of today, these firemen burn books rather than put out fires. The world has become a dystopian society that favors pleasure over reality. We almost have a 'stepford-society' of sorts. Critical thinking is said to create sadness and conflict so something must be done about it. The books must be burned.In Fahrenheit 451 Montag has an epiphany after talking with his light-hearted neighbor Clarisse. Clarisse represents the very thing this society is trying to rid. Guy Montags wife represents the opposite. You can already see the conflict here, so what is Guy to do?I'll admit the first 40 pages or so really had me going. The story was unique and the message was interesting. I did notice right away that Bradbury likes to be overly-poetic in some parts, and a straight-shooter in others. His writing is a little inconsistent but I was able to look past that. At first I really hated Montags wife (a good thing, when books conjure up these types of feelings then they are doing their job) and I really felt empathetic towards Guy. The problem is that this book really started becoming silly. The characters really become forced and the plot as a whole takes an eye-rolling turn for the worst. The ending is one of the most forced endings I've ever read. This book could have been written a million different ways and Bradbury chose a really silly path. I had to force myself to finish the book and I started to lose my feelings towards the main characters, I just started to not care anymore. It's almost as if Bradbury had a good idea for a short-story one day and forced it into a novel.In the end I would give this book a 2.5/5. There are some interesting ideas and some of the writing is pretty good, though it is inconsistent. Unfortunately I can't give half-stars so it's either a 2 or a 3. Tough choice but ultimately this book was more on the disappointing end of the spectrum for me."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"You've heard about the title, so you know this is a book in which books are burned. That is, indeed the most symbolic aspect of the novel. But the novel's richness comes not so much from the scenes and fact of book burnings, as the daily life of mind-numbing television and prescription drugs. As our narrator notes, \\"the firemen are rarely necessary.\\" Most people simply lost themselves in \\"wall televisions,\\" joy rides, advertising, shopping, and--above all--infotainment. This dystopian society is not unlike our own: people often prefer to have others do their thinking, machines do their walking, corporations to make their meals, pundits (\\"televisors\\") to do their political thinking, TVs to do their childcare, and televangelists to do their religion.This America offers a Bible-free, guilt-free, effort-free Christianity. It offers hedonism, sports, and the lowest common denominator. Who wants books in a society committed to individual ease?Books then, are not a magic bullet: this future America has been so dumbed down and has become so lazy that a mere book won't change a thing: no more than a recording of Mozart. What has been lost is a way of life--an integrated, critical, self-examining, strenuous life. This whole has been chopped up and swept away by a society obsessed with products and leisure.The narration is often overly blunt or even exaggerated. It's as if Bradbury doesn't trust that we'll get it: so he lays it on, thick and plain. This is not a subtle book. It's not great literature, but it is an important work of fiction. It is particularly a good book for the young reader.For all of these reasons, I think that Fahrenheit 451 should be canonized for high school. It's short, simple, direct, and relevant. And its well worth reading for anyone who lives in a society more obsessed with consumerism than the pleasure of a campfire, the look of a daisy, or the pleasure of a book as good as this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was well on my way to dropping out of high school due to sheer boredom when my English II teacher assigned this book. It read like it was written just months before, illustrating the sinkholes modern society had been slowly hollowing out in the 20th (and now 21st) Century. Always pertient and on topic, it's the kind of story that never looses its edge and becomes more true every time you read it. Sometimes we're Mildred, sometime's we're Guy, sometime's we're Clarisse. Always, 451 assures that humanity will make it somehow. All we've got to do is follow the tracks."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of those books that will never show its age. Ray Bradbury wrote it in 1953 but it feels contemporary even today and its warnings are as applicable (if not more applicable) to today's society as society in the 50's. Like George Orwell's 1984, it comments on humanity by imagining its hypothetical future; a dysfunctional society conditioning itself into thinking that everything is OK when it really is not. Unlike George Orwell's 1984, however, Fahrenheit 451 is a fairly easy read, and can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. This is definitely a good thing, though, because many casual readers would be turned off by Orwell's long philosophical passages questioning what defines reality. Fahrenheit 451 stands among 1984, Brave New World, and The Handmaid's Tale because of its significance, but because of its less technical and easier-to-read format appeals to a wider audience than any of these other books--giving it a distinct advantage for casual readers who still wonder where mankind might be headed.As far as plot goes, the book follows its main character, Guy Montag, through a short period of time in his life. Montag is a fireman in the unspecified future--but it's far enough in the future that the meaning of the word \\"fireman\\" has changed. In Montag's world, instead of putting fires out, firemen start fires. In this future, reading books is illegal for purposes of mass censorship and anyone caught with books has their fireproof house burned clean of their contraband libraries. Montag lives a happy life with a happy wife and enjoys his job until one day a young girl named Clarisse teaches him to ask questions--something the government does not want its citizens to do. Ultimately, this causes him to \\"wake up\\" and see everything that is wrong with his life.He is not in love with his wife (in fact, he can not even remember where he met her), his job is to ruin other people's lives, and he doesn't even know what happiness really means. Happiness to the masses is mindlessness; staring at wall-sized television screens in-between work and sleep. Obviously this pacification is no substitute for true happiness, and when Montag becomes aware of this and the fact that everyone else in the nation thinks they are happy as unthinking sheep, he feels the need to change it. He decides to read some books to find out how, effectively becoming a criminal.The main reason this is a great book is because its implications are very important to our society. However, it is also just a well-written book. It doesn't get stuck at any part of the story with too much of Montag's thoughts and not enough action, but it doesn't leave out the thought-provoking parts, either; it's a careful balance that keeps you interested enough to want to keep reading and intrigued enough to want to think. The book also has great character development, as most of its main characters go through drastic changes over the course of the story. When Montag first talks to Clarisse it is obvious though the dialogue and narration that she really annoys him. Slowly, though, as he talks to her more, his opinion changes, and eventually, even though he is offended by her, he has taken a liking to her.Still, what keeps this book important is what it means. In modern society many of Bradbury's predictions have come true--TV screens get bigger and clearer as people walk around with iPod earbuds blaring, ignoring one another completely. Reading may not be illegal, but the entertainment industry has a pretty strong grip on a huge portion of the population through television, discouraging reading by encouraging watching. The main thing Bradbury is promoting here is thought--the downfall of man in the book is ultimately attributed to losing interest in thinking. Which is why Clarisse has such a profound impact on Montag while doing something as simple as making him think.And who knows? If you watch a lot of reality TV, this book may do to you what Clarisse did to Montag. That's right--turn you into a fugitive. Oh, and it might make you think, too. Hopefully it will do that instead of making you a fugitive. Fahrenheit 451 is a very interesting, enjoyable, and important book for modern-day readers to read. Even if you read it, end up disliking it, and find yourself wanting to set it on fire, at least that would somehow be ironically appropriate. Because Fahrenheit 451 is a very quick and easy read, you have nothing to lose by reading it, and if what it predicts is true, you may have everything to lose by not reading it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"With great prescience, Ray Bradbury wrote Fahrenheit 451 over fifty years ago. Today, this story is no longer prescient but instead insightful of the situation of the West as it stands. Pluralism which was celebrated in the past has become a prison against plurality, destroying freedom of speech because of political correctness. Materialism (both practical and philosophical) has driven us in two different directions: (1) Absolute obsession with making money at all costs. (2) Absolute obsession with not working at all costs. These two factors appear in different quantities in the population, creating workaholics who destroy their lives (both by means of work and the escape from it) as well as those who merely play games with the world.Bradbury foresaw the rise of these forces in his day and astutely analyzed them to their ultimate end. This perfect storm of ideals has brought us to the edge of a cultural collapse, a collapse which is highlighted in Fahrenheit 451 and enacted in its fully decadence in the plot of the story. For Bradbury, materialism ultimately ends with the destruction of work ethic and the true pursuit of knowledge (and hence the Truth). Life becomes a game, without serious ramifications, for life without the Truth is nothing more than a masquerade. Bradbury's tale teaches, however, that all masquerades end, all masks fall off, when the Truth blankly stares us in the eye, making us realize the piteous state to which our closed minds have led us. This end is, for Bradbury, only possible when carried out to the full collapse, a collapse which is quickly coming to the entirety of Western Civilization.I highly recommend this book for its analysis as well as its very engrossing style. In a day when true knowledge is not looked for over the din of iPods, Fahrenheit 451 stands as a stern wakeup call to a culture in the throes of death."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Compared to many books that I have read Fahrenheit 451 was enlightening, imaginative and illustrative. Today, people now are glued to the television and they seem to take no interest in being active. Although Bradbury's novel seemed out of the ordinary, it is somewhat close to the society that we are in today.In Ray Bradbury's novel Guy Montag has been a fireman for 10 years and never questioned anything in his life until he met this young woman named Clarisse Mclellan. Clarisse was an eccentric young girl, she was happy, thoughtful, and questioned many things around her. The people around her were busy watching TV on walls, listening to seashells, and driving dangerously fast. When she met Montag, she knew he was different. He looked at her when she talked, he followed things that she said and was intrigued by her personality. Clarisse touched Montag's life in many ways, which triggered him to realize that life wasn't just about burning books, it is about discovery and thinking. Shortly, after Clarisse's death Montag became confused and began to seek for an old friend named Professor Faber. When he saw Montag again, he was afraid he had come to burn his books instead Montag had come to Faber for answers. After speaking with Faber, Montag had realized what a fool he had been and knew that something needed to be done.Ray Bradbury's novel is very close to unveiling the truth of what our society might become if there is no longer a use for intelligence, individuality, and knowledge. Television networks come up with reality TV shows, competitive shows, comedies, and mysteries to keep viewers interested in what the electric box has to offer. With people attached to the television all day the information that is offered out there will become obsolete."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Upon first thinking of the book burning concept, I thought to myself, \\"That's unrealistic. It would never get that far.\\" After reading Fahrenheit 451, however, I've come to realize that the creep towards censorship is insidious, and the American society is closer than I had previously realized. With the several groups, races, sects, and organizations complaining and protesting over every word that offends their fragile egos, with political correctness rewriting books and documentation even as I write this review, Bradbury was much closer to predicting the future than even he had probably imagined.Guy Montag is a fire fighter in the new world, a world where firemen start fires rather than douse the blazes. He travels from house to house, totally incinerating any location that dares possess and read books that do not fit the very limited list that has become acceptable. Regardless of families, livelihoods, or other considerations, if the occupant owns books, the house will be set ablaze. Montag's job, however, has started to make him consider the consequences and reasons his job exists.Montag meets a teenage girl named Clarisse in his neighborhood with an odd aura about her. She causes him to think deeply, to consider that which he had previously taken for granted. Her entire way of life, her family atmosphere, it all takes him by surprise, and eventually invigorates him with life he hadn't felt in quite some time. The daily monotony of his life, his marriage, and his job had Montag quite melancholy, and the new perspective brought on by the young girl with an odd wisdom becomes the catalyst for life changes.What follows is a brilliantly described story, where the details fly off the pages in colorful and lively metaphors. Bradbury's style allows each reader to clearly and easily see the images of Montag's world, a world in which Montag must now make a decision to continue living his life, or to follow his heart and mind into a new and dangerous journey.In the end it's a story about the dangers of groupthink and the loss of freedom. It's a prophetic warning, showing how seemingly minor forms of censorship could eventually lead to a society without the basic freedoms of individual thought, self-expression, or self-growth.I can't recommend this book highly enough, and it should be required reading for every school across the nation."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is perhaps the most thought provoking book I have ever read. Unfortunately, I missed this book in my earlier days of public education, but I have found a real treasure now. This book is very topical in the policitically-correct world in which we live. I find it hard to believe that so many of the fears that are expressed in Beatty's speech to Montag regarding why books or ideas were burned have come to fruition. In fact, the most stirring part of this edition is the coda where Bradbury's ideas about censorship are expressed in first-person. A must read for any would-be scholar."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In this day and age, with the internet, and TV, the printed word is becoming endangered. Ray Bradbury takes this to the next level in his masterpice in which books are illegal, and original thinking is considered odd. This book showes what can happen to our society if we let go of the written word."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Este libro de Bradbury tiene un fondo impresionate con una historia original, fresca y aterradora pero a la vez una naracion tan detallada y bien hecha que uno tiene que terminar de leer el libro tan pornto pasa las primeras dos paginas. Es un futuro aterrador el que plantea (imaginese vivir sin Amazon.com ni nada que se le paresca) pero su mente elavora muy bien la historia y no se mete en detalles tecnicos como, que a&ntilde;o es, como se monitorean las personas o comofuncionan los aparatatos. Toma toco cono un futuro ya establecido que no requiere mas explicaci&oacute;n que la indispensable para la historia. Una joya literaria para degustar con una lectura pasuada pero sin pausas."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Striking, scary, almost here. Yes, I think most people who love books, value free thought and expression, and worry about our personal freedoms being taken away one by one (which they are, folks) can identify with this story. Guy Montag wakes up one day to realize that all the material possessions of his life, indeed, his whole way of life is empty and meaningless. In Montag's world, the powers that be want everyone to be lulled into a state of false security. No one is allowed to stir the pot (remind anyone of the recent political conventions where anyone who protested anything was beaten and arrested?). Yes, anyone who can't see the symbolism so blatantly laid out before them is probably on a school board somewhere and wants to ban this book anyway. I read this book when I was about 12 years old, and I understood the implications at that young age. I think I read To Kill a Mokingbird the same year. When I moved to California in 1984, One of the North County School boards had banned To Kill a Mokingbird and it was quite a fight that took place. I re-read this book at that time, and every few years since. It's message is timeless, and if anyone has seen the advertisements for the Flat TVs that you hang on a wall, you may get a bit frightened by Bradbury's vision of the future. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which books burn, by the way. This should be standard reading for everyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book is not a standard SF and it is not meant to be. The idea is VERY plausible. Written 50 years ago, the idea of TV being a national obsession was ludicrous. Who knew? The white clown is very similar to the extremely violent shows that we let be on TV. And the books. . .the censorship. This is what will happen if we let censorship go any farther. And the scene where the women are discussing their children, absolutly scary. Good book. Read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is almost uncanny that Bradbury depicted this as the exaggerated furture for books. Certainly this is not an action packed blood bath but it is excting. He shows all to well how books full of literary beauty will be removed from view in public schools, libraries, etc. If you want to read a classic book this is just what you are looking for. It is set in the future where media dominates the earth and reading is believed to be a rash on society. As you read through and discover how well he depicted what is happening you will be vastly impressed how right he is. This is a must read book for those who want a good read and for literary knowedge. Despite all this, the reason I didn't give it five stars is because I do like action and this lacks some of what it could have."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was very good. It was about censorship of the future that the government has to keep people happy. People aren't allowed to read books it was forbidden to the law. Can you imagine the world without a book? The people will think the same things, and they won't have any things to talk about because even jokes come from books. When I was reading it I thought, 'The government is wrong they should let people read books. If some people aren't happy because they can't read books, then the government is making them unhappy.' I like the books very much and if it is our future I probably can't live the one moment of it. This book was hard to understand at the first time, so I read it again and enjoyed very much.

Thank you.)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This one of a kind novel by Ray Bradbury is an interesting story with many twists and turns from its almost boring beginnings to its dramatic and action-packed closing. As a soft science-fiction novel Mr. Bradbury made a powerful statement about what he thought the world was coming to with its ever evolving societies. Already some somewhat small groups of people are forbidding the reading of certain types of literature. In my personal opinion, I think that every person on the face of this Earth deserves to have a chance to read, Even if this book that a person decided to read went against all the morals that the society currently values."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you like to read about the future, this is a great book to read!

I enjoyed very much!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Story of Guy Montag, a \\"fireman\\" in a repressive society, who repents his job of burning books and joins an underground society committed to memorizing the great works of literature. Bradbury's excessively florid, overwrought prose bothered me greatly. The futuristic society of book-burners never really seemed fully realized or plausible. Dealt with some questions of book burning and censorship intelligently, but still seemed a bit nave. Bradbury struggles with long-form fiction. Never felt the execution rose to the level of thematic ambition."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A future in which books are burnt, teenagers are violent, and free thinking has been destroyed. The few free thinkers that are left are killed, and yet, one man saves a book and reads it, making him a wanted criminal. Guy Montag, the hero, is this man, the rebel, the fireman whose job it is to burn books. This is a classic about censorship, that is now more important than before. Be sure to read this one, along with Orwell's 1984, and you'll get a clear view on what the future can be. And remember, at 451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature at which books burn."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"it is more like poetry than normal novel;first time would be hard to get through (my friends told me that)but it's worth of that!!!!and more you read more you like it;it'll get better every time you read it, maybe you'll find more views too...you'd have this in your own &quot;homelibrary&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I recently read Bradbury's work &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; for a book report in a class. I am a junior in high school and quite frankly hate to read. It's very difficult for me to get interested in a book. This book, however, caught my attention. Maybe I just like books about the future. It's an entertaining novel discussing the struggle between Conformity and Individuality. Montag acts just as his society intends him to until he meets some very important people that show him a more interesting and exciting life filled with knowledge. Of course, his brainwashed wife, Millie, continues to acts as one of the androids that society has made her to be. This is a very important work about censorship and the dull lives that it would inflict on us if we lost our freedom of speech, our freedom of the press, and even the freedom to the written word."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm a sophomore in high school, and I just finished reading F451. I may be slightly bias, since I love to read, particularly Sci-fi (Star Trek rules!), but this book was really good. I know many read this book in their junior high years, but I think it's better if it's read a little later, when it can be &quot;digested&quot; more thoroughly by a more mature audience. So many people, regardless of high school levels, hate to read, and I sincerely believe that is one of the most dangerous things in today's society. Schools do not stress music, art, and literature nearly as much as they should. We learn to THINK--we gain WISDOM from what we READ, not from playing sports and playing games on computers. Even many colleges give out more sports scholarships than academic scholarships. Western Civilization had better watch out, or Ray Bradbury's sci-fi book will become REALITY..."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent book. Bradbury portrays the future in a very interesting way. The firemen burndown buildings, instead of saving them. Bradbury portrayed what he thought the future would be like. He portrays a world where people who think for themselves and question are outcasts and fugitives. Fehrenheit 451 is a very interesting story, but it can be confusing at times, making the reader reread paragraphs to understand what is going on. Bradbury doesn't use complicated words, so the reader won't need a dictionary by their side. I like the lenghth of this book. It is only about 150 pages long. The story also moves at a very fast pace. The plot is set right from the beginning. I feel that the story is developed well until the end. The climax comes and the end is right after that. There are not many characters to get bogged down with either. I liked this because the whole book centered around one person, not many people showing many stories. Over all, Fehrenheit 451 is very well written and exciting. I would recomend this to anyone interested in sci-fi and fantasy books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I enjoyed the book very much and would definitly recomend it to others. It is very fast paced and the action starts right from the begining of the book. The plot is very interesting because of the similarities between Ray's world and ours.

With the attempted eradication of books, people of this futuristic society are left empty, afraid, and become enveloped in materialistic and trivial exploits.

With the use of his imagery, you see his world in a different perspective.

The concept of this story originates from the time of WWII in which Hitler's Regime was burning libraries across Europe in an attempt to prevent the distribution of knowledge and other negative ideas that could affect his rise to power. This book is an exciting tale about a world in which firemen no longer extinguish fires, but instead start them. The firemen in this world burn all books and the houses in which they are contained.We feel that this story, despite its dark tone, is a well-written modern day classic that makes the reader better respect books and not take them for granted. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wishes to read a thought-provoking story that provides insight into our future. An interesting aspect of this novel is how well it connects with our world today. Our society is becoming more and more reliant on technology and is becoming less interested in education, which sadly enough, is the same story in Fahrenheit 451. Could this be a reality for our world in the near future?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is wonderful. I won't bore you with the plot details, as you must've read them quite a few times by now. It is fairly easy to read, and its dark atmosphere makes it oh-so-great. If you're a fan of George Orwell, you should love this."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"451 and other apocalyptic books such as 1984, and Alas Babylon were my required reading in tenth grade, and I found that these have been my favorites. Bradbury is one of my favorite authors, I've read all of his works. I see that others may not have liked this book, but I suggest that you try it. Bradbury typically bases his books around the unwinding of human civilization, the villian is the technology we have created. In 451, he revisits the theme, and does a fantastic job. I love this book, and if you like try his others. If you've read and loved 1984, you will love the excitement of Fahrenheit 451. In short, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book hearing that it was &quot;pretty good.&quot; What I was expecting was a traditional science fiction novel of good vs. bad and a weird plot. But Fahrenheit 451 was so REAL, it left me in tears. On the surface, it's entertaining, and a person with little patience will definitely find it boring but this story carries an important concept: Is censorship REALLY ok? I know very well that this book was written nearly 50 years ago, and describes a dark vision of the future. But this so-called &quot;vision&quot; is terrifyingly similiar to our own society and its present situation. Are we truly headed for the same fate described in the end of this literary masterpiece?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury creates a world of extreme censorship that is our future, where firemen burn books and houses in which they are hidden. I first read this book in 8th grade (not because I had to, but because I WANTED to), and it had a profound effect on my life. Guy Montag is an anticonformist at heart caught in a world where conformity is the only path to survival. I respect those who gave it 1 or 2 stars, though, because if you are forced to read any book in school that you don't want to, you are going to be inclined to dislike it. But, if you read it once, try it again. You will see the underlying tale about society in general. A very depressing, but very moving book, I recommened it for all, young ones for the plot about anti censorship, and older people for the underlying plots."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Learning to appreciate everything around us is difficult, in today's society.

It is apparent in our realm that this fable has already begun to happen. Change is something not always noticed. However, this book opened my eye's to to the world around me. I am certain, that &quot;Guy Montag&quot; the charachter, is in all of us. Just waiting to be discovered."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Not only is this novel great, but it is important. I just finished it and I can not stress enough how impressive this book is. It was absolutely amazing from start to finish. I have never known how to express my love for books until I saw the words Bradbury put into print here. It has elements of science fiction but I think it essentially for all people to read. It also is not a long book if you are concerned about that. Personally I wished it would go on for another hundred pages. This book should be required for all high school students to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Hello People,I thought that Fahrenheit 451 was a good book. I wouldn't say that it was the best book in the world but it was definetly a good book and you should read it. It isn't your average book that you're used to, it's a little diffrent. Bradbury writes really well and you can follow the story, but sometimes he would just say something and you would have no clue what he's talking about. So then you have to go back and read a couple pages just to figure out whats going on. But above all I would say that it is a good book and even though it's a little diffrent, it's good to give diffrent things a try. :)Peace-out and enjoy the book!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In this book Ray Bradbury, one of my favorite authors, did not become Nostradamus. His story did not account for the internet. Therefore, many of the political ideas simply won't appeal to the internet generation, where information is only a fingertip away.On the other hand there are valid points regarding the \\"opiates\\" of life. Unfortunately, when you are young you look at it and say \\"look at what they are doing to us\\", which is what our protagonist does. As you become wiser you begin to see that the statement is really \\"look at what we have done to ourselves\\", which is what he finally discovers when he joins the band of scholars.This is an all time classic, but the reverse is happening in our society. There is too much information and no filters/censorship. So we need to be more alert for misinformation and propaganda, than we have ever needed to before.Own the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was a quality book. At the beginning of the book it was kind of boring but when it got close to the climax I couldn't put it down. It kept me on the edge of my seat. The story goes something like this. Guy Montage was a fireman and so was his dad, and his dad and so on. One day he met a 17 year old girl and talked to her about everything and that is when he started questioning himself and what he did. He burnt books for a living. Books that told our past and what we have learned. If we burn our past we will kept making the same mistakes we've already made. One day he took a book from the house they were burning down. Once he read it he felt that all the books should be saved and he revealed that he had about 20 books hide in the cieling. The government made it illegal to read and own books. Montage wanted to let the world know what was in the books and share the knowlege they possesed. He was going to get help from an old man who's books they have already burnt. His name was Faber. One day at the fire house they got a call in that a house had books in it. When they got there it was Montag's house and his wife was leaving him. They made him burn all his own books and possesions. When he was done he went and burned his boss and other work members with the fire torch. The fire department had a machanical dog that chased him. The dog had a neddle in its mouth and bit him in the leg but not enough that he couldn't get away and burn the dog as well. He ran around back and got his books that he had hide in the garden and ran to Fabers house. There he got some clothes and watched the pursuit on tv. They got a new dog and started tracking him down. He told Faber to burn everything he touched and spray down the side walk to get rid of his sent. He headed for the river and then jumped in and threw off the tracking team and the dog. They ended up putting the crime on some innocent guy that was just walking down the street. Montage got onto the bank and walked into the woods where he met some other outlaws like him- self. I realy liked the book toward the end and I thought that it was probably one of the best books I've ever read. The tension is unbearable and the catch phrases are great. If any body likes a good book that won't bore you this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In perhaps the bleakest outlook of what the future would be like, Ray Bradbury tells the world how the thinks the future will be. This is a very bleak book, with wars all to common, firemen burn books, not put out fires, and the world is in a horrible state of turmoil. There are no teachers in schools, children go to schools for days at a time, and parents don't care at all, and an accquaintence to the main charachter had her father arrested for being a pedestrian. Guy Montag (main charachter), a fireman for awhile, realizes something all to true when Clarrise, the accquaintance, asks him a simple question: &quot;Are you happy?&quot; Montag looks at the question as a joke, but soon realized the bleak truth that he is not happy at all, and his wife, Mildred, obviously doesn't even like him at all. After a woman decides to burn with her books with Montag watching, even lighting the match herself, Montag thinks that books must have something true to offer Through all the experiences he has in these events, he begins to read, which in this book is a punishable offense. The books truly do open his life up to newer situations and great works, until one day his boss finds out Montag's secret.In great sense of irony, Ray Bradbury actually made some true predictions, even the microwave oven. Most of this book, however, is inaccurate with the future. Too bad, because other countries sadly do hate us. Wars, however, are far less common than this book has predicted. Other than that, this book is just too real, and recommended to both teenagers and adults."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. Bradbury's prose is direct but beautiful, full of sylistic twists that enhance the reading experience greatly. The story moves quickly, and the brisk pacing is expertly handled, never leaving the reader minutely bored. At under 200 pages, the length is perfect for the story, yet delivers its haunting message about censorship, superficiality, and the dumbing down of America with force without ever becoming preachy. Truly a magnificent accomplishment and should be required reading for everyone!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was a disappointing book for a reader who is not an avid science fiction lover. This book is very difficult to read. The correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand. The setting is also very hard to have a visual picture. Although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand. I think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book. But if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this. I also think you need to be above the 6th grade or a very advanced reader."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is about a time so far ahead in history that humans have decided that books are evil. and they are banned. people live very superficial lives. the book, as i remember, i read it like years ago, follows this one guy who starts to think that maybe all this anti-book is wrong. he finds a group of people that had all the classics memorized, each book one person. i was amazed to see how the author had chosen to protect the written world, he brought it back to spoken stories. this book was great. it really brings you to a time where everything u believe in is thought to be wrong. strange thought huh? :) i enjoyed this book a lot. happy reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I don't give very many things five stars.Bradbury's novel is simple, powerful, beautiful, and truly marvelous.A negative utopia along the lines of Brave New World or 1984, I like this book more than either of those because it is ultimately, utterly hopeful. Bradbury is in love with a messed up world and his message comes across with an urgency and honesty that is both startling and impressive.You know the plot -- they burn books because they're scared of ideas. Montag wonders about the ideas and becomes an outcast in a sterile society. This book makes me want to change the world. And so I want you to read it. And then maybe memorize it.A quick read, and a fairly easy read. Engrossing enough that you won't want to put it down, and once you finish it, you might be tempted to just start over and read it again. I recommend doing just that."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was very interesting.I read it in 11th grade English. We had many disscusions and look deep in to the concepts of the book. It had our class debating on topics that were'nt even mentioned in the book, but brought the ideas to our minds.This book makes me wonder about what our future will look like with all the advanced technology thats coming about. Will we soon become the victims of a world like this book describes.....? The people in this book become almost like a slave to technology instead of technology becoming a slave to them.Is that happening to us now, always wanting fast entertainment, not applying our Knowledge to problems or circumstances in our lives,or maybe not even taking the time out to sit down and read something. Makes you think and thats what Brandbury does throughout this book. So if you like to take the time out to read a book,think about what you've read and apply that knowledge to intances throughout your life then you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was standing in my local bookstore, which as usual didn't have what I was looking for, browsing the School Reading List shelves for a book I could get extra credit in English I for. I scanned over this book several times before I remembered a friend telling me that it was one of her favorite books. I also remembered a friend telling me not to waste my time. I decided to buy it to see what my opinion was. I was pretty sure I wouldn't like it because I am normally a fantasy reader and don't usually go for this kind of book. But when I got home with it I picked it up and it stayed permanently attached to my hand until I finished it. I was finished in two days (about two hours total reading time). I won't say I recommend this book for everybody. If you don't like to think, if you prefer to view everything as having a distinct happy ending, if you hate symbolism, if you are an extreme pacifist, or if you only read books that have absolutely no profanity in them, this is DEFINITELY not the book for you. Anyone else should read this book at least once. And I mean the whole book. Don't give up on the first ten pages.

I am an ordinary high school freshman."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury is a very smart man. Reading this book alone is not good enough to experience it's full greatness. This was one of the few books i enjoyed analyzing, because when you analyze Bradbury you catch on to a lot of little easter eggs that you would never catch while your just reading it through for fun. This book will definantly make you look twice at the people around you and how they think. If you're interested in psychology i think you would enjoy this book. I read it in a bout a week and the diction is some of the best i've ever read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fire is one of the kindest, cruelest, most beautiful, grotesque forces that nature has mothered into this world. It has the ability to take down and to cleanse at the same time and to allow for new things to grow or start over. The fire that burns inside Montag, the protagonist of Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is the burning desire to know the value that books truly have in the world and why society is so against them.The darkness of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is evident because of its modern texture and present day technology (such as the T.V.) and the stranglehold that it has on even today's society. You'd be hard pressed to find a home without a television and even more hard-pressed to find a home that truly values books above all else. Ray Bradbury's futuristic society is full of self-inflicted censorship and ignorance, which is a little discomforting because it is so modern. One is tempted to ask, \\"Why would a society bring about its own ignorance and censorship regulations?\\" The answer is simple: people fear those who are intellectually superior to them and also envy the brains that they were blessed with. Compare this phenomena to a competitive sport: when you compete you do the best you can and you think that you are doing a really good job then, out of nowhere, some one else comes out who does a far better job than you did not because he worked harder then you but because he was just more talented. Further more, in a fast moving society who really has time for books anymore when its so much easier to sit in front of the boob tube and receive a much more stimulating experience without the need to really think?\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a bundle of motifs and symbols. One of these motifs is the recurring quotes referring to nature. \\"The sun burnt every day. It burnt Time . . . Time was busy burning the years and the people anyway, without any help from him. So if he burnt things with the firemen and the sun burnt Time, that meant that everything burnt!\\" This quote is said when Montag realizes that he must never burn again. He realizes that the sun burns because it has to and seeing as it won't stop burning, he and the fireman must never burn again.Ray Bradbury was very against censoring in any form whether it was censoring out words in books or songs, or the news keeping people from knowing what is really going on in the world. The result of his views are cultivated in this book and overall \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was a fluid, well designed book that utters to us the warnings of the unforeseen effects of censorship: when we bring about our own constrained views upon a part of culture that has been around for such a long time, we will have a society that will begin to eat itself away and we will be forced to start all over again, and have nothing to work with but scraps of a lost world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I love this book.

Having read it now, I can see what the benefit of reading it school would have been. Books read in school are discussed and examined in detail. This book would lend itself well to that type of in depth analysis.I am glad that I at least read this book, although I found it only okay. I think in a school setting I would have enjoyed it much more. I just didn't find it as captivating or emotional as other books I've read.I have the 50th anniversary edition, which contains an interview with Ray Bradbury about the 50th anniversary, and how he feels about the success of the book.

It is far too melodramatic, and the protagonist Guy Montag uninteresting and merely a plot device. The writing is harried and convoluted, and the plot both unbelievable and shoddy. In many ways, it's a pale imitation of George Orwell's much darker and sinister \\"1984.\\" But it's a prophetic and haunting book that has predicted all too well the decline of a mass capitalistic society into a hedonistic lifestyle obsessed with instantaneous gratification.Even today, it's a compelling and frightening read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am a seventh grade student, and when my teacher passed out this book, I figured it to be dull and confusing. Oh, how I was wrong. Ever since the first opening sentence, &#34;It was a pleasure to burn&#34; I have been hooked. Like the saying goes, &#34;Don\`t judge a book by it\`s cover. The plot has me wondering, trying to predict the ending, but I know I can never know the ending until I read it myself. The description is full of vivid detail, and you always know what the characters are feeling. I love stories that aren\`t always so happy and pure, but, I don\`t want a story that\`s so depressing that you cry and get emotional over every paragraph. So, this book is balanced out on both sides. It can become somber and maybe even make you shed a tear, but it can also be heroic, knowing that the main character, Montag , is doing what he believes is right. Even if it means breaking the law.I am writing my own books, and I will be using this book as an inspiration to further my career.

Our Hero, who sneaked some books and has been secretly reading them, shows us just why the faceless Authority burns all books at Fahrenheit 451. The future has a strong emphasis on interactive television (hey, it covers the four living room walls), and literacy seems to be at the bottom of the heap. Dossiers are kept on all individuals who show an intellectual spark. Such individuals are swatted out of existence, though there seems to be no shortage of those willing to covertly buck the Authority. Plenty of backstabbing neighbors lead to the climax of the novel.With the emphasis today on television and computer skills, and less emphasis on the basic reading skills (just look at reading scores), one can imagine our future, just 4 generations from now, subtly turning into the extremist future world of Fahrenheit 451.

A story that you will never forget"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury is my favorite sci fi author. The book is full of poetic imagery, and thoughtful commentary of the direction he saw society heading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is important because the readers need to know what happens when the government seizes upon cultural rot to take control of all information in a society. That Montag has no understanding of what is happening around him, but that he becomes curious is the catalyst for the events that happen.Even his own wife and loved ones turn on him, when the government decided to withhold its television based nightmare. Socially, I think this novel is one that all people can grasp today. What would happen today if the NFL or Baseball or College Football were interrupted? That is why presidents, and not just Obama, use those things as stages for their political events.Why is the government so intent on perpetuating things like political correctness in our society? That is because if you control the information, you control the people. If there are only a few actually curious people, then the government can marginalize them and destroy them. A whole society of curious people is not what the power brokers want. They don't want to answer questions, and they sure don't want people to insist on personal freedom as a point of personal identity.Fahrenheit 451 deals with all these. From the mysterious death of Clarisse McKenzie, to Montag's ironic job. And the punishment in the hyper-managed society is reserved for those who want to seek out knowledge. The metaphor put forward by Faber is also salient to our current time, by the time we meet him we find that the class of intellectuals will be bullied out of existence. Our constitutional republic cannot be saved by looking to the educated professors to save us, as they are all cowards. It is the people, the populace at large who needs to be educated. And remember, the country will keep itself ignorant because that is what the government class wants. They know, you don't need to. \\"Trust Us.\\" is what they will say. It should make us recoil. The most dangerous words in the world: \\"I'm from the government and I'm here to help.\\" They never do. And the people still sit by and let them destroy our nation.We need to teach this novel to all children. They need to know that their freedom depends not on the guarantee by the government but on their own initiative and their complete skepticism every time a government agent tells them they will take care of it. That includes teachers and school administrators. How far down the road to being Mildreds are we? I'd say farther than anyone would like to think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I bought this book after Ray Bradbury died because the obituaries said that this was his best work. I did not know what to expect.The book is about a future in which [almost] everyone live vicariously through the lives of others delivered via technology. The system prohibits independent thinking or feeling and actually used the fire department to burn up anyone that is a 'problem'.As I see more people (myself included) using their cell phones, social media, and on-line entertainment, I see our society moving in this direction. It is amazing to me that Bradbury created this dystopian vision many years in advance of the current technology that almost makes it possible today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a must-read in the sci-fi genre.

Story is a little odd and wordy, but it is an excellently crafted piece that will go down in history as a classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book many years ago and enjoyed it then and having re read it was suprised that it was better than I remembered."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"To say that Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is about a society that burns book is putting it a bit simplistically. It's not simply the fact that books are burned that's dangerous, it's what's destroyed with the books. The people in Bradbury's dystopian world have been effectively trained to enjoy simple, mindless stimuli, such as television walls that feature characters who are your 'family' and your 'friends.' The rationale is that books are sources of a vast amount of ideas, many of them in conflict with one another, and this clash of ideas makes people unhappy. Burning books is one of many ways to reduce sorrow and confusion in the world, though more to the point it's a way to control people through blissful ignorance.Bradbury's concerns are still pertinent to society today, and in fact maybe even more pertinent. We are a culture obsessed with entertainment. We love TV shows, and some of them are incredibly mindless, though I don't think Bradbury would condemn all TV shows. Some certainly are thought-provoking. Advertisements permeate our culture in just about anything, from what we wear to the places we go, and they can be quite effective in making us feel hungry for a cheeseburger. Many of us have such busy lives that we hardly have time for friends and relatives, much less time to think. Our hectic, stressful lifestyles have certainly taken their toll. Suicides have become increasingly common. They are a way of saying that something needs to change.Fahrenheit 451 is a thought-provoking read. Some of the dialogue and the technology seems archaic today, but that adds to the charm. The mechanical Hound, with a syringe for injecting morphine into its victims, is particularly strange, but oh so devious. As archaic as some of his dialogue and his technology might seem to us now, the novel feels surprisingly contemporary, like it was written today and not 70 years ago. And that's what's frightening."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really wish this book had been written for a higher reading level. I loved the idea, but I felt like it was cut short. I felt like I really missed out on the entire picture, or like this a portion of a more elaborate novel. I loved it, but was definitely left wanting more. It would have been perfect if it were longer and had a little more detail!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am fascinated by the idea of this book. There is always debate in our society about the freedom of speech and I don't think that the prohibition of books is that different; especially since there are many occurrences each year of people demanding that certain books be banned from schools/libraries etc.I think that even though he's a complete jerk, Beatty is a genius; an evil genius of sorts. He moderates the book burning firefighters and strives to make sure that no one who is found with books goes unpunished.I'm not sure if Montag is a hero or a kind of anti-hero. He was a fire fighter but his curiosity about books is inspiring. I wonder about Beatty's true self. I am unsure about his knowledge of books; he could be using his knowledge as a two-faced approach to catching the rule breakers. But part of me wonders whether or not he's actually a closet intellectual who is torn by his passion and his civic duty.I love Beatty's insistence that the first fire fighter was Benjamin Franklin. It's the evil genius side of him that I kind of admire. (I mentioned this in a discussion of the book with the club mates). What made Franklin such a great diplomat was that he not only knew how to listen, but knew how to subtly sway people to his lines of thinking, but could also sway them to do has he wished in financial matters which is no small accomplishment. Those traits mirror Beatty, though Beatty is perhaps a bit more sinister.I love that the message of the book is a little open-ended, at least in my opinion. What I take away from the book is that prohibition or censorship may seem like it puts everyone on the same plane it also has the ability to cause a fair to significant amount of dissention. Bradbury leaves the question as to whether or not that is a fair compromise up to the reader."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Could we end up like this in our future? What would the world be like without books?? This story gives us some insight into what it might be like... and it's pretty scary. It is definitely food for thought regarding censorship.The book paints a dim and scary picture of a future society where all books have been banned. Firemen no longer fight fires, the set them to destroy houses found to have books. With the removal of books, people have turned their attentions to TV and as a result the general population is unable to think for themselves and their minds have turned to mush. The main character begins to challenge these concepts of censorship after meeting a young teen-ager who stirs his curiousity. The more he thinks about and challenges the 'norms' of society his world is turned upside down.This book really makes you think about censorship and where it can lead. The book is very relevant to the debate going on about censoring today's music (as well as books, tv and movies). You can't put limits on creativity and self expression without limiting the society as a whole."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The amazing thing about this book, is that it was written so long ago, yet it predicted many technological things that have happened recently. What makes it ironic is, is that the plot is basically about book burning, and banning and the absurdity of it all. YET it is a banned book itself. Could it have predicted this? Maybe. But, basically, this book has a great story and plot, on whatever level you read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Amazingly, I just read this book for the first time, although I've heard about it for years. While reading, I found myself constantly rechecking the copyright page to verify that Ray Bradbury did indeed write this book in 1953, almost 50 years ago. Back then he somehow knew what was coming; so much of what he writes in the book is actually happening to us today. We want things faster and faster, and fewer and fewer people are reading. I often talk with my students about reading; many say they just don't have the time, while others would rather see the movie. Bradbury even predicted the increase in violence in our schools.While reading the book, I shared the story with my ten-year-old. He was intrigued with the story of Guy Montag, the renegade fireman. So intrigued that he is going to have his literature circle at school read the book. I think this book should be required reading for everyone. There is so much we can learn from it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 wan an enjoyable read. It started out a little slow, but came to a tension filled climax. The tension of the ending was well worth the slow reading in the beginning. In the beginning we get to find out the life of the main character (Montag). We are given an understanding of what his every day goings on in the future are. We are told what his job entails and how important it is for the society that he lives in. The middle and end of this book is when the story gets good. We learn how unneccessary books are and why they are seen as evil. We see Montag go from anti-books to pro-books with the help of a freind (Faber). We watch as Montag comes up with a plan to try to make books a part of society again. Fahrenheit 451 is the degree at which paper burns. This is a good title because the whole story is about how books are as illegal or even more illegal as present day drugs. Books are to be incenerated. They are worthless in the future. All in all Fahrenheit 451 is a good science fiction book. Once the reader gets past the slow beginning, they are in for an enjoyable treat. The reader will be swept away into a future where reading is considered useless because nothing will be gained except confusion. This is not true about this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As I looked up this book after reading it, I saw it had an average rating of only four stars. What was wrong with it?

Read it and ignore the two star reviewers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel is a great way to explore what might happen in the near future if the public decides to allow technology do everything for them. It shows the power of popular thought, and also shows its distructiveness. I would not say this novel is science fiction, even though it has some qualities of that. I would call this book a classic, and wonderful. Bradbury really grabs the reader with the way he discribes everything. It is almost like reading a collection of poems that are in sequence. I highly recommend this wonderful master piece."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book blew me away, but to appreciate it, you must understand how technology has affected us and how we already act. Plus, you must understand, that this book was written in the 50s where they thought we would be even further in the future.In the time of Guy Montag, no book-readers were free. they were behind bars, or running from the law; and he was one of the people who put them there.this book is so moving and compelling i could only grasp the rhythm of Bradbury and his magnificent language that lets you know the fear and hatred of Montag.Before you start, you need to know that this book will be weird and confusing. You must appreciate philosophy and know how strange this world is."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches.&quot; -Ray Bradbury (Coda, Fahrenheit 451)This book is outstanding! It is a book for people who love books. It is a testament to the power of books and the importance of the knowledge they hold.It reminded me a lot of 1984 and Brave New World. If you liked either of these two novels, you will like Fahrenheit 451. Guy Montag, the fireman turned fugitive, is a lot like Winston Smith in Orwell's 1984 because he is forced to hide from an organization that wishes to destroy him. He is also like John Savage in Huxley's Brave New World because they both come to see the importance of literature, art, and beauty in the world. All three men are trapped in societies that are all about a quick fix, the easy way out.Fahrenheit 451 offers everything: action, drama, suspense, inner struggle, inspiration, faith. There's isn't really any romance, but the connection between Montag and his young neighbor Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the world around him, is one of the best I've read.Bradbury makes it clear that this novel is anti-science science fiction. Technology is not important in the great scheme of things. Human interaction, knowledge, beauty, these are what life is all about."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was really good!

The relationship between our world and the book's has teriffying similarities, that you tend to think twice about our lives today. Make sure you read this book!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's view on the future is startling. He has made many correct predictions on how the future would develop. He helps to remind us that books and knowledge are what we crave and need to be happy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the book Fahrenheit 451 the main character is a fireman named Guy Montag. Guy is a fireman that burns books and sets houses on fire instead of the normal fireman that puts out the flames. During the course of the book Montag goes through many different phases. The most important phase is where he starts wondering about books. Since all his life he has been taught that books are bad and only to burn them, he is curious what books are about. During the time that he is going through his mysterious phases he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens her eyes to the emptiness of his life. Montag met this girl one night when he was taking a walk at about midnight. Montag also meets a very important character named Faber. Faber is an old English professor that likes books and knows a lot about them. Over the story Montag has Faber set him up with a retired publisher, to help publish books. At the time that Montag is trying to publish books the fireman are chasing him.Guy Montag is a fireman who suddenly realizes the emptiness of his life and starts to search for meaning in the books he is supposed to be burning. He quickly forms unusually strong bonds with anyone who seems to have true friendship with him. His biggest regret in life is not having a better relationship with his wife. And because he didn't have a very good relationship with his wife that is why she turned him in to the fireman and got there house burned.The way that Ray Bradbury makes this book seem is incredible. He has a special talent that lets him really involve and capture the reader's attention. while I read this book I felt as if I was a silent observer that stood next to Guy Montag every where he went. I loved this book, and would definitely recommend this book to anybody who loves a great adventure and thrill."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":".... this is definitively one of the most philisophically and emotionally charged short novels I have ever read. Bradbury's paints a perfect picture of a future in which we are consumed by mass media. Yet more now than ever it rings true with our consuming obsession with TV and Internet (not that I'm a luddite, but I am constantly torn between the path we're careening off of, and exciting future ahead of us), which is probably one of the most terrifying aspects of the book. The only thing I could possibly think about complaining about is Bradbury's writing style; it's not confusing, but it definitely keeps you on your toes, and can be very unforgiving if you're full attention isn't devoted to it; nonetheless I found myself re-reading some parts, not to better comprehend it but rather to simply admire the deep and insightful observations and allegories Bradbury has created. My father and my step-dad both read this when they were in high school, and I get the impression it's either hit-or-miss, because they are split on whether it was confusing and boring, or if it was absolutely brilliant. I know I dissed Ray's writing style, and it is very spartan and may not suit some, but I also found it had a poetic flowing quality to it (not Dante or anything, but it is still very beautiful). My view is htat it is unquestionably a great work of philosophy, a far cut above most Grishams or novel you pick up ...; so put down that copy of Republic for a moment, and take a little time to read this masterpiece of a novella."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought this book was ok.

He is just going through the motions, as he is a puppet. One day a girl named Clarisse opens his eyes and lifts the dark cover from is head and shows him that he is not really happy even though he appears to be as content as can be. He is also not living his own life as an individual but is living like the government wants him to.Fahrenheit 451 takes place sometime in the future in England. After Montag's eyes are opened he decides to do something about it. He sees how corrupt the government is and how it controls the people. Montag's given job, given to him by the government, is to burn books. He thought that that is how life has always been with firefighters burning books instead of putting out fires.All this time is a quest for Montag to find out how to be happy and to make life better for himself and everyone else. I think that the novel was an excellent reading experience. The words spoken really made you think about life now and how the book applies to yourself. \\"Ten minutes after death a man's a speck of black dust.\\" This is an example of the how deep the novel is.I recommend this novel to people who are over 14 years of age. Anybody who is younger might not be able to grasp the meaning of the deeper points and may not appreciate the novel as a whole. Also I recommend this book to people who like to read about the future and \\"what if\\" type of books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Ray Bradbury's novel Fahrenheit 451, Guy Montag, the main character is a fireman that instead of putting out fires, he starts them because reading and owning books is against the law. The book is set in the future, but we don't know when. We learn that Montag has a stash of books that he has been stealing from houses he had burned that are hidden in his air-conditioning vent. Beatty, his fire chief, tells him he has one day to decide if books are any good then bring the book to work to be burned. Montag had met a retired English professor named Faber at a park a year ago. He reads poetry to Mildred and two of her friends; they get scared and go home. Montag goes to work and hands over one of his books, then the alarm sounds, when they get to the house they realize that it is Montag's house. His wife and her friends had called in the report. Beatty forces him to burn down his own house then places him under arrest, then he turns the flame-thrower on Beatty and knocks down the other firemen. The Mechanical Hound that Beatty had set against Montag injects some anesthetic into his leg. He walks off the numbness and goes to Faber's house. Faber gives Montag some of his clothes and tells him to run out of the city. He follows an abandoned railroad until he finds a group of \\"Book People\\" that have memorized the great works of literature and philosophy.In my opinion, Fahrenheit 451 is hard to understand and enjoy if you don't like futuristic fiction. The plot seemed like it happened too quickly and it doesn't seem realistic. This would probably never happen because people enjoy books too much. The characters don't seem disturbed about the fact that books aren't part of their lives. All they do is sit in their \\"parlors\\" watching TV on huge screens. This book is made more for people that are interested in futuristic novels and censorship. The characters are only used to not having books as a part of their lives, the government controled everything that was printed until society decided that they didn't want books anymore, as to not offend anyone. The people of this society don't think freely or spend time by themselves."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The story of &#65533;Fahrenheit 451&#65533; is a story about censorship in the future. The character of Guy Montag is a firefighter, but his job is to set the fire rather than put it out. The firefighters aren&#65533;t burning the building down, they&#65533;re burning what is inside, books. The government in this time has ruled that a certain list of books must be destroyed. People don&#65533;t think too much in this era, and books make you think, therefore giving people a problem. They all just want to be happy, watching television and listening to the radio. Nobody really cares about anything but their own happiness, so the children are left on their own and sometimes kill each other. There has also been a nuclear war happening for quit some time. One day Montag meets his next-door neighbor, a young girl named Clarisse. She was an exception to the rest of society. She always talked about nature and how beautiful things were. Stuff that Montag (and everyone else) had never even stopped to think about for a second. Claresse&#65533;s thoughts, and the way she talked about things, made her an outcast from this futuristic nightmare. She was considered antisocial because she talked too much. Her radical thoughts greatly opened Montag&#65533;s mind. When he would go to a house to burn the books, he&#65533;d take a book or two and hide them in his house. Montag&#65533;s wife, Mildred, was just like everyone else. She didn&#65533;t talk or think very much. She would just watch T.V. or overdose on sleeping pills. So when she found out about the books she called the fire department to burn them. Montag was astonished to pull up to his own house and have to burn his stolen books. Luckily he hid them in his yard earlier. The fire captain, Beatty, instructed him to burn the house, and Montag did willingly because he had nothing to loose. After he burned the house, he set Beatty on fire, and then he skipped town. He followed the train tracks into the countryside where he met a group of ex-college professors. They all felt the same way about books. Each one of them had a book that they memorized and were one day going to write them down again. Their mission was to put things back the way they used to be decades ago.I can relate to Montag and the ex-college professors because they kept doing something even though it was a crime. They were standing up for what they believed in and were willing to die for their cause. It&#65533;s self-realization, knowing what you believe in and not letting anyone tell you different. If people didn&#65533;t stand up for what they believe, than we probably wouldn&#65533;t have cars or even electricity. New ideas and free thinkers are what made our lives so easy today.I liked this book because it is so much like our society today. The way that people drive fast, the way people use drugs, and people are lazy and hardly go outside anymore. Also the way the government controls and limits our freedoms. They tell us how we can and can&#65533;t express ourselves. New ideas are becoming scary to the average person, and we can&#65533;t do anything without offending someone. It&#65533;s really freaky how much it compares to today considering this book was made in the 50&#65533;s.I think people should read this book if they want to open their eyes a little bit. I think what happened in &#65533;Fahrenheit 451&#65533; is happening to our world, and it is kind of scary because it is all too possible. But it won&#65533;t happen if people get involved in their politics and tell the government what they want, rather than letting congress do what they think is necessary to make the people happy. So think a little more, and we won&#65533;t be horribly destroyed by a vicious nuclear weapon."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 takes place in the near future where firefighters no longer put out fires they start them. Guy Montag is a married though uterly alone firefighter who is set to the task of seeking out readers of books, which are illegal to have in your possession, and destroying them.Fahrenheit 451 is my pick for the distopian novel that most acurately predicts the future.

A must read for anyone.

I read Fahrenheit 451 for class, and I enjoyed it, though it's somewhat disturbing. In a futuristic world, firemen don't put out fires, the set fires, and burn books. Guy Montag is a fireman, who has always been satisfied with his job, until he meets Clarisse, a seventeen year old who changes how he thinks about everything...Ray Bradbury has a very distinctive writing style, which I noticed in Dandelion Wine, which I read a while ago. I would say Fahrenheit 451 is a much better book; the writing is better and the subject matter more interesting. The society depicted in the book is really scary. Mildred, Montag's wife, is always watching her three-wall television (she wants a four wall). It's interactive too, so she can take part in the shows. She's almost always watching it or listening to her Seashell (earphones).Clarisse and Faber are both really interesting characters. I think I would probably get along with Clarisse. Now, books being really important to me, I found this book super disturbing, and not altogether unrealistic. Though written in the 50's, it bears a certain resemblance to the increasing consumerism of today. Bradbury builds suspense and dread with his foreshadowing (for example, the Hound not liking Montag).I've been planning to read The Martian Chronicles for a while now, and Fahrenheit 451 motivated me to do so. I would highly recommend this excellent Ray Bradbury novel. Update: Not going to read The Martian Chronicles. I don't like scary science fiction. That scene where the Martians pretend to be the astronauts' relatives and kill them is really creepy.[...]"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to buy the book right away, My son need for school. it was late at night. so just click it from amazon it is great to have that power"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Short book, wondering why the author didn't make it longer, and i wish this book had a little more action."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was not assigned to read it in school, so I wanted to know why it was such big choice of school districts.

I read it in my AP english class at school. His dealing with censorship was absolutley amazing. Most of the futuristic things in this story have become true since the 1950's when Bradbury wrote this book.

You've got to read it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I first read this book after my mother, a senior english teacher, was getting ready to have her students read Farenheit 451. I immediately fell in love with the book. In the almost 10 years since I fist read the book, I have read it over and over again. While in college, I wrote a paper for a Lit class showing the how Bradbury's science fiction is slowly becoming science fact (i.e. seashells= walkman. Its scary to see how a book written in 1953, as a work of fiction, is becoming reality. If you want to know what I mean, then read &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; and see for yourself. It is a definite eye opener that sends chills thorugh my body everytime I read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The sheer poetry of Ray Bradbury's words in F451 is absolutely amazing. Not only that, but he also gives a chilling look into a very possible future, were books are burned. And it shows how insignifigant and stupid people become without books.

In the years since that, I have grown to love this book and become swept up in the character quirks and bleak yet wonderful portrayl of the future. One point that is eluded to in the book and seems to be a prophecy that could very well come true is that of the society's need for friends(see Montag's wife's urgency around her &quot;friends&quot;) but the reality being that it is shallow company. For them, real entertainment is provided by the television, and friendship is a hollow term for the company that we so desperately desire. This is part of what makes Clarisse such a compelling charecter; she has rejected this notion of friendship for family and conversation. She sees that the hollow pleasures enjoyed by so many are just an excuse to keep the mind idle. Clarisse was a visionary, a free thinker, but most of all an enjoyer of books, a love she paid for with her life. This is only one aspect of the book that makes it such a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A very scary book. Reading in these times ought to scare anyone into throwing away their TV. It's truly amazing how smack dab on Bradbury was, and how poorly we listened to him. The only minus to the book is in not examining the side of the mindless public too indepth. Reality can be very scary, that's why we all sometimes hide from it. His vision of what it's like when we all take that extended leap into the world of virtual reality (TV, internet, movies etc...) ought to be more frightening than reality itself. I just hope we're not all too far gone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I think this book is one of the most important books written this century because it teaches the reader a lesson: take away anything (not just books) that enriches peoples minds, and they become, well, stupid. Talking to people all day like Montag's wife did not help her to any degree; it only made her less intelligent (scary thought, as she already had little to lose). Also, to those who say this book doesn't make sense: it is a SATIRE! It is not inteneded to be 100% logical, plausible, or whatever.

He has written the future's worst and gratest moments. Guy Montag has enjoyed being a fireman for mostly all of his life.

He also has burned up the houses that held the books inside, but this is until he meets a seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan. She tells him about a past when fireman had actually had stopped fires. The next thing Montag hears from a professor is of a future in which people are able to have their own differences and be able to think of themselves. This novel was fascinating.

This entire book is in that surrealistic style, beautiful to some and maddening to others. As the years go by, Fahrenheit 451 becomes ever more prophetic. For me, the most haunting theme is that this is not some 1984 style dictatorship. We subjugated ourselves through apathy and fear of anything different. Recent hits such as &#34;Feed&#34; by M.T.

It's one of those that I've always seen on lists of books that everyone should read but I never got around to it.\\"It was a pleasure to burn.\\" Guy Montag is a fireman. But, in this world, fireman don't put out fires - they start them. The government doesn't allow citizens to have books and if it finds that someone has a stockpile, they send the firemen to burn them. Guy meets a seventeen year old girl who inspires him with stories of a world where people actually talk to each other and read for pleasure. When he looks for her a few days later, he finds that she has disappeared. (People who speak out don't last long in this world.) Guy takes a book from a house they are burning and starts to question the government's wisdom. He is, as expected, discovered for his treasonous actions and the government tries to kill him. He escapes and joins other outcasts outside the city. A war then begins and the city is bombed.Meh...I thought this would be a book to love. But, somehow, it was just okay. No, I don't support this kind of government interference in our daily lives. Yes, I love reading and can't imagine a world where reading is not only discouraged but illegal.

This book however i should notice reads in some parts more like a poem then a novel, sacrificing plot and dialogue for poetic beauty.The characters in this book are very deep and realistic leaving a haunting feeling on you, however interestingly he doesn't actualy spend much time actualy describing them, but somehow from the story you can draw so much more than you would from a description, however short or indepth it may be. I suggest this book as a standard reading for all people who wish to understand what the world could (and inevittably is) comming to."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'll spare you the summary (you can read that in many other reviews) and tell you that this story is very easy to read and understand. The main idea of the story is that censorship (especially concerning books) is very dangerous and damaging to society. Whether you know it or not, books (especially the classics) are everywhere. From nursery rhymes to mythological stories, they play an important part in our daily lives. They are referenced in tv shows, movies, and in our vernacular. Think of Shakespeare. How many times do we see the Romeo and Juliet story whether it be in movies or music, etc. Or Homer's Odyssey? Or the Bible? If we were to lose these gems, our lives lose that important element. You don't have to be a reader to not feel the magnitude of losing our greatest stories. What I got out of the book also was Mr. Bradbury seemed to be warning the reader that if society doesn't open their eyes and take notice of important issues, the rug is going to be pulled out from under us. If we keep burying our heads in the sand and hiding behind celebrity rags, video games, and sporting events, we'll lose touch with the world around us and become victims of something bigger. He's not saying that fun can't be had, but if our lives are simply filled with sloth and fluff, we are going to be no better than a lemming. It's our duty to educate ourselves in order to prevent things like censorship or war from happening. A very good read, indeed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have always meant to read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" but had never managed to get around to it. In a world where time is scarce, I neglected this classic work by Ray Bradbury. I regret this situation very much. \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a modern classic that deserves to be read. The individual is poorer for not having done so.If the novel has any message, it is that censorship is a very great danger. In the extreme case, we have the official authorisation of book burning. Books contain evil thoughts and encourage individuals to think for themselves. If books are removed from society then the power to control the individual is that much greater.Although written more than fifty years ago, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" still resonates today. Yes, the evils of the Soviet Union and its satellites are no longer with us and the cold war has been left to the dustbin of history. However, whenever given the chance, governments of all colours just love to seek control through censorship. Even in the west, governments hanker for greater control as a means of stemming the growth of terrorism or whatever else they deem to be a danger to them. As citizens, we should always question any attempt to increase the power of government over what the population can read or watch or listen. We must always be vigilant.Ray Bradbury is a man of great prescience. \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" can legitimately be compared with the master works of George Orwell. This is true praise as Orwell rests in the pantheon of the geniuses and Bradbury deserves his place in the sun just as much."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book for school and, well, you know the routine. I thought, \\"Oh, great, assigned reading, this'll be so boring to read,\\" et cetera. Boy, was I ever wrong.Set in America's not-too-distant future, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" tells the story of Guy Montag, a fireman whose job is to set fire to houses where books are found. He loves his job, and never once doubts his happiness in life - that is, until he meets a seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse. Clarisse tells Montag of a past when the censorship of books was nonexistent - and more importantly, of a past when everyone could truly be a unique individual.Thus begins a riveting (and frighteningly prophetic) tale as Montag finally begins to question things he never questioned before and sets out on a quest to find the truth. Not only will the author leave you contemplating the novel itself, but the unsettling possibility of this kind of censorship actually surfacing in the tomorrow of America."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am a high school teacher, and Fahrenheit 451 is one of my favorite books to teach. First of all, the students enjoy the story, the images, and the writing style. With an opening sentence of \\"It was a pleasure to burn,\\" even students who usually don't like reading \\"eat\\" up this novel. With Bradbury's eerie insight into today's society (the book was written in the 1950's) and the topics of censorship, the value of books, etc, I never run out of things to discuss with the students.The novel makes people think, question today's society, remember great pieces of literature, and explore controversial topics. Despite instances of mild language, the images of the book stick with the reader; the mechanical hound, the hearth and the salamander, the venom spitting python hose are just some of those fantastic images that permeate the book.I highly recommend the novel. It's worth a second read if you haven't picked it up in awhile, and if you've never read it, you are missing one fabulous novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is about a fireman named Guy Montag. In his world, firemen started fires to burn books-as both their job and their own pleasure. He never questions why they burned books or the way society was, until he met a seventeen year old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who, with the help of an old professor helped him examine the past and what they have become in the present. Guy began to question society, and figure out what he had to do to change it.When I originally began reading this book, I found it confusing and a little hard to follow because of its futuristic setting and characters. However, as I got farther into the book, it was easier to understand the story line and the plot. Even as he wrote it in 1953, Ray Bradbury makes outstanding points in his book about the messages that society and the media sends to us today. No matter how convincing they may be, it is the truth that matters. This book opened my eyes to many questions about the way we live today, and how we can change the bad one step and a time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is over 50 years old now. Somehow, it just keeps becoming more and more accurate a look at American society. Yes, Bradbury nailed the American apathy and isolationism of his complacent 1950s world. That's still there. He also scores a bullseye on the eternal button earplug, always there to drown the real world with its soothing, private murmur. His video walls look increasingly familiar, as home theater becomes more common and as the 60\\" screens give way to 80\\" and 100\\". And, of course, the book-bannings. We have those in plenty, based on every ism in the catalog. Sexism, satanism, racism, to name a few, along with the anti-evolution nuts. Bradbury also foretold the decay of personal relationships, giving examples that sound bitterly like today's front pages.He got one wrong, though. Bradbury seemed to hope that nuclear war on US soil would cauterize the social wounds. We've seen a bit too vividly what a house of cards we live in, how sensitive the power, health, communication, and even emergency infrastructure are, how tiny outages cascade into national-level failures. The nuclear fallout would be bad enough, and Bradbury seemed to hold the \`50s idea of a winnable nuclear war. I just don't think he appreciated the enormity of the general collapse that would follow even one major city falling - but he didn't have our examples to learn from.Half a hundred years later, this book is painfully pertinent. And, in the blackest of ironies, Bradbury's warning against censorship and bowdlerism has itself been subject to censorship and bowdlerism. Read it to find out why. If you've read it, read it again.Who knows, your memory may be the one that keeps this book alive.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"...Very few people see the obvious in this masterful work by Mr. Bradbury...It's not only a political commentary against anti-intellectualism ( President Bush...are you paying attention?!)...But this work is also a clever love story...There are enough admirers of Bradbury's work reading here that may have noted the old triangle Bradbury throws out about middle aged Guy Montague's married wanderlust with a much younger, teenaged girl...The old master doesn't carry this down the regular Valentine road though...He couches Montague's fondness and interest in the fetching young Clarisse around the subject and \\"love\\" of books...It is easy to see the sexual connection Bradbury draws via vivid descriptions on the smell and feel of books...Indeed, Bradbury makes the choice the characters in this most novel of novels must make between the constrained fidelity of 457's society of anti-intellectual constraints versus the uninhibited option of free love in not only one's thinking but in the individual's life and love as a decision a person must make with every bit of fervor and \\"love\\" that they have...Mr. Bradbury makes his choice for the latter in a most convincing, romantic, and egalitarian manner...His spectacular if somewhat cliche ending lets the reader know in no uncertain terms that Bradbury wishes the reader to make and promote the books point of being for knowledge or against it as the crucible of what to take away from this splendid tale...Enough so, that one may indeed wonder what beautiful depths and dimensions Bradbury might have added to this work by giving the character Clarisse more of a voice and part in the book...Certainly, the further fleshing out of the romantic attraction between Montague and Clarisse this reviewer doesn't believe would have detracted from the work, far from it, perhaps it would have added a dimension to the story that seems waiting to be told...Reading any of Bradbury's gorgeous work...\\"The Illustrated Man\\", \\"The Martian Chronicles\\", \\"Dandelion Wine\\", or any of his many short story compilations are absolute rapture for the true bibliophile...Sitting down with Bradbury is like being able to dream while you read...Both are things we don't have enough of in today's \\"Bush-whacked\\" culture...Pick up this one today and send a message to the Nascar set!..."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I WAS SITTING ON MY COUCH ONE SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND I HAD NOTHING TO DO SO I PICKED UP THIS BOOK, FAHRENHEIT 451, BY RAY BRADBURY.

Never before had I read a book about the banning of books and using &quot;firemen&quot; to get rid of them. At times there were some lulls and some confusing parts, but overall Bradbury's unique style is what made the book worthwhile for me to read. I believe that Montag was at times a flat character that could use a little spice, but his growth throughout the novel seemed to counteract the deterioration within his own surrounding society. To think that one day our own society could be like Montag's; burning books and stifling creativity; is absolutely frightening to me and this book does not try to supress that notion. It actually amplifies it, but it can be used as a reference for our future generations so they would never reach that low point that Montag's society reached."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 is a wonderful book, though slow at times. I was intrigued by the idea of a future where thinking is looked down upon and mindless activity is promoted. Guy Montag is also a hero that I could sympathize with. For a interesting read, this book is an obvious choice."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury warned us of a culture that had no more ambitions then to watch TV. Much has come true. I mean how many people think &quot;Titanic&quot; actually qualifies as entertainment. He described a society were simplistic plots dominated. He also described a presidential race won because of one canidates charisma not because of wether or not his plans would work. Most of all Grandmaster Bradbury gives us hope. I sincerely believe that TV and movies will become obsolete to holograms and VR. Holograms and VR will become obsolete to somatic input devices. Nevertheless books will always be read. Why? I'm sixteen and proof that love of literature hasn't been completely lost on my generation. These are a few of the reasons this is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I don't know nothing about tha"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the best books I have ever read. This book potrays a society, which may look too fake to be true, however, when we realise in what society we live in, we understand that it is not too far away.

On his way home Guy Montag meets his neighbor Clarisse McClellan. A long time ago firemen put out fires instead of starting them. Could people be arrested for being a pedestrian? Guy finds his wife Mildred in bed, an empty bottle of sleeping tablets on the floor. He called the Emergency Hospital. They get many of these cases. [The pay of Guy dates this book.] The firehouse has a Mechanical Hound. Clarisse describes schooling, they can't ask questions but are only given answers. People race cars on the edge of town. Some children shoot others. [Gang warfare?] The History of Firemen has been rewritten. Guy talks to Mildred.Mildred lives vicariously through the television programs. [Like soap operas or reality TV shows?] Captain Beatty explains that book reading makes some smarter, so they are burned to create an equal world. Sports are encouraged since they don't lead to thinking. [But are all players equal?] They keep people happy with trivial things (like game shows?) Houses don't have front porches, they don't want people to sit and talk, or even think. \\"Fun is everything.\\" Guy has saved dozens of books, a criminal offense. People can't travel around or revisit the past, but they can read a book. Flying jets make noise. The station house bell summons the firemen. Guy recognizes the house! Its windowpanes are shattered to aid the fire. Guy is chosen to fire the house. Who turned in the alarm? Will Beatty be fired up? The Mechanical Hound gets blasted too. Guy Montag is now a wanted man. \\"Watch for the running man!\\"The war is on, and Guy is running like the hunted man he is. Can his trail be killed by lawn sprinklers? The Police ask people to turn away from their TV screens to look out at the real world. Guy escaped into the river and floated downstream. The TV news shows another faked event, the death of Guy Montag. After walking, Guy finds a home with the outcasts of society, the book lovers who have each memorized a book. Their Book Culture is to preserve books in memory, like in the Dark Ages. The war begins, bombs fall to destroy the far-away city. Can they begin civilization again?The \`Afterword' tells how he wrote this book on rented typewriters in a University Library. This story was changed to the 1966 film. \\"Coda\\" tells about publishing for high school readers. There are many groups that want to censor books. His publisher censored sections of this book. Bradbury says those who do not like his stories should write their own. [But its always easier to criticize than to create.] This book was written in the early 1950s when reaction was censoring books in libraries, and the spread of TV led to less book reading. Military jets would often streak across the sky to create sonic booms. Popular culture also avoided radio, which allows people to work or do things, unlike a TV or book. TV became an agent of mass psychology to influence people's thinking and buying (like the jingle in this book). Is TV watching a necessity like food, drink, and sleep for most people? Can you go for a week without watching TV? Even though much of it is of little value? The idea of a catastrophic war was a common theme in the 1950s. Burning books was popularized in 1930s Germany, so too an emphasis on sports. They didn't want people to think too much."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A highly prophetic story about the voluntary dumbing down of society that in today's day-and-age hardly passes as fiction (it's not really about government censorship, as some seem to believe). This is a must-read with a great (and alarmingly urgent) message. The only annoyance for me was the writing style, which I felt was a bit on the tacky side, but the core message here is too important and otherwise well-stated to let that influence my rating. Everyone should read this at least once, and hopefully we'll all learn something from it before it's too late; though the thought seems somewhat optimistic at this point."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 has been on my lengthy 'to read' list for quite a while. My book club selected it this month and I'm glad I finally took the time to dive into the book.What I found most chilling about the book was not the book burning although the idea makes me shudder, but the picture of a society that's lost all respect and sense of reality. Montag's wife with her television 'family' distressed me as the seeds exist in so many ways in our society. Likewise the premise that letting minority voices rule eventually leads to all voices needing to be the same provokes thought.My only complaint would be the suddenness of the book's conclusion. I was following Montag with great excitement, but wanted more answers than I had by the end of the book.I'd also recommend reading the afterward. Great perspective from Bradbury and some ironic moments."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is one of my absolute favorite dystopian novels of all time. The book is exceptionally well written, is very fast paced and is filled it political and social commentary. The book follows the life of a fireman... in this dystopia a fireman does not put out fires but instead his job is to start fires in order to burn books and the houses of the people that they are found in, as literature is banned. As the book progresses the main charater starts to question the legitimacy of his job and finally has one experiance that pushes him over the edge. Finally, one action takes him beyond redemption where he is targeted by his own ruthless government. The end of the book is wonderful, and it reminds me of the Book of Eli.I definately recommend this book as it is a great, fast paced, exciting read. Once you start you will not put this book down for a second, and you will be done in 1-2 days. Additionally, this book is one that you will want to pick up and re-read over and over again as you always find something new. It should be noted that this book was considered so inflammatory that it was secretely censored by the published without Bradbury's knowledge. You can not go wrong with this book and you will not be disappointed. This is my favorite classic, and I garuntee you will love this one as much as I did! Go and buy it, this is a great book to add to your collection."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury wrote this futuristic tale of a dysfunctional society where literature is unappreciated and virtually gone from the society. Individuals become sloths in and disregard books as an important part in the development of a society. The protagonist, Guy Montag is a fireman that burns books for a living. A young girl named Clarisse opens his world to new perspectives. Montag experiences a break down that changes his thoughts and feelings about books. From there he seeks the help of professor Faber who assists him in understanding books. After lashing out at his wife, Montag becomes a fugitive and he joins a group of intellectuals called the Book People. This story highlights aspects that are now seen in today's society- books have been translated into electronic forms and more and more people watch television and laze around. To me, the only thing interesting about this story was the plot itself, the style of writing was utterly uninteresting.When I embarked on reading this book, I couldn't get past the first 30 pages; Bradbury's style was boring and could not fully retain the reader's attention. However, it's because of its reputation as one of a kind during his time, that people read it. The characters themselves did not have that much depth to their personality. Montag's wife, Mildred is a small minded individual that cannot grasp the simplest idea of the anything. Bradbury killed off possibly one of the possibly interesting characters, Clarisse. She was like the last hope in adding creativity and depth to the writing. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the idea of the story and the plot line but the way it was expressed was not good. Overall, despite the negative comments I made about the story itself, I would recommend this book to readers out there."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Are you looking for a book that has the perfect mixture of real and make-believe? Written in the 1953, Bradbury wrote this book describing an altered society taken over by the media (sound familiar?), lacking freedom of speech and individuality. Today's world--especially the U.S. is highly consumed in the media and Americans are decreasingly reading books. So how did Bradbury predict this media phenomenon about fifty years ago? That is the genius behind it; he writes this novel with such intricate detail and creativity in regards to technology and societal thought, making it seem as if the happenings of today's and the future's society were happening at the time it was written.The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman-- a fireman that starts fires, that is, in order to burn books. The government of this society has decided that all books should be banned, and burned. In other words, an extreme case of censorship. You can't help but think that this is like the censorship of today of government records or media that attacks the government. Books expose people to new ideas and provokes the mind to think outside its bounds. If people have this exposure then surely they will speak out against the system and create great controversy. If books are taken away along with people's freedom of speech and expression, then everyone will be alike, leaving no space for individuality. This is exactly what happens with the characters, especially Montag's wife who sits and watches meaningless soaps and advertisements all day--they have become like robots. In Montag's quest to find a specific book, he experiences great emotion which he is struggling to express, leaving you (the reader) attached to his struggle.The suspense and vivid descriptions Bradbury creates leaves you on the edge of your seat, anxious to know what will happen next. Maybe the surrealism Bradbury illustrates will turn into (if not already) realism. Bottom line is, it's an all time classic and a must read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's clear why Ray Bradbury didn't care to have his novel compared to Orwell's 1984. Orwell's antagonist, the totalitarian state, was effectively one dimensional. Bradbury's protagonist, by the time the novel opens, is ourselves, infected by omnipresent fear. Early in the story, when Montag meets Clarisse, he finds her to be somehow uninfected. In modern parlance, she hasn't drunk the Cool Aid. \\"I'm anti-social, they say, I don't mix. I don't think it's social,\\" she says, \\"to get a bunch of people together and then not let them talk, do you? We never ask questions, they just run the answers at you, bing, bing, bing, and us sitting there for four more hours of film teacher. It's a lot of funnels and a lot of water poured down the spout and out the bottom and them telling us it's wine, when it's not.\\"Fahrenheit 451 is a very frightening book, and the reader is drawn in immediately. When Montag goes home, he faces the other end of the spectrum from Clarisse; he faces his wife, who has been thoroughly brainwashed into submission. The tension rises dramatically, reaching a climax when Montag is forced to torch his own home. When he turns the torch on his boss, Montag becomes a fugitive and eventually settles with the hobos along the railroad tracks, all of whom has memorized a book in order to preserve it after all the physical copies have been destroyed.At 50 thousand words it's what would today be called a novella, meaning no agent would touch it. And an editor would have problems with some of the more egregious loose ends, including the characters of Clarisse and Faber. But it has struck a chord with an American public which fears the encroachment of the government in our daily lives. And it is always fascinating to compare the futures envisioned by writers of science fiction with the way things ultimately turn out. Bradbury's inclusion of mural-sized TVs and people mesmerized by reality shows displayed remarkable foresight. And that, too, is terrifying."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"After reading \\"The Time Machine\\" by H.G Wells (Great book by the way), I started looking for more Sci Fiction/Dystopian style of books. Fahrenheit 451 is perfect! The author presents us with a world where books and anything \\"upsetting\\" are illegal. Things like creativity and thinking are nonexistent, and life revolves around being entertained, mostly by giant television screens... The main character of the story eventually changes, but I won't say too much more about that. I will say though that is one interesting book to read, especially with all the similarities it has with the current times. I also found it to be a very entertaining and not too difficult read, so I'd say anyone 8th grade and older should give it a try."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was a truly great book. I'm a book reader. I buy and stock and stack books. My house is full of books, all 3 floors, from top to bottom and I cherish my books. This book really brought home to me how important my books are to me and what the world would be like if I couldn't have them and had to hide them. What I really liked is how the main character realized that he could no longer keep people from having their knowlege and turned around to protect the books. The people who would memorize their books and keep the knowledge was also a very cool concept. Great story!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is so relevant to today that it is scary. It has really opened my eyes. This book is a must read and is definitely one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was first introduced to Ray Bradbury when I took up The Martian Chronicles at my community library. I was impressed. Now, several years later, I finally read Fahrenheit 451.The book is divided into three parts, and the first two were absolutely excellent. (The Afterword and Coda were, as well.) The third part of the story, however, lost me. Ray Bradbury decided, partway through the section, to abandon the easily flowing narrative that he had established in the rest of the book. Instead he picked up a very difficult to follow inner dialogue that lost my interest. Which made it even harder to follow for the rest of the book.But, Bradbury deserves a gold star for his insight into how society is working today (which he foresaw several years ago). We are giving up books and stopping thinking. Remember, at first, the government didn't have to burn books... People just stopped reading them.Love it or hate it, this is a book that rings with truth. And, whatever you do, don't burn it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Many other people have already said that they liked the book, but I really have to say, this is one of the most brilliant stories of all time. From the first sentence 'It was a pleasure to burn' to the end, I couldn't put this down. It's almost poetic, you don't get stuck in bogged down writing full of unimportant details. This book is an extremely easy read, yet it is a hundred times more impactful then a 500 page book that takes you weeks to finish. Sure, you'll think about that while you're reading it, but this book will come back to haunt you years down the line.For a story written so long ago, it's frightening that society has done nothing to prove it wrong. This is a classic story about censorship that manages to enforce it's point without sounding at all preachy. It encourages thought. I wish they had made me read this in school, surely this would strike a chord in many people bored by the onslought of bad shakespeare movies. Hopefully this story serves as a cautionary tale to the people of today. Our TV's keep getting bigger, our music more portable, our transportation faster, but it feels like, in our need for speed, we're leaving the important things behind.To conclude, this is a brilliant story, even who people who read but once a year. While it's simple to understand, It's one of the most profound things that you'll ever read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is simply amazing how, for a book written so many years earlier, is actually quite accurate discribing how things are turning this day in age...It does make you wonder...and makes you more aware of your own behaviors."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"That's all there is to it. I enjoyed the story somewhat, but it was nothing to die over: there are better dystopian novels to come out of the Cold War years. But what made me love this novel (notice the 5 stars) was the poetic, eccentric narrative. Some pages depart from prose, and actually become poetry, and then revert back again.Due to the short length, this book can be done in a few hours, which is ideal for any casual reader. I would advise anyone to find the time to read through this book, just to enjoy Bradbury's prose, which has made a fan out of me."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a utopian novel much like Huxley's Brave New World, Orwell's 1984, or Rand's Anthem. It is a startling depiction of a life where books are taboo, and reading is illegal. Instead, the people are dumbed down with constant noise and emotion devoid of purposeful thought. This novel is enthralling. It is vivid and potent because the telltale signs of demise are familar in our everyday lives: the importance that people are placing in TV (i.e. entertainment), the growing violence in children, the dumbing down of literature, and the impersonal relationships between family members. Bradbury has reminded me how much I love literature and impressed me to guard the gift of the written word."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"For grade levels 11th and up, Fahrenheit 451 is sure to please readers of all intrests.

In the well-known novel Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury. The story takes place in the near future at a town were the fire fighters don't put out the fires they start them. The fire fighters have five rules that they need to stick to 1) answer the alarm quickly 2) start the fire swiftly 3) burn every thing 4) report back to fire house immediately 5) stand alert for other alarms. So when the fire fighters hear the siren it means that someone in town has been caught with a book in their house. It is the fire fighters job to race down to the house and light it on fire whether the person living there is in or out of the house. Guy Montag, one of the fire fighters that takes pleasure in burning books is confronted one day by one of his new neighbors Clarisse McClellan a seventeen year old, she meets up with Guy a few times, but in their short time period's together Guy's world is thrown upside down. Clarisse questions him and tackles him about his job. She asks him what's the point and why does he do it. What's so wrong with book? His reply is that books are illegal. After all of the questions Guy became curious and takes books away from the burning pile. Little by little he starts wondering what was wrong with books, so he asked a professor to teach him.Ray Bradbury born in Waukegan, Illinois, on August 22, 1920. Ray wrote Fahrenheit 451 when he was 22 and has won many awards for his writing such as the O. Henry Memorial Award, the Benjamin Franklin Award (1954), and the Aviation-Space Writer's Association Award for Best Space Article in an American Magazine (1967), the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America. His work was also included in the Best American Short Stories collections for 1946, 1948 and 1952.He has won all of these awards because he writes with a breathtaking style. This book has a fabulous plot that makes you think about what might happen in the future years if people keep watching more and more television and reading fewer and fewer books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I loved reading Fahrenheit 451, it was very enjoyable. I can see why it is considered a classic by many people. Also, it deals with issues that are more vibrant in our country today than when the book was originally published. The scary thing is, the society in the book has many striking similarities to our own today, especially now that Bush is in office again. Anyway, I reccomend this wonderful book to everyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury has a vision for the future; firemen don't put out fires-they start them in order to burn books. Inthis society trivial information is good and knowledge and ideas are bad. Guy Montag is a book burning fireman undergoing a crisis of faith. People around him and his job cause this crisis. His wife spends all day watching her TV and being sucked into the fake reality of the world. She wants a room full of T.V.'s so she can just be connected to society. His next door neighbor Clarisse, is the one who I think starts Montag's thinking about society and what kind of knowledge and ideas are in books. Clarisse is more interested in what she can see in the world around her than in the mindless T.V. This book is a good representation of our society today. The TV and music are affecting our lives a lot more than reading books. These days we are constantly being bombarded by flashes of images and sounds. This is a good book for those who think outside the box and want to look at a different perspective of information these days and what we are really affected by."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451I like the thought that the world could be a completely different place if we did not have books. Before I read this book, I always used to think that it would be cool and a lot better if books did not exist in the world. However, I realized that without books nobody would have their own views on certain subjects, and everyone would be dull like Montag's wife. This fantasy no longer appeals to me, because I hate talking to people like Mildred. Everyone would live in their virtual world and the television would tell them what to think. I like the fact that Montag is forced to think about what he is doing, and he steals books because he has a desire to learn. I feel that I would have done the same thing in his situation, and I feel that I am a lot like him because I like to go with the flow but I don't agree with everything, and I question what I feel is wrong. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who feels the world would be a better place without books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 was one of the best books that I have ever read. I am one of those people who don't read often and don't enjoy books, so having said that is amazing enough for me. What astounds me is that this book was written in the 1950's and the author was able to make some predictions about the future. Now we may not be quite where this book takes place time wise, but some of the technology that is mentioned in this book is not too distant in our future. This book really caught my attention because some of the ideas were ones that I too have thought about. The main reason they burned the books was because they didn't like anything that was fiction, or were unsure it was true. They saw that there was no point in discussing such matters of scientific or religious nature if they could not be proved, but that's just my theory. If you end up reading this book, than you might come up with your own. I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to have an open mind."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have really enjoyed reading the book Fahrenheit 451. The book takes place in a society which is completely different than ours, at some point in the future. In this society it is illegal to have books of any kind, and the story depicts the man whose job it is to go around and burn these books. The fireman, Guy Montag, begins to go against his job, and sneaks books so that he can read them. I am not usually a fan of many books, so I thought that a world without books would be a great place to live. After reading this Ray Bradbury novel my view has changed. Because there are no books in this society there is no way for the people to express themselves, and everyone ends up being almost exactly the same. This type of uniformity was the direct result of not having books for people to read and allow them to write to express their feelings. This story has taught me that books are an important forum for expression, and when a book can keep me interested and reading throughout, and send an important message, that is a quality book in my mind. That is why Fahrenheit 451 got a four star rating from me."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A nice easy read for someone who may be interested in a futuristic fun read.

If these two facts weren't enough to make me pick a book to do a project on, I don't know what else would make me. Fortunately, my interest in this book would later become much deeper than simple laziness.What started off as a series of stories in a science fiction magazine would become a novel set in the future world. Books have been banned, and there was a strong force to enforce this policy. Guy Montag, the main character of this story, was one of the many who set ablaze to homes containing books. Montag was happy in a world where the role of the fire department had been reversed from years ago. That is, until he meets a young lady named Clarisse. After a couple of pleasureful conversations and her sudden disappearance, Montag's subconscious dislike of the society he lives in is unlocked. He realizes the shallowness of society starting with his own wife who thinks of her family as three television screens in the parlor. He is also particulary bothered by a woman who was willing to burn with her house after being caught with books. It is all now clear that this society and its censorship has gone terribly wrong.What Bradbury wants to bring our attention to is not that books have been banned, but that restricted society didn't happen in a matter or 24 hours. One word banned over the airwaves leads to another, leads to another leads to another. Pretty soon, free speech and thought aren't even tangible. Though this is a ficticious society, it is realisitic that this type of thing has happened in past civilizations and is still being tried in other areas of the world.At first a slow read became a blazing pace through words of predicition and fear of what could theoretically happen to a society in this world. The fact this could happen will stay with me for a long time. The book makes me want to keep my mind open to everything that i can. I think that's a pretty good thing to come out with after a short 2 hour read. And finally, if I had never heard of the book, I wouldn't know that i really could use the cardboard dish used to cook instant brownies in."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Of all the Distopia oriented books I have read this is my favorite. It's also the one that I think had the most probibility of actually happening. Not necessarily book-burning, but the whole complex of censoring things to make everyone happy. That sort of stuff is happening more and more everyday.Nothing else to say besides it's frightening and brilliant."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I enjoyed this book to an extent. I disliked a lot of things about it also. This book is about a futuristic time where censorship has been taking too far. The idea that as we keep censoring different things to please different minorities we sometimes lose a lot that is good I found very appealing. It seems as if society today does seem to censor too much and is it fixed on appealing to everyone.In this book we find what would happen if we did try to appeal to everyone and not offend anyone. It shows the future without books as being filled with people that have no personalities. People pretty much become drones, each person exactly like the last. The main character, Guy Montag's wife is a perfect example of this. She has no life outside of watching television, which is how most people spend their time in this story. Montag is a fireman who in this day burns books rather than put out fires. He later meets characters who intrigue him and get him to start stealing some books to read and find out what they are about. He soon finds the problems with his society that he is a part of and understands the importance of books.Although this book did have some great points to the negative side of censorship I couldn't really enjoy how unrealistic it was. I just couldn't get over the fact that all people had banned books completely. It was just an unrealistic future in my eyes and I couldn't get over it. Overall, I would recommend this book to all readers even with my dissatisfaction of it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"For Guy Montag burning the books is a way of life. Never once did he give a second thought to the fact that there was a time, and could again be a time when firemen prevented fires instead of starting them, and book were meant, and allowed to be read, not burned.My favorite aspect of Fahrenheit 451 was how real it was. Although it is a fictional, futuristic novel, the sense that the senerio could happen is chilling to a society that prides itself on freedom of speech and equal liberties.I like Bradbury's writing style also. At first I had little faith that this book could keep my interest, but not too far into reading I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. The language kept you hanging onto every word. Not only was it catching, it was easy to understand and read, yet had a sense of maturity to it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Generally my favorite Bradbury illustrator is Ray's compadre Joe Mugnani, but Steadman's crazed, violent visions sharpen the edge on this book and help you see just how frightening Bradbury's dystopia really is.

Guy meets a girl who turns his whole world upside down. She opens the doors to his mind and changes his whole perspective on life. She changes everything he ever knew.I enjoyed this book. I learned that you might not know people or even yourself as well as you thought. I also learned that you don't really know what you have until you have it ripped away from you.Some parts in this book made me want to keep reading because it was so interesting. Other times the reading was harder and it went slower. A lot of the little questions went unanswered; however the big ones were answered and basically laid out for you. It wasn't that hard of a book to understand. It didn't skip around too much. It stayed with Montag until the end."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"One of my all time favorite books. Montag lives in a world where books are burned and firemen actually set fires instead of putting them out. It's hard to imagine what Montag had to go through to make such a change in his life and go against all social norms, to be one of the most revered in society (a fireman) to an outcast. It's also very interesting to see the correlations to today's lifestyle."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a prescient, cautionary tale about the dangers of censorship and the stifling of reason and empathy.Guy Montag, the protagonist, represents the moral conscience of a society gone mad. In the imaginary, hellish society created by Bradbury, Montag has conformed to the prevailing irrational belief that books are for burning--and, by extension, that the fire of intellectual curiosity is something to be extinguished. Yet persistent reminders of a time when people could think for themselves compel him to look for the causes of his own as well as his society's senselessness. A beautiful girl reminds him of the simple power of nature and art. An aging professor extols the virtue of great literature. In the process of Monatag's search, the reader, too, explores the nature of curiosity and the forces that would squash it. For example, we come against the deadening superficiality of television and the unyielding closed-mindedness of the authority figures in total control.Unlike 1984, another dystopian novel pitting man against an irrational society, Bradbury offers a hopeful, uplifting ending, where those who would dare to think are about to escape to start a better world. This injection of cautious optimism is but one of the masterful flourishes Bradbury offers that make his work stand out from others of this genre. This is a magnificent story of the triumph of knowledge over artificiality and pretense."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The unfamiliar circumstances in this story are analogous to the present in several aspects, conveying a relatable character in a strange world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"To be perfectly honest, I really don't understand how this classic is rated below a 4-star by any reader.

We may not literally make books illegal, but socially, they already are. In this tale, Guy Montag is a fireman whose job is to burn books, and the houses that contain them. Then a \\"17 year old and crazy\\" girl puts some questions into his mind. Then he meets an old professor who brings on more questions. These characters make Montag question the society, and as a result, his life gets turned upside down.This book was published way back in 1953, when society was just starting down the road that leads where it is today. Many things foretold in this book have come true in one form or another. Most people have become mentally stagnant. TV and video games have replaced books and creative thinking. I knew very few people in high school who enjoyed reading anything besides web-pages and TV guides. This book is worth reading just to get a kick in the stomach at how closely the book's society mirrors our own.Many people have complained of the confusing writing style the Bradbury uses. I agree that it is a little difficult to follow at first, but you get use to it rather quickly. The only time that I had excessive trouble understanding what was happening, was the last couple of pages. I found the ending to be confusing. But, I just read it again and found some cliff-notes online, and now I understand what happened perfectly. Personally, I like the writing style because it is somewhat confusing. It makes you think for yourself in order to understand what is happening.So, if you are looking for a great book, this is one of the best I have read. I highly recomend Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 to anyone. Please read it so you can understand where our society is headed. Please read this book and aide in avoiding this very probable future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury wrote Fahrenheit 451* over 50 years ago; it's theme of the 'Big Brother' autocratic society, has often had it compared to Orwell's 1984.Before I read this book I knew absolutely nothing of the story or its draconian motif. So finding out the altered definition of 'fireman' that this book refers to was a revelation, to say the least.The story: *SPOILER*This is the tale of Guy Montag, a 'fireman' within this repressed society; a society in which 'happiness' is permitted and even encouraged, but free thinking is frowned upon in the strongest terms. And what is the most obvious example of free thinking...why books of course. Thus we discover that Montag is a 'fireman' and his job is to burn books; burn books, so that no one in the future will every get a sense of history or get any ideas about changing the present regieme into a free thinking society. Montag's problem is that he begins to wonder if what he's doing is right; thus his personal revolt begins, and not surprisingly he finds friends and enemies in unexpected places.I liked the style in which Bradbury developed Montag; Everyone in this society is suppose to be happy, but Montag is increasingly unhappy. He is constantly talking to himself, always doubting himself and his new, 'radical' thoughts. It's not difficult to feel empathy towards Montag as he becomes increasingly uncomfortable with his position and he begins to question his thinking and his own sanity. His wife (and her friends), his job and his desire to read books all contribute in ways to reduce his ability to handle his increasingly difficult situation.Subjectively, I liked the first 2/3s of the book better than the latter; not knowing anything about this tale added to the intrigue and mystery at the beginning, making it hard to put the book down. I didn't find the latter 1/3 quite as 'believable' and that compelling sense of urgency that defined the first part seemed to disappear, and for this I took off 1/2 Star.Conclusion:A great book, much different than I'd expected. Well written, with a wonderfully developed hero; giving us many glimpses of a distressed and complex personality who is in an ongoing battle with his own inner demons, and a waffling conscience that's unsure of it's moral obligations as it fights to maintain his sanity.Interesting to see that some of Bradbury's thoughts of the future are not all that far off in certain parts of the world today; some maybe closer to home that we'd like to believe.* 451 deg.

Oh, not really because of what happens in the book (which is not a bowl of cherries), but because of how close we are to the society he describes. We've pretty much reached the big media/pervasive television/don't read point that he describes as the precursor to his universe. The only thing left is the actual banning of books. Though horrible for us, Bradbury writes a pretty good story around it. The problem I have with the book is that Bradbury jumps the \\"tell-a-story\\" rails quite a bit and ends up on the \\"classic citations\\" and philosophy tracks too often and for too long. It just gets in the way of what he's saying. Of course, my saying that is one of the slippery slopes he describes (condense books down by removing the thought-producing parts) as leading to his world. But, even so, because of these \\"interruptions\\" to the story, I rate this book at merely an OK 3 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My son needed this book for his summer reading.

However, the delivery needs some work. I find that the entire buildup to the climax was weak and mostly unnecessary. It either needed to be much longer with greater detail, or entirely rewritten. The author, for some reason, enjoys repeating words or sentences to add stress on the situation... which is fine until it is done on practically EVERY page. He also likes lists. It gets to the point to where you can read the first sentence, then skip the entire rest of the paragraph because all it is is the repeating of the same information. The book also has a weak ending. I reference it to the Tortilla Curtain. A wonderful book with a good moral... but the author decides to rape your mind of everything you've been trying to build of what your expecting in the end. It just doesn't make sense. It does, but of all the ways you could have ended it? REALLY?A few other flaws in the book is that there is virtually no background of... the background. Its quite a few pages before you manage to figure out what kind of year theyre in (past or future). And you only do this by them referencing futuristic devices that you're somehow supposed to already know what they do and why they exist. You almost have to accept that you don't know and move on.The book is sometimes compared to 1984... however 1984 does a much better job at a similar, yet different moral of society. 1984 is government focused, 451 is literature focused.I would recommend this book simply because it is a highly referenced book. Not because of his excellent writing style or plot abilities... but because the lesson needs to be learned. I really only started caring during the 2nd half of the last section. The rest... meh. It's almost like taking the highway vs the scenic route. sure you get there... but it's not nearly as exciting.

I'm not a fan of long books but this one was just too short for the story to go anywhere. The ending felt rushed and a bit too dramatic for the speed at which it developed.

I am currently attending college and due to the amount of reading I have had in past years it was hard for me to bring myself to reading other books as well; related to laziness / lack of motivation.This year, however, has brought a new change upon me. I have made it my goal to read at least 1 - 2 different books each week which are not related whatsoever to school material -- and let me tell you, I am happy I have. Textbooks are boring, dry, and repetitive. Books such as Fahrenheit 451 and others I have purchased open your mind and make you think in different ways.Anyways, I have a few friends who suggested this book to me which lead me to purchasing it. I knew \\"book-burning\\" was going to play a factor before I even opened it. But, while reading this short novel I have noticed that Fahrenheit 451 plays a much bigger concept. It's hard to believe that this book was wrote in the 50's for how prophetic and how much it can relate to our currect society and perhaps the society to come.There is no doubt TV (Bradbury comparison to the 'Walls') has killed free thinking. I have read numerous works on Media Control, Propaganda, and how TV controls minds. Think about it. What do Americans buy? The item they see on TV advertised by their favorite 'celebrity'. Who do young girls wish to be like? Models on TV, Actresses, others they see in magazines. How can you gain support for a war? Mass propaganda on TV about WMD's. How can you get your President elected? Spend the most money on advertising for the campaign. You can broadcast anything you like, if you have the money, to sway public opinion one way or another and it proves that TV controls Americans.I'm 21 - I find it hilarious the amount of TV watched by people my age and defintely younger. Some of my friends can sit their whole Saturday and Sundays infront of their HDTV's watching College Football and the NFL. Kids under my age are absorbed by TV shows on MTV, nothing ever meaningful to expand your mind; you could make the claim that watching shows such as Jersey Shore may even make you less intelligent, that's for another time though haha.To close, the book shows great implications where society is heading and how society is today. In the book, Clarisse, explains how people drive fast and how they don't acknowledge the world around them. I took this in a sense that Americans work, work, work, constantly, to provide for the family / themselves. We are always in a rush. We rarely stop to observe the world around us or take a look at what really is going on and enjoy being on Earth. We are tied to working to survive. Life is too short not to admire the beauty that may be around you; if you take the time to look, that is."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Enjoyed it thoroughly - I had never read it - am not usually a sci-fi fan, but it's truly a classic"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's books are insightful and thought-provoking because he writes fictional short stories and novels about the future, with a common theme on how society uses technology. In particular, Bradbury's book, Fahrenheit 451, discusses relevant concerns about applying technology to teaching. In the back of the 50th Anniversary Edition published by Del Rey Books, there is a recent interview with Bradbury where he discusses his concerns about using radio and television in the classroom as a replacement for sound traditional teaching methodologies. When Bradbury wrote the book in the 1950's, he imagines a society where reading is no longer taught. In his recent book interview, Bradbury expresses that he is still concerned about the quality of education today and believes that there is a current problem in the educational system, with less emphasis placed on quality in comparison to when he attended school back in 1926.Many readers feel that the book is about censorship but it actually focuses more specifically upon the idea of freedom. Bradbury says in the interview that he does not regard censorship as a problem within the United States and feels that there are many diverse groups who provide voices for various interests; yet, he considers television, including local news, as a culprit towards ignorance. In Fahrenheit 451, Bradbury attributes intelligence to free thinking and expresses that books are merely an agent towards learning and not a magical device to create intelligence. In a subtle way, Bradbury points out that wisdom comes from trial-and-error types of experiences and intellectual growth comes from making real-life decisions, albeit not always correct choices, but nonetheless, independent thinking is an important part of the learning process. In a democratic society, both freedom and independent choices are vital for keeping its structure sound.The story goes something like this: there exists a dysfunctional, sick society where \\"thinking\\" is no longer valued and education is censored. Through the advent of radio and television, information is absorbed but there is no longer reflection or judgment over the validity of the source. Book burning becomes fashionable because \\"truth\\" is too disturbing. Firemen are used to keep social order and to maintain majority group satisfaction. In this time frame, religion exits but only serves to function as a media tool used for commercialism. The main character, Montag, is a fireman who sets fires to the homes where books are stored illegally. Over time, Montag is plagued by many questions, such as, why people are willing to die for books and why are the qualities of independent thinking not valued in his society? At the beginning of Fahrenheit 451, he meets a teenage girl who asks him numerous questions about how the society is structured and what would happen if things were to change. He is particularly bothered with her question as to whether he is happy. This specific question brings an important issue to light; what constitutes freedom. What would happen if academic freedom became outlawed? As Montag grows sympathetic with the rebellious cause over intellectual freedom, he discovers the history behind why his culture became dysfunctional and what future scenario has to happen in order to change it. Reading is more than an action of digesting words but requires reflection and a foundation set towards higher thinking.Overall Fahrenheit 451 provides intriguing concepts and a very interesting story line, although Bradbury finishes with a very weak ending. There is more than one way to change society, and not necessarily through the 1950's notion that an atomic bomb has to rip through social fabric in order to create new thinking. Yet perhaps, atomic war can serve as a powerful symbolic weapon to the destruction ignorance does to society and its people. His final advice to teachers is also useful: assess the quality of what is taught and encourage students to become independent thinkers.In Bradbury's interview, he expresses that his concern with radio and television is over its application to learning. Even though he doesn't show how radio and television can be used in education or explains the definition of quality media, Bradbury does not dismiss the idea that electronic transmissions can be used effectively. In Fahrenheit 451, Montag is told directly by Professor Faber that books do not create learning but that they are merely vehicles to describe thoughts. Montag, however, is still bothered about the role of books and education because he recognizes that men spend their entire lives to record thoughts and experiences, and Montag believes that society can learn from this type of wisdom. In fact, at the moment when Montag begins to question his social structure, it leads him into independent thought and freedom. Furthermore, because Montag is able to discern between authors who contribute greatly to social thinking and writers who produce work for entertainment purposes, he is willing eventually to put his own life at risk for knowledge.Yet, whether radio, television, or books are used for teaching, the point is clear, it is the way that they are used and the values which are placed upon the medium that makes a difference in learning. A page from a book can be just as meaningless as a television commercial that is tuned out by the listener. How teachers reach students is a very critical issue in Bradbury's Farenheit 451. Montag becomes the next teacher and leader in his dysfunctional society, and as observers, we too can learn from Montag about our future roles in determining social values. This book is small enough to read within a few evenings but has enough material to \\"think\\" about for a long time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Ray Bradbury's science-fiction story Fahrenheit 451, he tells of a world set in the future when it's illegal to own books. The main character, Guy Montag, works for the fire department setting fires in homes occupied by literature. Guy Montag, unhappy at home, is surrounded by technology that he feels is unimportant. Guy Montag soon realizes that burning the books would ruin years of writing and history, when he takes home a handful of books he is put in danger. The setting is believable, unknown, and familiar all at the same time. It has a lot of similar issues as today's world does, but with a futuristic spin on them. Fahrenheit 451 is a fast paced, fascinating read; I would recommend it to anybody who likes sci-fi thrillers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My favorite book.

He was a fire fighter, a person who burns books and had everything he would ever need to be happy. But something is missing and all Montag wants to do is figure it out. Could the books he has been destroying all these years be what have been missing in his life? Is knowledge the power that Montag needs? Fahrenheit 451 is a book that will open your eyes and make you realize how much the little things you have in your life mean.Guy Montag is a true hero who battles against himself and the way of the world to find the truth. Montag was a firefighter who started reading the books instead of burning them. His wife never loved him and Beatty is out to get him. But this doesn't stop Montag. He kills Beatty with a flame thrower and then proceeds to run from the law until they kill an innocent bystander to make a good television show. Now Montag is just one of the few that must rebuild the world.This book shows just how much we should appreciate the things we have, like books. People committed suicide everyday because they could not take the pain. Something was missing from their lives, and Montag discovers that books are what his life is missing. His wife, Mildred tries to kill herself by overdosing because she can't take the hurt. The book teaches you to appreciate the things you have in your life and how much it hurts when they are gone.Fahrenheit 451 is a book that makes you realize where our world may be going. Books and newspapers are being dumbed down so that nobody will be offended or discriminated against. Just like in the book, could the pain from the missing of good literature cause people to be unhappy and eventually commit suicide? Could we become like the people in the book?Fahrenheit 451 is an eye opening book that makes you appreciate what you have. Montag had no idea what he was missing until he began reading books. This book opens your eyes to the dangers of not having good literature and how the little things in life are never fully appreciated until they are gone. Everyone should read this book at least once in their life.--V. McGee"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Possessing books is illegal, for which your house may burn.

Whereas \\"1984\\" took me two days to complete, I read through \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" in an afternoon. Additionally \\"1984\\" ends with an feeling of hopelessness, whereas 451 ends with some degree of optimism for the future.Overall, 451 still stands out as one of a limited number of dystopian stories whose message remains as vital today as when it was published."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ages 14 and up.

Despite being hailed as a book about censorship, I prefer to stress the aspect Ray Bradbury himself prefers: that long before the government mandated the burning of books, people had abandoned them, considering them 'obsolete.' It isn't so much about politics, but about society. I also want to mention that it is not objectionable books being burned, but ALL books, and with it, mental thought processes. People are being reduced to robots, with short attention spans. The essence of life is being sucked out of them, and this is the best theme of the book, in my opinion: the emotional pain and suffering of those who have nothing to cherish in life. The suicides and murders, the agony of the protagonist, Guy Montag, the bursting into tears of a woman . . . it is a much weightier theme than censorship.The book does have its drawbacks- an emotional but often confusing writing style mucks the clarity of the content, and there is an annoying on-purpose disregard of grammar. The character of Faber rubbed me the wrong way, as did the group of hobo learned men in the end, who declare themselves unimportant except as vessels for the books they have memorized. In fact, there is a paragraph in which Montag seems to notice and be conflicted by it- which is COMPLETELY UNRESOLVED! That got to me.Overall, the book is not a literary classic, but it's worth reading for the ideas in it, for the simple pleasure denied Bradbury's characters- to think about it, to talk and discuss. Montag is a sympathetic character, Clarisse is wondrous with her childlike enthusiasm, and Beatty is deliciously evil in that he gets straight to the root of what happened and what he does- and continues. No self-delusion of grandeur.Read it! See what you think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book has it all. Bradbury's fascinating description, a engrossing plot, a skewed but interesting hero, and a cause any reader can get behind. I know there are probably thousands of reviews of this book, but I just had to say it again. If for some strange reason you haven't read it, read it now. You are missing out!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In an age of instant &quot;classics&quot;, this book has stood the the test of time. Let us remember, this book was written in the 1950's, not today. So, yes, the story line might seem a little worn, but that's because it has been repeated, used, and indead, to pardon a pun, worn by humanity for five decades. Like many of Bradbury's works, this stands as a warning of humanity's arrogance, dependance upon technology, and lack of learning."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've heard some people say that this book rips off 1984, that is NOT true. It's essentially the converse of 1984. In Orwell's masterpiece (I won't deny either of these books that title) the government has absolute power. 1984 has been called &quot;The end of all Utopias&quot; because the people can't win.In Bradbury's work, however, the government is not all powerful, and still has those who work against it that it foolishly ignores. Furthermore, the war is not to permanently distract the people, it is a real thing to win or lose. The people aren't closely monitored, they can even have ideas so long as they don't have books. In the end this is the beggining of a Utopia, in 451 the government can't win, they will eventually fall and a new age of learning will rise...to fall again, and again, and again, but as Bradbury points out unlike the Phoenix we may eventually learn NOT TO JUMP IN THE FREAKIN' FUNERAL PYRE, OR EVEN TO BUILD IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a novel about a futuristic society where censorship reigns supreme and independent thought is deeply scrutinized. This is a world where the televisions talk to you, vehicular manslaughter is an innocent charge as long as you have insurance, and fireman burn books instead of putting fires out. The main character in this novel is a fireman named Guy Montag, a man happy with his job, his wife, his place in society, and life in general. All of this holds true until one fateful evening, after a successful night of setting millions of pages ablaze, Montag runs into a wistful teenager named Clarisse. She is an introverted girl by this future society's standards because she doesn't enjoy playing sports, or driving fast. Her main interests are thinking and talking about what she's thinking--very anti-social to everyone else. Clarisse is the catalyst for Montag's rise from subservient book burner to independent thinking intellectual. Montag begins to take books from the houses he burns and hide them in his air conditioner, promising to read them one day. One night, the firemen come to an old woman's house where they are to burn her collection of books. Beatty, the firehouse captain, douses her collection of books with kerosene, but instead of letting that be the end of it, the old woman decides to set herself on fire along with her treasures. Montag becomes very sickened by this event and decides not to be a fireman anymore. This is where one of the most crucial scenes comes into play, Beatty comes to Montag's house to talk him into staying a fireman, using all of his cunning and sly words to tell him how things were, and how they are better now. Montag makes a choice not go with what society wants, and to become a rebel. Montag meets with a professor to learn how to fully understand what he's reading, and they come upon an insidious plan to plant books in fireman's houses and call alarms on them, effectively destroying the idea that books should be burned if the burners themselves want them. Montag decides to go into work one last time, and after they get a call, much to his surprise, they arrive at his house. Montag's own wife Mildred had called in an alarm, and quickly left. Montag kills the other firemen and goes on the run, eventually meeting a gang of old college professors in the woods, and becoming one of them.The character I felt I could most relate to was the main character Guy Montag. Montag was really confused with his life, and how it was turning out, he didn't know if he liked the person he had become. I think I would do the same thing as Montag did if I were in his position. Montag's society reminded me of today's society slightly where censorship is still a problem, but to only a small extent. Also, the only way people in Montag's society could enjoy anything was if it was fast paced and devoid of any need to think, sometimes I feel that holds true with our society as well. Take our sports for example: football, basketball, hockey, all of these are extremely violent and fast.I did not like the book for a few reasons. The first is that I felt the view point of the novel was too extreme, and it lost some of its value because I just could not relate to it as well as the novel wanted me to. Another was the characters, outside of Montag, all the characters are static and flat, not one of them changes. I did enjoy the digressions in the book, the time Bradbury took to stretch his own personal talents with beautiful, and sometimes scary, descriptions of what Montag was thinking. But, I felt that Bradbury was trying to hard to fit into an Ernest Hemingway style of quick thoughts without explanation, giving the reader the opportunity to figure out what is being said like a puzzle. It just didn't do it for me.My recommendation is that people should read this novel because it can give insight to how any society works. But I do not believe it is an important novel because it just did not get its point across well enough. Read this novel if you dislike censorship and wish to see it completely abolished, but this is the only type of reader I feel could totally enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The author of the book Fahrenheit 451 was focused on teaching appreciation of God-given rights to his readers. Ray Bradbury considered a life without reading, without control of one's own thoughts, and without knowing history. He also considered a life where parents don't like the children that they have. Bradbury considered this and thought best to write a book so that people would not take their lives for granted. He considers reading a privilege, while most others would consider it a right, a right that isn't thought of as a right, but just is. Bradbury conveys a horrible story that helps his readers understand what they should value in life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I began reading the book Fahrenheit 451 I did not enjoy it very much. But after I put more time into reading this book I started to like it more and more. One of the reasons I liked the book so much was because of the great detail, but it still leaves room for you to think about what is going on. Ray Bradbury's vision of the future does not seem to far fetch for me. With how our society is, and the love for television I could see how the banning of books can occur. This has already happened in history before.This story is about a fireman Guy Montag and his life. His job is to burn books and the houses they are in. He is happy with this until his young neighbor Clarisse Mcclellan. She shows him how horrible the society the live in really is and changes his views in several ways. All of the symbolism in this book was so amazing once you understood it. Light and dark, symbolizing good and bad, was used often in Fahrenheit 451. I also enjoy how rolls reverse in this book, like in our society and in the future society. In the book the fireman are completely the opposite of what ours are today, also in the future society you can not drive under the speed minimum or you get a ticket. This shows how the government doesn't want people to take there time because they could have time to think about new and interesting thins. One thing I didn't like about the book was that throughout it the author goes into less detail about how the society in which they live in is ran and more detail on how he goes about living in it. But I think the author did this to get focus on the problem at hand. I enjoyed how the author makes you find the under lying meaning in the book and that is a good aspect in my opinion. I also like how the book can be compared to Hitler and what he was doing when he was in control of the German government. The way the society does not like having freethinkers and having open minds is almost exactly like what Hitler was trying to do to the people of Germany. I think it is great how it shows how far ahead of his time the author was. I think his interpretation of the future could be accurate.My overall opinion of the book is it is a good read. It can become boring at times but it can also be extremely exciting at points too. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes the thought of futuristic societies and what can happen to the world after we leave. I think it is a very well written book but doesn't define some of its characters as well as it should. But that isn't a reason to not read the book. I think anyone could enjoy reading this book. It makes you think and has so many metaphors and similes that at some points are too much. But it is a great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My initial thought of the book, after reading the back cover, was this is going to be very corny. After putting much time into reading the story, I was surprised when it turned out to be one of the best books I have ever read.One of the key ingredients for my much love for the book was the sufficient detail, but still leaving room for you to interpret it in your own way. The glimpse of the future does not seem so far fetched. With the new interest in television over a book, and the \\"un-colorblind\\" society, book burning would seem like a good answer.I enjoyed the book, it was a fun read, and portrayed what may happen later in our time. The story is about Guy Montags life as a \\"fireman\\", one who destroys books by burning them. He is challenged by a younger girl, his neighbor, and notices the horror of his times. One thing I did notice with the story, however, was some parts in the book were very well described, and others I wish had more explanation. For example, more details on how the society is run, and set up would have been nice. I think the author may of done this to keep the focus on the point of the story, but I felt I was missing things when \\"painting my picture\\". During my period of reading the book, I couldn't help but compare the story to that of incidents of book burnings during the Second World War. The government in Fahrenheit 451can be compared to Hitler, and his drive too uneducated the people of his generation, and erase all evidence of their past.This book requires you to read between the lines, to get the under lying meaning, which is a great aspect in my opinion. It stupefies me on how a writer so long ago, could accurately portray what exactly is happening in our society, for this reason I alone I read the book cover to cover, and made special note of other areas of prediction. I read other reviews before reading the story myself; I noticed that many of the reviewers felt there were too many metaphors. I don't think this should be a reason not to read this book.I enjoyed this book very much, and would recommend it to any one that asked. It is a must read classic.

It made me realize how important books are in society, and just how much books really do influence your reality. In F451 the government was afraid to let the people have their own ideas.

Most people in this particular community did not \\"talk\\" with one another, they would rather sit in front of the T.Vs. After a while the community wasn't even people anymore, they were robots.

This book takes place in a futuristic American city. In the book, the main character, Guy Montag, works for a fire station. But instead of putting out fires, they start them. The book is about this group of firemen who find people that own books, go to their house, and burn them. Guys wife, Mildred, is a completely opposite character. She is a woman with absolutly no life at all, she prefers to watch tv in their parlor room all day, and listen to the radio in her &quot;seeshell radio&quot;, that is attached to her ear. Mildred seems to be a completely empty person, and doesnt even realize it when she tries to commit suicide. Beatty, Montags fire chief, is the leader of this group that burn books. As he notices that Guy is starting to realize what books have to offer, Beatty gets more and more curious as to what Guy is really doing on his days off. These two turn out to be enemies towards the end of the book, because of Guys new love of books. In the beginning of the book, Guy meets a seventeen year old girl, named Clarise. Clarise is a different kind of girl for her age in this society. She is more in touch with herself and nature and the people around her. Everyone in this society is completely opposite of that, and consider Clarise an outsider. A few days after Guy meets Clarise, she is killed by a speeding car. When Guys love for books exceeds his passion to burn them, Guy sees an old english professor for help. When Beatty finds out what Guy is up to, he sends the fire department to Guys house. Beatty forces Guy to burn his own house down because of having the books, then places Guy under arrest. Guy takes the flamethrower and burns Beatty to ashes, and knocks out the rest of the members of the fire department. His last obsticle is the Mechanical Hound, which is a machine set to find people that have escaped from the police and fire department. Before Beatty was killed, he had set the hound to find Guy. After Guy is done with the fire department, the Hound finds Guy. The Hound leaps at Guy and injects anesthetic into Guys leg, to get him to stop running. Guy manages to burn the hound and get away. Guy meets a group of people like himself, runaways from the city who enjoy books. The point of this book I think is a possibility of what computers might do to civilization. With the ever expanding computer technololgy we have, books are starting to phase themselves out. They portrayed this in the book by saying that books were written to offend people and had to be rid of. This was a good yet different interpretation of what the future of our society can become."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a great book about the world in the future.

This is a great book to read and it really makes you think.Fahrenheit 451 is about a time when books are banned from the world. Anyone with books will get their house burned down by the fire department. The cars are really fast and everyone cares only about themselves.

The brillant start to book about burning and changing not only sets up the book's major themes, it also foreshadows Montag's transformation.

Bradbury seems to put the last events on cruise control. The contrived ending sort of gives the book a bad after taste.However, this book is fantastic even with the flawed ending. The dialogs surrounding books and the concepts they contain often make the reader pause and reflect. The fact that sitting and reading can be deemed revolutionary is something every reader dreams of.

Its quite on the contrary, it's a world where TV's lined whole walls, and if you pay extra they can even say your name!

His premise is interesting enough, especially in light of the present state of our culture, however his execution is embarrassingly bad.The plot is predictable and hoaky, the characters are boringly flat, and the dialogue--perhaps the biggest drawback of the book--is wooden and unrealistic. Interspersed throughout all of this soap opera melodrama are dreary, quodlibetic references to Shakespeare, Bacon, Milton...you get the picture.It dawned on me as I was nearing the end of this book that Bradbury could easily have been the child of Ayn Rand and Jacques Barzun. Hamfisted, cardboard fiction from mommy, and tired pedantry from daddy. To be fair, there are a few well-penned lines, and he definitely has a point. But if you're interested in nightmarish visions of a futuristic dystopia, check out Orwell or Huxley. Bradbury basically took their stories and mashed them together anyway.Again, I can't stress enough the importance of this book's message. Nevertheless, this book, as vehicle for that message, definitely has a flat tire."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are looking for a story about a dystopian society in which the government censors people's entire lives to the point where citizens aren't even allowed to read, then Fahrenheit 451 the perfect book for you.

He starts out really dedicated to the job, but then he meets a girl one night walking home from the fire station that really gets him thinking about how he is living his life. Guy begins to rethink everything he does and decides to fight the system. The idea of the story is fantastic; however the writing is not the greatest. The way Ray Bradbury writes is highly confusing. He uses metaphors, symbolism and similes like there is no tomorrow. He also has a tendency to jump from one topic to the next, one time to the next and one mood to the next. When he is talking about the Salamander when going out on a call to look for, and burn books, he describes the Salamander in great detail and then just switches to talking about the house, at which they have just arrived, without saying anything about the house until after the explanation of the house. So while the reader thinks Bradbury is still describing the Salamander he has actually gone into talking about a house instead. All in all, the book had a great point being that if someone challenges you; challenge them in return for what you believe to be right and just. However the style of writing just didn't agree with the way my mind thinks. But if you are someone who enjoys metaphors and jumpy writing, this would be a good choice for you to look in to reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In my humble opinion, I find it is riduculous that eBooks cost more than books printed with ink and paper."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Hi!I guess I didn't look too carefully and missed that text to speech was not enabled.Is there a way to get the publisher to change their mind?Thanks,per"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This summer we read this book. I hated this book for several reasons. First of all, the story was way too jumpy. It started slow, and then randomly got fast. It had absolutly no suspense to it. I found myself forcing myself to read! I couldn't relate to any of the characters! For instance, some of the characters were too boring. Maybe if I read this book in this book in ten years I would have a different opinion. Another reason why I didn't like this book, is because the characters weren't seen enough. They were all just thrown in at different times. You didn't feel like you got to know them very well and I hate that. I would not recommend this book. I think that Ray Bradbury needs to rethink his book ideas! I do not want to be critical of Ray Bradbury, but really I couldn't stand this book. It had no meaning to me. It also, had a poor plot and setting. For instance, it was plotted in the future yet it was no different than today. I don't plan on reading anymore or Ray Bradbury's books!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Heyyyy I had to read this book for school and it was the worst thing I ever read.

The characters were entirely unconvincing - e.g. the professor with the strange name who can only express himself using metaphors. The plot is just a predictable and flimsy excuse for a parable about the dangers of modern society. I read it, because I'd bought it, but I found almost every word an insult to my intelligence."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is the worst book I have ever read in my whole life. I was forced to read it in school, and I disguised the book starting at the first page. There is absolutely nothing good in the book. It makes no sense, and I personally don't think the world will become to be, as predicted in this book. I also find this book very offensive to my religious beliefs. How can a book that takes the name of the Lord in vain, in almost every page, be used as a class novel. Everyone knows that taking the Lord's name in vain is breaking one of God's commandments, and is a sin. I have never read a book that was as bad as Fahrenheit 451 in language. I don't understand how the school boards can justify such a book, and use it for classes.

Or because they conflict with what the powers that be require you to believe. That was the way Bradbury envisioned the future in Fahrenheit 451.

An excellent read by one of Sci Fi's best and not far from the reality some people have lived and still do today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradubury is definately the book to read. This novel takes place in a world that is vividly described by Bradbury. I rate Fahrenheit 451 five stars because of the adventure and curiosity. With events happening at every page, Bradbury keeps the readers on their toes! With the main character being Guy Montag, a fireman, whose job wasn't to stop fires, but to start them. He liked his job until he met a seventeen year old girl that tells him about the past, and a retired English professor telling him about the future. In this wondrous world where books were depressing and illegal, Montag finally knew what he was supposed to do a long time ago. This novel has events running by, rapidly, happening one after another, this novel is full of fun and excitement! This book always makes you want to read more, from the time you pick up the book and until you put it back down, you will never want to put it back down. Ray Bradbury leaves readers with suspense and tension at the end of each time you pick up the book, this is definitely, without a doubt, the best book to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Like all great books that cause a stir, either because of their &quot;ideas&quot; or the fact that they're so shocking (think Rand's &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; McCrae's &quot;Bark of the Dogwood,&quot; or &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;) &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; took its place long ago among the classics. But the scary thing about this book is, despite the fact that we were warned of this type of thing, situations like the one in 451 are still happening! This book is even more relevant today than it was years ago when it appeared as &quot;fiction.&quot; How sad that we haven't learned our lessons. F 451 is beyond the definition of a classic and beyond food for thought. It's a wake-up call that should not be ignored."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which book paper catches fire, and starts to burn... Why on earth would you want to know that? . Because that is extremely important in this book, due to the fact that its main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman. However, he is not a fireman in the way we now understand that word: a man that tries to stop fires. Here, firemen burn books.Bradbury tells us about a place where books are forbidden: nobody can read them, or have them, without committing a crime. The authorities consider that they are dangerous, and because of that they make firemen burn them, and the houses where they were.Everything changes for Montag due to two things. To begin with, he gets to know Clarisse, a young girl that makes him see life from another perspective. Secondly, one day the unexpected happens: he cannot help but read a line of a book he was burning. Of course, Montag gets curious, and as a result, he steals some books, and decides to read them.That causes him many problems, as he begins to put into question things he took for guaranteed before. With the help of Faber, and old former professor who still remembers how things were before books were forbidden, Montag starts to think about a way to change things... Will he be able to do that?. I don?t want to give away more about the book, so read it and you will know :)It is worthwhile to point out that &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is a beautiful story, so wonderfully written that it is very easy to read. Notwithstanding that, I believe that the more important aspect of this book is that it is a good way to remember why we like books so much, and what a privilege it is to be able to have them.Thanks to Bradbury?s imaginary dystopia we realize once again that something that Heinrich Heine said is true: &quot;It is there, where they burn books, that eventually they burn people too&quot; (&quot;Dort, wo man Bucher Verbrennt, verbrennt man auch am, Ende Menschen&quot;). I think that the book?s message regarding the dangers of censorship and the importance of reading should remain with us...On the whole, I highly recommend &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; to you. Enjoy it :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I like books that teach me things. Fahrenheit 451 is similar to other books like 1984 and Brave New World, where humanity is just a shell of what it used to be. However, 451 presents a problem much more slippery and troubling than 1984 in my mind. How do you help someone who doesn't want to be helped?Bradbury's prose takes a little getting used to, but his message needs to be understood. It's a message that grows more important everyday, with classics being exchanged for cliff notes and books being banned because they offend someone (huck finn, uncle tom's cabin, catcher in the rye). This is the first step to Bradbury's nightmare, culminating in the thought 'Everyone must be equal - not like the Constitution states - but *made* equal'.Editorializing a bit here, 451 represents to me the ultimate victory of things like MTV, reality television and political correctness. Humanity is reduced to one plastic mold - through laziness or censorship - and everyone is loving it. These characters don't realize how empty their lives are; instead of working out problems everyone retreats into their own world. Instead of attempting to answer humanity's most profound question, the world of 451 pretends they don't exist.One last thing: Clarisse is a trip - her character really catches a living quality I don't see often in books. With Fahrenheit 451, I learned a lot."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most important and influential books of all time. In 1950, when it was written he didn't know he was going to predict today's society. Guy Montag, the protagonist, loved his work. There seemed to be nothing that he liked better than to spray kerosene on a pile of books and watch the pages curl and turn into ash. Until, one day he meets Clarisse, a 17-year-old girl who has been educated about the world. At one point in one of their conversation she asks if he is happy. Montag realizes that people should have the right to read books. He finds that books mean a lot to people when a woman chooses to burn herself with her books. Guy comes up with a plan to get revenge on other firemen in an effort to stop book banning.Montag's boss, Beatty tries to reason with Montag about the banishment of books saying \\"Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs. Don't give them slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy (61).\\" The people of Montag's society live under such a principle, even though at some times they may not know it.The turning point in the novel is when his wife, Mildred discovers what he is doing. She becomes scared. Eventually, she turns him in, and he is forced to burn his collection of books. This is the climax of the book because the reader is unsure what lies ahead. The adrenaline of the reader is at its highest, and ones mind is trying to think of all the possible outcomes.The censorship that is in Bradbury's novel comes from an inferior dictatorship. It is a culture that does not want its citizens to be lured into the meanings of books. Today, our culture is bombarded with advertisements. Everyday it seems as though we have less time to ourselves. Today we are not burning books and bookstores are popular, but we still seem to ban books for one reason or another. Fifty years later the book still remains relevant to our society.Fahrenheit 451 is a brilliant novel. In my opinion, it is as meaningful perhaps even more so than it was when it was written in 1950. The novel shows what censorship can do to a society, and the importance of free speech. People must learn to accept different views, whether they agree totally or not. We must always be open to new opportunities that arise and never except the norm. Everyone should read Fahrenheit 451, take what they learn from it and apply it to their everyday lives. Overall, I think that the novel has a good message and I am glad that I spent my time reading it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read Fahrenheit 451 years ago in highschool, and just reread it last month. It was the feature book in our town's One Book, One City program. What I found was that F451 doesn't lose it's impact all these years later. The ideas of censorship, of book burning, of reading in general come sharply into focus as the reader experiences Montag's journey."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've read this book a couple of times and the truths of this book never cease to amaze me. Very similar to Orwell's 1984, this is the visionary look of what happens when government has too much power to control our lives and censure our media. In this story, books are the source of evil because they encourage free thinking and contain ideas that discourage the ideals of this government's philosophies. To control what people think, books are banned and burned by firemen. Firemen, as far as people believe (because books don't exist that disprove this), have always been around, burning books to protect the public from the evils they portray. This is the story of Guy Montag, who is a fireman.Guy Montag lives the life of any dedicated fireman. He does his job, pretends to be happy, and spends much of his income on TV walls so his wife can have more people in her \\"family\\" in which to converse with (and be controlled by).His life changes when he meets his seventeen year-old, free-thinking neighbor, Clarisse. Guy's eyes are open to a new world as he finds a new love for thinking for himself and discovering the wonders of books.This book has really appealed to me of late because of my own new-found love in books. If you don't appreciate having libraries in every town and an endless supply of books in which to enrich your imagination then you need to read this book so you can imagine what life would be like if books were banned along with your ability to think for yourself. Consider this a MUST READ."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A time honored classic, once a scary prophetic vision, and quite possibly, now a reality. Ray Bradbury's futuristic thriller, &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; reads as both analogy and warning, and a dire one at that.This book has been on my &quot;let's read it in the near future&quot; list for some time. But it wasn't until the city of Portland, Oregon selected this book for their &quot;Everyone Reads&quot; campaign that I found the incentive to read it.This story spins a tale in the near future where reading is considered outlaw, that books are contraband, and any attempt of thinking outside the box is handled by extinguishing the threat. Guy Montag is a fireman, but not in the common sense; he starts fires instead of putting them out. He's &quot;married&quot; to Mildred, in a passionless marriage of convenience; Mildred who prefers to spend time in front of the television and listening to the radio in her life of hopelessness. Early on, he meets the fair Clarisse who boldly suggests to him that life is much more than starting fires. It is the tipping point of his decline, as his life begins to rush closer and closer to the incinerator itself.What impressed me about this book is that it was written in the early 1950's, and yet it reads as well as a modern novel. Bradbury would refute any attempts of suggesting he was forecasting the future, but so much of what he saw the future becoming has transpired. How many hours do our children spend in front of the television? And in these times, when our libraries are being threatened to track patron's records or monitor internet use, how far away are we from Bradbury's 451?It's both chilling and reflecting. As a dour warning for what might happen, we can take heed to this warning to ensure that we celebrate divergent thought and reading as a gift for our citizens and not something to fear. Whereas people would refute the claim that we would never burn books in America, why is it that this book so often has actually been banned from some libraries and schools across this country?We need to listen, and learn, lest we suffer the fate of Montag and start to live in a country and world so brilliantly premonitioned in \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"'Fahrenheit 451' is a powerful story that imagines a future world where literature is burned and readers are imprisoned. Bradbury creates a whole dumbed-down society of people who are robbed of creative and independent thought, and where this deficit is enforced by law.I felt that the major shortcoming of the book was that the entire book smacks of '1984,' but it is not nearly as powerful as Orwell's story. 'Fahrenheit 451' focuses much more intently on the relatively narrower issue of censorship in our society, whereas '1984' looks at the complete robbery of free will. I thought all of the characters were a rip-off, from the young girl to the protagonist to the mean authority figure who tries to &quot;help&quot; the protagonist and turns on him in the end.This is a good book, and I like the metaphor, I just felt like the same idea was espoused in a much more gripping fashion in '1984.'"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm sorry seeing as everyone considers this book a &quot;classic&quot;, I hate to disappoint you , but it is not that wonderful of a book. I did not particularly enjoy this book. I was forced to read it for my 8th Grade AP English class and wasn't very thrilled about it. Bradbury goes on for pages of poetic nonsense that many don't and wouldn't want to understand. The book has a wonderful message and I am disappointed in Bradbury for this horrible representation of such a wonderful theme. Too many questions left unanswered for the mind to ponder. I mean who doesn't like thinking about a book?? Well I certainly do but there are just too many loose ends. And the characters aren't elaborated on enough. They are almost all left as flat charachters which doesn't make for a most enjoyable book. Many have read and many have been disappointed. Bradbury has many other works, I highly reccomend reading one of those instead of this book which lacks good plot or character development. It also has very little plot action and isn't very interesting.

We had read some of Ray Bradbury's other books in school and I hadn't liked them, but i thought i might like this one. I didn't. Even though it is suggested for students older than me I think I still understood it enough to have reasons for not liking it. First of all, I didn't find any certain plot to it. You could understand that the main character was not happy, but nothing told you why clearly. I found it very boring because of the way they went from one event to another without really tying them together. Also,the way the author compared the characters thoughts to real life examples most of the time didn't make very much sense and sometimes you couldn't tell the difference between something really happening or if it was all in their mind. From the start it did not seem to be going anywhere. I would not suggest this book to anyone of my age or anyone interested in adventure books, because this isn't. The only thing i can say i liked about this book is the character Clarisse McClellan, she seemed intersting and I think she should have played a more active role in the story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Haing missed this book in school, somehow, I've always meant to read it since I keep hearing great things about it.

Add to that only a single character that was likeable at all (and she was killed off pretty early), then a pretty boring story to go along with it, and the only reason I was able to finish it was because it was so short.I don't see any reason why anyone would want to read this book, but I'm clearly in the minority on this one, so maybe you'll like it better than I did."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book in my sophomore Honors English class.

The main character is a man named Montag, a fireman whose job it is to burn books. In this story Montag is secretly reading, even though the punishment for reading is either life in jail or death. In this world there are many technologies that control people's lives.I think that Ray Bradbury should have done made the plot more clear. At the beginning of this book I was confused about the world where the story took place, which meant I couldn't relate to Montag or the story. By the end of the book, I was still left wondering about what happened to certain characters or why certain things happened.There are many ways he could have made this story better. He could have added more conflict in the plot or action in Montag's life. I did not enjoy the sci-fi aspect of the story because the complex technology interfered with the lives of the characters. Bradbury may be a good writer to many people, but because he did not explain the story clearly, he isn't someone I would choose to read again."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a short and simple book that deals with some incredibly complex issues. Most people mistakenly believe that Bradbury wrote Fahrenheit about censorship. Although that shoe does fit this story, Bradbury actually wrote this book to highlight the possible consequences that our society may have to face if the trend of television and similar forms of entertainment began to overtake more imaginative forms of entertainment such as books. This theme seems even more relevent today than it would have when it was written in 1953. The fictional world of the future that Bradbury created is a depressing and generic place where people have forgotten how to think for themselves and are completely unable to form true bonds of family and friendship. The books that are burned by the firemen are against the law but the story points out very obviously that these laws began as a result of the citizens' own actions. Books were burned if any one group found them offensive so that everyone would be happy. Eventually, all books were considered offensive to someone and the government stepped in to take care of the problem of books once and for all. Unfortunately, this did nothing to REALLY fix the problem. It merely dumbed down society until people were unable to realize their true feelings. Suicide and murder is a normal and acceptable occurance. Everything is impersonal and generic as protagonist Guy Montag goes from \\"content\\" fireman to book-loving fugitive in the matter of a couple hundred pages.As a book lover, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Bradbury writes in a natural voice and it is extremely obvious that he himself if a great lover of books. It is a refreshing read while still disturbing the reader with it's eerie depictions of where we could be headed as a society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this novel for a literature class in high school and while I thought it very good, I didn't feel it was as powerful as other similar dystopian novels like 1984. Well, I still don't feel it is quite as good as 1984 (which I think is maybe the greatest SF novel written) but I have revised my opinion on Fahrenheit 451. It is exceptional. It is somewhat eerie to read about Montag and his wife Millie and realize they could represent in many ways the society we are now becoming, one further and further detached from people and things and, of course, books, and even memories. With all our innovations and technological discoveries, we seem to be lagging behind in literacy and when I read 451 this time, I could not help but identify the metaphor book burning took on for me, where we are slowly being almost totally reliant on computers for everything, including entertainment for hours on end and reading seems an almost quaint and charming relic of the past."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Truth be told, I read this book in my high school days and probably didn't appreciate it as much as I could have. I remember thinking it was an above average read, but I didn't have a strong appreciation for the novel's depth. Bradbury's message didn't strike me until I recently picked up the book again years later. Reading this novel again, I was wowed and amazed about the events I had missed with my first reading. The underlying message about the dangers of losing one's self amid conformity came ringing forth, and the idea of fire burning as a metaphor for burning away existence stuck with me. Bradbury's work became a profound experience for me.Set in a dystopic world, Montag works as a firefighter whose job it is to burn books, as they are held as dangerous materials. When Montag meets his neighbor, Clarisse McClellan, she wakes him up to the world he exists in by asking him a simple question: \\"Are you happy?\\" Montag, as if in a trance before, begins wondering why books are thought to be such a deterrent to society, why he should be burning instead of reading, and why society runs the way it does. He identifies an uncomfortable unhappy feeling, and takes steps to try to get to the bottom of the vast emptiness he has lived with. Beatty, Montag's boss, begins to identify the guilt Montag feels about his job, as Montag at one point feigns being sick, and tries to philosophize about why the world exists the way it does. Beatty's basic premise is that books make people think, and bring about all sorts of \\"nastiness\\": emotion, tears, feeling, rebellion, and power. He states that the world is better conforming to systematic enjoyment and collective thought because it is, in his words, less dangerous. Montag has a life-changing moment when their fire crew is called out to burn down a woman's house; the woman refuses to go, and is burned up along with her books, and Montag feels responsible for this. Montag befriends a man named Faber, an ex English professor who he remembered from a year earlier hiding a book while at a park. Where Clarisse wakes up Montag to his life, Faber is the key to Montag's full reawaking, and taking action towards his new ideas. Faber gives him the tools to know that there are people out there who believe in reading and thinking. Montag vows to never burn again. Beatty eventually suspects that Montag may be collecting books on the side, and eventually the call comes for Montag to burn his own house down. From here, Montag has a dilemma about whether to follow his boss' orders, or try to escape somehow. Without giving too much away, Montag is on the run as a fugitive as the chase is being broadcasted live as police attempt to hunt him down. From here, we are left to try to find out whether he will escape the police, and, if so, where he is heading.Fahrenheit 451 is one of those rare books that becomes more powerful and poignant as time goes on. As much as the story is about dystopia and the ills of censorship, it goes beyond this. It is also a book about the pitfalls of society devoid of conscientiousness, individuality, reason, or uniqueness. When we get to the point where we lose our voice or our ability to think, our existence becomes empty and meaningless. Perhaps even more startling or tragic is the notion that citizens may not even realize that society has become this way, or that THEY have become this way, as is the case for the main character, Montag, who happily burns away house after house, book after book, and lives a rather systematic life as a fireman, with a wife who is more machine than spouse, a product of the times.Some compare this book to 1984, and with just cause, as both depict the isolation caused when individuals have little to no control in thought or living. However, Fahrenheit 451 feels less dark and gloomy than 1984, and seems to have an optimistic outlook, so I find it a little more enjoyable.Fantastic book! One that has deserved every bit of praise it has received."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the middle of the last century, a number of authors wrote novels describing the de-evolution of out Western culture:-Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley-A Clockwork Orange&-The Wanting Seed, by Anthony Burgess-1984, by George Orwell...And Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury!Set in a \\"near-future\\" which has somewhat already materialzed in our own time, the Fire Department has long ceased to be an emergency service. They have become a secret-police force, whose primary purpose is to incinerate \\"illegal printed material\\". Why? Long before Thomas Paine distributed \\"Common Sense\\" and \\"The Rights of Man\\", or Martin Luther nailed his Theses to the cathedral door, the printed word has proved most unsettling to all thug-ocracies.Montag, a disillusioned fireman, who just can't stop thinking for himself, soon finds himself under suspicion for his own secret literary curiosity.The future described by Bradbury, is a time and place defined by LOUD, ALL PERVASIVE, BOMBASTIC commercialization, and a truly vapid, soulless, and superficial popular culture. Does that sound familiar?Printed material has been banned, (and burned) because it \\"disturbs\\" peoples minds.Montag, a sensistive and introspective sort, finds himself profoundly alienated in this society, failing to find authenticity even from his own wife. He can not help but question the role he plays as a fireman, and finds that he must find out for himself as to why the books he burns are so \\"dangerous\\".Look at the contemporary \\"popular culture\\".Observe all the conforming artificial fools about you.See the overt lack of free-thinking on any given college-campus, (institutions that once exemplified the concept).The loud, obnoxious, all-pervasive and overly-commercialized popular \\"culture\\" is ALREADY HERE. With so many empty-heads so easily distracted, the next step can very well be the willful incineration of all that \\"disturbing\\" literature out there.Be assured it didn't just \\"happen this way\\".Someone wants you to conform. Someone wants you to STOP THINKING.There may not be a \\"fire-brigade\\" acting as the tool of an oppressive police-state, or even public book-burning events. Maybe books will become \\"passe\\", because we have \\"computers\\", and \\"electronic media\\".However the printed word becomes \\"obsolete\\" (and there are people working very hard to bring this about), be assured that your very civilization is circling the drain. Be assured that someone want you to stop thinking.\\"Books are humanity in print\\"\\"Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science crippled, thought and speculation at a standstill.\\"-Barbara Tuchman"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Back in the year 1941, Mr. Bradbury started writing the story \\"The Fire Man\\": one nickel at a time in his local library basement. This story about burning books later transformed into what we know today as the classic Fahrenheit 451. This book is hailed as one of the best science fiction novels at the time, and is still very successful today.The book revolves around a character named Guy Montag, a fire fighter in an America where there is no order, or self control: Books that contemplate deep thought are outlawed and burned, with no sense of literature or compassion towards those who hang on to them; as the pages burn at a cozy 451 degrees. This America, maybe even this world focuses more on fake joy and illusion, than pressing world issues, such as the constant threat of nuclear war. In this world, or at least in this America; the citizens are rampant, and are brainwashed to think that they are happy, when in fact each and every one of them are just drones without a real queen. More people are killed in random car accidents than their last nuclear war, which America won. Guy, like almost everyone else in the nameless city, gives in the misapprehension of happiness until he meets someone. One day he meets Clarisse Mc Cellan, a young teenager who changes his perspective on his life, and life in general; from the smallest rain drop to whether he really loves Mildred or not. He begins to realize the sheer grievance of the world; from thinking putting new blood in a person is curing them, to thinking T.V families are your real families. (This is Mildred's problem until the very end). He at last questions his own occupation, which is probably the reason why his life is the way it is. He finally goes off the deep end and steals a book from a lady who burns her and her books before the firemen do. It is then revealed to Mildred (and the readers) that Montag has been keeping a stash of books hidden for a year, and has been trying to memorize them. Alas, the information always slips away; like \\"the sieve and the sand.\\" He then goes on a journey, both physically and mentally; as he must face himself, the Mechanical Hound, and even his own boss Captain. Beatty. He is very much Montag's opposite, and is the main antagonist.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who can create deep thought from reading a book. This book is action packed, epic, and is a striking realization on a path modern America might be heading for itself. The book itself is actually more relevant today than when it was first published in 1950. The fact is that the back story mentioned in the book on how America got this way is sounding more and more like our present. Basically, their past might be our definitive future. This book is classic for a reason, as the book is critically acclaimed by almost any person who reads it; of any demographic. The only real requirement is to be able to analyze the information in the book, as there are a few moments of symbolism in the book. Overall, I believe that there are a lot of bone- rattling moments that anyone with a brain should enjoy, but probably won't in the end. And for anyone who likes this book, I recommend The Martian Chronicles, and Dandelion Wine.\\" They are excellent examples of Bradbury's work. I also recommend The Last Book in the Universe; it is very similar to Fahrenheit 451 in plot. In all, I would give 5/5 to the classic that made us all think a little more.. --Christian C."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of those books I've read and reread throughout my life, and it has proven itself as a true work of genius in that it had something new to say to me at each stage of my life. In my youth, I was led to believe that \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was a novel about censorship - after all, the main characters are \\"firemen\\" who burn books. But with maturity, and a wider view of the world, I began to see the more potent message inside the book.In this supposedly futuristic world, society at large has been dumbed down gradually. Books have been reduced and summarized until readers can only stand brevity, then they are eliminated altogether. Special interests of all sorts have demanded censorship or destruction of anything deemed offensive. Advertising and marketing are everywhere. Mindless interactive entertainment consumes all available leisure time. Life is lived in a drugged stupor with a soundtrack delivered in a steady stream through earbuds. The threat of annihilation looms large, while most of the population carries on lives not worth living. Personal relationships are now so superficial that people regard television characters as their \\"family\\". Voices of dissent, when they appear, are silenced quickly.There's very little I can say about a classic novel that hasn't been said before. We may never see widespread elimination of books as Bradbury imagined, but it can't be denied that the views and attitudes that brought on the firemen are certainly part of our world.If you haven't read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", read it now. If you've read it before, read it again. Then come join the rest of us tramps by the railroad track, and be the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was forced to read Fahrenheit 451 as a high school sophomore and hated it. I thought it was boring and completely implausible and I wanted to burn it as soon as the unit was over (I didn't).Fast forward 10 years. For some reason I decided that I should go back and re-read all of the books I was forced to read in high school English classes. And maybe it was because I chose to read it instead of being forced to, or maybe it had more to do with age and a knowledge of the world that I didn't have back then, but I found myself completely entranced with this book.The storyline is believable, especially in the context of real world attempts to ban books for various reasons over the years. The characters are three dimensional and sympathetic. The pacing is perfect. The book is so gripping that before you know it you'll realize that you've read the entire novel in one sitting.Fahrenheit 451 is still technically classified as science fiction, a label that can be a turn off to those who think of Star Trek or Stargate when they see it. I personally would categorize it as a classic suspense novel, or as literature, rather than calling it sci-fi.If you read the book when you were very young, whether you liked it or didn't, I highly recommend re-reading it as an adult. You will learn as much about yourself and how your perspective has changed over the years as you will about the possible future that Bradbury presents.And if you've never read it at all, read it now. This is one of those books that should be a part of everyone's library."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is Ray Bradbury's 55-year-old futuristic masterpiece about a time when firemen burn books instead of extinguishing fires. (451F is the temperature at which book pages burn.) His fireman protagonist, Guy Montag, has suddenly changed allegiances and become interested in preserving books rather than destroying them. The book is supposedly about censorship, but to me it seemed to be more about apathy. The book burning started after everyone had stopped reading anyway, and the liberal arts schools had mostly disappeared. Montag's professor friend Faber lists the three things that books provide: texture, leisure to absorb the information, and our response to what they teach us. The texture is the fabric of life that books describe, and the more densely woven the fabric, the better the quality of the book. Bradbury's writing style is not very fluid, but his take on the future is noteworthy at times. Not all of his predictions have come to pass, but the bug that Faber puts in Montag's ear made me think of people wearing their cell phones today. Also, the author mentions that the television is used as a babysitter, and he was spot-on about that. However, we don't have vicious mechanical hounds, at least not that I know of, nor do we all live in fireproof houses, unfortunately."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"There is a reason that Fahrenheit 451 is considered a classic.. it is one of those books that we can identify with during any era we have lived in, and our current era is no different. Less and less people are reading \\"real\\" books and more and more people reading and giving credence to trash magazines and internet blogs.I always felt that F451 and 1984 were set if not in the same universe, then maybe universes right next door to each other for they tell similar yet both separately important stories. This book is a cautionary read on society gone wrong, and is one I consider a must read for any reader."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Deep inside each of us is a Montag, a burner of books, a fireman who destroys rather than saves. And this is what makes Fahrenheit 451 the masterpiece that it is: it gets at the root of censorship, at its ultimate cause, at the fear of ideas that all of us must struggle with at one point or another. In our current age of political correctness from all ends (and sometimes the middle also), Bradbury's warning rings louder than ever: it is not books that we fear but what is inside of them, the fear that by reading something new we might find our precious ideas about life challenged. And rather than engage the ideas that make us uncomfortable, we try to isolate them, condemn them, and then destroy them.What struck me most about Fahrenheit 451 was how closely Bradbury's vision matches our current world, particularly in the west. Like Mildred, we are all too willing to lose ourselves in fantasy soap-opera worlds, finding ourselves more interested in the next American Idol than in the neighbor across the street. And here is Bradbury's real coup: it is not any particular idea that the government and we ourselves fear, but the very idea of ideas themselves. Montag and his fellow firemen are not discriminatory: they burn anything, because their employers know that whatever makes you think, whatever makes you question your shallow, empty life, whether it is pornography or Shakespeare or the Bible, is a danger to those who use ignorance to gain and hold power.Think about that the next time you get the urge to light the kerosene and destroy an idea."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"We all hold some novels so close to our hearts that we cannot view them dispassionately. For me, one such treasure is Fahrenheit 451. This is the novel that first awakened me to the possibility that science fiction could be about more than just action heroes, quick thrills and mindless drivel: that at its best, it honours a unique literary duty, allowing us to glimpse horrific futures that may actually come to pass if we leave the path of wisdom.Fahrenheit 451 is one of the finest examples of that sub genre of science fiction called dystopian fiction. Every science fiction writer of note has drawn from this well, but few as successfully as Bradbury. The only other authors to realise equal successes are Orwell with 1984 and Huxley with Brave New World. Some would add Gibson and Dick, but theirs are derivative works of a later generation. Of all such works, Bradbury&#65533;s is the most accessible. At his centre, Bradbury is an optimist while the others are not. Consequently, Fahrenheit 451 holds out the light of hope when the others leave us despairing.This book operates on countless levels. It can be read as a futuristic fable, a psychological drama, or a social commentary. It is a rich character study; a pounding plot-driven quest; an overwhelming thematic work, or a setting of sterile horror. In actuality, it is all of this and more. Rarely does one happen upon a work in which the parts fit together so exquisitely, and for this reason alone, it deserves its reputation as one of the greatest works in the genre.But it is the characters that make this book come alive. When the protagonist experiences the emptiness of a hollow life, the anguish of guilt, the glimmerings of a real love, the terror of blind panic or the despair of pursuit, it is as if these things are happening to us. Bradbury&#65533;s skill transforms science fiction into literature.This is not a book for juvenile minds. While it is written in tight, almost Spartan prose, and reads like a children&#65533;s novel, it is actually a highly philosophical work. In some ways palpable, but in more ways subtle, it focuses an unflinching light on those ugly aspects of our nature that impel us towards superficiality and mental sloth. It is no wonder that shallow readers and idle thinkers find this book unrewarding and depressing; even vaguely insulting. More thoughtful readers will be disturbed, but that will only be to Bradbury&#65533;s purpose.This work is really written for brave thinkers - those willing to confront unpleasantness and sweat for their rewards. Such readers, no matter what their age, will fall in love with this book. Bradbury exposes the failings of our natures with a perception and a depth of wisdom that few science fiction authors can reach. Most of all, his love for humanity shines through the darkness of his cautionary tale: and he has the literary courage to warn us against ourselves without the addition of artificial sweetener."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I enjoyed the book through-and through. I haven't read since high school and found the second time refreshing. Montag, the questionable fireman, discovers truth in the cave of reality while wife, Mildred, stares at walls of fiction. Beatty, the fireman, villified a brainless modern world with hopeless, while Clarisse fantasized about the future of tommorrow. Each character's desperate nature compelled me to read further. One taught who shouldn't, one inspired who knew better, one conspired who should have loved, one deceived who kinked the hose of knowedge, and one questioned everything who never did before.Bradbury's novel is one many can relate to in the modern world. His dystopian is filled with brillant biblical and philosophical allusions. His words are more poetry than prose. Like many of his novels he questions the heart and mind of the future in a world of new conveniences and conflicts.Bradbury's flaws are few. But like many books in the bible, with prophetic damnation there is also a promise. There is a glimpse of a new hope, but there is no second to this lonely motion. I would like him to push the plot onward. The baptism of Montag is just the end of an old life, but it's also the beginning of a new one.As I read Ray Bradbury's art work, I see a need for free thinkers, individuals who challenge daily. Many of the writers decorated in the text show this will to propell the individual past the barriers of social appropriateness. This is something I have always admired about his writing and will continue to."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a futuristic parable that warns of the bleakness of a society in which political correctness has gone awry. The firemen in the story burn books (and the houses in which they are found) in an effort to save mankind from being offended by their contents. There are a couple of gripping passages in the middle of the story, amidst intense action sequences, in which the firemen's philosophy is expounded, and a history is given to explain the madness. In the words of the fire marshal (Beatty), &quot;Colored people don't like Little Black Sambo. Burn it. White people don't feel good about Uncle Tom's Cabin. Burn it. Someone's written a book on tobacco and cancer of the lungs? The cigarette people are weeping? Burn the book.&quot; And so on.The main character (and fireman) Montag evolves from someone who merely observes with a curious detachment the odd book-loving maverick around him, to an active participant in a quest to salvage what little is left by way of the written word. He is inspired by a little girl and an old man, both unconventional thinkers, and along the way, Montag's disdain grows for his conformist wife. [Curiously, and most prophetically, Montag's wife's love of interactive television (or its futuristic analog) ends up stripping her of any individuality or character, and causes Montag to tire of her more quickly.]A great read, all in all, with credible characters, creative and thought-provoking settings and devices (including a mechanical &quot;hound&quot; working for the fire department that tracks prey according to its hormonal makeup (or &quot;odor index&quot;), and dispatches it with a poison syringe), and a caustic tone that spares no one (the media, the government, religion, etc.). The story is totally conceivable, too (even today, despite its completion in 1953), which serves to scare the reader more than the most fantastic piece of fiction ever could. My edition had a riveting Afterward by Bradbury as well, circa 1979, in which the author inveighed against censorship and those who see fit to censor. In the author's own words, &quot;There is more than one way to burn a book.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Imagine a place where fire alarms alert firemen of where books are being held, and the firemen start fires that destroy those books along with the house and sometimes the people living inside of it. It is a time of censorship against all books. Guy Montag is one of the firemen, but a few people have helped him realize that what he is doing is wrong. But with this knowledge comes the betrayal of his wife and co-workers. Guy must escape the world in which reading is illegal.This book offers a fascinating glimpse at what the world, or at least the country, may become if books continue to be censored. Bradbury keeps the reader interested by citing books that many of us have read, including the Bible. And his topic of censorship still rings true, possibly more so than when it was written, due to the growing list of books censored from libraries and school curriculums. I recommend this book to anyone who recognizes the power of books and what society would be without them, but also to those who don't realize the power. Overall a wonderful book, written in a way that spans lifetimes."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As much a clich&eacute; as it is to say, I think this book is even more relevant today then when originally written. I think Montag's wife's obsession with the &quot;real people&quot; she watches is such an uncanny parallel to the reality based shows that are so popular now that it's almost creepy. The fact that it was written so long ago only adds to the impact. There is also the similarity of the viewing walls and the 56 inch high definition T.V.s of today. It's a little like a horoscope though, the reader can read more into it then is there. Ray Bradbury's past future is dreary and bleak and no one cares for anyone else. I tend to be more of an optimist, I think there are still enough people in the world that care to prevent the kind of events that happen in this book to occur any time in the near future.I don't believe the main focus of this book (as most people think) is censorship at all but rather a love letter to books and the joy of reading. Mr Bradbury writes about the joys of reading as though he were describing a flesh and blood lover. He clearly despises censorship and complacency but he gives more of his passion to the love of the written word. I think the &quot;not happy, but hopeful&quot; ending shows his faith in man.This is literally a classic piece of fiction and it's impressive how much Ray Bradbury says in such a short novel. It's easy to read on several different levels. There's almost no excuse not to read this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman who's job requires him to efficiently burn books when a call enters the station. In the future, the government, in control of millions of people, decides to make reading books against the law, fearing that a literate society would destroy itself.Guy, through the vision of a young girl and an old English professor, discovers his own wonderment of his surroundings, triggered through great ideas found in books. Discovering this universal wonderment lies at the foundation of the author's main theme, highlighted brilliantly through his distorted and domineering society.With this futuristic society and a distortion of trends found in today's culture, Bradbury captures his reader's attention and makes them open their eyes, hearts, and mind to the true importance of independent intellectual enhancement through reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a profound book indeed, and I don't know how I can hope to do it justice. I think in many ways, Ray Bradbury is after us to think about happiness, and when we are better off being unhappy. This comes up several times -- the twisted, tragically fallen Fire Captain Beatty calls his firemen &quot;The Happiness Boys&quot; because they make melancholy and thoughtfulness more difficult, by burning literature. Later, when the hero -- Montag, the book-burning fireman who begins to question his job -- confronts his wife's friends, he tries as hard as possible to make them UNhappy about their boring lives, in the hope that it will wake them up to the world around them... The very first sentence of the book states &quot;It was a pleasure to burn&quot;, referring to Montag before he begins to wake up, and become an unhappy, sympathetic human being... Bradbury is getting at some important things here, such as how we can be most peaceful inside when we are questioning, when we are not happy. Older readers might want to think about reading John Milton's &quot;L'Allegro&quot; and &quot;Il Penseroso&quot; to flesh out their own personal response to this book. I think younger readers, who could be reading this for school, might be interested in renting the movie &quot;Logan's Run&quot;. Both stories are about future societies, where order and happiness are maintained by weeding out anyone who seems capable of independent thought. In this story, that means burning all books. In &quot;Logan's Run&quot;, it means simply killing anyone who starts to get too old, who might start to have a little perspective. In both stories, the main character is a member of the elite, with a personal, professional stake in maintaining order, who suddenly begins to question the whole system, and ends up siding with his &quot;enemies&quot;, the thoughtful people. At any rate, this is really quite a tremendous book, and I hope a lot of people read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this story in 7th grade, and since then I have never been able to forget the amazing tale of Guy Montag and his job as a fireman. I will never forget the magic of Clarisse, who to this date is my favorite book character of all time. I loved this book immediately when I started reading it and I never put it down until I was finished.Guy Montag is a fireman. But it's not the kind of fireman that you and I know today. These firemen burn things. Books to be specific. It is said that books are not needed for the future, and are officially illegal. So when it is found out that people are in possession of books, the firemen come to the house or whatever hiding place, and burn the books, and sometimes also burn the house. Guy Montag meets a girl named Clarisse one night as he's walking home, and with that one conversation, his life makes a complete turn in his life, soon sheltering books in his own home.The story of Fahrenheit 451 is nothing but amazing. This book is unlike anything I have ever read, and to this date, is one of my favorite books of all time. Some people say that this book is &quot;dumb&quot; and &quot;wish it would burn&quot; but these people don't understand the mentality of the book. You need to read into it and understand it fully before you go bashing it.The book Fahrenheit 451 even reflects some of our ignorance today, seeing as most of my friends hate reading. If only more people could get into this book. I would recommend Fahrenheit 451 to anyone I knew, even those friends who don't like reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature at which book paper catches fire and burns. If you have not read this book, now a cult classic, you wouldn't know that fact. Nor would you know that in Ray Bradbury's world of the future people don't say anything because they don't know anything. And they don't know anything because they don't have books. At first books were leveled down to a sort of pastepudding norm by cuts that made them shorter, producing condensations and digests. Classics were cut to fill a two-column single page, winding up at last as a ten-line summary. Then books were outlawed. Discipline relaxes. History becomes neglected. English is dropped. Life becomes immediate. Why learn anything save pressing buttons, pulling switches, fitting nuts and bolts? The amazing thing is that Bradbury predicted that censorship would start with the minorities objecting to the way they were depicted. Blacks, Baptists, Dog Lovers etc. waanted strict enforcement of anti-book laws and the burning of all books followed. Someone has written a book on tobacco and lung cancer? The cigarette people are weeping? Burn the book. The smokers are distressed? Burn the book. A book, any book creates problems. You don't have to face those problems. Just burn the book. The point is obvious. The world is full of people running about with lit matches. Every minority feels it has the will, the right, the duty, to douse the kerosene, like Montag, the protagonist of this novel, and light the fuse. But you know there are more ways than burning to destroy a book. Every dimwit editor could slenderize, starve, bluepencil, leech, and bleed white any book and make any author sound like Edgar Guest. Frightening in its implications, 451, this insane world, which bears many alarming reseemblances to our own, is required reading for all lovers of books. Incidentally, the proof that Bradbury's esthetic vision was not far off the mark was that he discovered, years after 451 was published, that cubby-hole editors at Ballantine, fearful of contaminating the young, had, bit by bit, censored some 75 separate sections from the novel. Alert students reading those editions told the author about this exquisite irony. The original story is now available thanks to Judy Lynn Del Rey."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I have read it twice now, and everytime I read it, I enjoy it more and more. This book was about one person and the changes he went through. Guy Montag was a firemen, who burned books for a living. Then he is enlightened to read a book, and is helped by Professor Faber. At the end, Montag is a rebel. He runs away and becomes I leader of other rebels to bring reading to the world they left. This book show how the technology is taking over and not even using books for education. I think it is a book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's the temperature at which paper burns said the first page of the book and I knew it having read it earlier, and yet I chose this book to be re-read. It has only instilled my faith further in the power of words and what can they do. Writers such as Bradbury and Orwell who have written on the totalitarian society and how a group of people stand and fight it, may be somewhere at some point done the same and that is what which amazes me.I first read this novella (190 pages and yes I am aware that the technical definition would not allow it to be classified it as a novella, however I chose to call it that) when I was 16 and was enthralled by it. Guy Montag's transformation from a fireman who burns books and takes pleasure in it to the one who savors the written word and wants to save books and thereby his soul is brilliant. Bradbury did not dream the future when he wrote Fahrenheit 451, the future actually was here. Right now. Look around you. Aren't we burning books by banning them anyway? I am sure in certain parts of the world people are not at liberty to read (Afghanistan being one such place). I wonder how my life would be if someone were to barge in my house and burn down my books. I would either kill myself or the person in the bargain. It would be the latter in all probability.What I loved about the book this time, is that I understood the layers involved, which I hadn't earlier. It is not only about book censorship, it is about censorship period. The part in the book when Guy is raving mad at a bunch of women who think nothing beyond their husbands and \\"families\\" who can now be viewed on huge TV Screens and how he reads poetry to them and one of the women starts crying. I would like to believe that the tears were for a lost tradition amongst them. That of reading. The joy of thinking. The freedom to speak without editing a word.I can say one thing though - Books can never be extinct. Try as you might. Try hard if you will. Just try."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"[This review is for the paperback \\"50th Anniversary Edition\\" of the novel, which contains special additional essays and an interview which enrich the experience of reading the novel.]I'm not going to recount the plot details since this book should be a part of every book lover's lexicon. (If you have been off of the planet for the past half-century or so, this is a parable, set in the not-too-distant future, about book-burning. But the novel is really about what makes a person an individual. It postulates what people might be willing to give up in order to have \\"peace of mind,\\" and poses material enough for hours of stimulating debate about the real value of independent thought and its importance to society.)This review is simply a friendly nudge for those of you out there who have already read this book once, perhaps when you were quite young, and have not re-visited it. I urge you to do so as soon as possible.I just re-read this incredible novel for the first time in thirty years. I picked it up because my teenage daughter is reading it as an assignment for an English class. I read it in high school, too, and I recall that I enjoyed it. But for some reason I had never re-read it. Bad move on my part. I got so much more out of the book now that I am older and have been in the world for awhile. The novel has aged beautifully. Actually, its insights, in light of our computer age and the changes which are being wrought in publishing and in the education of our children, are astoundingly relevant. This is a novel so current in its political and social re-imaginings that it could have been published last year.I love Bradbury's books. He is a master story teller. HisThe Illustrated Mansits on my nightstand bookshelf right beside a copy of Ring Lardner's short stories,Ring Around the Bases: The Complete Baseball Stories of Ring Lardnerand a copy of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short storys,The Short Stories of F. Scott Fitzgerald-- just in case I need to re-read a wonderful short story or two before sleep comes.But as I said, I had not re-read this particular book in a long time. Not only did this futuristic masterpiece affect me completely differently when I read it again after such a long lapse of time, but I found so many nuances in the book which are just not present in the movieFahrenheit 451(wonderful as the movie is.) I had forgotten how mesmerizing Bradbury's prose is. I had also forgotten that this novel won the National Book Award. It's a treasure, and a novel to be savored periodically throughout one's life.I especially like this edition which mentions on the cover that it was released as the \\"50th Anniversary Edition.\\" Not only does it contain Bradbury's 1979 Coda and 1983 Afterword, but there is an illuminating interview with the author where he discusses his own views about how the book has held up to the passing of the years, his approach to writing in general, how he views the \\"future\\" we are now living which he imagined in the early 1950s, and even what he considers the weaknesses of the movie version of his book.This is great American literature. Please re-read early and often."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the book Fahrenheit 451 author Ray Bradbury shows his wisdom and our faults through a character called Guy Montag. The story takes place in the near future and shows a world where history is an unknown blur and books are a contraband that must be burned. The people in charge of burning these so-called \\"contraband items\\" are non other than the worlds firefighters. And of course, one of those brave book burners is Guy Montag.Guy has lived his entire life without questioning it, but all of that changes when Guy meets Clarisse McClean. Clarisse is pretty, young, and very curious. Guy has never met such a girl before. A girl that focuses on love, friendship, and the contents of books, the same books that Guy burns. Guy tries to ignore her but cannot, and when Clarisse dies in an automobile accident, he is left on his own, with his wife and his colleagues being very close-minded.One day on the job Guy is called in to an old grandma's house where she has been keeping books, illegally. Guy tries to convince the lady to get out of the house, before she burns down with it, but she refuses. Before Guy burns down the house he steals a book. Guy is aware that it is illegal but he cannot resist. Guy is determined to read that book. So, he tracks down his old English professor, Faber, who agrees to teach Guy how to read. What will happen to guy? Will he get arrested for holding contraband? Will he get burned? Will he die? Read the book to find out.This book is probably one of the best books I have ever read. It got me questioning my own life. And I started thinking; maybe this really could be the future. The phrase \\"curiosity killed the cat\\" takes on a whole new meaning in this book. It's great for people of all ages and any gender."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I won't quibble with the social importance of \\"Farenheit 451,\\" but I do think the book has limited value as literature. Quite simply, it's well-written only in parts. Some parts are almost laughably weak, in a literary sense.The book gives us a frightening vision of America about 500 years in the future. An unseen, unnamed, unaccountable government has extraordinary control over citizens' lives, and the government perpetuates its power by dulling people's ability to think, remember, and feel. Medical advances don't reduce suffering -- they dull our senses. People are drugged and then saved from their drug overdoses. Similarly, media is used to dull minds, rather than to enlighten. The urban environment where most people live is fast, violent, and dark; and most people have no contact with the natural world. It's our America, extended to extremes.Guy Montag, the main character of Farenheit, is a fireman: this means that he sets fire to books, because books have been banned. He's in an emotionless marriage, and his wife can't even remember when they met. When Montag has second thoughts about what he's doing and about his society, his wife and his boss fight him, and a crisis quickly emerges. Montag must flee in order to survive, and he joins other outcasts in the woods.These are powerful ideas. The problem is with the execution, in some parts. The book starts slowly, and the language of the first 20-30 pages probably tempts many people to put down the book. By the second section, the imagery improves, and the repetition of some themes (books as butterflies, the screaming entertainment walls, black beetles) starts to be powerful. But then, the chase scene in the third section and the meeting with outcasts are both rendered in pretty stiff language. I guess the best that can be said is that the author exercises restraint in his language.My other complaint arises from a few logical gaps. For example, if the government truly has the awesome technology it seems to possess, how could outcasts live in the woods that are just a few miles outside of town? Why would there be woods and farms a few miles outside of town in the first place? Also, what's the meaning of Beatty's ability to quote literature, apparently with gusto: Does he love literature and represent one way to fight against the oppressive society, or is he the fireman chief he seems to be on the surface?In sum, \\"Farenheit 451\\" is an important book. More than 40 years ago, it put into concise form the fears that many people had about the way modern society was heading. It created memorable images of book burnings and mindless, mechanical violence. But the language itself is rarely as evocative as the ideas it relates."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have known aboutFahrenheit 451for many years, but never picked it up until recently when my daughter brought it home from the school library. She hadn't enjoyed it too much, she said, but some of her friends had. Bradbury, along with Isaac Asimov and a couple of other authors, is an icon of 20th century American science fiction, and this novel offers an excellent display of his prowess. The version I read, published by Ballantine Books, contains an interesting Afterword written by the author in 1982 (the book itself was written in 1953 at a UCLA typing room on typewriters 'which rented out at a dime a half hour'). In it, Bradbury describes the book's c. 1980 adaptation to the stage, in which he further developed certain key characters, namely Clarisse, the mysterious young girl who opens the main character's eyes, and Captain Beatty, the ironically well-read fire chief who is in charge of book burning. Bradbury also mentions changes added by Francois Truffaut, the Director of the film version (seeFahrenheit 451for the DVD). Appropriately enough for a book about an extreme form of censorship, Bradbury notes that he has avoided the temptation to censor his own young self by bringing some of these additions into a revised version of the novel: \\"I don't believe in tampering with any young writer's material, especially when that young writer was once myself.\\" A wise decision, judging from the excellence of the original product."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Through each page, this book carried with it amazing perspectives that transcend time and generations. In terms of the story independent of everything else, it was not very compelling. However, as a piece of literature trying to paint a vision of what happens when communication is no longer valued either verbally or through the pen, it is a classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book blows my mind. It says so many things that I've been believing for years (and that's before I read it) about human nature: the tendency of the masses to follow and do what they're told; how easily humans waste their capacity for critical thinking; the difference between pleasure and true joy; the true meaning of freedom. Many people don't search for a deeper meaning to life than what tradition gives them, and that's okay; it's their choice. But when those people assume that everyone is that way, and they start restricting people's freedom because they think it will make everyone happy - well, that's when you get Fahrenheit 451. The character of Millie, especially, strikes me with her utter devotion to meaningless trivialities. We all know a Millie, or two or three. And this book is the story of how Montag discovers he really isn't like Millie at all, even though he thought he was, and how he fights the law and becomes a renegade, just to discover who he really is."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If ever there is a formula for the perfect novel, 451 has the ingredients. It would be one part science fiction masked in a glaze of poetic impulse, settled on a bed of classic literature soaking up the juices of vast philosophical thought. The burning of books is a horror to any who love the written word and our freedom to dream. It would be our worst nightmare for society to regress to a state of anti-intellectualism so staunch that ideas themselves have become the enemy. Ray Bradbury not only captures our fears in this post nuclear world but also touches upon our often forgotten love for the stories that have captured our hearts. This is a must read for anyone who has ever loved a book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"By my count, this'll be the 1,218th review for this book on amazon, so what could I possibly say that the other 1,217 haven't?But for those few who dare dig this deep to read: I loved the book. I've read numerous novels and thrillers for fun, and also dabbled in more serious, non-fiction as well (check my profile if you want), but this one book managed to bridge the two meta-genres. In Ray Bradbury's comments he mentions that he wrote the book on typewriters that charged a dime per hour in a university library, driven there by the distractions of two young daughters in his house; as a result (imho) the work comes fast and furious and makes no apologies for failing to artistically create a subtle and symbolic background.The characters are few and the scenes sparse but it is a book that almost says as much in what is left out as what is included. It is also a book that fully describes (even immerses) the reader in this distopian future which only slowly comes to mirror our own. The commentary, like many of the characters, is never explicit, left to the reader to draw their own conclusions. Rather than the spoonfeeding of Animal Farm or even 1984, true motivations and causes are hidden and the reader's own perception of civilization can guide them."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I don't want to think how many years ago I first read Fahrenheit 451, but it must've been around the same time (1966) that Truffault came out with his horrible cinematic version of the novel. I know this because I remember being unimpressed with both versions (although the movie may've soured me on the book).Re-reading the novel now, I still don't think that it ranks up there with, say, Huxley's Brave New World. But it is an astoundingly prescient vision of the sort of society in which we live: one in which cultural memory and tradition is increasingly replaced by immediate kitsch, in which media is entertainment, reading is a dying practice, immediate gratification the norm, jadedness a perennial hazard, and never-ending war a reality. Social commentators such as Morris Berman and Susan Jacoby have argued for a kind of secular monkdom to try to preserve and pass on the tradition that's quickly sinking beneath the new dark age that's descending, and this isn't at all unlike the anonymous book-memorizing preservers in Fahrenheit 451's moribund society.What does it mean when a culture loses its depth, its memory, its lineage? What does it mean when an entire society is unable, as the character Granger recommends to Montag, to \\"stuff [its] eyes with wonder, live as if you'd drop dead in ten seconds\\" (p. 140) because it's far too occupied with commerce and kitsch? Bradbury's dystopia invites us to ask ourselves these sorts of questions. We ignore them at our peril."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Imagine what tomorrow will be like without books, a time when books are condidered extremely malevolent and a time when firemen's jobs are not to put down fire but to start fire. This is what Montag, our main character does.This book tells of Montag's gradual realization of the superficialness around him and encounters the very taboo that he was told to destroy. Montag soon realizes that books were not only not evil, but a precious thing that needed to be saved. We see Montag's progression in this book, from the girl he met on the street, who said that she was \\"tasting the rain\\" to his wife, whose only interests were watching TV and hangs out with other friends of hers. Montag came to conflict with his society as he finally rejects it altogether. Eventually he did something that no one would think of. And that something may just be the path to save knowledge."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a classic. I first read it over 30 years ago and the issues raised are just as pertinent today as they were then.The book was first published in the early 1950s, at a time when censorship and control were also topical issues. The world depicted by Bradbury is, to some extent, a reality for some. Not necessarily because of technology but because once people stop thinking, questioning and creating they have surrendered at least some sense of self.On one level, this book can be read as 'straight' science fiction. On another level, it can be read as social commentary.You decide.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury, one of the most celebrated authors of all time, paints a very frightening and vivid picture of what life would be like if we were not allowed to read books. In this futuristic society, firemen do not put out fires - they start them.Fahrenheit 451 has survived the test of time. Although written in 1953 about an advanced society that is threatened by the imagination and the knowledge that can be gained from reading, decades later this book still parallels some of the struggles that we must face in society every day. Fahrenheit 451 is a classic tale of censorship and the harm that it can cause when man is forced to take on his own battle between knowledge and ignorance.Guy Montag has been a fireman for 10 years and considers himself to be relatively happy with his career and the way he has chosen to live his life. He has never questioned the ritual burning of books, the constant television watching or the rules set by government and society.This all changes when Montag meets Clarisse - a 17-year-old girl who is fascinated with books and the sacred art of reading. She tells Montag of a time when books were not burned, and firemen were hired to save homes and lives from fire - not to start the fire themselves. Even though Montag knows that reading is illegal, he cannot help but be drawn to the passion that books bring to the people that read them secretly.After Clarisse mysteriously disappears, Montag takes a deep look at himself. He begins to question his actions, society and happiness. Struggling with following his own morals yet still obeying the laws, Montag finds himself caught in a web of confusion. His descent from society begins with hiding books in his home, but before long he is running away with a group of outlaws that have made it their mission to memorize books in order to prevent future generations from missing out on knowledge and the stories of mankind's journeys through time.Fahrenheit 451 is a must-read book - definitely one of the best Bradbury books that you will ever get your hands on. This tale of irony, censorship and societal constraints will follow generations for years to come until one day they too are faced with challenges not much different than this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Farenheit 451 (the temperature at which paper burns, says the prologue), Guy Montag is a \\"fireman\\" whose job it is to burn books, and any building and/or people associated with the crime. After an old woman commits suicide by lighting her own house on fire instead of escaping and allowing her books to burn, Montag has a crisis of faith. He's always believed in the rightness of his cause, but now is not so sure. So he pockets a few books and takes them home. He tries to read poetry to his wife, to disasterous effect. Montag has to make a choice - the life he knew or a life (possibly very short) of scholarship where books supply the grist for the intellect.Although the story is putatively about book-burning, censorship, and propoganda, that is just the surface story. Bradbury paints an eerily prophetic picture of a land so in love with its own happines (and leisure) that no one wants to rock the boat. Deceased relative are not grieved. Whatever grief is present is drowned out by the cacophany of ever-present televisions, advertisements, and catchy tunes. Keep the plebes disctracted and they'll let you get away with anything! There is also some wicked social commentary on the lack of accountability in society, which is even more apparent today than when the book was written.Often, when one finally gets around to reading a modern classic like Farenheit 451, one is dissappointed. Not so with this book - the action is exciting, the resolution is satisfying (if dystopic), and the philosophical debates between the characters is interesting. At less than 250 pages, it is a quick read, but this is one classic that every science fiction fan will enjoy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is about a fireman named Guy Montag. In his world, firemen started fires to burn books-as both their job and for their own pleasure. He lived what he thought was a picture-perfect life, and never questioned why they burned books or the way society was. When he met a seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, his life changed forever. After she mysteriously disappears, Guy sought the assistance of an old professor named Faber, who helped him examine the past, and what their society has become in the present. He began to question society and the censorship of ideas that surrounded the world that he lived in. Guy had to decide what he needed to do to change all of it.When I originally began reading this book, I found it confusing and a little hard to follow because of its futuristic setting and characters. However, as I got farther into the book, it became easier to understand the story line and the plot. Even though he wrote it in 1953, Ray Bradbury makes outstanding points in his book about the messages that society and the media sends to us even today. No matter how convincing they may be, it is only the truth that matters. This book opened my eyes to many questions about the way we live today, and how we can move to modify the \\"Ignorance is bliss\\" idea in which many people live today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an innovative and awesomely prescient look at the \`future,' which is for us now the past. As I read it, I could draw quite a few similarities between Montag's desensitized and ignorant society and our own, or at least the direction ours seems to be heading. As in Montag's world, we seek convenience above all things rather than overcoming our obstacles and learning from our mistakes. I would go so far as to say that today; literature is slowly dying out just as newspaper journalism is, because there are more convenient ways to get our entertainment and news. However, such practices bring us closer and closer to a world where citizens are merely cattle as long as they are entertained, like in Fahrenheit 451. I also thoroughly enjoy Bradbury's writing style, how he conveys Montag's loneliness as he is realizing the plight of humanity and cannot tell his wife, indeed he doesn't even know if he loves his wife, he can't remember where they met. Montag changes from complete bliss in ignorance, to a willingness to give everything to enlighten the rest of the people, as he was. Bradbury is not flowery with his descriptions, but I think he gets the feeling across which is the most important thing since no matter what the description, we are the ones forming the mental picture. The issue of censorship is addressed on an extreme scale by this book, but still one cannot help drawing comparisons to now, and how easily it is to see it progressing from here to there. This book is a classic, and unlike some with such lofty titles, it is most definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Having met and seen Mr. Bradbury speak in person in the very location where he wrote this book out on type-writer, the Powell Library at UCLA, I have tremendous respect and admiration for the message this novel conveys. Serving as a warning to the intellectual and knowledge seekers, Guy Montage's search for information and logic is heroic considering the political repression present in his society. One of the pre-eminent beacons promoting freedom of speach and the free exchange of information, this novel continues to serve as a guideline and reminder of the importance of the open exchange of ideas. In a society where many governments and religious regimes seek to curtail information flow, this is a message of the necessary pro-activeness and vigilance necessary to preserve the Alexandria library of modern civilization, the printed word."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The reason that Fahrenheit 451 is such a great book can be a hard one to pin down, though the fact that it is goes without question.It is the story of a fireman, Guy Montag, who faces a crisis when he begins to question his whole way of life after a chance encounter with a young woman on his street. After this first, casual meeting, he begins to re-examine his relationship with his wife in contrast to the familiar, warm relationship that the girl has with her family- instead of this loving type of exchange, Guy finds that his closest relation, his wife, spends all day with the three-walled 'family' that barks constantly at her from a script, but that never bothers to actually say anything. From these estranged roots, Guy turns to look at the thing that he is destroying and that he has been taught to hate- books. This curiosity gets him into trouble quickly, forcing him out of the life that he knows and into one of panic, flight, and eventual banishment...though even this is a blessing in disguise.The novel works from the basis of a phenomenon that has occurred in literature in recent years- that of the utopia gone bad, something that Thomas Moore never could have imagined. In this growing canon of literature you will find such venerable titles as '1984', 'We', 'Anthem', and 'Brave New World'...what separates 451 from these is it's focus on the specific problem of entertainment as a venue to the masses. What happens when the government controls our books, our television, our inputs? What happens when we close our minds off to literature because it is going to offend someone, somewhere? What happens when we become so PC that we burn 'The Merchant of Venice' because it might offend Jews, 'Roots' because it might make whites look bad, and 'Huckleberry Finn' because it might make blacks uncomfortable?Bradbury attempts to answer this question, albeit indirectly- true, no one can be offended if these things are removed, but neither can anyone learn and grow. Life, civilization, everything- it all becomes stagnant, sliding slowly away to meaningless interactions that amount to nothing. Bradbury does not tell us that our point is to go around offending but rather that in order to function, we must push one another. Life, love, happiness...none of these happen without passion, fire, intensity...all of those emotions which flow might step on someone's toes, true, but they are necessary to be human.The novel tackles this with an unforgiving brutal bent to those who would censor and suppress anything that might make a person think. Captain Beatty is the epitome of the problem, though even in his final thoughts he seems to be full of a sort of self-loathing. This character, along with several others, leads the reader to examine the different sides of the issue at hand, trying to discern which approach is most appropriate.In doing this Bradbury achieves what the intent of the novel is- to make us think about and examine our own views on what art (specifically literature, but it can be generalized) is and what place it has in society. Should it be censored? Should it be controlled (as in Plato's \`Republic')?The fact that the novel encourages these questions in such a short span (a little over 100 pages) is a testament to Ray Bradbury's brilliance as a novelist...it is also the reason that you, the potential reader, should make sure to pick up a copy and tear through it (it can be finished in a single day, easily). By doing so, you will be facing what are still very relevant problems in our modern day and time.Bottom line: this book is considered a modern classic for good reason. It has all the elements- ideas, execution, style, substance- and should not be missed.-LP"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's best; A non-stop look at the supreme ignorance that comes with totalitarian regimes. A dystopia like BNW and 1984, this dystopia is littered with awesome similes, startling paralles, and absurd contradictions such as firemen who light fires, instead of putting them out. Whether your of Liberal mentality (Michael Moore took his bush-bashing doc title from this book.) Or if your of a Conservative mentality, (this book gives a great account of what true conservatism is all about.) The story is prophetic, and will manifest itself in America now or later. Just like G.Orwell's Big Brother has now manifested itself through the Patriot Act. This book is a must read, and if you don't like it, well, you can always burn it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book definitely has great ideas to revolve around, and ever since I've heard about the burning of books, I thought it was worthy of reading and I placed some expectations that were all met. I wanted it to be exciting, and it definitely was. I also found this book to have less boring scenes (there are boring scences to every book, and we can't deny that) than many other great books - this book is short, but it is to the point, which is one of the many reasons to love this book. While \\"1984\\" by George Orwell is a great book, it took more than a hundred pages to set up, which I found to be a drag.I cannot say what the biggest strength in the novel is - there are lots of strengths. I like how the author doesn't mention what city they are in; that way, everyone can relate to it a little more. He doesn't set it in Los Angeles or New York (though for all we know, it could be), because he wants to imply that every place is like this - in other words, it could be your city that they are living in. He does this to create a better microcosm of the world. Also, the idea of book burning is one of the greatest ever, as it shows how a society denies knowledge and chooses to go with ignorance instead. The biggest weaknesses in this novel is that it is hurried at times. I think Clarisse McClellan dies too fast, and it would have been better if they had had a bigger relationship. Also, the ending is abrupt. Then again, that is his style. In his short story \\"Frost and Fire\\" the ending is also abrupt. However, he has a great way of making people relate to his stories, even though they might be science fiction. In the future, I probably will read another one of his books.This is a great book, hands down. Go take it out of your library or purchase it and read it. It will only take you a matter of days (in fact you can even read it in one day). With a great theme dealing with censorship, along with everything else that is great about the book, this should be a \\"must read\\"."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book was one of the best that I have ever read yet, it is the same mumbo jumbo that humans will always find th right way.

There is true wisdom and serious warnings that Bradbury writes about, and I encourage all of you who had to read it for school and hated it, pick it up again sometime in the future when you are ready to really think about it and act on it. It is something everyone should read sometime in their lifetime."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's way of writing forces you to think about how non-sensical the world is becoming. While throwing in a couple of other ideas, he builds up to describing the horrors of censorship.

The story is of a young man, a &quot;fireman&quot;, in a future where information and knowledge come from television. Books are banned, and owning a book is punishable by death. The fireman becomes fascinated with why people would be willing to risk death in order to own something the state says is bad for them. He steals a book and reads it. Then he steals another book and another and another. Eventually he becomes exactly what he has been trained to eradicate. Finally he is turned in, by his wife, who doesn't understand his change in attitude and must answer a call to come to his own house...where his stolen collection of books are burned. He runs away and goes into hiding, until he eventually comes upon a group of people living outside the city without luxury of television. The people in this group have solved the problem of not being allowed to own books. Each person selects a book and then commits it to memory...in effect they become the book. If they are searched, they have no books and cannot be punished. They have become the receptacles for all the world's great literature and for their own future; a future that someday may permit books. This is a brilliant story, which has many parallels to America today, and not just Nazi Germany in the 30's. Less than 50% of Americans read newspapers; the idea of functional illiteracy has become commonplace; and an entire generation doesn't know anything that didn't come out of the television. As Howard Beale says in the movie Network, &quot;You dress like the tube, you talk like the tube, you raise your children like the tube...My God, you maniacs...you are the real thing, we are the illusion.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book, though possibly confusing in some places, is a wonderful look at a world where Firemen are paid to burn books.

So much more than a cry against censorship, this book is a rallying cry for us to wake up and see what is happening all around us. From the video walls to the relationships of children and parents, Bradbury is eerily prophetic in his predictions. I can see why some readers today would feel uncomfortable with this book; the truth not only hurts, but sometimes it can be downright damning.P.S. This is not a young adult book. The levels of symbolism and prophecy make this a read much more appropriate to an older, more mature audence."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Anyone who thinks that this book is boring and has no value, should simply watch TV.

I feel that it is a good book, but overrated."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury considered this novel his best work -- identifying himself on his tombstone as the author of Fahrenheit 451. It is an intriguing piece of work, though more fable than novel. Bradbury, like Dick, was never one to develop great characters, though his dialogue is a lot better than Dick's. And while Bradbury's plots are never as brilliantly convoluted as those of Dick, the imagination and philosophy behind his plots are his strength.Here Bradbury anticipates by 60 years the plugged-in, hyper consumerism of our present society. Books and ideas are abandoned voluntarily - first the books are condensed, then outlined, then just not read at all. And finally society as a whole mobilizes against the perceived snobbery and divisiveness of intellectuals, resulting in organized bookburning. In the background is a commitment to a permanent state of war with other countries.Like the interrogator of the hero in 1984, the chief book burner who tries to keep Bradbury's book-burning hero on the straight and narrow is one of the most interesting characters in the book. One gets the impression that he's an intellectual who has recovered from his heresy with a vengeance. Also interesting is the character of Clarisse, who first persuades the hero to ask questions about his life. I wish that character had been better developed.This is a very good book, though it has a truncated feel. The novel would have benefitted from expanding the characters and from giving a better feel for day-to-day life in this imagined future dystopia."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I doubt I can add anything new to a book with over 1500 reviews. So, like always, I'll just give my personal insights. In my opinion, what makes a classic a classic is something like this. . .it's pretty obvious that this book, when it was written, takes place in the future. Never do we know exactly when, and never is it actually stated that this book takes place in the future, yet it is. The fact that the fictional plot isn't really far-fetched is spooky, and mabe that's what caused such a stir when this book was causing controversy.Another thing is that a classic can not be defined as just one genre. This book is sci-fi, but it's not hard sci-fi. It's not the sci-fi that Asimov presents, where it takes place in space, across planets and galaxies and so on (by the way, I like Asimov alot, I'm not at all saying this type of sci-fi is bad), but with the little details, such as a Mechanical Hound (who was quite intimidating I might add), and the seashell worn by Mildred. It was more science fiction than I expected it to be, yet it was far from just a science fiction novel. It is also mostly a dystopian novel, yet at times it's also a thriller, even a tad of horror, and not to mention some heavy pyschological tendicies. And all of it works beautifully together.This story also does two things that a classic does: it takes a toll, or has a profound effect, on you, and also gets you thinking. From early on, and I mean the very first pages, the mood is dark and gloomy, and already the reader feels dreary. Montag's unhappiness is so realistic, his world so seemingly hopeless. Instantly the reader pities and sympathizes with Montag. His unhappiness, his refusal to just do as he's told like everyone around him does, is so well written as to be completely relatable and realistic. The scene where he watches his wife being \\"operated on\\" after she overdoses is both intense and horrific.It's pretty amazing that this book was so controversial and so challenged, especially considering the plot. Bradbury fit a whole lot of story into 150 pages here, and whatever he was trying to accomplish, I'd say he was extremely successful. Something Wicked This Way Comes was a good book, a really fun read (one thing I really liked better about fahrenheit 451 is that Bradbury's writing is much more concise) but THIS book is the real deal, and this is what proved to me that Bradbury deserves the praise and accolades he received throughout his lifetime.

It's a prescient look at the impact of technology on our society and the way we define and view 'knowledge' -- and relationships. This novel rightly belongs on lists of great social treatises like Orwell's, Huxley's, and the like."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In a not so distant future, Guy Montag is a fireman. But, paradoxically, his mission is NOT to quench fires, but to set them up in order to burn books. Because in the world in which Montag lives, it is absolutely forbidden to read books. Because reading books forces one to think for oneself. And thinking for oneself might lead you to question the world and not be happy. And in this world, it is mandatory to be happy.This book warns about the dangers of a mechanized civilization which condemns the life of the spirit and the free mind. The prescience of Bradbury is remarkable: in a book written in the fifties, he foresaw the terribly negative effects TV could have. Today, there still are free thinkers in this world, but to most people they seem weird and strange. TV, of course, can be used for constructive purposes, but let's be honest and admit that some 90% of its consequences have been stupidly destructive. So turn off your Oprah (like she could recommend good literature) and read this book: you'll end up wanting to read more."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Read this book! This, sadly prophetic, book truly reflects modern day life. Amazingly, people don't read anymore, BY CHOICE! Were offended by any and all things serious. Life has become nothing but trivial, meaningless, stupid, &quot;fun.&quot; The movies, television, pastimes, everything, is completely empty and devoid of all substance, if it actually has a point, then it's called &quot;overly serious.&quot; After all, we just want to &quot;have fun;&quot; why waste our lives trying to fix problems? Forget the problems! Life's too short! Eat, drink, tomorrow we may die! Ozone depletion, global warming? Bah! Human beings like you and I starving to death? I don't see it! Poverty, pollution, living beyond our means, injustice, racism, classism, sexism, hatred of all differences, greed, and countless other serious problems? Who cares, I don't see 'em! Flick on the TV!... and all these other anoexic, empty-headed, cuties we all aspire to be, who have nothing to offer us but &quot;cute-ness,&quot; and, of course, the planned obsolesence of the latest clothing fads, etc!How have we gone this far over the edge? Why don't we read? Why don't we care? Why don't we think? Why do we allow this to go on? Ray Bradbury tackles all these questions and more in his book. While this isn't a difficult book to read, it is slow reading, because, to get the point, you must continually stop reading and think about what you've read, to ask the important questions: Is it better to know, or not to know? Is it better to read, or not to read? Why do I read? Why do I think? How do I separate two conflicting truths, which are equally true? Join Montag, Clarisse, Faber, Beatty, Stoneman and Black, Mildrid, Granger, and the other characters of Fahrenheit 451 to help you find these answers.What a great book!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is truly ironic that some here are saying they didn't like Fahrenheit 451 because it was &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;didn't make sense.&quot; Slamming this book because it didn't feed itself to you, predigested? You missed a major theme of the very book you're trashing: society has degraded because thinking was deemed &quot;too much work&quot; - challenging books are burned, and mindless entertainment keeps people docile.Either you didn't really read it, or you haven't learned to think for yourself yet. (And only those under 20 get to use the latter excuse.)You don't have to like this book. You don't need to agree with everything Mr. Bradbury says. BUT - if you didn't like it because it required too much work from you... well, let's just say you shouldn't be proud of that fact. Everyone who &quot;got&quot; this book, whether they liked it or not, understands this.And to the book burning eighth grader...

I finished reading the book two months ago. I have to say it is very good. Set in the future, in a time where fireman burn books for a living, we see played out the story of a man named Montag who is a fireman....but he knows there's more to life...... Befriended by a sixteen year old girl named Clarrise Mclellan, he begins to see through her eyes the beauty of simple nature. And books come alive to him. He later comes to himself and quits his job as a fireman. Although this is a Science Fiction it has a depth that this genre often lacks. Montag's wife is distant from him. Clarrise who was like a daughter to him was killed. And in the end being an outcast joins a group of men who believe in a brighter future. This book is not only important to read but moving. Put it up there with Brave New World and 1984.I have a great appreciation for good litreture. Being a future writer myself, I believe good writers are always good readers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"To verify, I am a boy of age twelve. For a little introduction before delving into my review of this book, I would like to say that I amuse myself with books more advanced for my age, as they are by far more interesting, and enhance my writing skills and whatnot. With that done, I will not begin my comments on the book and a bit of a summary.Concise Summary (in my standards): Fahrenheit 451, written by Ray Bradbury, concentrates on a man by the name of Guy Montag, living perhaps a century or so from modern day, when the world suddenly altered into a dystopia. Therefore, firemen, instead of extinguishing fire, generate fire. However, they perform such tasks because of certain objects: books. Books were thought to be threatening and complicated, and thus, were ordered to be destroyed. The entire history of firemen was completely changed to fit this. For example, Benjamin Franklin was the first fireman, but he was a fireman parallel to that of the world in Fahrenheit 451.Anyway, Guy Montag is happy with his life. Until he discovers a girl by the name of Clarisse McClellan, who forces upon intricate thoughts about the past. Certainly, she was an odd person. Later on, she disappears, possibly dying. However, despite this, she remains an impact to Montag, influencing him. By time, Montag betrays the society and becomes an avid book-reader. The tale journeys through a short, almost unbelievable period of Montag's life, twisting into the end with Montag joining a group of book fanatics whom memorized certain books.Comments: The story is interesting, unlike any book I've ever read. Instead of being based on the normal spaceship, out-of-the-world concept, it is based on a completely different world, frighteningly similar to ours in a way. Bradbury employs nice words, but does not suddenly place a difficult one right out of nowhere. Because of this, the flow is great.The writing style is at least normal, as it should be with most authors. The plot is overall good, although I do feel that everything occurs too quickly. In a week or so, Montag changes from a ten-year fireman to a book lover. Regardless, it is a good book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury is the living master of the science fiction genre. This stuff is good, written in 1953, even if you are like me and don't like science fiction. Pass on those Bush-bashing movies by disingenuous poorly dressed film-makers and go to the real thing.This Fahrenheit is called 451 because that is the temperature at which books burn, more or less, and that is what this is about. Reminiscent of Hitlerian Germany, book burning is back in vogue in the eastern US in the late 20th century. The first ironic twist is that the firemen start the fires to burn the books, generally engulfing the book owner's home, and sometimes the book owner as well.Guy Montag is a third generation fireman who starts to question the purpose and meaning in burning books. All homes have been somehow fireproofed, so no real fires occur, only those started by the fire department. Montag's wife sits home all day, watching mindless broadcasts on large screens, and complaining that Guy needs to earn more money in order to purchase even larger screens. Her ultimate objective is to cover all four walls of the living room with monitors.Guy starts to sneak home some of the books and of course, he ultimately becomes the target of his own department. He learns that he should not trust his wife or his colleagues, all of whom long ago drank the kool-aid. He does make the acquaintance of an elderly professor, an intellectual and scholar from the old days, who ultimately puts him in touch with others of a similar ilk.Perhaps most interesting is the reason givien for burning the books. Non-fiction is bad, since it is all contradictory and impossible to prove, and fiction is even worse since it is not even true, just made-up people, places, and dialogue. And dont get me started on poetry or philosophy, that will only cause confusion, sorrow, and feelings of being lost. Society has made a clear selection in its entertainment, with an absolute preference for high speed sports, action, and adventure.More irony follows as Montag on several occasions becomes both the observer and the target as he is pursued by the authorities. Then we learn from reading a book that books are not a suitable way for humanity to store knowledge, that requires dedicated but powerless and marginalized scholars involved in constant peer review and analysis. The last irony is that Bradbury has written a very short book here, actually a novella, because he knows that we prefer action and adventure to reading.As of this 2005 writing, I understand that Bradbury is in his 80's and still working. In various interviews, he expressed anger that Michael Moore would adapt his title for a completely unrelated and unfunny diatribe. But then, Bradbury lifted \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" right out of Shakespeare. What comes around, goes around."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"How many times have you ever wished that you never ever have to read another book again or how many times have you wished that books should be banned so that you could watch the TV all day long? Well, enter into Ray Bradbury's world where reading books are illegal, watching TV all day is encouraged and running people over with cars are acceptable.Remember in school, where the brainy kids would always answer the teacher's questions while the rest of us sat behind? The rest of us would always feel dumber and after class we would beat up the brainy kids. It was a no win situation but in this wonderful society, class consisted of - you guessed it - television and more television. But in this world, everyone was made equal, so much equality that practically everyone are mindless zombies.Guy Montag, the protagonist of FAHRENHEIT 451, mindlessly burn books for a living. His profession is being a fireman. What better way to prevent books from making us unhappy, right? Wrong! Everyone that follows the contraband-book-society is miserable. Right off the first few pages, someone wants to kill herself and it turns out to be Montag's wife.Clarisse McClellan enters the picture and she gives Montag a little shove towards the direction of actually making him think for himself. For a moment there, Montag starts to live. He sees nature meaning trees and flowers, you know, that sort of junk people really don't see when their mind and concentration is on the television. McClellan also makes Montag question his lifestyle and happiness. He starts to get upset because he realizes that there is something terribly wrong with how the society works. But don't worry. Before McClellan can complete the transformation of making Montag into a living and breathing person, she gets run over by a car, driven by a bunch of kids. A wonderful world, is it not?Since Montag is stuck in between the phase of being a zombie and being a full fledge person, he looks for help. Although he wants help, he's placing himself in danger, by - be prepared for this - reading books and by talking with Faber, a retired English professor. The journey that awaits Montag would be full of confusion, danger and anger especially when Faber and Beatty have a verbal one-on-one. By the way, Beatty is really Captain Beatty, as in captain of the fire department."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Set in a not-too-distant future where books are banned, firemen start fires rather than put them out and room-sized TVs provide all social interaction, Farenheit 451 is truly scary. In a world like this, that is at once strangely familiar yet radically different, Guy Montag's behavior throughout the novel helps the reader identify with him. Definitely thought provoking and frightening in how close to reality much of the subject matter has become."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's books make for immediate, mesmerizing, entirely compulsive reading. His prose is electrifying in its use of poetic metaphor and dramatic syntax. The reader is instantly plunged into an alien culture, or a terrifying future, and is not really released even after the last page is turned.I had been postponing reading this novel for years. I am, after all, a confirmed bibliophile. Reading a novel with a plot involving the burning of books would, I kept telling myself, be too traumatic for me.I finally decided to wade in.Need I say that I only put the book down when I absolutely had to, when reality intruded? The novel carried me along on its relentless wave of narrative. Of course, I tried not to picture the books burning as I read, but Bradbury wouldn't let me. Not when he was describing them as living creatures, dying, their pigeon wings flapping.... The fact that I managed to endure this at all is a real tribute to the greatness of his writing.The characters are indelibly imprinted on my brain. The most compelling, of course, is the protagonist, Montag. Equally compelling are Faber, who is obviously Montag's alter ego, and the numinous Clarisse. She is the one who first awakens Montag to the futility of denying his own soul, the stirrings of thought and penetrating questions that reading invariably arouses. The most tragic character is Beatty, who struggles hard against his love of books, in his work as chief fireman. This struggle culminates in a final, ironic conflagration. Montag's wife, Mildred, is to be pitied, since she is unable to acknowledge her emptiness, her consuming loneliness. She pushes away the power and beauty to be found in books. She refuses to come out of denial, preferring \`the family', a banal cast of characters she endlessly watches on the living room \`wall-to-wall TV', in order to anesthetize the deepest longings of her soul.As I read, I became aware of a deeper sense of discomfort, underneath that elicited by the burning of books. Due to my own life experiences, I, along with this disturbed society, had been unconsciously longing for a world in which no one would ever get his or her feelings hurt - a world where everyone's rights would be respected, especially those of minorities.Bradbury gave me a sobering look at such a world, and it was absolutely terrifying. It was \\"American Idol\\" gone wild, a world in which people no longer thought, felt, or even communicated on a soul level with other human beings. Instead, they spent all their time being \`happy', through mindless, ongoing entertainment.I realized that I didn't want to live in such a world; it would mean the total annihilation of what makes us most deeply human - the ability to dream, to wonder, to ponder the deep truths of life.Books and the questions they raise are incompatible with living in a world where nobody would offend anyone else. Books disturb, probe, anger and challenge. Books are flawed at times, due to their authors' all-too-human penchant for furthering their own pet theories, however twisted they might seem to a reader. Books can make us squirm, for they can force us to face the unwanted realities we try to bury.There is still a part of me that thinks that books such as \\"Mein Kampf\\" should be burned, or at least, allowed to expire by going, and staying, out of print. The Marquis de Sade also comes to mind as an author of books with a markedly offensive subject matter. Then there's Anais Nin. One of her books chronicles the incestuous relationship she had with her father...The problem is, where do you draw the line? Who decides which books merit extinction?I don't have a final, satisfactory answer.And so I am left feeling restless and slightly depressed, although I'm glad to have read the book, nevertheless. It has caused me to ponder what I really and truly believe regarding the banning of books, and their potentially harmful influences.Yet another uncomfortable element of the plot is Montag's desperate, evil act toward the end of the novel. I suppose it is inevitable, however. It is indeed immoral, but then, so is the entire, nihilistic society he is a part of. It is the act of a man who has turned on a symbol of that society, and so, turned on himself, in a sense, in order to be reborn as a new man, a man who thinks and feels, even if doing so causes him some measure of unhappiness. This act could, itself, be considered a harmful influence on a reader, since Montag evades punishment. Yet, as an act of rebellion, of a misplaced sort of justice, it is totally fitting. Therein lies \\"the treason of the artist\\", as Ursula K. LeGuin puts it. For the artist makes meaning out of pain, suffering, and tragedy. This is also part of the value to be found in books.The symbol of rebirth is ubiquitous in the novel. At one point, the myth of the Phoenix is mentioned. Ironically, civilization is being reborn out of the very fire it has used to destroy the very objects that had given it meaning - books.By the end of the novel, groups of people have quietly begun the reconstruction, the return to reading. It is a movement that is slowly gathering momentum. Civilization, suggests Bradbury, as Miller's \\"Canticle for Leibowitz\\" was to do years later, is constantly rising from the ashes of every Dark Age in order to reinvent itself.So I know that I will be re-reading this book sometime in the near future, as I intend to do with Miller's. Both are books that apparently dwell on despair, only to end with a feeling of hope.Bradbury has once again sparked my imagination and tickled my intellect. He also refuses to let me forget his incredible take on a future that may or may not turn out to become all too real."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have re-read this book twice. It is a profound, pivoting novel, redolent of dysthymic admonitions and insight into the depths of nature. We are truly moving closer to the future allocuted by Ray Bradbury, for we reside in a society of superficiality and vice, in which mass media precludes critical thought and engages in unmitigable ideological insemination. The infernal machine known as the television is everywhere, and the pretense of the machine's adoration of the viewer and pseudo-relationship manifests itself in the aplomb, homogenous you-centered advertising schemes. Political correctness is bilious and has reached a prodigious, nauseous height. We are absorbed in a sub-culture of vanity, asininity, and conformance, whilst the circumambient ecumenical situation continues to precipitate. But we can preclude the advent of a Bradburian future. We must destroy televisions everywhere, and rid the world of superficiality. degenerate literature such as modern romances and John Grisham should stop being idolized, and we must return to the antecedental genius of man, We must read Thackery, Bronte, Joyce, Mann, Goethe, Kant, and we must liberate ourselves from ignorance. reading this, i felt that Clarisse Mclellan was predicated upon me. I have always wandered amongst fecund leas and orchards and the fallow moors, engrossed in nature, and admonished and mocked for it. Just the other day, whilst seeing the reflection of a television's promulgations, i heard jets in the sky, their aquiline screech shattering the heterogenous tranquility of the pines diademed with mists of the sea... and all the while, the television blasted, and i thought eerily of Fahrenheit 451, and what would ensue...."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I didn't think I'd like this book as much as I did.

Early in the book he meets a young girl who causes him to change his thoughts on everything that has been existing in his life forever. The book follows his journey through the world.SettingThe book was originally written in 1953, and the time frame for the book was set in the 90's or early 2000's. Anyway, the idea for the setting is that books are outlawed from society. The government has a firm grip on it's control of information and very little is given to the populace as a whole that isn't controlled by the government. In this way it's very similar to George Orwell's 1984.PlotThe book begins with Montag at work, burning someone's house down because they were reported to have books in their possession. Coming as no surprise, the book quickly forces Montag to question just how right it is to continue to hold back the knowledge of the past from the people.EnjoymentThe book has a very interesting premise, and the author's message of the importance of information and being able to think for yourself instead of allowing others to think for you is clear. I'm not quite sure what I think about the ending, it's not that it comes from nowhere, but I think it almost stretches out a bit too long.Overall GradeI enjoyed the book, it has a lot of interesting ideas. However, I'd seen most of the ideas from reading 1984 (which was written a few years before Fahrenheit 451).

The city is a dystopia in a utopia.Guy Montag, firemen who finds out that he isn't happy once he has multiple conversations with a spontaneous adolescent girl named Clarisse. Clarisse doesn't thrive in the dystopia like everyone else. She does not accept that books are bad. She late affects the train of thought for Montag. Mildred, Montag's wife is happy with her life. She accepts the thought of books being bad. She agrees that destroying books brings happiness. She spends most of her time watching T.V. all day. Faber is an old man who enjoys books, but he is terrified of the firemen. He's a smart coward. Captain Beatty reads books from time to time, but he doesn't believe anything he reads.The common theme for the book the collective loss of memory, history, and the outside world in a society will result in an easy psychological manipulation of mankind by a government ultimately leading to dehumanization of the people. This is the theme because they are erasing history in an effort to achieve happiness. The common characteristics used in the book are relying on physical and somewhat psychological torture to maintain order. They threaten to burn books and houses if you're caught with books. The society the government runs thought to be an utopia but is far from it, the government basically runs and controls everything.Fahrenheit 451 really unfolds when Montag begins to take books for himself. His wife is terrified that he wants to keep the books. She is afraid that her house will be burned by the firemen, but Montag is a fireman, but does this make him able to read books? Things become more interesting when he is caught with a plethora of books in his home.Deon, Carlos, Juan, Cody (12th grade)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of the very best book to add to your collection. You can keep on reading this book over and over again. The setting which takes place in the future is a sure way for sci-fi fans.

The setting however may be confusing at first. The symbolism is very interesting but again, hard to understand."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a book that is set in the futuristic time of the 24th century. Ray Bradbury, the author of the book, tells his vision of the future which is definitly technology enhanced.The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who loves fire. In this time it is firemens job to start fire to a house of those who have disobeyed the law, like possesing a book. The people of this society are to think the same and to know of no different. Guy Montag is of course one of these people. However this soon changes when he meets a young girl names Clarisse who is quick to change Montags beliefs.Montag begins to realize that that book burning is wrong and the thing that he loves burning is the very thing that spreads knowledge and opinion. After he realizes this he is tempted to steal one of his own. He does this and the plot begins to unfold. He tells his wife of his secret and that he actually has stolen many more. His wife disagrees with him that this is the right thing to do and turns him in. Guy Montag meets new people along the way that have the same opinion about this stuff and they help him. Montag tries to rebuild his society with new freedoms after it is destroyed in war.I enjoyed this book becase Bradbury's descriptions and vocabulary usages are amazing. I liked how he showed that the things we think so little of are really very important to the life and freedoms that we have today. He also shows that sometimes inventions can get out of control and we forget how to do the simple things becase the machines do it for us. The author creates a world that is threatening and exotic but at the same time is is familiar enough to seem real. I enjoyed this book even though at times it could get confusing and complicated it is definitly one of the better thought-provoking books I have read yet."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most disturbing books I have ever read. In Fahrenheit 451 the way that Ray Bradbury uses his imagination to visualize the future is great. His future had shells for head phones and walls for screens, that is so cool. Except for the fact that everyone has lost there mind the story is extremely interesting.The way that Mr. Bradbury depicts the future is almost real in the sense that what if we really do forget what books are used for. The way that Montag gets interested in the books and has to try to hide it from every one he knows.The detail that Bradbury goes in to about Montag keeping his secret is great describing him sweating out every second. Mildred At all times being half drugged half awake. The society to wear no one can die unless you have books then you are burned. I believe that Bradbury succeeded in is book although I believe it is increasingly weird.It gives brilliant depiction into his mind and his imagination. Mr. Bradbury I believe has a way of striking to the core of a person. A way of showing a side of a thought that no one has ever thought about. I personally have never thought that our inventions could be bad. This shows that what if change is really bad."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a gem, the best book that I've ever read. I didn't have the opportunity to read it in school and decided to check it out. I now have a little paper in my wallet that I carry with me everywhere. This paper has quotes for the novel. My personal favorite. While most of these quotes are disturbing, because they're just so close to the truth, they are brilliant. Mr. Bradbury's descriptions and vocabualry usages are amazing.He wrote this book 50 years ago (52) yet he still managed to get so close to the truth. Back then, TV was a new thing and Mr. Bradbury sensed that there was something wrong with it. His future has TV as a replacement for books, books being outlawed and firemen starting fires instead of putting them out to destroy books. Mr. Bradbury probably feared that something like this might happen and decided to put his thoughts down first.While books still exist now and aren't outlawed, much more people would prefer watching Wheel of Fortune or going to see a useless movie at the theatre like Mr and Mrs. Smith. One thing that struck me was that there are over 5 million copies of this book in print. A lot, right? Not really if you think about it. While this book has been out for over 50 yrs, movies make 200 million dollars in 3 or 4 months getting a huge amount of US's population attending them.Mr. Bradbury makes TV something that everyone has in his future, like it is now. He has the TV's taking up an entire wall and certain characters are begging for another wall. Picture it, a giant wall, a TV screen. Now, how far is that from the truth? Now we have those giant plasma TVs and the ones litteraly attached to the wall. How sad.In his future, the U.S. is the big dog, starting wars with other countries because they can.This future is full of violence and hostility, but one man will stand up to it. The last 40-50 pages of the book are pure genius with some of the most memeorable lines ever.Mr. Bradbury has made a classic, my personal favortite book, a wrok fiction that could easily be mistaken for a work of non fiction. So tonight, instead of watching Mr. and Mrs. Smith, why don't you pick this gem out. I'm sure that everyone in the U.S ahs heard of it, but I bet that a much fewer number has read it...if they hadn't been forced to at least."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is an interesting thing to review an american classic, and furthermore to review a book by an literary legend. That being said, it is apparent to anyone who has read the novel of why exactly it is a classic. Bradbury is among those authors from the golden age of science fiction writing. The early to mid 20th century saw a surge of scifi writers, the most prominent standing out from among the crowd to bestow upon us today's required readings. No sarcasm there, infact moreso enthusiasm. Huxley, Orwell, and Bradbury (and the even earlier Wells) have all produced standing classics which are used by many facilities to teach. It is truly a wonderful thing.Bradbury's book begins with a recount of the passion and the draw to burning. As a foreshadow, thiese paragraphs seek to write about a fireman in a futuristic dystopian society (dystopian in the quality of mental freedom). The society has, over time, allowed provisions to be made that completely cut out freedom of thought. However, the frightening thing deals with how they do this. Instead of just restricting books and other forms of published media, they have distracted the general public by means of electronic trickery. An advanced and much more frightening form of brainwash, the citizens are too caught up with \\"their family\\" (the referred is actually those on the television, whom they've become so ingrained with that they spend most of the day watching) to care about much else. This works for most, but not all, as humannature dictates. There are those behind the scenes, taking care of the dirty work.Enter Guy Montag, a fireman with the local fire department. Unlike modern convention, firemen in this futuristic nightmare are set out to burn the aformentioned media. They carry bottle of kerosene, the adversary to their predecessors, and threaten to burn anyone who posesses printed literature. However, Montag dissents when he reads a book that he swiped and he begins to slowly support those who he has hunted for the past years. His captain, Beatty, is a fierce man with a sharp wit. He completely understands Montag's position, as he has lived it, however he sides strongly with the belief that books are the root of all evil and that by destroying them, the government is doing the people a favor. He twists the situation of brainwash into sounding almost appeasing.Bradbury wrote the book in an amazing fashion. Taken from the life of \\"he who burns the books\\" (or the character who's job creates the actual problem), the story follows Montag into his general dissent and being hunted by those he previously worked for. Bradbury uses an amalgam of characters to shape our perception of this world, everything from the foundation upon his societal institution was based to the hidden war that is being waged. Without giving away too much information, it is sufficient to say that the conflict is resolves in a satisfying manner. One would suspect that such an occurence would happen during the upstart of such a ruled society, and I was pleased to see it concluded in that manner."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"An excellent read, thrilling and provocative. Ray Bradbury is one of my favorite authors because of his superior ability to convey detail. I began this book thinking it wasn't all that good but to my surprise I loved it and it is now one of my favorite books. It was a good book because the writing was engrossing and there was alot of action, he made the characters come alive and you could imagine them in your head as you were reading and play a sort of movie in your mind. The way Ray Bradbury views his future from 50 years ago is not that far off and is a bit frightening. Even though it was a great book I only wished it could have lasted longer. After the city was blown up it ended right there and left you wanting more. I also enjoyed reading about the futuristic gadgets and devices they used such as the Mechanical Hound, Seashell Radios and the Parlor. Overall I would suggest this book to anyone despite their taste I strongly feel no matter what kind of books you like this will appeal to you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book one day on a long bus ride. At first it was just something to do, but soon it became more. It is a very fascinating novel, especially when considering that it was written 50 years ago. Bradbury's view of the future is actually not that far off, in my opinion. The book is very thought-provoking and it makes you think. I also appreciate that it is written in a deeper matter, a characteristic of a true classic. I can understand that perhaps the fact of this being required to read at many schools might turn many students off to the book, but personally, I enjoyed reading it for pleasure."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 surprised me how good it was and how quickly i read through it. The idea of firemen not putting out fires but starting fires got my attention and held it. The way that Bradbury saw the future also kind of scared me, that people were killed all the time and no one noticed or even cared, but somehow this society was supposed to be perfect. The Mechanical Hound was something that also interested me, the perfect hunter. Something that can find the genetic make-up of your body and store it and then whenever you need to be killed, can track you down and finish the job. The only thing i could change about the book is to make it a little longer. After the city is bombed it just ends. I was hoping Montag would find Faber and the story would continue, but it didn't. Even though this book was really short i enjoyed reading it and was always ready to see what would happen next"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The message is clear.Burn the words to cover-up and control society through censorship -vs- the fire for warmth, and light for learning. Let the people make up their own minds as to which helps or hinders them.Truth, actually keeps a society in a better position (no-matter how much it seems to hurt in the present) than any ideal forward pushing utopian lies...It is a great book, and Ray's real purpose/philosophy point blankly shines in the later chapters.Thats my broadbrushstroked opinion. Amazon does not offer fine lines concerning gold stars. If they did, I would rate it 4.625"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've heard so many people say they've been influenced by Bradbury (writers and others) and I can see why--this is simply a great novel. Bradbury is really a national treasure. If you ever get the chance to hear him speak, don't miss him. His stories are priceless. (Especially the one about his anger at people telling him for years that he was crazy to believe man would set foot on the moon in his lifetime. He said he called up every person who laughed in his face the night Neil Armstrong did--and pretty much laughed in their faces!) There is a fantastic one-on-one interview with him in the Walt Disney Tomorrowland-Disney in Space and Beyond DVD (interviewer is Leonard Maltin). His friendship with Disney (a fellow futurist) was fascinating. But it's the sense of wonder and child-like curiosity and optimism (not childish or blind optimism as he clearly understands what can create a dystopia) that make you realize why he is a national treasure. He's inspired me to look to the future, to look up, to look forward, to always be wary and alert to what can go wrong, (and the dangers of closed or lazy minds) BUT not to let any of that stop you--that anything is possible in a world willing to believe, in a free world with open and curious minds."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was a book that had a very good message. This book made me think about where our society could be heading. It made me realize how important books are and how awful it would be if it was illegal to read! The only bad thing about this book is that there were many metaphores. Becuase there were so many metaphores I didn't always know if certain things were really happening or if he was just using figurative language. Despite this, the book was very good and made me think very hard about how important books really are."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In L.A. our class read this book. At first I did not like this book because it was not exciting. When I got to the second chapter the story was getting more interesting because Guy Montag started to go against the government rules about reading books. Guy's captain, Beatty, starts catching on to Guy about bringing books to his house. Towards the end I really started to enjoy it because Guy burns Beatty and runs away. Guy meets these other firemen who also started to read books and ran away. It was a good book. I thought it was cool the way the author wrote those similes and how he related everything to each other. This author did a pretty good job with this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451Ali**13 yrs old H.A.S.F:451 was an enjoyable book yet it was also hard to read. I thought it was a very intresting society, it seemed as if peopple were always rushing. I thought that the mechanical hound was pretty cool,that they could put anyone's DNA in it, and it could go after them. THis book had many symbols such as, fire, books, phoinex,beetle, and more. I hope that in the future this will never happen in our society, talking to the TV, come on people! We need books!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I personally enjoyed Fahrenheit 451 very much. I do think that Bradbury's writing style is unique and packs a lot into a small amount of space, but I disagree that the aesthetic qualities are the highlight of his writing. I think that the ideas behind the story are what makes the book so compelling.I also disagree that the book is lacking due to a missing thick plot. I think that the lack of petty details about how exactly the society is set up or functions helps both the author and the reader to remain focused on the ideas. I think that there is a clear enough explanation for the way in which the society went from not being interested in books to burning them. As time passed more advanced forms of technology replaced reading as the mainstream form of entertainment, and people were less attached to books. Then the government that is in place at the time the story is told takes over, and decides to have all books burned. Not all people in the novel burn books, only the firefighters, and the whole thing is very regulated by the government. The government makes this decision to get rid of the possibility of people gaining knowledge pertaining to ideas about revolutions, and better ways of life. This way the people will blindly accept the government, and be content even though their lives lack any real relationships.The story is an exaggeration of problems Bradbury sees in society and of fears of what could happen in the future. It forces the reader to think about how we spend our time, how much we really know or don't know, and how much is within our control."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In this book i found it very interesting how the book just progresses through every thing in an instant im a matter of a snap of the fingers and nothing else in the story matters but Guy Montag himself. For example there would be a girl and she would just com into play but then the auther just kills her off and the ending i found was just a stop to leave you wonder what would happen if the auther finished it off. Overall this book was very good as the story goes on you get into it and why write a book about burnning books? :)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury combines controversy with a touch of suspense in his novel Fahrenheit 451. In the future where &quot;firemen&quot; burn books and the houses they are in, the conflict between rescuing the past and burning it comes to life. Guy Montag, a &quot;fireman,&quot; struggles with his everyday life of burning books, and the life that the next-door neighbor, seventeen-year-old Clarisse, introduces into his mind. Captain Beatty, the fire chief, tries to convince Montag that the life of burning books is the only way to go, that is until Montag meets another &quot;book saver&quot;, a retired college professor, who helps him decide what is right. Bradbury's conflicts between wrong and right are those that have been handed down over generations and will be for generations to come. Morals take over in this battle of instinct and actuality, as Montag joins a group to try and save the books of the world. From adventurous chases to confidential meetings, this book will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last page."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury takes place far in the future in the suburbs of a big city. The name of the main character is Guy Montag and he is a fireman, but instead of putting out fires he lights them. In his society books are banned. If anyone is found to be keeping these illegal objects, their houses are burned down. Montag meets a girl named Clarisse, and she makes him question what he does every day. The main conflict begins when Montag begins to steal books and hide them in his house. He realizes how important they are and what the government is hiding from its people. He is immediately motivated to do something about this. He seeks the help of Faber, a book-keeper who Montag knows about but never reported. Faber is not at all hopeful, but he agrees to help Montag preserve books. Together they read books and store the words in their minds, saving the information for later.In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury describes things by gshowingh instead of gtellingh. On page 75, Bradbury describes being inside the virtual parlor, which is surrounded by video screens. gHe was a victim of concussion. When it was all over he felt like a man who had been thrown from a cliff, whirled in a centrifuge and spat out over a waterfall that fell and fell into emptiness and emptiness and never-quite-touched-bottom-no-never-never-quite touched bottom. The thunder faded. The music died.h This is a very interesting book, but most of it is fairly depressing. It is all about the government controlling what people think. gfWhatfs going on?f Montag had rarely seen that many house lights. eOh, just my mother and father and uncle sitting around, talking. Itfs like being a pedestrian, only rarer. My uncle was arrested another timedid I tell you?for being a pedestrian. Oh, wefre most peculiar.f eBut what do you talk about?fh This quote shows how deprived the society is of anything that actually means something. This book was written on experiences that Ray Bradbury had like actually being stopped by the police for walking. The one thing that makes this book different from other science fiction is that the plot of Fahrenheit 451 is so believable that it seems like we are in danger of it happening.Fahrenheit 451 carries some valuable lessons. The largest message in the book is that we should not let books become obsolete. Even if we use the Internet and watch TV more and more, we should still read books and value them because, as Faber says, gBooks donft tell things, they tell the meaning of things.h He also says that books are not important, but that they are just a receptacle for things we are afraid we might forget. This is a reoccurring theme that appears throughout this excellent book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman who job it is to start fires instead of stoping the. In this backwards world of his he burns books and the houses that they are hidden in. In this future world reading a book is against the law because it gives peoples ideas. Guy never qustioned his job until he actually thinks what it would be like to read a book.....I never never really thought what our world would be like with no books, but now that I think about it I can't believe how monotonous and boring it would be. Now that I think about it I am glad I dont live in a world like Guy Montag's.This book has become on of my favorites and I highly recomend you read it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 came out over 50 years ago, first as a novella called The Fireman (1950), and finally in its full novel form (1953). In those days we were probably most concerned with censorship from the right. Now, the liberals who advocated free speech at Berkeley have taken up the cause to tell us what we can say, so as not to offend anyone. So the First Amendment risks assault from both ends. One way to solve the problem is for us all to develop thick skins. If somebody calls me a bad name, why should I spend my time complaining and give the impression that my ego is a basket case? (Now physical assault is another thing. No First Amendment protection there.)Ray Bradbury's Coda is at the end of newer editions of his book. This is a valuable addition that gives specifics on some of the problems mentioned above.But there is something lacking in the newer editions. When Ballantine published the first edition in 1953, they included two short stories at the end, &quot;The Playground&quot; and &quot;And The Rock Cried Out.&quot; These have since been excluded and are not easily found elsewhere. They are excellent stories, and I hope that someday Del Rey will consider reinstating them. For this reason, I now rate the book a 4 rather than its deserved 5."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book talked about important themes that changed my perspective on life. Guy Montag's world was nothing but bizarre rules that covered up the past. One important part of the story was the fear of change. The society was against him for his attempt to find out the truth. Killing his fellow firefighter, Beatty, caused him to see that he wanted to die. Quote: \\"...In the middle of the crying Montag knew it for the truth. Beatty had wanted to die. He had just stood there, not really trying to save himself, just stood there joking, needling, thought Montag, and the thought was enough to stifle his sobbing and let him pause for air.\\" He wanted to be free, instead of being confined within rules of the ordinary."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a personification of the human spirit. In this story he is given a new insight by a young babbling teenage girl, Clarisse. With this sudden and mysterious revelation, Montag begins to see that the world around him is very synthetic, no can think about what they feel or feel what they are thinking - only the now exists and no concern for actions or consequences. Montag is centered and yet torn between two archetypes, Captain Beatty and Professor Faber. Beatty is an evil and heartless intellectual barbarian, a man possessing an illegal library in his home and claiming to not read a page of it. He is without a doubt a coward hiding behind brute force, whether it be by tongue or kerosene. Then there is Faber, a kind and fearful man who provides sanctuary for Montag. Bradbury puts you behind Montag's eyes and tells the story by letting you experience his life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book pulled me in, and spoke to me. It's chilling how well Bradbury was able to make such an obvious stance, yet still write a beautiful, well rounded novel. This is a book that I hope everyone reads, it makes you a better person. It makes you want to do good in the world. I think Bradbury wants people to ignore things like television, and sit around with one another and talk, debate, discuss. Ironically, this is a book that forces the reader to do just that, perhaps Bradbury's greatest feat.Absolutely timeless novel, 5 stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an intelligent story filled with adventure and suspense. It takes you on a journey through the development of Guy Montag, a man who is fed up with a corrupt system. What I like most about this book is the writing style of the author. I find it incredible the way he can capture the way the characters are feeling. For example; \\"He saw himself in her eyes, suspended in two shining drops of bright water. Himself dark and tiny, in final detail, the lines about his mouth, everything there, as if her eyes were two miraculous bits of violet amber that might capture and hold him intact.\\" Page 7. It's almost as if Bradbury is writing poetry, but it is not to the extent that he is rambling on aimlessly.The theme of this book is rebellion. The story fallows Guy Montag through his path of change from being part of the system to a leader of a rebellion against it. Slowly but surely, Montag discovered more and more things that aid his transformation into an independent man. I fully agree with Montag's decision to rebel and I Truly look up to him for his bravery in doing what some thought to be impossible. His actions relate closely to my life because I as well, am not the kind of person who is willing to do what I am told to do unless I agree with it and find it worthwhile, so if someone tries to force me to do something against my beliefs, I will fight them to the fullest extent.I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone out there that is either; looking for a futuristic drama, into sci-fi, or simply just anyone looking for a good read. I recommend this book because at first, it did not look to appealing to me, but after about 45 pages into it I realized that the good characters, interesting story line, and a whole new way to look at the world and government. I know that if you give this book a chance, it will completely change the way you look at such things as limits by the government, literature, and relationships. Fahrenheit 451 is a well-rounded page-turner that pushes the limits of our minds and expands our knowledge of the cruelty of the world around us."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Everyone seems to think this book is about censorship. I don't really think this is the case. 451 is a book about what books should be about. Books should inspire us to think, to challenge ourselves. The best poetry should make us cry (so, too, should the worst but for other reasons.) Books should make us question our society and it's assumed intrinsic goodness.John Cheever said, in his Pulitzer acceptance speech, that books, maybe, could prevent nuclear war. Bradbury, too, makes this point in the speeches of the wandering academics Montag meets at the end of 451.If you're interested in reading a book with a purpose, with a meaning -- a book which strives to show us where we could go and the bad we could do -- read 451 and let yourself question the status quo."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm not going to summarize the book. I'm not going to tell you how Guy Montag feels, how his wife feels, how those people on the screens that cover three walls feel. I'm just going to tell you how I feel. And the way I feel is this: awe. Mr. Bradbury wrote this book way back (well, way back for me) in the fifties, I believe, after a series of unsuccessful attempts. He wrote it half a century ago, yet the country depicted in it is strikingly like the US today.Let me put it this way, in a slightly more historical backround; we were talking about Confucius and the Legalists today in Social Studies, or History, whichever you prefer. The Legalists were like the US in this book. They suppressed opinions that did not agree with their own, they used military force, they even burned books. Only agriculture and medicinal books were allowed to be printed. The way the Legalists ruled ancient China during those fifteen years is like the way the government runs the US. Actually, I started a great discussion with the only other kid who read this, comparing that future world to this ancient one.But the scariest thing is that it's not really THAT far in the future. They've won two nuclear wars since 2070. The year 2070 is going to be in my lifetime unless I die very early. Freaky. Very, very scary to think of.The last thing I want to say in this oversized-review is that I absolutely NEVER give five stars. A book has to be really great to get the great \\"twelve-year-old stamp of approval\\", as my mommy calls it. I'd recommend it to anyone within the vicinity of my voice...in fact I think I have. (Before homeroom I tend to be a little tired, I mean it is as 7:40 in the morning, and I get \\"roudy\\". This means I tell the whole hall in general which books are good, which are bad, and it actually works. Because of my interesting antics I've gotten three fans of this book, and countless others of books for youngerpeople.)Ray Bradbury, if you are seeing this review, which you may in fact be, I've really got no idea whose looking at this, you have a Fonz' (ever seen Happy Days? I watch reruns on TV Land) quality thumbs up.\\"Hey!\\""},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Since I don't want to give away all the details of the book I will try to be as descriptive as possible. The book open with humans, as a whole, not remembering the way life used to be. In a time when there were books, schools, and maybe most important of all, the freedom of speech. You first meet the main character Guy Montag after one of his work shifts. He is a fireman, but not the type of fireman that we would think of today. In this case, he is a fireman who starts fires. In the world in which he lives, owning books is a highly punishable offense. In this case, firemen arrive at reported libraries with tankers full of kerosene and light the books and the homes of the book owners on fire. This usually takes place at night to make a good show for those who enjoy to watch. The same people who owned the books will also be arrested. However, most of these so called &quot;radicals&quot; who own the books decide to be burned along with them. In any case, Guy enjoys his work and never seems to give the mass destruction too much thought. That all changes, however, when he meets a girl named Clarisse. She talks with him about the way the world used to be and it starts making him wonder about things. Eventually he begins sneaking books out of the fires. Of course this type of behavior is going to get noticed and he has to go on the run and ends up turning on his society and his role in it. He later finds a home in a wasteland outside of the city with other educated people who take him in and watch as the city is blown to bits in a techno-war that lasts only three minutes. In my view this was a pretty good book. It was entertaining and a short read. Some of the themes like drive by terrorism, the large amount of entertainment, and the fast vehicles make a point that not all technological progress is useful. On top of it all the story basically ends on a good note because all of the controlling ways of life are destroyed and the educated can now build a free world that once existed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you like books that you don't need a dictionary by your side, or it doesn't take three months to read then, fahrenheit 451 is a book for you.Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In this society fireman start fires instead of putting them out. The people in this society don't even read books they are consumed by tv and radio. There's one problem though Guy likes books.Throughout the story Guy's life is a plagued by disturbing events like his wife's attempted suicide, a crazy lady that would rather be burned alive than have her books burned, and to top it all off his friend Clarisse is hit by a speeding car and killed. This was devastating to Guy because she opened his eyes to the emptiness of his life. This is when Guy questioned the duties of his job.Other exciting events in the story are when Guy doesn't show up for work one day and his boss Beatty pays him a visit. Upon his arrival Beatty discovers that Guy has been hoarding books from the fires to read. Beatty tells him that he can keep the books for one night and after that he has to turn them in for burning. Guy begins one long night of reading. Overwhelmed by this task he turns to his wife for help, but she's more interested in tv. He pays a man Dr.Faber a visit, Faber agrees to help him.The next day Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty for incineration. Then the alarm sounds and they rush off for another book burning. When Montag gets there he realizes it's his own house. His wife betrayed him. Beatty forces him to burn down the house himself.Once he is done he turns the flamethrower on Beatty and kills him, then he manages to escape the other firemen and the big mechanical dogs.If you want to know what happens next you'll just have to read the book because a review shouldn't give away the ending. So if any of this sounded interesting I suggest you pick up a copy of fahrenheit 451 and read it, you won't be dissapointed.After reading this brief introduction to this book you would understand why I gave it a near perfect score, it's action packed with adventure, and it's easy to understand. What more could you ask for?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book is, from an analytical standpoint, about the meaning of life, values and the reactions of people. The book begins with the main character, Montag, as you will realize he lives the life of the classical fireman. He burns books because it is what he is paid to do, he goes home to his wife that, since they have no children, sits around and watches T.V. all day, and is completely brainwashed by the society. Montag then encounters a girl, named Clarise, who thinks about the world and he wonders. Not too much later he goes to see a professor who helps him to think, himself, and in so doing puts Montag against the society that he was the idealist for not so long ago.This book can be analyzed as an insight to the meaning of life for the different characters have such contrasted views as to what the true meaning of life is. First of all there is Montag the protagonist of the story, he changes his meaning of life from, work at my job, that isn't too bad, so I can support my wife and she can be happy. Then contrastingly to what I considered as my view on life before is flawed, because my wife isn't really happy; for two reasons, first she almost kills herself, without thinking much of it, and, second she doesn't understand how to think so she really can't be that happy anyway. This leads him to think that his purpose in life is to try and enlighten some part of the society to induce thought and maybe make people really happy instead of the temporary solutions they use all day long. The second character that is the general view you get on the people in society is Mildred, who is basically every average housewife. Mildred is a living zombie of absolute brainwashed stupidity, she really isn't capable of her own thought and she thinks she is happy, since she can't really think for herself and their isn't much material around about the meaning of life, she really doesn't have a view, but her character, or moreover what she represents matters to the story and how life is viewed by general people. The third person that shows the meaning of life that is generally accepted is that if you please your superiors you have done your job in life, this character is captain Beatty. Beatty is an interesting character he knows what Montag knows that books let people think, he has also read many but he utterly supports the government without objection or dispute. He knows what the government wants; yet he agrees and he tries to convince Montag that he is right and the government is right and he is doing what must be done. These three characters show contrasted views of three beliefs on the meaning of life, or what is good.Values are shown vividly in the book, there are different values shown, such as knowledge, material, and thought. The first example is the night call to the house where the woman burns with her books; this exemplifies value in knowledge. This is shown in what the books represent to her, she has such value in the knowledge, which the books contain, and value in the importance of this she doesn't feel she can live after they have been burned. The second instance where value is shown is in Mildred, and her value of material, in this case her parlor. The scene where this is most relevant is when Montag comes to burn the house, she complains more about her parlor as she goes away than she does about her husband who will be sent to jail. The third time value is shown though this is in no order is in Clarise. The value she represents is thought, she values thought without even having to try, she values it because her family values thought and she is fed on thought and conversation; throughout her life by her uncle and parents she is thought the value and meaning of thought, and so she expresses this value.The reactions of people are also in the theme of this book, for many times this is shown. The different reactions I will discuss are: first, the society's reaction to banning books, second the reaction Captain Beatty has to books, and third Montag's reaction to Clarise. First, I will discuss society's reaction to the banning of books. Society in this world is not so much different from ours, yet a ban against books wouldn't make sense to people, but it seems logical to people in this world. I am for the opinion that this is because the government structures the world around fast pleasure instead of the pleasure of knowledge, so it can be easy to ban books and make people into what Mildred and her friends represent. I believe given time this would easily follow through in our fast paced world, not because people wouldn't fight but because of people that wouldn't really care. The second reaction I would like to discuss is the reaction of Captain Beatty to his reading of books. This is intriguing, because even after reading many books Beatty still hates them, this is odd since the general reaction to something you hate is not to do it, yet Beatty knows his enemy like a friend an intelligent, hateful method of enforcing your opinion. The third, is Montag's reaction to Clarise, she doesn't have to do much to catalyze his thought, this is most likely due to the fact that he thinks a lot but not about the right things.To conclude this book has many an Interesting aspect to it, and is worth a good read, make sure to remember not to be a person that doesn't care."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The story, Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is about an alternate society set in the future where cars travel 100 miles per hour, TV walls interact with people and books are banned. Guy Montag is an enthusiastic fireman, who enjoys pouring kerosene over books and burning them and the entire house. In this society, firemen do not put out fires. They start them.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury. This book was action-packed and involved a lot of good writing. For example there were many metaphors in this book. They helped to connect Montag's society to ours, and show the frightening similarities between the two.Mildred Montag is Guy Montag's wife. She is an example of the people the government wants to create. Mildred is shallow and cares more about her possessions than about herself or her husband. Also, Mildred never shows interest in what Montag has to say. She regards him as an annoying younger brother rather than her husband. Mildred is the stereotypical housewife of this time period. She values all the things her society does. She seems to not think for herself, and only knows what the society wants her to know.In the beginning of this book, Montag seems perfectly content with his life and his job. He says it is a pleasure when he burns people's houses. He loves the smell of kerosene that comes from his job, and \`wears it like a perfume'. Then one day Montag meets a girl named Clarrise McClean, and his life changes forever.Clarrise is a peculiar girl for the time period. She thinks. She enjoys smelling the leaves in fall, staying up late at night talking and watching the stars. Clarrise seems like a girl that came from our time period and was placed in Montag's. The norm for teenagers in this book is to play video games, play sports, and kill each other. There are many gangs in this society and often innocent teenagers are shot. Also, teenagers like to drive their cars hundreds of miles per hour to see how many people they can run off the road. If a pedestrian were to be crossing the street in this society, they would most definitely be killed. However, no one walks anywhere. Rather, they take the subway or they drive to wherever they need to go. Pedestrians are seen as weird and are often watched by the police to make sure they don't do anything illegal.When Montag meets Clarrise and talks to her, he immediately wants to know more about her. She is unusual to him, and he likes that. Montag loves the way Clarrise doesn't care about what anyone else thinks of her. Clarrise teaches Montag to question society when the society seems wrong.The day after Montag met Clarrise, the firemen were called to a site where there were books in need of burning. Montag seemed detached from the routine that usually captured his every waking hour. The firemen were at the house of a woman who had hidden books in her attic. When the other firemen were pouring kerosene over the books, getting ready to burn them Montag stole one. He put the offensive book under his jacket and in doing so saved it from being burnt.When Montag got home he revealed to Mildred the stolen book. He opened up the air vent in his room and exposed 20 more books! Mildred was horrified, and gathered the books so she could burn them in her incinerator. Montag ordered Mildred to stop and said he wanted to read the books. He reasoned the authors must have spent their whole lives writing a book and therefore the books must be worth reading. Some people were willing to die for the ideas and opinions in these books, and Montag wanted to figure out why.Mildred, like most of the society, took no interest in Montag's books. She knew that if she did, she could be sent to jail. Mildred did not want to risk ruining her reputation, or loosing her house and TV walls. After Montag realized that Mildred would be of no help to him, he decided to talk to someone. Montag needed someone who would be aware of what he was going through, and could help him understand the books. Montag recalled an elderly man, by the name of Faber, he met in the park years ago. Faber told Montag that he was once a literary professor and he loved books. Montag went to Faber's house to visit him there. He brought with him one of his stolen books; the Bible.Faber eventually helped Montag in his quest to change the society. He told him that this couldn't be done quickly, but rather after a long period of time. Montag and Faber then began to discuss a plan to change society's views. They decided to place copies of books in firemen's homes. Then they would have the homes burnt. This would cause unease within the system and hopefully cause its demise.This book is about a society similar to ours. They have censored everything possibly offesive, thus only keeping the facts. The society is terrified of stepping on the toes of minorities for fear that they will rebel. They believe the bigger your market, the less you have to handle controversy. The public doesn't want to read anything that might offend someone. This aspect of Montag's society sounds frighteningly like ours. People watch what they say in public so as not to offend anyone. Montag's society grew to hate books because they might cause an uprising. What their society wanted above all, was for everyone to be happy. The story of Fahrenheit 451 is of the coming of age of Guy Montag. It is about his heroic efforts to restore civilization to it's thinking. This was an astounding book, and it is great for people who like action, controversy, and to think about life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read Fahrenheit 451 at school. Before I picked it my Mom was telling me how she enjoyed reading the book before me ,so naturally me being a teenager assumed that the book was going to be stupid ,but I got it anyway .It turned out that Fahrenheit 451 was one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. It's true to life sci-fi theme puts me in the future world as depicted by Ray Bradbury where firemen are paid to start fires instead of put them out. I read the book once before but the second time around was much better. Allot of details in the book were overlooked by me the first time .It captures the decay of modern day literature to technological advances such as television and amplifies it with a sci-fi twist to the point where literature is forbidden .The reader follows the character montag through the story as the reluctant firemen begins to long for literature .His wife is addicted to television so she doesn't really help him with his self-esteem .He meets a man named Faber who helps him learn more about literature while his secret still remains kept .Eventually he ends up with a choice between his job and his life .A problems with this book is as follows ; If literature is forbidden how to they teach children ? Overall It was a good book and if you haven't read it yet I'd recommend that you do."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Update: The initial photo shows the anniversary paperback version. The NEW amazon listing for hardcover is to be avoided at all cost. Another reviewer added a photo of the hardcover version (the darker cover with orange border). It is a tiny little book (3x5 I think) with minuscule font and cheap, see-through low grade recycled paper. I returned my copy, and I recommend you do the same. The paperback is of better quality. I would never spend $10+ on such a shoddy hardcover. I expect this from unscrupulous 3rd party sellers, but not from amazon.com's actual listing.-----------------------For those who have not read this novel, or not have read it since school (as in my case); it deserves a thorough read. Many of the concepts that Bradbury wrote about were alien to me in my teens. Now, barely over 30, I find that my life experiences as well as influence from other literature and film have helped me to develop a better responsiveness to this work.The novel is quite short and even reading it carefully and thoroughly took me a couple of visits to my local coffee shop. The book does contain some grammatical and spelling errors, but remember that Bradbury wrote this at a very young age (as a series of short stories first), and without a formal composition or literature degree.The message is one that surely hits home in these times: people are often in such a rush nowadays. Literature is being overlooked by many, television is the most utilized media, advertising is rampant in the society, and people have a million little 'diversions' such as twitter and facebook and video games to occupy their free time.I believe that the most unsettling aspect of the novel as applied to todays society is thus: people never officially banned books to begin; instead they just forgot about them and pursued other interests.For any true book lover this is a must read. Again, it has it's problems, but it is an entertaining, mind opening novel deserving of another (or a first) read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The novel \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" by Ray Bradbury takes its name from the temperature at which books burn. The story takes place in the future and it follows the life of a fireman called Montag. Fireman in our current time have the job of putting out fires. In the time period that Montag lives, fireman make fires, burning collections of books since reading books in that time has been outlawed.Ray Bradbury's book is a welcomed defense of book reading that is still relevant considering that many young people only read books because their English teacher assigned them for class. The novel \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" also champions the free press. At one point in the novel, it is explained to Montag by his boss Beatty that the opinions argued in books led to more arguments and that it was best to not allow people to read in order to avoid arguments.As the book progresses Montag becomes more and more disenchanted with his job as a book burning fireman. On top of a defense of literature, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" also makes a fulfilled prediction that people in the future will sit around with earphones listening to music all the time (in the novel the earphones are made of seashells). Sound familiar."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is the story of how, in a future time when books are outlawed, a man goes from burning books to preserving them. It's a cautionary tale, as well as the story of a dynamic human being.I had tried to read this book several times in the past and was never able to get past the first few chapters. The very thought of burning books made me cry, and although I was relatively sure that it picked up from there, I had to put it down several times. The work postulates that books are necessary for three very important reasons: quality of ideas, remembering the past so as not to repeat it, and engendering community between readers. Important function of books, I think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book seemed to be a very interesting. It showed me a picture of the future if the government would not be controlled by the people and books would be banned from reading which would make the people be equal. This would be a problem because there would be bad leaders and people would not be very happy about it. I liked how Montag was standing up for the people which were connected with the books to help them out because he could not believe how the world was run by people who wanted to control the people and rule the country until they die. I learned from Montag that you need to do some courageous things to make this go better and live on a side to spread the word of books which might be passed on and on until the people understand that reading is good for people and people should be smarter in order to have strong leaders not leaders that want everyone to be equal and not allow to do things they want and whenever they want. The books would allow the people to show their emotion and to get over stuff that was difficult to deal with and they also teach us new stuff and expand our knowledge. The literature was banned in the society in which Montag lived because the leaders wanted them equal."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book was recieved in a really well condition. I will order from them again if I need another book!! Although the book is not your everyday entertainment its still good for school assignments."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Very little in the way of review is required for this classic novel, given that its content and themes are so well known. I will, however, attempt to give a response to this monumental work.Fahrenheit 451 addresses the subject of censorship by depicting a society in which books are forbidden. The destruction (by fire) of any books discovered represents a form of social control which is, essentially, a distortion of utilitarian ethics. The fire chief, Captain Beatty, explains to the novel's primary character, Montag, that the work of a \\"fireman\\" is to assure happiness for the many. Utilitarianism, of the kind promoted by John Stewart Mill and Jeremy Bentham, judges the ethical correctness of any action according to whether or not it produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. The character of Beatty argues that books have a disruptive influence on society: \\"[W]e can't have our minorities upset and stirred. Ask yourself, what do we want in this country, above all? People want to be happy, isn't that right?\\" Happiness for the majority is encouraged by \\"the parlor\\" (a form of television) which entertains and generates contentment by avoiding material which could stimulate independent thought and, therefore, anxiety.Montag, however, becomes increasingly dissatisfied with this stagnant social situation, and curiously (given his lack of exposure to books) he expresses his disquiet through an apparent reference to Plato's Republic: \\"Maybe books can get us out of the cave.\\" While this may seem an unlikely observation, it neatly signifies the growing enlightenment in Montag and his desire for further enlightenment - both for himself and for his society. It also draws attention to a somewhat ironic parallel. In matters related to education, Plato was very selective about which works of literature should be used, just as only a few books (mostly technical manuals) are permitted in the society imagined here by Ray Bradbury.But books aren't really the issue for Bradbury; what matters is the freedom of ideas they represent. Books themselves are mere receptacles. Bradbury's interest clearly lies in the censorship of ideas, not the medium that carries them.Fahrenheit 451 deserves its status as a classic. It beautifully conveys the power (and the fear) of ideas, and the conflict between the conservative and pioneering tendencies in human consciousness. It easily earns five stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" by Ray Bradbury a long while ago, but then I've read it again and watched the movie I couldn't say how many times. It's one of those stories you can read, or view, over again. The story is placed in a futuristic society where books are banned and firemen set fire to them wherever they're found. What brings this story back to prominence, for me anyway, is the gradual cessation of printing that has begun as a result of the evolution of electronics. And many schools are also no longer teaching children script. Where might it all end. I remarked to a friend recently about just this situation and she responded with: \\"I'd create a suitable place within my basement to keep books safe\\". That is exactly the sense that one develops while reading \\"Fahrenheit 451\\". The movie follows the book, however, I'd read the story first. And one idea Mr. Bradbury had which has always provided me wonder is the memorizing of book contents. An idea that was copied in the movie \\"The Book of Eli\\". Mr. Bradbury has always been a favorite of mine as has \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is said to be the temperature at which books ignite. The concept of the novel was satirical. The book was set in a sort of parallel universe or alternate reality that says that a government has taken over, which has outlawed books and goes into people's homes and sets the books on fire. There is a law against books even in schools, this seems insane, and the backlash to an idea such as this is the current popularity of books today then the alternative to books, would be the ebook."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is one of my favorites. I have read it through three times now and love it every time. The interesting changes of the future, but steady curiosity of the main character kept me wondering. A splendid story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The narration is more cerebral than story-driven even though Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is one engaging dystopian thriller. What continually surprises me, as well as countless other reviewers, is how prophetic the novel has become. Predicting the future, even only for the sake of story, has a tendency to unravel a novel's relevancy if enough years pass since the original publication. Even that's putting it softly. A novel about the future will cease to matter UNLESS, as in the case of Fahrenheit 451, the story ages in a state of becoming mostly true.My favorite bit of wisdom came from the author's afterward of the particular edition I was reading. To summarize, he commented that people of all ages and all creeds have the potential and often do engage in the act of book burning without ever lighting a single match."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is about the future and what censorship can do to society and the importance of our free speech. People must learn to accept different views, whether they agree with them or not. First off it's about a fireman, Guy Montag, whose job is not to fight fire and put it out but to start the fires. At this time books are forbidden from people unless they were government writings. That is how the government controlled them: by not letting them learn. Although one day he can't help but read a line from one of the books he is about to burn. Of course he becomes curious and steals some books so that he can read them for himself. After starting to read the books he goes to an old professor to see if they can reprint some of these books. One night he came to an old woman's house where they are to burn her collection. The fire captain drowns her books in kerosene except the old woman lights herself on fire along with her books. After seeing this Montag becomes disgusted and decides not to be a fireman any longer. Montag decides to go to work for just one more day and surprisingly they get a call to go to his house where he is the one to light his house on fire. Instead of lighting a match he kills the other men and goes on the run eventually meeting up with a group of old college professors in the woods and eventually becoming one of them.I disliked this book for a few reasons. The first one is because it is a futuristic book it is hard to follow in some places and the author describes some things in a way that is very difficult to understand.The reasons I liked this book is the fact that you have to create what you think the author is trying to make the future look like; and because Bradbury is a very descriptive writer he helps you create a picture of what you are reading. Another reason I liked this book is because I can relate to it. The people in our society are reading less and enjoying television and radios more than they should be."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Having read this novel a few years ago when I was younger, I was hoping now that I would have developed an appreciation for this futuristic experience in words, but I did not. I shall reference specific aspects for my review and explain why this science fiction story still does not appeal to my personal reading preferences.The overall plot includes a fireman named Guy Montag who burns books because they are considered evil now since they make people think and question. The people in this weird society do not read books or think independently. They all watch an overabundance of television on wall size sets and listen to \\"Seashell Radio\\" sets attached to their ears. Montag enlists the help of a retired English professor, Faber, to help him understand the value of books, and why they are in a world with no reminders of history.The \\"normal\\" character in the novel is Clarisse McClellan. If it is assumed that Guy Montag is the protagonist, she is the antithesis of anyone he has met before. She talks with him about the world's beauty and meaning topics which make her an outcast from this society. She makes him curious about the contents of the books he burns. Guy's wife, Mildred, is obsessed with the interactive television programs. She is a shell of a human being without substance whose \\"family\\" attachment is in a soap opera she watches constantly. She is a morbid, complex person who eventually betrays him. The antagonist in this novel seems to be society in general, but also Montag's boss, Captain Beatty. He calls books \\"treacherous weapons,\\" but he clearly uses his knowledge from reading to manipulate Montag without feelings or pity.Guy Montag is a fireman, who burns books and starts fires, rather than put them out, a far stretch of my imagination. After his encounter with Clarisse, he begins to question his empty life, his profession and society. In his intense and reckless pursuit to envision his life and direction, he often blunders and is easily swayed and manipulated by others. The violence and killings throughout the story were not to my liking and interest. The use of the Mechanical Hounds seemed silly and not necessary. In the end, when he joins the \\"Book People,\\" a final war begins, with bombs falling upon the city. This seems to me to be a great start for another novel, one that would appeal to my reading taste."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The plot of this book is based on the future and it's difference from the past. Perhaps the greatest difference is books and how people see them. Guy Montag is a fireman who realizes the significance of books. The twist is however; his occupation involves burning books because people are afraid of them.This novel has very interesting significance because it uses symbolism to give important lesson in knowledge. Books and knowledge. Books and knowledge are what gives us freedom.Learning that we take thoughts for granted is what makes Ray Bradbury such a great author. He managed to give a plot with a sudden turn into the jaw dropping conclusion of Fahrenheit 451. Using symbolic words and quotes of characters, he gets his message out loud and clear.After reading Fahrenheit 451 and learning about how much freedom every person has, Ray Bradbury's words are descriptive and share an important moral about life that the decisions we make can affect everyone else."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am not a science fiction fan in the least, but this is such a classic - how can you NOT like it? It speaks volumes on the way things are today even. I so respect the author's views and thoughts on life and censorship. I think it should make us all pause and consider our own lives and if we're living them to the fullest and grabbing it by the horns!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Just finished Fahrenheit 451 this past week after reading it well over 5 years ago in 7th grade. Back then I thought it was a nice little book to read but unfortunately missed all of the key messages that Ray Bradbury was addressing in our society today.5 years later, I picked this book up again and was blown away again by the story itself and what I missed years ago.Guy Montag is a fire fighter in the non-traditional sense. The setting is an age where houses have been fireproofed not against house fires but against their own fire departments.Books are banned in this society , an atomic war is looming over the heads of the city, and above all of this is the agony that Guy Montag must face as he makes a decision on questioning the same job he has faithfully executed year after year.This novel is both fascinating and unnerving with the same turn of a page. A future where movies and television (parlors) block out all of our problems instead of addressing them could very well happen one day. A future where books are no longer useful in a society dominated by the entertainment value of Hollywood.A fine read if you ever get the chance to pick up this novelTravis S"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ok, I saw the movie \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" and I thought it was well-made (even though I didn't agree with most of the content). So, the next day I hear that Ray Bradbury (the author of this novel) is furious at Michael Moore for stealing his title. The name sounded really catchy and this dispute sounded like it could brew into a controversy between Moore and Bradbury. Also, I wanted to see what the whole thing was about since they label it a classic.So, I picked up the book and I was blown away. This book is really short yet it is so intriguing. It's basically about this guy who is in a futuristic time where the government does not allow people to read books. If you are caught with them, they have a special crew of \\"firefighters\\" who go and torch your books (hence Fahrenheit 451: The temperature at which paper burns). Kinda weird, eh? Well, it gets better. This society basically doesn't think on it's own. The reason that books are not allowed is because that they influence people to think and it does not fit well into this new society.Then the protagonist (who is a \\"firefighter\\") wonders what is so powerful about books after witnessing a lady willingly being torched to death with her books. He is very unhappy with his life and figures that maybe the content that books contain (which he has never read before) might be the key to livening up his useless life.I'll stop there and let you figure the rest out for yourself because this is one book that you would want to read without much knowledge of it. It's quick, yet thought provoking about how society even today could change into something similar to that. Excellent read. Make this a definite addition to your potential reading list."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was a Ray Brudbury fan for a long time before I finally picked up this book. I have to say, while it is a brilliant piece of utopian literature and should be required reading, the fact that Bradbury threw it together on a pay typewriter in a public library shows. The underlying point of the book comes across sharp and clear, but at the expense of much of what is quintessential Bradbury. His deep probings of character and deep pools of thought are whisked away to make room for a fast-paced story that in my own opinion could have been at least twice as long. Anyhow, let Farenheit 451 be your door into Bradbury's world, and when you're done pick up Something Wicked or Dandelion Wine, find your way to the Illustrated Man or the October country and you'll find Bradbury's real treasure"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Though I was long familiar with many of Bradbury's works, I had put off reading Fahrenheit 451 in favor of other books until a friend lent it to me recently. After finishing it, I'm angry with myself for having taken so long to pick it up. This book is a fantastic tale of a future society that abandons intellectual development and destroys its books. Like all great literature, it offers insight into our society today despite having been written over a half-century ago, and it continues to reward reading today.This book is more than a seminal work of dystopian literature, however; it is also one of the most elegant meditations on the value of literature in modern society that I have ever read. In envisioning a society that destroys books, Bradbury has to explain what is lost as a result. His answer, as we see in Faber's expositions during Montag's visit, is the exact thing which makes this book worth reading - the insights we gain into our own world and our own lives through reading. Integral to this process, of course, is the fact that people must read them and put what they take from them to good use for a society to thrive; as Bradbury notes, the first step towards the world of his novel was taken when people stopped reading. It is this message which makes this book essential reading, especially in a society where entertainment today bears an ever-closer resemblance to the noise-dominated media depicted in Bradbury's nightmarish future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are only going to get one Bradbury novel this should be it. There are many reviews about the plot, so I will not go into that. The story is one of the greatest ever told. Bradbury is very adamant on his views of education and reading and writing. This book proves that our ability to express feelings would be lostwithout writing. Get this book, but with some caution. It may seem a bit boring at first, but once you read it a few times you will grow to love it. A great work of art should not be very acessible, and this is a great work of art."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a futuristic story of the dark ages. Guy Montag, a fireman with the job of burning books, sees a problem with book burning after meeting a nonconformist neighborhood girl. Ultimately, this leads Montag on a path which encourages him to discover books. While he was told books are nonsensical and useless, he discovers their beauty. Montag rebels, destroying his own home and killing the fire chief. As a fugitive, he ends up on the outskirts of the city when a war destroys his former homeland. The insinuation is that the book keepers who live outside the city will bring about the end of the dark age, rebuilding civilization.Bradbury's futuristic society is effective because he creates a thorough picture of the future. In the same breath, I think the scenario is realistic because people do not read as often as they once did. It made me think about the likelihood of a new dark age.The story starts off slowly. Montag seems to have an unhealthy obsession with the young girl. But as the story develops, more conflicts are evident. As a consequence, the story flows more smoothly. I particularly enjoyed the police chase. The mechanical hounds seemed very realistic. They would seem to be such an effective crime fighting tool for this day and age.I would suggest this book is a classic. If you enjoyed &quot;1984&quot;, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, or &quot;Animal Farm&quot; for the ideas they stood for, you should enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you have ever heard the saying &quot;Don't judge a book by its cover&quot;, you'll notice how Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a perfect example of that. Since I was assigned this book to read by my mom after she read the reading list Mrs. Spehar gave us, I didn't get that enthusiastic with it at first, especially with that title. I thought it was going to be a book where I had to struggle to keep myself awake to read it. After reading the first 4 or 5 pages though, I was proven totally wrong. I became engulfed in this book and couldn't stop reading it. The story felt so real that I could picture it happening in our society without a doubt in my head.I enjoyed reading about how Guy Montag's character unfolded throughout the story and how he realized that just because something was the law didn't mean that it was exactly right. It is good how he followed his beliefs and didn't let anyone tell him that he was wrong. A downside to this book though is that my favorite character, Clarisse, was run over by a car. I believe that Bradbury just added that part to just take her away. I believe if Clarisse would have lived, she would have been at Montag's side and the overall story could have been so much better.Also, I believe that Bradbury could have changed the ending a little. That was the least exciting point of the book. The jets flying by overhead and the city being destroyed was very exciting, but after that, the overall excitement of the book just died off. I am not going to be stereotypical and say that all of Bradbury's books have a dull ending (because I haven't read any other one), but I will say that he should have fixed this one up a little.All in all, Bradbury has written a good book. Not perfect, but good. I think that this is a book that few should be without reading because it can actually knock some sense into them to not be fools and stand up for what they believe in. The book portrays a world that could possibly be our own in a few years. The fate of this world though, will rest upon our own hands."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Before I decided to read this novel, I knew one thing and one thing only about this book, and that was that it was about burning books for some reason. Now that I have read it, I am blown away by how this was written and how thought out it was.The novel starts out set in the future, the main character and the protagonist in this case is a man by the name of Guy Montag. Montag takes great pleasure in his profession, which is a fireman. I like how his job is not to put the fires out but to start them. The fires they start are the burning of contraband, which in this case are books. You aren't allowed to read in the future because reading causes people to think by making them curious and the government jams what they want you to think down your throat. Which isn't too different with today's society, with the video games and television, the reading of books is decreasing, causing people to become less educated. Now a day's television programs force feed you their biased opinions which I think isn't too different from what Bradbury describes. The reality they live in isn't a pretty one. Drivers instead of having a maximum speed limit, have a minimum one. This forces them to drive at blazing speeds and they actually run people over for fun and wars come and go numerously which is absolutely insane.Montag soon becomes bored with his job and his life in general. He steals a book from the collection he was supposed to burn as a means to lower his increasing uneasiness. This leads up to my absolute favorite part in the book. The owner of the books he stole which is an older woman refuses to leave her home, which is to be burned to the ground. Instead, the woman sets fire to her house herself, and stays there as her books and she are destroyed. It makes him realize that the written word is a very valuable thing and only the very enlightened know that.The next thing I liked was that, after hiding the books he had stolen, he was forced to burn his own house and all of his possessions which is a great turn of events. He then gets into a scuffle with his boss and he is warned that he will be dealt with severely. Montag then kills him and is soon perused by a Mechanical hound, which can track anyone down. He then kills that with a flamethrower and retrieves his books.This leads me to the part I disliked, the ending. Montag essentially meets up with a group of intellectuals and hides out until it is once again safe to print books. When bombs destroy the city, they sift through the rubble and begin a new society where man is free to learn and prosper. The reason I disliked this is because it really didn't describe what the new society would have been like. I really wish Bradbury went more in depth on what the new society would have been like.Lastly, although I loved this novel, it could have been way longer, perhaps by not ending the novel where he did and maybe going more into the future and explaining how everything ended up. All in all I am very happy I read this book, and I would recommend this to everyone. Not just the guys."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This story of shattering the oppression of American literature has raised many questions among readers of all walks of life. Guy Montag's expedition was one of self-realization and immense resolve. The inspirational journey involved self-discovery and social hardships. Fahrenheit 451, lets the reader into Guy Montag, a fireman who is slowly but surely seeing his warped world for what it is. The author, Ray Bradbury's clear and descript way of writing shows the reader what type of man Montag is. Bradbury also opens up a new world in describing the city and its citizen's beliefs.Being one of the most unique books of its kind, it's no surprise Fahrenheit 451 has been read and analyzed over and over. The story begins with Guy Montag happily burning books, but by the end of the story, his entire perspective of fire itself had changed completely. All in all, Guy Montag learned that burning the fire is the only way to cure his war-torn world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman; he starts fires to burn the houses of people who keep books illegally. He enjoys his job and doesn't ask any questions, until a series of events open his eyes to the emptiness around him, forcing him to question everything about himself and the society in which he lives.The story that Bradbury wrote over fifty years ago is every bit as effective as the day it was published. The censorship he describes isn't simply the result of an overbearing government, it begins as a function of the masses, whose desire for political correctness and 'happiness' lead to the destruction of things that offend and stir emotions. The solution, along with burning the offending books, is to bombard the senses so as to eliminate the thought process entirely.In this age of political correctness and mass media, Bradbury's words ring more true than ever. His vision of a society where all men are not created equal, but made equal, is a stern warning against the elimination of individual thought and the idea that true happiness comes from being constantly entertained.I can't begin to do this book justice; nearly every page contains a thought-provoking passage. Bradbury wrote a classic whose truth is timeless and that everyone should read at least once."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read. Just imagine living in a society where reading books is illegal. The way that Ray Bradbury wrote this book is magnificent. The reader can easily visualize the flames when he describes the burning books.Guy Montag is a fireman who never questioned his job. In this world, a fireman was not hired to put out fires but hired to burn books. When Guy Montag met a seventeen-year-old girl who tells him of a past where people read books to learn and to read for pleasure instead of burning them, he begins to doubt his chosen profession. What's wrong with owning books and wanting to read and learn about the past and read for pleasure? Why can't society be the way it used to be. Why do we live in a world in which the government feels that it must control every aspect of our lives? These are just a few of the questions Guy asks.Imagine Guy Montag's horror when his wife discovers a stash of his illegal books in her own home! He now must explain to her why he has done this. Just because it is illegal he doesn't feel it to be such a terrible thing. Mrs. Montag is not only saddened by her husband's deception, but totally frieghtened of the consequences.Fahrenheit 451 is a must read! It is a very imaginative and fascinating book. It grabs the reader's attention from the very first page to the last!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is a fast-paced science fiction novel about a futuristic society that has outlawed the reading of books. The main character is Guy Montag, a fireman whose job it is to burn the books and the houses they are found in. Montag thinks nothing of his job and is perfectly happy living an ignorant life, along with the rest of his brainwashed culture. That is, unitl he meets Clarisse. A 17 year old who doesn't fit into society, Clarisse begins to open Montag's eyes to the reality of the world he lives in. This book is interesting, powerful, and a bit scary. The writing contains many similies, metaphors, and other forms of descriptive writing. Although sometimes confusing, 451 makes you think a lot about society today and how it could be in the future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury has written a book that made me feel as if I were Guy Montag. He uses situations of panic that seem unfair and confusing. This is a very useful writting trick that made the book better and slightly frightening for me. If there were 900 stars to award this book, I would still give it a five if the scale were the same. Ummm... I can't think of anything else to write. I was hoping Clarisse would come back towards the end of the book. She didn't. That's okay. I guess. She sounded hot. My lungs are failing, so I need a ham sandwich. Bye. Oh yeah, and the book is good."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is remarkable. Fahrenheit 451 by Rad Bradbury is an intriguing book about what would happen if a society had gotten rid of books. I totally have grown to like this book. I have read it 3 times over and every time I Loved the way Rad Bradbury wrote as if the book was a debate of literay authors and ideas. The reader can visualize the pain and risk Guy Montag the main character goes through. The first thing I noticed about this book is the cover. How clever to have a person burning with newspaper and the title &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; which is the point where things burn. The best part of this unique book to me is the last part &quot;Burning Bright&quot; and the afterword. Bradbury's writing stands out the best. The reader can totally feel the fatigue as Guy takes his last step, before realizing he is safe.This book sparked a new &quot;flame&quot; for me because I could feel and taste the burning of books and how it could impact my society now. I can just feel what would happend if my city,state or country burned books. The chaos and killings. Books now are looked at as last resorts. The internet has taken over all books. But this book made me think a lot too. I reread his afterword and coda twice because I like to think of how he came up with this idea and his writing style. This is a great book that not only gets the reader lost in this world of burning but notices different authors, books, and new ideas that can bring just a better new generation of authors, poets and everyday writers and thinkers to come as one and share to the world that as quoted in Fahrenheit 451,&quot;Knowledge is Power!&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a well written and thought out science fiction novel that has many different levels of understanding to it. The book is designed to force people to consider the future of society seriously. This book is great because it changes the roles of people in the future to make the plot interesting. The plot of the book is set at a brisk pace to keep the reader from putting it down because the author is desparately trying to prove many points that are hidden throughout the story.The book places you into the future where the government tells the people what they can read and how they can live. The majority of the people loose their independence because they allow this to happen without protesting and they deserve what horrible thing will come of this. There are a few people like Montague who begin to fight back against the government. Montague used to be a fireman who in the government contolled society burns fictional books until there are none left in the city. The government wants all fictional books burned so everybody can be happy all the time. It turns out the people become ignorant because there are no fictional stories to compare their lives to. Montague attemps to escape the government with a few allies helping him out by storing the memories of the books in their heads to share with generations to come.Montague at first loves his job as a book burner, but he changes as he sees how ignorant the people in society are getting. Montague's curiosity lures him to the books. Montague is independent unlike all the characters in the story who are brainwashed except for Montague's ally Faber. Faber is a frightened old man who used to be a college proffesor until the government ruled that there will be no more fictional books, and he was forced to live alone without his beloved books. Montague came along and changed Faber so that he wasn't like all the other ignorant people. Faber now will fight back for what he believes by helping Montague bring books back to life. Montague and Faber need eachother to live in this society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am not such a fan of Ray Bradbury but his book Fahrenheit 451 is excellent and is now among modern classics in the same line as 1984 and Brave New World. Most new versions of this book carry with it a great introduction from Bradbury about how he typed his manuscript on a typewriter that cost 10 cents to use every half hour. The story was first published by Playboy magazine. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which books burn.Inspired by Hitler and Stalin book burning, 451 tells the futuristic tale of a fireman, Guy Montag, who works for the government as an emergency book burner that sets fires to books which have been banned. They storm houses, dig up floor boards, find books, destroy them and then arrest the owners.Montag begins to question the controlling society that he lives in. Why is he burning books? Inevitably this leads him to seek out books for himself and with it the paranoia of being found out while working for such an oppressive regime. There is some very good plot twists and the story is full of tension, suspicion and mistrust.You will read 451 in a day or two. It is less than 200 pages long and easy to get through. A modern classic that you should not miss."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first encountered this book at the age of 13, I was more accustomed to 'choose your own adventure' books or pulp science fiction. I'd never heard of Bradbury, but realized as I fought through the first few chapters that I was in over my head. I stuck it out however, and when I was done, my life had changed forever. Since then I have read this book many times, and it is always with a particular fondness because this is the book that taught me to read. To read as more than someone who desires nothing more than to be entrained.That is not to say that Bradbury isn't entertaining. I've always found him to be one of the most successfully entertaining science fiction writers of all time. FAHRENHEIT 451 is on of his best. Conceptually simple (books are outlawed and the world has become a dreary, dystopian place where cheap thrills and wars fought with disease bombs are the norm) but wise and deep in substance, Bradbury successfully weaves characters and plot into a profound statement about the essential nature of human kind and how the best of our writing can, if used (read) properly, even save us from ourselves.There are few accolades that I can give this book that have not been already said more eloquently elsewhere. This is book filled with profound truth, a book that inspires, and a book that illustrates the best and worst of what men are capable of. Ultimately about the hope we have in the sum of human knowledge, few other books will make you treasure the act of reading and the privilege of owning books like this one will."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was a journey through the future of what our world turned in to. Guy Montag was a firefighter, but instead of putting out fires, they started them. In their world books were illegal and anyone who had them in their home would be removed and their house would be burned. Montag has burned many houses, but this one burning really struck him and he took a good look at reality. He never noticed the importance of books and goes through many, many adventures you'll just have to read for yourself.I personally don't like science fiction, but this book really grabbed my attention. At the beginning it was a little difficult to understand what was going on and it was hard getting into the story, but as you read on everything starts to fall into place and make sense. The thing about this book that I found the most interesting was I read it and almost felt as if things in that book were true. It seemed like our world would end up like that in their century, this book was very believable and made me want to read more. Everyone should read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" at least once in their life because it is very well written and a truly wonderful book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Ray Bradbury's classic, Farenheit 451, he describes a terrifying but all-too-real world of sensory overload and thought-depravity. Guy Montag is a fireman, but this fire brigade doesn't put out fires (for houses are fire proofed with plastic coatings), but instead starts them, burning houses (and often people) where books are found. And people, for the most part, don't question the way of things; in fact, most people simply contributed to them, reading less and less, being less and less interested in dissenting views and complex views of reality. Instead people opt for graphic novels filled with sex, and talking \\"parlors,\\" living rooms with televisions on three (and sometimes four) walls that surround the viewer in a virtual reality that becomes family, friends, entertainment, and knowledge. There is no taking walks, no late evening chats on the front porch; in short, little or no thought. But Guy slowly emerges from the haze of this contrived reality, as he first encounters a strange girl who doesn't seem to be charmed by the way things are, and then comes to see his own duties as a fireman as brutal and senseless. Didn't firemen used to actually put out fires? he wonders.Montag, now repulsed by his occupation, starts looking for a way out. And on the way, he begins slipping books into his coat as he is burning houses, one here, one there, until he's got his own little library. But soon his captain, Beatty, is on to him, and the mechanical hound, the instrument of doom and seeker of people and books, finds him out. Montag is left with the choice, burn his own house or admit guilt. He starts his house ablaze, but then turns the flame thrower on Beatty and on the mechanical hound and makes a break for it. He is now a man on the run, but a free man for the first time. He finds himself among a group of run-aways along a deserted railroad track, and discovers they are former professors and preachers, and each one holds inside him a chapter or a book. One is Thoreau, one is Marcus Aurelius, one is Plato's Repulic, and so on. Montag is the book of Ecclesiastes. And as their civilization seems to be spiraling toward an end in a huge and destructive war, the wisdom of that great book, that everything has a time and a season, seems a pointer to the possibility of a new reality, a fresh start.Bradbury's Farenheit 451 is a prophetic novel that bears freightening resemblance to our world today. Our culture resembles the reality he paints in its obsession with virtual reality (think \\"reality TV\\" and our obsession with this fictive family or friend network, as just one examle), media saturation, and shallowness. Our politics are driven by sound bites and media experts more than they are driven by policy positions and reasoned debates. Marketing is more important than product quality. And this is just the beginning. Reading Bradbury's classic is like a wake-up call to appreciate the wisdom of the ages, the beauty of friendships, the value of family, and the wonder that is a quiet walk in the woods. It is truly a treasure trove of reality, all tinged with the hope redemption."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was first published in 1953. It is one of those books that for some reason I was never required to read in high school or college. For that reason, I am trying to read a few of these classics each year. I was not sure what to expect as I am really not into futuristic books, however this book blew me away with its accuracy of predictions some 55+ years after it was first published.Fahrenheit 451 details the eternal war between censorship and freedom of thought and continues to be relevant today more than ever. In Bradbury's future, books are illegal and happily so--citizens are too busy watching their wall-sized televisions and listening to their in-ear \\"seashell\\" radios to care about the loss of good literature. Guy Montag begins the novel as a fireman who enforces the temperature of the title--that at which books burn--but then transforms and tries to show his society the mistake of censorship. It's a treat to hear Bradbury read his own work, almost as if a wise elder were sharing a cautionary tale. Sometimes the slower pace seems awkward for a novel of such action, but overall the reading does justice to the timeless classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was the first novel to describe what would happen if people couldn't think. It is an interesting story that you don't find much. The world it draws up has no basis. This is because people can't think. In Fahrenheit 451, people are not allowed to have books because the government is afraid of an educated society. This book is very distressing because censorship could happen today. If there was censorship, the world would become dull and disturbing, as nothing would happen. There would be no great events, and this would cause no one to realize anything. This is the reason that it is still popular today. It is because of how controversial it is, in the fact of the world it portrays."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a masterful speculation of what the world would look like if events continued to unfold in its destructive progression.

Now that houses are completely fireproof, the firemen no longer need to stop fires. Instead, the have a new job: to burn books.I liked this book because it kept me wanting it to keep reading and reading to the end. It was even hard for me to go to sleep some nights I was reading it.

But the novel is much more than that. There is more depth to it than a simple dystopian novel. It really is a warning to a future where TV and Film surpass reading ten fold as a prominent form of entertainment. It's not just the prophetic style that makes this a great read; It's also Bradbury's superior writing.

Its place in literary history is assured with good reason. That Mr. Bradbury so accurately pinpointed that censorship would get out of control is only matched by Orwell.But Bradbury has been resisting the ebook format, stating that he prefers the old fashioned book, with its smells and textures of pages. I understand that and I prefer to hold an old fashioned book myself. But books allow us to have so many titles at our fingertips at a time that they have become invaluable. And now he has allowed this jewel to be the first of his novels to be in this format.I can only hope that his short story collection is next. It is very thick and quite heavy to take outside the home to read; then again, we need all his books in e-format...all his books can be considered classics."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was actually purchased for a friend of mine as I still have my original copy from when I was a kid along with a first edition I picked up on eBay. This is the book that first started my interest in my favorite genre of science fiction, dystopia. Ray Bradbury's story behind this book is almost as amazing as the book is in itself. I'm not going to go into it, but Google it sometime. This book is written about a world in which houses no longer burn and censorship is rampant. Because of these two issues, firemen eventually become part of the government censorship and burn books. This novel is a short read but it leaves you feeling changed. This is in my top 5 books of all time and will always be on my shelf."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"So I finally got around to reading Fahrenheit 451 and all I can say is that it's one heck of a book. Bradbury's dystopian tale of disenfranchised \\"fireman\\" Guy Montag is so spot on in some places, I had to do a re-read. The book was published in 1953 but some of the depictions are eerily current. For example, Montag's wife, Mildred, spends her days gorked out on TV from the three wall installed sets in their house. She says: \\"It will be even more fun when we can afford to have the fourth wall installed. How long you figure before we save up and get the fourth wall torn out and a fourth wall-TV put in? It's only two thousand dollars.\\" (p. 20)Sounds a lot like a plasma screen to me.When Mildred entertains her friends, the talk turns to children. One woman, Mrs. Bowles, says: \\"I've had two children by Caesarian section. No use going through all that agony for a baby. The world must reproduce, you know, the race must go on. Besides, they sometimes look just like you, and that's nice. Two Caesarians turned the trick, yes, sir. Oh, my doctor said, Caesarians aren't necessary; you've got the hips for it, everything's normal, but I insisted.\\" (p. 96).Isn't there a growing trend for elective Caesarians these days?The references get eerier when Montag talks of anti-American sentiment: \\"Is it because we're having so much fun at home we've forgotten the world? Is it because we're so rich and the rest of the world's so poor and we just don't care if they are? I've heard rumors; the world is starving, but we're well fed. Is it true, the world works hard and we play? Is that why we're hated so much?\\" (p. 74).I shivered when I read Bradbury's description of a hotel about to be flattened by a bomb \\"that was an inch, now a half inch, now a quarter inch from the top of the hotel\\" It was an image of 9/11 all over again, those horrific moments before the towers were struck. Montag's estranged wife is in the hotel. He imagines her looking up at the \\"ceiling as it and the entire structure of the hotel blasted down upon her, carrying her with a million pounds of brick, metal, plaster, and wood, to meet other people in the hives below, all on their quick way down to the cellar where the explosion rid itself of them in is own unreasonable way.\\"It's a sickening, visceral description and Bradbury nails it.I only hope he's wrong about the rest of it; that firemen start fires instead of put them out; that reading is a capital crime; that entertainment is a televised manhunt in which the unfortunate victim is dispatched by a diabolical mechanical hound.Bradbury is brilliant. The book is chilling. It's on a lot of reading lists. I wouldn't be surprised to find it on the list of banned books. If Bradbury is right, the future's coming and it isn't pretty. But there are survivors, men and women who are charged with remembering, who are living chapters of books that no longer exist.So maybe there is hope, too."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montague, a fireman in Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, can't imagine anything better than watching books burn, the pages blacken and crumble. Guy's world is a futuristic America where firemen burn instead of extinguish and where books are illegal. Books will offend some people, so they all burn. As Beaty, the Fire Captain, explains so bluntly, \\"We can't have our minorities upset and stirred. Ask yourself, What do we want in this country, above all? People want to be happy... Don't we keep them moving, don't we give them fun? That's all we live for isn't it?\\" And they do. Their world is all about entertainment, the faster and more they get, the better. Guy is compelled to ponder his world after meeting a young, seventeen-year-old girl, who actually watches and thinks about the world, and then she disappears.Bradbury's skill with words steers you effortlessly through the gripping story. I sincerely enjoyed reading this book. I could not put it down and after I finished it I wanted to start over to pick up on the details that I was sure I had missed. I would recommend this book to anyone willing to think. However, because of its depth, less experienced and younger readers may struggle with understanding and grasping the authors message and purpose.Even after fifty-eight years, Fahrenheit 451 still retains a prophetic bite that makes you stop and contemplate our own world's direction. It leaves you considering your own life and where you are allowing it to go. Hopefully enough people will stop for a moment and care, or we will end up in the same shallow world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The beauty within Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 comes from how it begs you to look at the world around you. The futuristic society depicted by Bradbury in the 1950's is almost frightening because of how closely it resembles the world that we live in now. We have filled our lives with technology and arguably have become more removed from society than ever before. Instead of sitting on the porch and conversing while watching the sunset or listening to crickets we tend to turn our television sets and let the propaganda and the garbage be forced down our gullets. This book opens your eyes and paints the picture of a very feasible and very scary future and it forces you to be aware of what is happening around us.I have read positive reviews from people who love this book and also reviews from those that think it is an overrated piece of garbage. When forging my own opinion of this book I look at the messages that Bradbury seems to be trying to convey and how well he does that. I have found that the most acclaimed message in the book is that propaganda and technology are poison to the human mind. The book creates a world where human beings have been hollowed out by these things and have become nothing more than automated drones seeking only entertainment - and to be free from worry and woe. Bradbury has said that the theme of his book is that television takes away the desire for people to read and appreciate literature.Aside from the previously mentioned theme - I feel that the most spectacular part of this read is the satirical society that Ray Bradbury has created. I feel the message goes further than television eats away at your mind. I found that the most significant message in the story is that technology as a whole is dangerous to us. The book illustrates how technology has people moving faster and faster and becoming detached from each other (comparable to real life). People in the society only care about what is on television, or about driving a 100 Miles Per Hour, or going to amusement parks. Families are not close-knit; people send their children away to school and never really know them. It seems that every person in the world around the main characters are completely empty and do not care about the well being of anyone. This is one of the most interesting points of analysis that I have found in this book. Comparing this to how people are becoming in real life. It is almost hard to admit how similar our world is to the horrible place from Bradbury's imagination.I cannot say that this is the greatest book that I have ever read, but I did really enjoy it. Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most thought provoking stories that I have ever read. I find it to be extremely interesting from cover to cover. It is a book that you can read several times and come away with different ideas and messages each time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really loved this book. I'm sure the average reader will, too. Bradbury's prose is rich in metaphors and images and most of all, you capture his intent and feeling that he perfectly places in every moment of the book.The world the book is set it is ironically similar to ours today, and I find it kind of funny how Mildred is so incredibly similar to some people I know myself.Science Fiction is a label and this book is more of a homily. It's an important read because it asks so many questions...how does Our America compare to his?Read this book and decide for yourself...are you in progress and on track to being in a \\"parlor family\\" or are you curious enough to learn and love the World we live in."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 is a dystopian novel where a Firemans job is not to put out fires but to burst into peoples homes like cops on a drug raid , find their books and then burn them. I thought this was a good book but not on the level of some of my favorite dystopian novels like 1984, Brave New World, Camp of the Saints, The Iron Heel,or even some of HG Wells or Phillip K. Dicks work for their predictive see I told you so qualities."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The story is simple, but powerful. As other reviewers have noted, some of the details that Bradbury imagined in 1950 (when he wrote it, not the publication date of 1953) have come true (large TVs on the walls, a move towards simplistic sensationalism, the deep distrust of education and educated people, etc.) I found the writing to be serviceable, sometimes brilliant. Occasionally the metaphors get too long winded and overly descriptive.The 50th Anniversary Edition, published by Ballantine Books/Del Rey is wonderful. Not only do we get the full unedited text (ironically, this book about censorship has been censored frequently over the years), but we also get the afterword and coda (added in the late 70s, early 80s) and an illuminating 10 page interview with Bradbury himself. In the interview he describes his writing process, how he thinks the book holds up today, and whether or not he'd write a sequel. It's a great addition to the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This classic novel of the future by Ray Bradbury is amazingly original. The thought of firemen starting fires is dark and quite odd. Burning books, though, is one of the scariest things about the theme of this book. It almost makes me afraid that this could happen not in the too-distant future. Book lovers out there, Fahrenheit 451 might give you a big chill."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is not your normal fireman. Instead of putting out fires, he starts them. We find this out right at the beginning. It is not just regular fires he starts, but book fires. If they catch you with books, they will burn them, and maybe they will burn you. In this society, they don't want you to think.There are walls that speak to you, you can drive as fast as you want, billboards stretch out for hundreds of feet because they want to make sure that you still get advertisements drilled into your head. Is this in the future, or did Ray Bradbury know what our society was coming to?When Guy came home from work, he met up with a strange girl who was curious, charming, and not like anyone he has known. She put questions into his head, and he would never be the same. After their meeting, he started to sneak books into his house knowing what would happen if he were caught. The question is: should he risk his life for the sake of knowledge, or live like everyone else: happy but ignorant?The only problem I had with it (and I don't normally say this) was that it was too short. It ended so quickly, that I didn't see it coming. I read this book in highschool (like everyone else) but it had a different effect on me the second time around. I definitely recommend it, especially for book-lovers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451. The temperature at which books catch fire and burn.Odd title, but not as odd as the story itself. The community in which this story takes place seems strange, but it's shockingly similar to our own. Both in their community and ours, citizens follow what the government says and do it without question. In this case, people don't read books. If they do, firemen burn them. It's simple, but in Ray Bradbury's account of this tale, it becomes very complex.Guy Montag, the main character/fireman, discovers that this process is wrong. Firemen should not destroy homes and books. People should be aloud to read. But what can he do? Find out by reading Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Yes, I *do* read classics once in a while... :-) Our local library was sponsoring a program called &quot;Everyone Reads&quot; where a number of people all read the same book and have discussions about it. Fahrenheit 451 was the featured book, and I've been meaning to reread it anyway. You probably already know the storyline... Reading books is a banned activity, and firemen are not used to put out fires, but to burn down houses where books are being covertly hidden. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which paper burns, hence the title. The main character, Montag, starts to wonder why people would still risk having books, and ends up becoming a book hoarder himself. His house is burned down, and he flees before he can be arrested. He meets up with other readers in the countryside and decides to remember and preserve books rather than return to the city, which, by the way, just got anniliated by atomic warfare...This isn't so much a novel as a longer short story critiquing society's ever-decreasing attention span and lack of time spent actually thinking. Everything is based on entertainment, and ideas and concepts are spoonfed to the public in short, repeated soundbites. Sound disturbingly familiar? I found it amazing that, 50 years after having written the book, Bradbury's view of the future isn't that far removed from reality. We don't burn down houses with books, but we try to censor ideas and make everything &quot;politically correct&quot; so that no one is offended.This particular paperback edition is the 50th anniversary edition of the book, and features an interview with the writer at the end. He also expounds on what the characters in the book would say and do now if the book were to be expanded.Well worth reading (or reading again if you haven't done so lately)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What began as a short story in 1950, evolved into one of the greatest American novels of all time. Fahrenheit 451, originally titled The Fire Man, was Ray Bradbury's first novel. It is ironic that the place that Bradbury chose to write a novel about book burning was in a book haven - the basement of the University of California's library. Fahrenheit 451 takes place in a future where knowledge is despised and thought of as an unequalizer. People are made to believe that in order for everyone to be happy and live in harmony they must be equals. Since books spread knowledge and knowledge is an unequalizer, most books are banned from reading and burned in order to be kept from society's hands. Due to the fireproofing of houses, firemen are no longer needed to put out fires. Instead, firemen set ablaze houses that contain illegal books, sometimes burning the people within the houses if they refuse to leave. Guy Montag was a fireman who loved to watch the flames dance in the sky and the books shrivel and die, that is until he met a young girl named Clarisse. Clarisse opened his eyes to the world around him, and no longer did Montag want to burn books, he wanted to save and learn from them.The story picks up when the protagonist, Guy Montag, is walking home from work with his baked on smile and the smell of kerosene hanging about him, having just finished attending a call from the firehouse. While nearing his house, he is accompanied by a strange young girl who introduces herself as Clarisse McClellan. They begin to talk and Montag realizes she is very different from everyone else he knows. She looks at the world around her and sees it for what it is and then takes the time to wonder why it is that way. Before they part, Clarisse asks him something that turns his world upside-down, she asks, \\"Are you happy?\\" (Bradbury 10). One might say that those three little words are the most important in the entire book because they set in motion the series of events that are to follow. At first, Montag tries to laugh it off saying, \\"Happy! Of all the nonsense.\\" (10). However, as Montag entered his house and looked around the quiet rooms and at his silent, stone-like wife, he knew that he was not happy, he knew that something was missing.Subconsciously, Montag knew he was not happy for a long time and had been collecting books from the houses he went to burn. After further discussions with Clarisse and much thought of his own, Montag realizes that there had to be a better way to live and that books could teach him how. Montag pulled out the illegal books he had been hiding and began to read them. However, try as he might, he could not understand and retain what he was reading. Bradbury compared Montag's struggle with sand and a sieve, \\"the faster he poured, the faster it sifted through . . . His hands were tired, the sand was boiling, the sieve was empty\\" (78). The sand is a metaphor for the knowledge within the books and the sieve is a metaphor for Montag's brain. The more and the faster Montag read, the faster it slipped from his memory.Montag continued to try to read and learn more from books and was found out by his boss, Captain Beatty. Of Montag's situation, Beatty makes an allusion to the Greek myth of Icarus, saying \\"Old Montag wanted to fly near the sun and now that he's burnt his damn wings he wonders why\\" (113). In the story of Icarus, his father Daedalus builds him a set of wings, fastened together with wax, so that he can escape from the island of Crete. Icarus was reckless, though, and flew too close to the sun so that the wax melted, breaking his wings and causing him to fall to his death. For Montag, the island that he was trying to escape from was not a physical restraint, but a mental island of ignorance. Montag was reckless like Icarus and came too close to the sun, in his case, knowledge, which caused his downfall, according to Beatty.Overall, I found this book thoroughly enjoyable and frightening at the same time. I look at the world around me and see it slowly turning into the world that Bradbury so vividly described. There are several students in my class that when given the assignment to read a book and do a report on it, opt to watch the video and skim the cliff notes instead. Movies and cliff notes merely brush the surface of books, which is what the parlor walls in Fahrenheit 451 do to all the information and stories it portrays. The idea of a future society where people do not think about their actions, the consequences, or of anything with substance is terrifying and yet incredibly believable in this day and age. It is this idea that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I just read this book a couple days ago (it's a quick read--just a few hours) and felt it portrayed a lot of what I had been thinking for a long time. My mother always shuns shows like &quot;Family Guy&quot; and &quot;South Park&quot; because she feels they are too politically incorrect, but she misses the point of them entirely. Political correctness is good, but to a point. In the aforementioned shows, it's used to make points about society and often the ridiculasness of people who aren't tolerant. In Farenheit 451, people have rejected this in favor of making eveyone happy. The point is, in a world where free though isn't allowed, no once CAN be happy. Montag's wife is a victim of the new society, a woman who refuses to think about anyone or anything that upsets her and is completely enveloped by her tv shows, or her &quot;family&quot;, where everything is perfect and everyone is laughing. In fact, a common theme throughout the book is people saying they are happy only to let us discover later that they really aren't. At least they aren't subconsiously. This is evident in the beginning when Montag's wife tries to kill herself. The social commentary, even at fifty years old, is still very striking. The burning of books is only a part of this novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury opened the book with the line &quot;it was a pleasure to burn&quot;. A shocking and simple sentence began a story set in the near future where a firemen's job was to set fire, as opposed to putting them out. As the story progresses, the main character, Montag, meets more and more people who gradually begins to change his views of the society and analyze his actions as a fireman. What made this book interesting was the radical concepts and belief that the society embraced. The story tells us that a fireman&iexcl;s job was to set fire on books, which were considered to be bad. Not just books were bad, but knowledge in general was viewed as sinister. Montag lives in a society that only promotes very basic information to the public, and knowledge was forbidden and strictly controlled.The title of the book is also closely related to the content. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&iexcl; is the temperature at which normal book paper catches on fire. I thought this title was not only unique and related to the story, but it also attracted its readers. By only stating &iexcl;Fahrenheit 451&iexcl; I would think to myself &iexcl;What would this book be about?&iexcl; and &iexcl;What is the significance of this particular temperature?&iexcl; These continuous questions really increased my curiosity on the book.I thought that the most successful aspect of this book is its ability to portray an image in my mind. Though Bradbury's vivid expressions, I could picture the scenes in the book. Bradbury used figurative language as the paintbrush to construct the image. Personification, metaphor, and similes were extensively utilized. In the first page of the book, every sentence contained figurative speech. For example, through Bradbury's magical use of language in &quot;With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world&quot; (P. 1 lines 2-4), I could very clearly portray a fireman holding the hose with kerosene coming out like a python spitting it's poison. This does not solely portray an image; it also leaves a strong memory, and impression afterwards. Through the use of these powerful and impressive words, Bradbury carved an everlasting image in my heart. I especially adore the quote &quot;He strode in a swarm of fire flies&quot; This effectively produces a complete image in my mind of Montag happily walking through a bunch of burning ashes. The &quot;swarm of fire flies&quot; really produces an everlasting powerful image.Another reason I gave this book five stars is that I thought it was not just an entertaining and poignant book, it was also a book that moved and influenced me as well as triggered me to contemplate about the presence and the importance of knowledge and books. The first time I read it, I could not understand it, so I read it again. After the second time reading it, I was stimulated to ponder about the significance of knowledge. I felt very deeply that controlling knowledge through the destruction of books is extremely inappropriate. I very powerfully felt that books were important to us in our daily lives, and that every one of them has value, and they should be kept and treasured. My emotions changed from detached to extremely motivated. I felt that this book really portrayed a very different world, such that books are absent. Through indirect speech, Bradbury has really moved and changed my views. I thought this book was both very thought provoking, enjoyable, and very well done. I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" has some very interesting ideas, but they get bungled in the execution. The book was written in the 1950's and takes place in the unspecified future. Books are now illegal and no one learns to read more than is absolutely necessary. The world is in a constant state of war, but drugs and mindless T.V. programs keep most people pacified.The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman. But firemen no longer put out fires; they start them to burn books and the houses that harbor them. (Because there is no written history, very few people are aware that this was not always so.) Montag meets an intriguing teenage neighbor, Clarice, who challenges him to think and not conform to society. This leads him to reexamine his life, and his relationship with his dull and placid wife. Montag is also troubled by a conversation with an old man about a year earlier. Though he was sure this man was harboring books, he never turned him in. Finally, Montag steals one of the books he is supposed to burn. He dreams of collecting books and sharing them with everyone willing to listen.What's good in this book are the theoretical ideas: the sheer horror of the society being depicted (it's like a less complex \\"Brave New World\\"), and the image of thousands of people memorizing books so they can keep the words alive. Here we see that books are not paper and ink, but living words that start with one person but can touch everybody. This is what makes them so potentially dangerous.Although the book is very involving, and reads quickly, I was dissatisfied with some aspects of the plot. Montag's conversion was much too quick. If that was all it took, why weren't there millions of others like him? He doesn't come across as an unusually bright man. Also, I think the ending of the book is rushed.A minor complaint: The 50th anniversary Ballentine edition is riddled with typos, which should be unacceptable in a commemorative volume."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;If they give you ruled paper, write the other way.&quot;-Juan Ramon JimenezIt is truly amazing how a person, different in any way from his peers, can be so the same. The year is somewhere in the 21st century and Guy Montag is a fireman--whose job it is to set fires instead of putting them out. The government of the time has professed a law which makes reading or merely owning a book illegal and the punishment? The books are burned along with your house and all of your belongings. Censorship and conformity are on an uprise in this world and Guy is right in the center. T That is until Clarisse, a girl who calls herself &quot;17 and crazy&quot;, tells him of a past where people were not afraid to be themselves. With the motivation Clariss gives him and the help of Faber, a once upon a time english professor, Guy plans on telling the world the truth about the books the government will not allow them to read. Fahrenheit 451 is a book filled with suspense and multiple plot twist that keep you reading until the very last page."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's 1950's sci fi classic presents a plot frequent in futuristic tales: the rebellion of the protagonist against the mind-numbing status quo. Fireman Guy Montag knew the pleasure and psychological rush he experienced while burning books; it was privilege to ride the Dragon, to bear the Salamander emblem on his clothing. He delighted in destroying remnants of a previous era, when people foolishly believed and reacted to the printed word. Seeking ever more speed, noise and violence to substitute for lack of intellectual and emotional stimulus, this culture has become shallow, enjoying superficial interactions and slavish obedience to mass mentality. This was a disposable society, where the government manipulated war and city officials doctored the news--to keep an audience or merely save face.But Montag gradually realizes his own dis-ease, as doubts creep into his mind; he begins to stash forbidden books in a secret chache, and to seriously consider the ideas of the school girl next door, whose family has been watched and labeled as antisocial for years. It is very dangerous for an individual to question or defy the prescribed pattern for Happiness, as dictated by mass media techniques. Was there some secret--vital to mankind's happiness and peace of mind--hidden within those scorned and banned books? Could one man save civilization from its own misgudied zeal? This gripping tale (under 150 pages) depicts a society gone amuck; RB provides many serious themes for thoughtful readers of all ages to digest.The 1968 film, though inevitably different from the original, is also a powerful statement. I saw it as a student in Italy. While walking home from the theatre, my companion remarked grimly: &quot;Nobody's getting My books!&quot; It made us realize that we should not take books for granted or ever underestimate the power of the written word."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"They say Bradbury's amazing, but he really didn't impress me at all. It seems that he tried to write in such a sophisticated way that the book became boring. The Fahrenheit 451 is slow going, and very hard to understand. We had to read this book as a class and almost everyone found it confusing. Even the ending hardly made any sense. The book is going on like normal, and suddenly it all ends abruptly. Bradbury has failed to make the writing interesting, and it is not easy to tell what's going on. For example, the whole plot is not appealing. There is a society where books are not allowed, and Montag (the man who burns alot of books) ends up liking books. He has to run away from others and hide for a long time. Some details were completely unnecessary, and had nothing to do with the book. As soon as the book starts getting even a little good, Bradbury drifts off to another topic and that slows down the whole flow of the book. When some things were going on in the book, it is like Bradbury didn't want to get off that same topic at all. If something happened, or there was a discussion, Bradbury made it as long as possible. The book failed to entertain me, and I do not reccommend it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book has been raved about as a classic SF story for many years now, so I decided it had to be worth reading. How wrong I was! As with many so called &quot;brilliant classics&quot; the author gets a novel idea and then tries to run with it. Unfortunately, the story fizzles out completely towards the end and the full impact of the original message dies with it.

It is much better, and deserves its status as a classic unlike this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the best books I've ever read. I say this without skipping a beat. Like many people, I first read this book for school, and I fell in love with it. Fahrenheit 451 is an essential book for any reader, young or old. Bradbury did remarkable things with this little book, and I know I'll never feel the same way about censorship again.Fahrenheit 451, the temperature at which paper catches fire and burns, is a hauntingly appropriate title for this book. For a controlled and thoughtless society, the reading of books has been outlawed (note, the READING of books - a point in an important scene which Bradbury wrote but never placed into the book and can be read in the Afterward). Deep thoughts are discouraged, and the public instead recieves no more than what I sometimes call \\"on a platter\\" entertainment, such as the wall-to-wall television screens and miniature radios which are placed inside the ear to block out all other sound. Firemen are now paid to burn books and the houses in which they are hidden, to protect the society that books are believed to endanger.Like another favorite book of mine and also another very necessary book, Lord of the Flies, whos fiftieth anniversary passed last year with an unfortunate lack of recognition, Fahrenheit 451 takes place during a war in the outside world. Also Lord of the Flies, little light is shed on the subject of the war, although in Lord of the Flies it is often assumed that the war is World War II. But, as Mildred Montag and her friends know, \\"It's always somebody else's husband who dies.\\"Guy Montag is a fireman who, after meeting a young woman by the name of Clarisse McClellan, becomes disillusioned with the burning of books. Montag's life changes when a book falls into his possession and, needing to see what's in the tomes that are so forbidden, begins to read.As the book unfolds, Montag's metamorphosis is astounding. A pleased, fire-loving fireman becomes a curious reader and fledgling scholar, becomes a man determined to do something about the dangers of book-burning, no matter the cost.The book is not only a good book, an important book, but also a NECESSARY book, an IMPORTANT book, which I think everyone should read. I highly recommend Fahrenheit 451 and Lord of the Flies, both excellent and thought-provoking novels which will capture the interest of those willing to think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's prophecy of a distant (or not so distant) future is essential reading in these times of self-censorship through the dumbing-down of the national dialogue. The story seems to peter out at the end, but as a plot device it succintly allows for the discussion of numerous topics that have 'come true', at least nearer to true than the time of the original publication. For instance, listen to Beatty's history of book-burning that encapsulates a media-saturation and political sensitivity (p. 54). Or perhaps you're intrigued by the dead-on Hubris Americana Montag bemoans in the post-war period (p. 74)? Faber's recollection of a Jesus before merchandising rings as a true indictment of the modern church (p. 81) - and his threefold explanation for the importance of books (quality of ideas, leisure to think, and freedom to act on the preceding two on p. 83) should be carefully considered by all of us as we rip through our reading lists. This book delivers an impact, and is well-worth the read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Not to be confused with fahrenheit 9/11, Fahrenheit 451 is the classic dystopian tale of rebbelion and the invasion of media in our private lives.It is the story of Montag, a fireman who burns books. He loves his job, until one day he meets Clarrisse. Clarrisse is a seventeen year old girl in love with life, in a society so desperate to escape life that it never notices its many wonders. In Montag's world, billboards have to be 200 feet long so that people will notice them. The walls of Montag's home have giant television screens that his wife spends all her time watching. The walls don't tell stories, they just give people feelings.Montag accepts all this until Clarrisse comes out of the blue to shed a new light on everything. She tells him about grass having dew on it in the morning, about the blue sky, and he changes. Slowly, but he does go through a change.Bradbury's writing has been accused by some reviewers as dull. I found his writing insightful, and very interesting. One of the many fascinating things about these amazon reviews is that there are large groups of people who find that the writing was too slow, completely disregarding how writing styles create mood. But amazon has created an environment where anyone can write their opinions. If you really want to know how good this book is, read both the best and worst reviews. Then, if you find that the good outweighs the bad, at least in your mind, then read the novel. Afterwards, you should try reading the reviews that are most contrary to your personal opinion.To reiterate, Breadbury is a genuine genius, he should be commended, this novel is a masterpiece, and you should check out the worst reviews for this book for further intellectual stimulation."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Prior to reading the book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, I knew nothing about the book other than it was considered a classic by mane Some how I managed to work my way out of reading the book all through high school and it has always been on my list to read. So I decided to choose the book for our semester independent reading project, and I am glad I did.This science fiction novel expressed the natural occurring communism in a futuristic setting. Interestingly, the books setting could easily be believed to portray our world one hundred years ago. The reality of the book is somewhat depressing in that it actually is a lot closer to the truth than we would like to believe. Books have not been banned yet, but many schools across our country are not aloud to use certain classic novels in their teachings. And maybe we are not under a mind control because of the banning of books, however our sources for entertainment operate on mind control and there are ads for just about anything surrounding our lives.This novel does indeed deserve the literary merit I has received over the past years. The novel itself steers away from descriptive science fiction and into a more dreamy approach, which leaves more imagination on the readers' part. One of the overriding themes of novel is knowledge vs. Ignorance, which the main character Guy deals with the entire novel. He must decide whether to continue to read books and continue to gain knowledge, or to just be happy like everyone else and continue to be ignorant. Ray Bradbury's novel is quite intriguing and a very quick read. I recommend this book to everyone before entering the college level, for it is a classic which has been read for over 50 years."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was one of the best books I've ever read. I had to read it in high school and I'm glad for it. Bradbury's vision of the future is shockingly similar to our own society now. Sure we're not burning books, but many of us would prefer to be entertained by watching television than reading a book. This vision is also a future where censorship has replaced free press, shying the people about the disturbing world events taking place. Since this book was written in 1953, many would think that Bradbury's vision of this future would have been proven wrong over time but to this day school districts are banning certain books, such as this one, for what ideas they might express.This book is about a possible future where books are outlawed and firemen are given the job to set them ablaze. The story is centered on one particular fireman named Guy Montag who after meeting a seventeen year old girl and an old professor, decides to join the struggle to preserve books before they are wiped out forever."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury has twisted imagination, fears, thoughts and a quick lesson together to capture our senses and keep us turning the pages!There is a certain depth to this book that is unreachable to anyone unless they are willing to dive beneath the surface to get it. Not only do the characters have feelings and thoughts; but all around the words are the feelings and sceneries that only the imagination can take in. What is actually shocking to realize is that our [country] is turning into exactly what this book says! No...were not burning books, but our entertainment and media has started controling our minds to thinking anything hard is not worth doing.Bradbury has taken all our thoughts and fears on the future and taken to writing them down into a book. Fascinating as it is, its only our fear that our society could actually turn into this nightmare."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was a real page turner. It had a certain depth to it, one that could not be reached unless the reader was willing to dive beneath the surface to get it. It had so much information packed into a good adventure, it really taught [me] to appreciate the books we have today and that we can enjoy learning at the same time as finding the lesson taught inside it. Not many books have the same perspective as Fahrenheit 451. Not only did the main character have feelings that could be seen, but all around the words were different emotions and settings in them that made you feel like you were there, and it was so creatively written it made you think harder than most books normally do. Ray Bradbury knew what he was writing so well it flowed like thoughts, and he had the same thoughts as most of us do. But he kept them in these pages for us to read now and in the future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I think the author wrote this book to tell people, who read this book, that it is necessary to bend or break rules once in a while. I agree because if you live your life always following the rules, and not making mistakes, you kind of get used to being perfect. You have to make mistakes and do something wrong once in a while. Break out of the shell and live your life curiously.I think Ray Bradbury handled setting the best because if you read this book correctly, you would figure out that the setting explains everything that happens. I love the way he uses bunches and bunches of personification, similes, metaphors, imagery and many other figurative languages.This book is science fiction. It's good because he uses so much imagery that you can literally see what the setting looked like and see what they were talking about. Some details in his book are for sure ficton but the way he described the government and the fire department is really, really unique. Ray Bradbury is an excellent author with a good imagination.I don't think the book is less than perfect because he makes the book reals and you wouldn't want to change something so realistic. I'm not saying that the setting is real, like today, but he tells you. No. He shows you how real the city is. Once you read it, you wouldn't want to change anything. I recommend this book if you love science fiction or fantasy books, you will fall in love with this book and the author."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am currently doing a research project for my sophomore project in my Honors English class. Part of the project is to read a book the author has written. My teacher told me about Fahrenheit 451 and told me that I should read this one. I didn't really know much about this book before she refered it to me. The opening page sucked me in and now that I have finished the book, it makes me wonder if society will ever turn out this way. It is amazing how Bradbury \\"predicts\\" the future with some of the events in his book. After reading this book I have so far brought the movie, and the movie The Martian Chronicles. I also want to read the book. For a teenager in high school who doesn't like to read, I'm hooked!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I taught \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" as the example of a dsytopian novel in my Science Fiction class, although it is certainly one of the most atypical of that particular type of narrative discourse. Compared to such heavyweight examples as George Orwell's \\"1984,\\" Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World,\\" Yevgeny Zamiatin's \\"We,\\" Ray Bradbury's imaginative meditation on censorship seems like light reading. But the delicious irony of a world in which firemen start fires remains postent and the idea of people memorizing books so they will be preserved for future generations is compelling. Of course, there have been more documented cases of \\"book burning,\\" albeit in less literal forms, since \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was first published in 1953, so an argument can be made that while all the public debate was over how close we were the Orwellian future envisioned in \\"1984,\\" it is Bradbury's little parable that may well be more realistic (especially in terms of the effects of television).The novel is based on a short story, \\"The Fireman,\\" that Bradbury published in \\"Galaxy Science Fiction\\" in 1951 and then expanded into \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" two years later. However, those who have studied Bradbury's writings caw trace key elements back to a 1948 story \\"Pillar of Fire\\" and the \\"Usher II\\" story from his 1950 work \\"The Martian Chronicles.\\" Beyond that, there is the historical record of the Nazis burning books in 1933. The story is of a future world in which everyone understands that books are for burning, along with the houses in which they were hidden. Guy Montage is a fireman who has been happy in his work for ten years, but suddenly finds himself asking questions when he meets a teenage girl and an old professor.\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is not only about censorship, but also about the inherent tension in advanced societies between knowledge and ignorance. Reading this novel again I am reminded about Pat Paulsen's editorial on the old \\"Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\\" (a series well acquainted with the perils of censorship) about how we might enjoy freedom of speech in this country but we do not enjoy freedom of hearing because \\"there is always the danger of something being said.\\" Censorship, in practical terms, is the effort of those who do not want others to hear what they find offensive, for whatever reasons, basically because it leads to people thinking thoughts they do not want them to be thinking. Through the rambling diatribes of Captain Beatty, Bradbury makes this point quite clear to his readers.Even though this is essentially a novella, Bradbury's work retains the charm of a short story. The recurring use of animal imagery throughout the story, the use of the mythic ideas of the salamander and the phoenix, make \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" more poetic than any other dystopian work. Even if it is predominantly a one note argument regarding censorship, it is impossible to deny that Bradbury makes a clear and convincing case for his position. Besides, there is something to be said for any work that insures that beyond the point at which water freezes the only other recognizable number on the Fahrenheit scale is the point at which book paper starts to burn."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451Ray BradburyScience FictionFahrenheit 451 is a story set in the future about a fireman who starts fires. Unlike today, all houses and buildings are fireproof, making you think firemen would be unnecessary. Firemen however, have a different job. They burn books. If a civilian is found with a book, Guy Montag and the other firemen burn it, and the person is sent to jail. All his life Montag had thought burning books was the right thing to do, something to which the world had become accustomed. Then he met 17-year-old Clarisse. She had what was then considered an unusual family. They would just sit and talk for hours at a time. Montag begins to form a friendship with this girl, and comes to believe she has a lot to teach him. Clarisse walks Montag to work everyday, talking to him about many things; her uncle, about how people don't talk about anything, and about the wonder of books. Then, one day, Clarisse disappears. She isn't there when Montag walks to work, making him surprised and confused. After a few days without Clarisse, Montag asks around, and finds out she was killed in a car crash a few days ago. Not having Clarisse to discuss life with causes Guy to wonder, is burning books right? What ideas do these books hold? This story is continued as a trail of where this thought takes him, and of the tragedies and joys that occur because of it. I believe the writing style of this book fits what Ray Bradbury expects life to be like in the future. It seems to be slow, dry, and boring. Bradbury uses detail to the point where it is meaningless. He gives three examples when one would do, and elongates things until they are uninteresting. At one point in the story Montag is sitting in the firehouse, listening to all of the sounds. Bradbury explains about \`the flutter of cards, motion of hands, of eyelids, the drone of the time voice in the firehouse ceiling, and the tick of playing cards on the greasy tabletop.' It would have been much easier and quicker to use two examples and get on with the story. No part about the book hooked me, and I had a hard time finishing it. Although the plot was good, this book could easily have been fifty pages shorter. The author is also very repetitive; using the same dry language many times over. Words like pretty, and nice can be found repeatedly as the story progresses. Although I'm not in love with this story, I think it's worth reading. This book made me realize how in America we always talk about being having freedom of speech, but never what we can or can't read. I can't imagine a world where one of the things I love the most was outlawed. Overall, I can't really give this book a number of stars. Scoring Fahrenheit 451 on my enjoyment, it gets about two stars, but on making me think, it gets five."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"...and seriously though-provoking.

As you read the book many similarities can be seen today, such as large billboards, people not talking to each other, a society dependent on drugs and entertainment and reality TV shows and of course the rushing around in a rat race.Whats amazing is that Ray Bradbury wrote this book in 1953 some 50 plus years ago and unlike the book 1984 written by George Orwell this book is ignored by the media and pessimists of todays society and our future.For those you like science fiction with a large dose of reality please read this book before you die from drinking the Kool-Aid."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was very much looking forward to reading this book, a good friend has been recommending it for some time. I must say that it took me a little longer than I thought it would to read. The language for me was little hard to follow at times. Some of it was so chopped up that I would have to go back and reread the page over to try and understand the message of that page.I thought that the themes themselves were very prevalent to our day. I am finding that more and more that children are unwilling to read and want to play video games or go on the internet. The idea of how books are slowing being eradicated is spot on in current events. I really liked the message of how knowledge will set you free, and the good, and bad that can come from it. (As the snake said to eve, you will be like a God.) I also liked his idea of the TV walls and how it clouds the mind with loud noises and bright colors. I found that to be very interesting, especially with the outburst of 42\\" TVs and all the crave for the latest gadgets. I find it very ironic that Amazon is out with their new product Kindle. No offense to them but I do not support that item.One thing that I did notice was that as I was reading it reminded me a lot of \\"The Giver\\" by Louis Lowery. I know that The Giver was written afterword but I actually liked that book more that his. I also understand that it was more meant for children, but think that the ideas presented in her book, almost paralleling Bradbury's book, were very well written and thought out. I also thought that her book was simply just a little more easy to read.Either way, this still was an excellent book, with a lot of different issues that I think have a love of prevalence in our current status. If you liked Bradbury's book, I would greatly recommend The Giver."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Good read!The most amazing part of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is that it was first written in 1950. Wow! That blows me away, a futuristic book written 58 years ago that in many ways is was right on.The characters and story are excellent. Some of the writing in the book, I found to be difficult to grasp. Alot of intense dialogue between the main characters, several times, I wasn't quite sure who was talking to who.Overall, a very good book, I look forward to reading some of Ray Bradbury's other classics!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451. 451 is the temperature at which paper burns. How did we find this out? Learning, and with learning comes books, and according to this story with books comes burning. This story follows one man, one guy actually. Guy Montag is a fireman. However not the definition of fireman of which you think. This is a world where the past is burnt and all is forgotten and minorities are eliminated. Books are for burning and your family is all on a T.V. wall. People die and nobody cares. Nothing matters as long as people are happy. Houses are fireproof and books are the exact opposite. I really liked this book. Bradbury's book shows our own flaws as well as those to come. Montag's fire captain, Beatty, tells him how the firemen got started, \\"\`Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to popular songs [1] or the name of state capitals [2] or how much corn Iowa grew last year [3].'\\" We have all of the game shows. 1. Don't forget the lyrics. 2. Are you Smarter than a 5th Grader. 3. Jeopardy. This book was written in the 50's. Over 50 years later (almost 60), this is beginning to form. I hope that this does not happen. For if it does, who knows what we will lose next. Will it be our real families? Our front porches? Our books? Our identity? This book is very controversial. It's ironic that every one in this book is anti controversial and don't ask questions and yet this book brings up so many questions. It also makes you question yourself and what you think. With all of this technology being brought into our world, we're not against it but we don't hate it. With all of the new innovations by the time we buy something it's already obsolete. When you buy a computer in a few weeks they all ready have an updated version. Sometime its just nice to stop and smell the roses. Thank you for your time.-Marvin"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Mention \\"Farenheit 451\\" in casual conversation, and the casual response is (especially if you are highschool or lower): \\"Ooh. Did it freak you out?\\" And yet, is the \\"Farenheit 451\\" of our cultural stereotype all that accurate? Yes, Bradbury's world is a distressing one, but the story itself is, in the end, about perserverance, about the human love of knowledge, and about how a group of people lives to fight against a world that doesn't want to know. As Montag, or \\"Ecclesiastes,\\" discovers, there are still things worth fighting for. And while we may cringe every time a Chesterton slides into the incinerator, the true meaning of the book lies in Montag's determination to save some knowledge from that incinerator.Is it a distressing setting? Yes, of course. As some of the other reviewers have said, that often is because it's far closer to the truth than we would like. But, of course, that's the reason Bradbury wrote the book. But under all that is a story of hope; a story that, if we dig just deep enough, can empower us to face the danger and the distress and to let us prevent \\"Farenheit 451\\" from being a nonfiction book.So the one thing you should know if you're not sure you want to read \\"451\\" is that it's not \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\" Not by a long shot. In the end--and with Bradbury's writing, you will get there fast--it is a distressing world, but a heartwarming story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I chose to read Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" for a High School Book Report. I thought the fact that so many of the ideas portrayed in the book by Bradbury are still very relevant today was fascinating. The book was published in the 1950's, yet Bradbury's ideas about the influence of of media and its effect on society are evident today. Society as a whole has had its general thought process effected (to some extent at least) by the media with ideas portrayed in ad campaigns or television shows, which make decisions for you instead of letting you develop some of these ideas on your own.Another theme that the book does well is representing the effect of censorship on society. The protagonist of the story, Guy Montag, begins the book oblivious of his own ignorance towards the world around him, not changing until a thoughtful teenage girl (Clarisse) causes him to question why everything is the way it is. These questions lead Montag down a path to enlightenment in which Montag discovers the reality of an unaware society. \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" does a superb job of displaying the harmful effects censorship can cause: a society of robotic citizens who find ignorance more attractive than actually exploring life.Another reason I enjoyed reading this book was the fact it was very thoughtful and left a lot of different ideas open for interpretation. The book did seem a little bit dry at times, but it was not a bad transition because it allowed for time to interpret a few of the many ideas presented in the novel. I thought that \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was an excellent read and I would happily recommend it to anybody who enjoys something more meaningful and thoughtful than an average novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is another author, like George Orwell who has the ability to see the a possible future and present it in a way that appears to be a time in the life of an individual character, as well as surrounding characters who are experiencing the same world. Whether this is a made up story or not remains to be seen, because as the author states in Coda, \\"\\"The point is obvious, there is more than one way to burn a book.\\" But it is told in a manner that is all so more believeable in todays current world of technology than perhaps it could have been percieved when it was first concieved. Bradbury like Orwell are writers that having discovered them, I feel fortunate to know that there are many things they have still written I have not yet read, but I certainly intend to!Something to truly look forward to!Guy Montag respresents an individual who with help from a mysterious \\"Girl\\", awakens from the slumber he has found himself in. It seems to me that even now, this fantastic creation if truly appreciated for the message it delivers, can continue to awaken others who are not seeing the entire picture.Told in a manner that is clearly intellectually sound, the implications are truly frightening.Five stars isn't enough to rate this, nor would ten or any other amount if it existed here be.I will certainly be absorbing more of his writes.And if you haven't read this, although frightening I don't believe I could recommend that you do so more highly.

In this futuristic, dystopian universe houses are fireproof and firefighters burn books. Books have been banned because they make people think uncomfortable facts, however most people are too caught up with their wall-to-wall TVs and fast cars for the thought of reading to even cross their minds. Montag loves to burn and thinks he is happy with his life until he meets a girl who thinks about the world in her own way and a professor who remembers when books were treasured rather than banned. The story follows Montag as he slowly comes to realize how he really feels about the world he lives in.Fahrenheit 451 explores deep ideas about human nature, censorship, and the balance between knowledge and comfort. The most disturbing thing about this book is how close Bradbury was to our life today. Almost 50 years ago, he imagined things similar to cell phone earpieces, big screen TVs, and super highways. Other things are exactly like today: constant advertising, mindless entertainment, an endless war that most people forget about, and political correctness restricting peoples' speech. In the world of Fahrenheit 451, books have been banned because they make people think uncomfortable thoughts.This compelling book is a quick, but by no means light, read. Bold, artistic language and a fast-paced storyline makes Farhenheit 451 seem less like a vehicle for a sermon, and more like a window through which one can view a different but eerily similar world. His word choice and use of imagery creates a surreal feeling throughout the book, forcing the reader toAs good as Bradbury is at description and ideas, I felt that many of the characters were fairly one-sided and seemed to only exist to spew out speeches about differing points of view. I found it hard to relate to them, and didn't sympathize with them at all. However, part of Bradbury's point is that in this world human relationships aren't valued. Perhaps the character under-development was done on purpose to force the reader more into the mindset of the time.Overall, this book was thought-provoking and beautifully written. Its overarching message of individuality vs. comfort is just applicable to today's world as it was 50 years ago when the book was written. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to think more critically about the world in which we live in."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"'Farenheit 451' is rightly deserved to considered a classic much on the order of the works by George Orwell. Written almost sixty years ago, 'Farenheit 451' brilliantly and concisely captures the overall demise of society through the \\"dumbing down\\" of people by the media and socialist-leaning government. People become automatons, unwilling to think or feel pain. Books become the enemy because they speak of reality and pain. So in 'Farenheit 451' the government outlaws all books, and \\"firemen\\" become government backed literary arsonists. However the author brings us hope in the form of the lead character, a fireman himself, who begins to think for himself and crosses over to another world (figuratively speaking :-)). His life rapidly unravels and transforms.I suppose my only quibble with 'Farenheit 451' is that it somewhat overloads the story with a sub-story of a world war about to begin. I'm not sure why the author introduces such a distraction other than to tell the reader \\"hey, none of the citizens care about the war because they are too brainwashed from the government and media\\". I think \\"Farenheit 451\\" could have been just a little better without such silliness.Bottom line: a near perfect read. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book tells an intriguing and dystopic anecdote about.....books. It is thought provoking, and evocative. Every person should read this book, and think not of the absurdity of premise, but of the unfortunate parallels one sees."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Throughout \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" I had a mixture of feelings running through my head. For the most part, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys futuristic novels. However, there were a few parts that I disliked and would like to tell anyone about before they read it.The beginning of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" starts very suddenly. The author sticks you right in the middle of the story it seems. I very much disliked how the book started for this reason and this reason only. I felt as if I started reading the book in the middle and missed the introduction of what was going on and whom everyone was. The only positive side of this abrupt start to the book is that it definitely doesn't start out slow. This made the book a pretty easy read.The only other parts that I didn't like so much were the ending, and the character Mildred, Montag's wife. I didn't like Mildred very much because she just seemed like a shady character. When the book started off by her trying to commit suicide, that event turned my sympathy for her away. I just think that there should have been more background or more to the story line that had to do with her seeing as how she was the main character's wife. Then, there was the ending. I really didn't like how this ended because, like in the beginning, I felt like it just ended. The story, to me, had not quite been finished yet.Finally, the main parts that I enjoyed throughout the book! The main reason this book interested me was because I had heard such great things about it. My favorite part was the way the setting was created. Originally written as a futuristic novel, Ray Bradbury was putting his ideas of how the future, or what is now present day, would be like. I also liked how easy it was to read. I love it when books get more interesting the further in you read, and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is definitely one of them. I also enjoyed seeing where Montag's plan would lead him next or what it would cause him to do."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read Fahrenheit 451 five years ago, having bought it as an introduction to a book club, and to this day I can't remember any of the other books I bought with Fahrenheit 451, only this one magical book. Ray Bradbury is well-known as a sci-fi author, and even as a legend in literature, and I'm a believer that 451 is his best. It's subtitle describes perfectly the premise of the story: \\"The tempature at which book paper catches fire and burns...\\"It is a haunting book, filled with strange machinery that you realize during your reading you'd hate to see invented. For those of you who love books like me or even the American Constitution, this book will have extra meaning, as it's about censorship to the extreme. In fact, Fahrenheit 451 would be one of the books burned first had it been in this book. Another aspect of this novel is its description of a human's need to preserve our freedoms, and the drastic ways in which this is done. Imagine, human books.This book is relavent to today's world, as some censorship is slowly leaking into our society. A very important read indeed, and I'd recommend it not only as a sci-fi classic but also as an American classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"An excellent read, thrilling and provocative.

Guy Montag is a fireman who has done his job for ten years, never questioning the pleasure of seeing books burned and consumed by flames. Then he meets a girl who shows him that life is not all burning and speeding. She shows him that if you take the time, life has a deeper meaning. He begins to question the burning of all the books he never had time to read and understand. He is driven by a madness to find out what the books say.

He has to make a choice between the illegal life he never knew and the ignorant life as a fireman."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Having first heard of Bradbury after reading The Martian Chronicles, I immediately fell in love with his writing and was itching to read Fahrenheit since I had heard so many good things about it.The brilliant novel was better than I thought. What took me the most was the sheer realism of such a strange world. I could feel the pain and fear the characters endured throughout the story as the infamous \\"burning of books\\" took lives and houses. I really got the sense that books were as taboo (let alone illegal) as narcotics are today.The edition I read included an afterward by Bradbury reflecting upon his own story after about 20 years. I was impressed that he felt that he wouldn't have changed much if he had the chance. This was but another bulletpoint in my list of reasons to have such high respect for this acclaimed author. Fahrenheit 451 was a fantastic read and I encourage everyone to read it, especially sci-fi fans and librarians :)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a book I had always meant to read - so when a 16 yr old I know had to read it for class I read it too. It's a quick, entertaining read. Nothing earth-shattering for adults, but I can see why it's recommended for high school (or even middle school) kids."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is one of my new all time favorites. While this author has some problems with his interpretation of our society as seen from his point of view 50 years ago, his language, full of metaphors, couldn't be more beautiful. As the song says, \\"If a picture paints a thousand words...\\" This author can paint a picture with a few of the right choice of words."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is my favorite book--I have read it three times! Consequently, Ray Bradbury is my favorite author. His style of writing is so captivating. I would, however, say that this book seems to me to be an acquired taste. I LOVE it, but a few of my friends don't like it at all. I think you need to have a certain maturity to read it. When my stepdad first introduced it to me, I was probably still in middle school. I gave up on it after reading the first 20 or so pages--I just didn't get it. A few years later, I picked it up again, understood every word and idea, and loved it!I recommend this book to friends and many of them say, \\"Oh, that book? It's so weird.\\" But you'd be surprised; when you read it, it's almost like looking into a mirror of our world's future. It really makes you think--is this where we're headed?Buy it. I can't guarantee you'll like it the first time you read it, but give it a chance. If you want great literature, this is it! And check out some other Ray Bradbury books and short stories too; I highly recommend them!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a must-read book in many ways. Written in 1953, the author was able to predict (in some fashion) the coming of Cable TV, personal music devices, and non-stop urban violence. Bradbury was a prophet.The object of Bradbury's wrath is intellectual sloth, which, left unchecked, results in censorship and a barbarous society where everyone acts on impulse. The author does not merely elevate the importance of books while trashing the influence of media: he elevates the importance of ideas, of thought. Bradbury condemns careless reading as easily as he condemns mindless television. Nor does he find electronic media to be useless: Bradbury's Professor Faber admits that film, music and television can make important contributions to society, when the individual films, songs and programs convey coherant ideas. The Clarisse character further emphasizes the importance of ideas by exploring the arts of conversation and observation.This is an excellent book which defines education, and shows the consequences of an uneducated society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a 190 page, high action novel, written by Ray Bradbury. The plot is about a man named Guy Montag, who is a Fireman. Only in his days, firemen aren't the same as they are now. This book is set in the future, and Montag didn't fight fires, he started them. He lives in days where books are prohibited. The government and the media control everything and everybody. People aren't allowed to read so that they can't be smart and don't know reality. Everybody in his society owns a parlor. A parlor is a huge TV that covers an entire wall of a house. Montag has a wife named Mildred, who lets the parlor get the best of her. At first, Montag loved his job and actually got joy out of watching books burn. His job takes a big turn after watching an elderly woman burn in her house for her books. He also took a book from her house and asks an old friend to help him come up with a plan to eliminate the firemen. I would recommend this book to anybody that likes action, and likes a little challenge in his or her reading.Ray Bradbury has great characterization for each character. Montag is definitely the protagonist is this story because he understands what is wrong, and he wants to fix it so that nobody else is hurt from these firemen. The antagonists are the firemen and the government. The government is what created this illiterate, controlled society, and the firemen are what keep it like this. The great characterization helps the reader a lot, because when new names are mentioned, you're not clueless on whom they are. You know a little background on everybody and their relationship to the main character, Montag.I think the theme of the book is: \\" Even if it's just you against the world, always fight for what is right.\\" This is the theme because others are afraid to stand up to authority, but Montag isn't because he knows his good cause. He realized he was wrong for so long, and he then chose the right side; and he' willing to fight for the people that are scared to.The language is very understandable. The author does use figurative language so the story is more intriguing. He uses great imagery to explain different settings people, and things. The author's language and style are very effective because while reading, you can actually visualize everything going on. The author's style is unique because his descriptions are like no other. His words allow the reader to actually experience what Montag does, which is what makes the story so rich.The point of view changes from time to time. At times it is told in third person with dialogue, and at others, it is in first person. It's great to have different point of views because you get different perspectives on situations. When told in first person, advantages are you know Montag's feelings and thoughts. When it is in third person, you get a full overview. The tone also changes. It can be emotional or very action filled. When Montag expresses himself the tone gets emotional and calmer, but when there's lots of commotion it gets more hectic and dramatic.The story's conflict is with Montag and his surroundings. The type of conflict is person vs. society. The plot definitely thoroughly explains the conflict with background on how it started, and possible resolutions.Fahrenheit 451 is a great novel to read. It teaches us how lucky we are to have freedom in what we want to do. It also shows people that are very kept to themselves, to rise and let their voices be heard. It also helps us appreciate books more and embrace our intelligence."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"of the future (and, boy, is it *not* pretty!).For all Americans' talk about how they don't trust anything they see on TV, they sure do parrot what they see as fact time and again: They talk about characters in soap operas as if they were real family members (like the \\"families\\" of the parlor walls in the book), they trust what Fox News throws out as fact every day of the week (shades of the book, again), and things have improved so much in this country that years ago there had to be an entire cable channel created to accomodate the insatiable appetite for 24/7 celebrity news.Oh, how Ray Bradbury was a visionary way back in 1953.Upon television's advent in the late-1940's and increasing popularity in the 1950's, it was often referred to as the \\"boob tube\\" and that would be a vast understatement nowadays. I think it's pretty much safe to say that the tube's executives have run out of fresh, original ideas, hence the bombardment of mindless \\"reality\\" TV shows (where everything is, surprise, scripted). Americans also think it's perfectly fine for these televangelists to scream about what a bunch of losers we are but if we fork up thousands of dollars to them, we'll be saved. (That's gotten so out of control that there are a few cable channels devoted to that junk.)And now we're back to mindless soap operas such as \\"Desperate Housewives.\\" The cycle of mindlessness just goes on and on.I read the 50th anniversary edition of Fahrenheit 451 and at the very end of the book, someone conducted an interview with Bradbury who said that there are no forms of censorship in this country because, \\"We have too many groups for censorship to be possible.\\"The reality is the exact opposite.The majority of these \\"groups\\" actively encourage censorship when what's being said either affects their agenda or when they just plain don't like the statement. Too bad the interviewer didn't ask Ray to explain the recent record/cd crushings (today's answer to burning) of Sinead O'Connor or the Dixie Chicks (these happening in the past 15 years alone), when they made statements that certain groups didn't like.The worst example of censorship is happening everyday right in front of our faces with the Iraq \\"war,\\" where the puppets in the US media say whatever the Pentagon instructs them to say. Want to get the truth about what's going on over there? You'll have to tune in to international news outlets. But do that before Bush appoints his right-wing friends on the board of PBS to stop the BBC World News and other international news from being shown over here.Finally, there are a few things that were written way back in 1953 but which have turned into proof-positive fact in America 2005. Coming from the character of Fire Chief Beatty:Page 60: \\"The home environment can undo a lot you try to do at school. That's why we've lowered the kindergarten age year after year until now we're almost snatching them from the cradle.\\" Translation: A child is to be incorporated into a mass consumer from birth, not because the country's power structure want your children to be smarter.Page 61: \\"Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of noncombustible data, chock them so damned full of 'facts' they feel stuffed, but absolutely 'brilliant' with information. Then they'll feel they're thinking, they'll get a *sense* of motion without moving. And they'll be happy, because facts of that sort don't change. Don't give them any slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy.\\"Hey, Beatty, you forgot political science."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Personally, I found the background idea of this book very smart and &quot;appetizing&quot;:a world where books were forbidden and the fire-eaters were actually fire-blowers fighting in the name of mind-globalization against the dangers of reading and building your own way to think and to face life. Unfortunately I reckon that the style is weak, words are just thrown without explanesions in the pages, sentences are chopped in a way that often made me feel totally extraneous to the plot. A heavy atmosphere floats in this book and I had to fight hard to keep on reading. In simple words, I'd mark it 4 out of 5 for the subjects but only 2 out of 5 for the style."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you look at Farenheit 451 from the perspective of when it was written, you can be amazed at Bradbury's prophecy. I tried to keep that thought in mind when reading the book but I wasn't able to put myself into any type of Cold War paranoia mind frame and as a result, I kept coming back to my 2011 mindset and thinking, hey, we have bigger fish to fry, or bigger books to burn, nowadays.Anyway, that's just me.The idea of censorship and government control and general public apathy was interesting, and the idea of society possibly heading there, or already there if you want to think about the obsession with television, is frightening, but when I finished the book I'm sitting there thinking, That's it? That's all? So we suffer through all of this to find out that there's a group of people in the country who have memorized books? That's great, books and ideas and free thought live!, but then what in the world was the whole sense of Montag's story leading up to that great revelation?I thought Montag was a little wimpy and the whole chase at the end wasn't exciting. I found the writing a little difficult to read at times, very choppy and dull. I wouldn't recommend this book"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have Always preferred to hear an author read their own works because only they really know what was intended--until now. Mr. Bradbury has one tone and one tone only and that is carried out with a mush-mouth. It's just horrendous and painful to listen to. Go find another copy--trust me (I would quit but I'm trying to finish it for a book club). Mercifully @ 5 CDs it's pretty short.Amendment: So after finishing, I must say that the last CD is just an interview with the author and it's really very interesting. If you'd like to hear him talk about his life, the books genesis, etc., skip to the last CD. I did enjoy that and it's almost like a different person speaking.

I'm sure there were many times in the past, history could have taken a wrong turn & many many books could have been lost. I am certainly glad that didn't really happen. I had an experience once in which I checked out a book titled \\"Paganism\\". I was just curious. All throught the book someone had written in pen that whoever reads the book is working w/the devil.

Was I disappointed? Kinda. The novel didn't really feel organic, and I felt that there wasn't a very strong sense of urgency. It was a fun enough read, but I simply didn't feel it was on par with some other dystopian novels (Brave New World and 1984 for example)Everyone praises this book for its anti censorship message, but when you learn the history, Ray Bradbury was only doing two things when he wrote this 1)Telling the negative effects he thought television would have on our future (source: [...]/) and 2)Make money (Not criticizing him for that goal).Bottom Line: I didn't love it, but you might."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I finally got around to this classic young adult novel. I figured since I'm in the young adult literature class for my MLIS, I might as well catch up. I never read the book because I was dryly bored by all of Ray Bradbury's work. I just can't seem to feel any passion for science fiction.Not that Fahrenheit 451 is scifi. There is a strong presence of metaphor in this book; too heavy a presence for my reading delight, though the idea is cute. Firemen ignites fires to destroy knowledge aka power. 1984 with an arson's twist. But the conclusion was so obvious from the start that I thought, why read what's in between?Written during an era of Cold War fear, I can see the appeal of his plot. But I wish Bradbury had either revved up the scifi and gave me an all out apocalypse or gave up on the robotic dogs and let the political hounds do more communist hunting."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The author starts out with a very interesting approach to the problem of censorship, but eventually falls flat. What would have made for a nice magazine sized story, doesn't have the ability to fill out a novel. The book is is mercifully short, but the story is at times dull and pointless and full of dull and pointless characters. The only character of interest is killed off after a couple pages. Its not an entirely fair comparison, but 1984 and Brave New World were orders of magnitude better than 451. The ending is completely unsatisfying and the author's vision of the future, both hopes and fears, do not ring true. Overall its an interesting read just for the concept involved, but keep your expectations low."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have always liked this book to read so I thought I would get it on CD.

Someone needs to re-make the CD's."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm not one for long reviews so.... I was kind of disappointed with the novel. I expected the greatness of 1984 and better writing. Loved the characters though. The ending, I feel, was a let down and not as well written as the first half. Read it, but I suggest 1984 or A Brave New World if you enjoy that genre, since they are better books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel Fahrenheit 451 is a science fiction classic that, somehow, I'd never read. With Bradbury's recent death, I decided it was time to remedy that. Unfortunately, I was severely underwhelmed by Fahrenheit 451, and found it lacking in many ways.Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel that, despite prominently featuring book-burning, posits dystopia-by-entertainment, like Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, as opposed to dystopia-by-oppression, like George Orwell's 1984 or Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. The evil of the Fahrenheit 451 is not censorship, but television, which has made people so dumb and uninterested in the world that (almost) no one even cares that firemen now burn books, instead of putting out blazes.The main character is Guy Montag, one of these firemen, who, after a few chance conversations with a young girl next door, realizes he's doing bad things and that the world is a mess. This pushes him to start to consider reading the books he's supposed to be burning, and the novel moves on from there.Montag, and the other characters in the book, all seem flat. Part of this is that there's no real dialogue or conversations in the book. With the exception of Guy's horrid wife and her friends who basically say \\"Shut up, my shows are on!\\" all book, every time a character opens their mouth, it seems they launch into a diatribe - the protagonist and his allies for books, and the antagonists against them. There's no real debate of ideas, and the characters all seem like mouthpieces for Bradbury, either for his anti-technology position or straw men for the anti-book position.The idea of a dystopia brought on by entertaining the citizens into apathy is a perfectly good one, and Huxley did a fine job with it in Brave New World. However, I just couldn't buy Bradbury's take. As far as he's concerned, technology can only be used to placate the masses through their wall-sized TV's or proto-Walkmen. In Fahrenheit 451, the means of content creation still rest, as they did in the '50's, in the hands of the few. This fails to account for the way technology really played out. Sure, we all have huge HDTV's and smartphones with Bluetooth headphones, but we also use all this fantastic technology to connect with people around the world in ways never before possible, and we seek out alternate sources of information that could never have reached nearly as as many people. Sure, plenty of people just let TV rot their brains, but I'm not convinced that's any different today than the '50's, and the technology now has so many other fantastic and worthwhile uses Bradbury ignores or can't predict. Bradbury also ignores that a large percentage of books aren't any better than TV. Just because it's printed on a dead tree doesn't make it Plato or Dickens.Let me also say something about the end of the novel and the war background thread. All through the novel there's imminent threat of war, though - perhaps this is to reflect the characters' lack of concern - what the war is about, who it's with, or how it will be fought is never really addressed, until the end of the book. All of a sudden, it pops up in a major way, and then a page or two later the book's over. It's like Bradbury ran out of story and decided \\"Eh, I'll just toss in a mention or two of war earlier in the book, then let that take care of everything at the end.\\" Maybe this is related to the fact that Fahrenheit 451 started as a short story, was expanded to a novella, then expanded again to a novel. Maybe there just wasn't enough story to flesh the ideas out to that long a format. In any case, the war thread is a horrible deus ex machina (see 1984 for how to weave war into a dystopian story effectively), and the ending is almost a non-ending. I don't mind a grim or ambiguous ending, but Fahrenheit 451 can't even deliver in that way.The writing style also gave me problems. Bradbury goes on for paragraphs describing scenery in repetitive flowery language, then in a plain sentence or two you hardly notice, he slips in a major event with little emphasis. It's just uneven, tedious, and makes things hard to follow.I love golden age science fiction from Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein, so it's not that I don't enjoy the genre or the era. Yeah, 1950's science fiction has its issues these days, but I don't mind those too much, as writers like Asimov an Heinlein penned entertaining stories with lasting messages. I know Bradbury is looked at in a similar way, but from Fahrenheit 451, I just can't put him in the same class as Asimov or Heinlein.I listened to Harper Audio's 2001 production of Fahrenheit 451, ready by Ray Bradbury. I thought it would be interesting to hear the book as envisioned by the author. I was wrong. Bradbury was not an effective narrator. He has a single tone in which he reads. It can be hard to tell if he's narrating description or reading dialogue, or if he's reading dialogue, which character is speaking. Conversations (such as they are, see above) are horrible to try to follow. I just can't recommend anyone, even a hardcore Bradbury fan, listen to this production. There are other versions out there read by professional audio book readers. Get one of them. It has to be better. One other problem with the production are the track times. These are rarely worth mentioning for audio books, but in this case, they are. The tracks range from 1:37 to 28:37 in length, and for no apparent reason. Tracks aren't tied to chapters or anything else I could discern. They just vary wildly in how long they are, which makes it very hard to keep track of where in the book you are. There's no reason for this. The production includes a 2001 interview with Bradbury after the book itself. The entire production runs approximately 6 hours, and about an hour of that is the interview.I can't recommend Fahrenheit 451. Yes, it has an interesting premise, but Bradbury just isn't up to turning it into a compelling story. If you're looking for a good dystopian novel, you'd do better to read 1984, The Handmaid's Tale, or Brave New World. And if you still want to read Fahrenheit 451, do not under any circumstances listen to Bradbury's narration of it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is not Bradbury's best work. His forte is the science fiction short story. His novel is ponderous and slow moving--and will turn off more young people from sci-fi than it will attract. One wonders why so many high schools use it as a required reading in sci-fi when there is so much out there which is truly exciting and attractive to young people while being equal to or better than this particular piece in a literary sense. David Weber, Jack Campbell, Robert Jordan and a host of others come quickly to mind. Even Asimov, dated though he is, would be preferable as an introduction for young adults to sci-fi reading which offers rich literary content."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was surprised at how good of condition the book was in when i got it....I wouldnt mind ordering a few more from this vendor!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Honestly? It's not that great. I'm giving it four stars because it must have had some incredible super-meta-meaning back in the 1950's. I hate to dock it points due to poor translation to modern times.I read Farenheit 451 as a student, back in the 1970's. Afte all these years, I didn't remember the book too well, but I did remember thinking it was incredibly deep and insightful. I picked it up a few weeks ago, looking to re-engage with a classic. I found it interesting, but tedious. The book is both intriguingly written and poorly written. It is a somewhat impressionistic book, with awkward sentences that work much better after a few glasses of wine or other substance of choice. To the 1970s eye (including mine, at the time) the writing style seemed imaginative and inspired; to the 2011 eye, it seems tiring and perhaps self-indulgent.There's no doubt that Bradbury was a visionary who saw a lot of things coming before they actually came. That said, he nearly missed the point of it all. He saw a future of coerced conformity (in which people would be compelled to give up their books). The more advanced insight might've been that in a bleak future, people would happily give up their freedoms. They wouldn't need firemen to burn books, because they'd voluntarily participate in their own enslavement. The incentive would be, simply, comfort. There are other writers, both fiction and non-fiction, who came a lot closer to this realization. They'd just need an IV filled with state benefits and handouts, in return for which they'd acquiesce in their own serfdom.It deserves the four stars, simply for being a famous classic. Nevertheless, I was left wondering whether the distopia that Bradbury described fit the threats of the 20th century but not that of the 21st."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's a disturbingly prophetic reading and radical idea for its day and age. But the concept is old hat in this day where it's a regular affair. It's simply no longer the system shock it once was.

In this story Ray Bradbury portrays censorship in a way that only some one who thinks outside the box can. In this alternate future firemen are paid to burn books. Guy Montag is a fireman that is undecided. Every other fireman thinks only of the great blaze and wicked joy that comes from burning books. But Guy is the only one undecided. When he sets books ablaze he wonders whether this is right. One night while he was walking home from the latest book raid the awful stench of kerosene still in his hair he meets a strange girl who makes him think. What if books were not meant to burn? This question as he knew could endanger him and his wife. So he decided that he would forget about the queer girl. He soon found that it was nigh impossible to forget her. But the next day he was called in for another book raid. This time during the raid he thought about the girl and her strange thought of him saving a book for her. As Guy and his fellow firemen sprayed on the gallons upon gallons of kerosene on the books he saw a sentence of a book he would always remember. He had only a second to think about the sentence because someone reminded him to set the blaze with his salamander engraved lighter. After that he saw one helpless book try to escape the blaze. Like a bird's final push the book went up and down.

Just how old are the people who make the school board decisions about what is considered literature? Are they just too lazy to find something newer...like written in the last half century?

I almost fell asleep during the forword, I dont know how I survived the book. The book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace.

I am going to go back to the library next week and I bet its back on the shelf laughing at me with my $7 in its hand.I hate this book but to be fair it rates TWO STARS because I guess it is okay if you like stories about firemen which I do."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"it is impossible to keep reading this...it is very hard to understand and most parts don't make any sense...it is very hard to understand."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"To put it simply: this book sucked. Although this is a very juvenile way of putting it, it fits perfectly. This book was so boring, that all the description Bradbury puts in couldn't possibly describe how slowly it moves.

Essentially: Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book for school. I, personally, don't care for any type of science fiction, so that could play a part in my rating, but it was very confusing and not worth my time. The book is about Guy Montag who is a fireman from three or four hundred years in the future where firemen cause fires instead of putting them out. The book mentions people Montag meets and is friends with and about his failing relationship with his wife. There are many 'futuristic' objects in this book which keeps you thinking and confused. The book ends in a chase which was by far the best part. If you don't enjoy science fiction, I do not recommend this book for you. I only read it because it was required of me."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I found this book to be very dry and boring. I tried to compare this to The Giver, and I just conuldn't.

This story has some characters that are very different from each other. The main character Montag, who is a fireman who burns books instead of stopping fires, is very different from his wife Millie. His wife just watches TV all day and they call the actors their \\"cousins\\". Also their are so many different things that happen that you can't really keep up with them and you can't really understand it because you can;t understand what the characters do. The plot does not really make sense, it is about people who burn books and let me tell you it isn't very fun to read. I think that the the book is creative, but the Author should use something else to go with this story. The vocabulary was pretty good and he used good sentence, but they got confusing and you find yourself doing nothing with this book. The book just goes on and on and then you find yourself wanting to burn it like the fire fighters do. I would say that I recommend this book to probably no one because it isn't fun to read, you fall asleep during it and you can never feel suspended. People who like Sci-Fi stuff might, but it isn't really Sci-Fi ether."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 was just an ok book.

If you are a person who likes reading books about fire, this book is for you.I really don't want to have to read it again and I didn't like it. It was way out of my league.

Guy is a fireman that burns books and sets houses on fire instead of the normal fireman that puts out the flames. During the course of the book Montag goes through many different phases. The most important phase is where he starts wondering about books. Since all his life he has been taught that books are bad and only to burn them, he is curious what books are about. During the time that he is going through his mysterious phases he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens her eyes to the emptiness of his life. Montag met this girl one night when he was taking a walk at about midnight. Montag also meets a very important character named Faber. Faber is an old English professor that likes books and knows a lot about them. Over the story Montag has Faber set him up with a retired publisher, to help publish books. At the time that Montag is trying to publish books the fireman are chasing him, because his wife turned him in.Guy Montag is a fireman who suddenly realizes the emptiness of his life and starts to search for meaning in the books he is supposed to be burning. He quickly forms unusually strong bonds with anyone who seems to have true friendship with him. His biggest regret in life is not having a better relationship with his wife. And because he didn't have a very good relationship with his wife that is why she turned him in to the fireman and got there house burned.The way that Ray Bradbury makes this book seem is incredible. He has a special talent that lets him really involve and capture the reader's attention. while I read this book I felt as if I was a silent observer that stood next to Guy Montag every where he went. I loved this book, and would definitely recommend this book to anybody who loves a great adventure and thrill."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really did not like this book! Now, don't get me wrong the idea was good, but the writing was horrible. I normally like Ray Bradbury's work, too. The writing style was very repetitive and boring. I think that this is one of those books that could have been great if written differently."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This summer we read this book. I hated this book for several reasons. First of all, the story was way too jumpy. It started slow, and then randomly got fast. It had absolutly no suspense to it. I found myself forcing myself to read! I couldn't relate to any of the characters! For instance, some of the characters were too boring. Maybe if I read this book in this book in ten years I would have a different opinion. Another reason why I didn't like this book, is because the characters weren't seen enough. They were all just thrown in at different times. You didn't feel like you got to know them very well and I hate that. I would not recommend this book. I think that Ray Bradbury needs to rethink his book ideas! I do not want to be critical of Ray Bradbury, but really I couldn't stand this book. It had no meaning to me. It also, had a poor plot and setting. For instance, it was plotted in the future yet it was no different than today. I don't plan on reading anymore or Ray Bradbury's books!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"who ever wrote this dumb confusing book is in a mental state of mind!

Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) depicted a society where the majority of people had settled on distant planets, while Marco Brambilla's Demolition Man (1993) was a peaceful world where human contact was not allowed and crime was almost non-existent. In literature, George Orwell's 1984 (1949) and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932) both depicted a bleak future for mankind, loveless societies with technology at the fore and the freedom of the individual vastly reduced through fear and manipulation. Reading Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 for the first time I was fascinated about how it would compare to the great dystopian novels I'd already had the pleasure of reading.Set in an unspecified future Fahrenheit 451 follows the story of Guy Montag, a fireman who goes through life without asking questions and abiding by the rules. Firemen in Bradbury's future are not the fire fighters we are accustomed to but fire starters! In this society it is illegal to own or read books and anyone caught doing so must hand them over to the fire service or suffer the consequences. The title of the book refers to the temperature at which the books burn, and as can be expected fire plays a big part in the novel. Guy Montag's life is turned upside down by an encounter with his free-spirited neighbour, Clarisse McClellan, whose outlook on life is in direct contrast to Montag as she dares to ask why in a society that is not to be questioned or reasoned with. From meeting McClellan, Montag begins to question his own existence, his relationship with his wife, Mildred, his work as a fireman and whether books really should be forbidden. The book follows the change in Montag's life and the consequences it has.As with other dystopian novels, Fahrenheit 451 is often frightening when you consider such a reality in our own world. The idea that books are forbidden for the thoughts and stories they convey and are simply not to be harboured by the population is difficult to understand. By robbing the world of books Bradbury's characters are almost lifeless. Montag's wife, Mildred, is addicted to TV walls, constantly discussing the images with her friends and hounding her husband for a fourth TV wall. This form of entertainment has become the staple of society and is much preferred for the images projected ensure the viewer doesn't need to use their imagination or think. A stark contrast to books.The penalty for hording books is best reflected when Montag and his fellow firemen are called to a house where an old woman has many books stashed. After refusing to destroy her precious collection the old woman waits until the firemen have their backs turned before starting a blaze of her own, destroying both her house and her books, and taking her own life in the process. The event rocks Montag severely as does the disappearance of Clarisse McClellan who we do not see again but Montag is assured she is dead. These changes force Montag not only to question the morality of society but to begin keeping books himself and reading them! The change in Montag is wonderfully crafted, the idea that he has no life prior to the meeting with Clarisse McClellan but in discovering the beneficial elements of books he feels more alive than ever, though his transgressions leave him a wanted man.When Clarisse McClellan is out of the picture, Montag has to turn to an English professor, Faber, who begins teaching him about the significance of books to human history and how they should still be relevant in the present. While Montag begins to learn about books he has to deal with his wife, Mildred, who is reluctant to have books in her house but also with his boss, Beatty, who suspects Montag's wavering stance but proceeds to spare him punishment by assuring him possession of a book by a fireman for 24 hours is acceptable so long as the said book is then destroyed. Montag's brief meetings with Clarisse McClellan and his new found need for independence and the ability to choose means he eventually has to leave the society that has been his whole life or have his existence cut terribly short.When Montag is on the run the novel gathers pace as he first fends off firemen and then the relentless mechanical hounds. After eluding capture Montag has helicopters to contend with and these scenes reflect the stranglehold of the society over its subjects. One man steps out of line by reading and keeping books, and all of a sudden firemen, mechanical hounds and helicopters are all devoted to his capture. Montag's decision to defy society costs him everything he ever knew and if that's not enough of a problem, he also has to face up to the onset of war!Fahrenheit 451 can sit proudly amongst the other dystopian novels of the 21st century. Working round the theme of book burning, Bradbury expertly fashions a world where the individual is a mindless minion and helps add weight to the argument of the importance of books. Bradbury's novel may not predict the Internet but it does suggest books will be obsolete in favour of technology. Prior to the Harry Potter novels there was a growing fear that children's love of books was decreasing fast but now their enthusiasm has been somewhat restored. It's unlikely a future like Fahrenheit 451 will come to be but the book should stand as a warning of a way of living we simply couldn't allow to happen."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book way back in high school, but after Mr. Bradbury's recent demise (and the youtube channel vlogbrother's choice of this for their summer read) I decided to pick it up again. Once again, reading a book that I either didn't like or didn't understand in school has blown me away later in life. For those of you who are encountering this classic for the first time, Fahrenheit 451, in a nutshell, is a book about a future society that, for a combination of different reasons, has decided to ban all books and the main character, Guy Montag, is a content fireman (i.e. book-burner) who has a crisis of conscience over his job. What Mr. Bradbury seems to be saying, to me at least, is that a life that is devoid of critical thought, which is something that books easily facilitate, is no life at all. Nearly all the characters who have turned their backs on books are seemingly dead and alive at the same time, just like many of the mechanical devices that populate the book like the electric hound and the one-eyed snake. It also feels like a a caution against both anti-intellectualism and intellectualism as embodied in the character and antagonist Fire Chief Beatty. Beatty relishes burning books and has clearly turned his back on them, but uses quotes and arguments from books to try to manipulate Montag back into the field. I only give it four stars though because Fahrenheit 451 has this strange habit of moving along really fast at times (not uncommon in a book that is less than 200 pages), but can also feel really slow too. It is easy to miss crucial details, especially in part 2. But don't let this criticism fool you. This has now easily worked it's way onto my favorites shelf and is a great introduction for readers interested in dystopian future novels like1984 ( Signet Classics (Paperback) ) [ 1984 ( SIGNET CLASSICS (PAPERBACK) ) ] by Orwell, George ( Author) on Jul, 01, 1950 Mass Market Paperbound."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My older sister had to read this book for school way back when I was maybe 12 years old. She left it sitting around and one rainy summer day back in the 70's I picked it up and was hooked. I read everything Bradbury wrote like a warm knife going through butter. My love of reading can be traced back to this book. His recent death triggered me to think about how much he meant to me as a boy growing into a young man, and I thought I'd pick up something as a sort of memorial to him. I hadn't read anything of his in probably 35 years, and to be honest I felt like maybe it wouldn't be that good going back to re-read them. I mean, could they actually live up to my memories? Wow, and then some! His writing is poetry, magic and a sincere look at the human condition. It is as timely today as it was when he wrote it, maybe more so.

Bradbury takes an ugly stick and beats the present day American philosophy down with it. We are a society based on instant gratification. Our slogan is &quot;Right here, Right now. It's your Right!&quot; (How many magazines about fashion, cars, and the ever expanding number of ways to cook chicken can we read before our curiousity is deadened?). This is the type of thinking that Bradbury criticized. What especially frightened me was the concept of MAKING everyone equal. Paradoxally, this is the dumbing down of America, so that no one could be made to feel dumb. It is in settling for society's values without critical judgement that we give up our freedom. Thank you, Mr. Bradbury, for putting it much more eloquently and forcefully than I ever could. Now everyone out there reading this ... BUY the book, READ the book, then tell me if you aren't outraged at the lack of neuron firings in the heads of our society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury is amazing. Fahrenheit 451 is an amazing book. So amazing in fact that I did my senior research paper on it. The plot is about Guy Montag (protagonist) learning about censorship and the death that accompanies it. The symbolism is very deep in this book. For example, the story mentions burning books, which is linked to destroying knowledge. Through intricately woven twists, it becomes apparent that Bradbury wants us to realize that knowledge and individuality are the keys to being alive and that when those are lost, regardless of our medical condition, we are dead.The obvious theme is of course censorship, but if you're willing to read it carefully and give some serious thought as to what's being said, you can see a much deeper message. This book should be required for admittance to society. Read it. You won't be disappointed.And don't pay any attention to those negative reviews - they are the people that this book talks about: the morons in our society who don't see the folly of ignorance."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury expounds a firghtening message in Farenheit 451. The book details life where firefighters burn the corpus of many well known authors such as Faulkner and Shakespeare. The book shows the importance of an outlet where people can express their ideas.This message is increasingly important as we near the horrific society portrayed in bradbury's novel. Like the society in F451 we are becoming dependent on television. Books are in a period of quiesence.The book sends it's theme, but it sends it with a hammer. If my memory serves, the book is no larger than 170 pp. Bradbury innundates every paragraph towards the end with his theme. The book is overly sententious, and I wish it was longer. The end seemed rushed and out of a cheesy b movie.Despite this flaw, Bradbury's prose is to die for. In simple, specific words Bradbury manages to convey a convoluted theme. This will remain a classic for years to come, that is if we still have books. Hopefully, F451 will recrudese book's in the future. One can only hope that our grand children will giggle over Wodehouse or marvel at F451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As 1984 becomes less relevant as a work, this novel becomes annually scarier and scarier. Everyone remembers that they burn books in this novel-- what they forget is why. Bradbury's world is one where-- --anything that might offend any special group is repressed --anything that might require people to think is repressed --people sit and stare endlessly at wall-sized tv's --suicide is rampant and unremarkable --people lead life at breakneck speed to avoid thinking or feeling In short, Bradbury has created a world which is frighteningly close to the one in which we live.

The novel is about a fire fighter named Guy Montag whose job is to actually start fires. In the society of the future, no one asks questions or thinks for themselves. Montag and his fire starting colleagues are paid to light books on fire and watch them burn. Montag meets a seventeen-year old girl who tells him about times when people treasured books and when a fireman's job was to extinguish fires. Filled with curiosity about the past, Montag starts hiding books in his home and reading them. His wife reveals his secret to his co-workers and Montag is forced to burn his own stash. Montag then meets philosophers who have stored the contents of books in their heads so that when people need and want the knowledge, it is there.Bradbury brings out a statement of theme that is not revealed without careful analysis of the story.

School would be so much fun (english &amp; history) if I could read everything as if I were doing it to entertain myself and not because I have to. My state of mind may have been the factor that made this one of the most exciting and meaninful books I have ever read.Every politician should this to learn what democracy is not. Not that I think such a regime could take over in the near future with the freedom of speech on devices such as the internet and the continous poplularity of books. But by not giving his tale a date shows that such a world could come into being any time without warning if people simply forget. The theme of the book is the answer to anyone who asks what the purpose is of learning history. Montag is forced to watch his wife and the rest of a doomed society as it repeats history and mindlessly involves itself in war. The book is not so much about the importance of books but the importance of knowledge. Bradbury shows that a civilized society must always remember and cannot always be happy.The second half reads like an action story without straying from the theme and it is made obvious where Steven King was influenced to write the unrecognized but I think great book The Running Man."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I LOVED this book.

The language that Bradbury uses in this novel is odd but very well used. It is like stream of conciousness, flitting from one thing to the next. It works because that's how thoughts (mine at least) tend to run through the mind. I doubt the future described in this book will ever be fully realized, but mindless generations now being raised, that haven't enough imagination for reading, may lead us in that direction. I love this book, I recommend it to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Seriously, it is. I could never imagine a world without books. That is like a world without oxygen. Okay maybe not that bad. However, the story line of this book is excellent. It is also fast paced and short. It is the ultimate book on censorship."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an interesting novel filled with lots of hidden meaning and excellent in depth characters. The story takes place in a futuristic American city where censorship runs wild. Books are banned and firemen no longer put out fires, in this city they start the fires. Burning books is a way to control the population and stop people from having original thoughts of their own. With an overwhelming entertainment industry controlling every aspect of people's lives, the people feel content being ignorant and have a false sense of happiness. Guy Montag is the main character in the story. He is a fireman by trade and burns books to stop people from questioning their surroundings and to \\"keep everybody happy.\\" He never questions his job or his marriage until he meets Clarisse McClellan. She is a young girl of seventeen and is different from the rest of the people. She questions the world and book burning and this is what starts to sway Montag into questioning his world. Soon Montag realizes his wife Mildred Montag is just a hollow shell that does not love him, actually she loves nobody and cares only for a family that only exists on television.With this realization Mantag sets out to change things if not on a large scale maybe just for himself. Meeting professor Faber teaches Montag about the meaning and purpose books. Montag decides to no longer burn books, instead he decides to preserve them. He does this with the help of some hobo's he meets outside the city after fleeing from prosecution for protecting the written word.Clarisse is a character I can definitely relate to. Her outlook on life and the small quirks that make us wise and happy are the things she notices instead of the mass entertainment that envelops us all. By accepting the role of an outcast and continuing her intellectual quest to better the world, she displays her huge will power. With such will power the majority of the people could find peace in whom they are, instead of always conforming.I enjoyed the meaning of this book but found that the author used far too much symbolism. The imagery hid the plot and story line of the book. I thoroughly enjoyed the parts where he rebelled against the system, especially the part in which he recites poetry to the hollow beings on television destroying their happiness by shattering what keeps them happy and content. He used a type of a \\"mirror\\" to show them their terrible faults. After hearing the poem they realized that their actions have been unforgivable and become consumed by guilt and tears. If I could, I would increase the action of the story by making Montag act in defiance of the system in more places in the book. This would give his actions a sense of great accomplishment instead of just another try at what had been tried and failed so many times.This is a good book to teach the value and wealth of knowledge contained in books and arts. Without literature and the arts we can't record the feeling or motives of the present and the future cannot benefit from the great trials and tribulations that the human spirit endures every second of every day."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I originally picked up Farenheit 451 for a summer reading book but in being touched deeply by this book and the realization that the book wasn't on my summer reading list I realized it was much more than just a quick read. I love reading but this book really made me think about how some of my friends despise reading. Now, it doesn't seem like much, but in Guy Montag's society, the main character, reading and just owning books was a crime. I started thinking about how much knowledge can be attained through books, and this book made me think about what books offer. That is because this book offers so much to the reader. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it had no closing to the story. I personally like closings but some people like to imagine the end and it always works for teachers to have a finish the book kind of project. But anyway, this is a truly great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury writes in 1951 of a future America that is somewhat of a caricature of present day America, where shallowness prevails. In this America book reading is both unpopular and forbidden - and a house containing books is burnt down.Bradbury writes out of love for knowledge and human potential, and out of total disdain for shallowness and mediocracy. Writing in 1951, his ideas leave out the important achievements of non-White civilizations, but this does not take away from the power of his message.I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and found it very stimulating. The language is not merely used to convey ideas ot events - it has a life and beauty of its own.I recommend it to anyone who loves to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The novel Fahrenheit 451 is a great Sci-Fi written by Ray Bradbury .that is about censorship. It is revolves around a man named guy Montag he is a firemen. In that time books are illegal they are against the law to own book and more so to read them. Firemen don't stop fires they start them by burning the books that people have illegally. Liked doing his job until one day a women killed her self for the books she owned. After that Montag plays seesaw from being a fireman or a rebel reading books.Fahrenheit 451 is one of the greatest sci-fi novels I read so far. Ray Bradbury did excellent in this book. His writing is so good that you can see what he is thinking about the pitcher is so vivid that it is like watching a real movie. He also had a great scene of the future he explained every thing well he didn't leave you guessing how the stuff worked. He is truly the greatest book that he is written .The best part of the book is how much information he gives about his character. You can image how Montag would be if he was real.An excellent part of the book is the ending it lives you guessing what is going to happen to him. I think that the author did this so the reader makes the ending whatever you wanted to be. Over the entire book are five stars. This is the best science fiction book I ever read.Fahrenheit is great for the kids that say that books never have anything good in them. It is also good for science fiction readers, it is a great sci-fi book. This is also good for people that believe that the government is controlling us. Or the people that don't like censorship."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It's a great tale about utopia, censorship, and decline of our collective culture into a mass of visual goo. It's Bradbury at his best. He kind of cheats a little with the ending, but the overall quality and message of the book makes it one of the finest pieces of literature out there."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The novel Fahrenheit 451 tells us about a time in the future in which books are illegal to read or posses, and firemen aren't employed to save houses (because they are virtually fire resistant), but to burn books. Guy Montag, a fireman, and the story's main character, enjoys the destruction and burning of the books and he is constantly soaked in the smell of kerosene. Montag had a weird feeling about things, but wasn't quite sure what it was. He was like all the other people, in that he would just keep going ahead to where he was going, not looking at what he was walking past or paying much attention to things. Except one night he stopped and met a girl who told him of the past where people were allowed to think, to read, and to have original ideas for themselves, and the ability to write them down and share them with others.As the story goes on, it deals with his drug-abusing wife and her weird friends. Also there are crews of people that are out to save people that try to committee suicide due to the high suicide rate. The reader discovers the ways that the society works, about how people are not unique, not knowing their own neighbors, and how the television thinks for everyone so that they don't have to.This book shows a future where it is nearly impossible to be a freethinking individual. Ray Bradbury's descriptive writing makes the story easy to read and hard to put down. The story thickens, twists, and curves with every page as Montag is forced to go on the run from a mechanical hound whose only mission is to destroy Montag. It is a book that everyone should try to read. It really makes the reader think about how our future may turn out like this someday."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this was the first bradbury that i have tackled, so i am not entirely sure if bradbury's style is always so greyfor this book however, the splashing about in the language was a good thing, and fit the material.rather scary how closely the world here resmebles our own, with the mass of the public simply too enveloped in their own ignorance, and happy about it.fairly quick read, and worthwhile."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I hadn't read this Bradbury's classic for 15 years. I had 14 years old then and though I liked it, I appreciate it now even more. Should I think I was not mature enough to understand all the ins and outs of the book?When Ray Bradbury published his Fahrenheit 451 several decades ago, he depicted a decaying society, only preoccupied by its facade of happiness. Not that people are entirely free of the usual constraints but everything is done through games, shows, comics for them to forget the notion of thinking, source of all distress and misery. Those who resist are destroyed, dangerous books (those *who* make think) are burnt. And finally, does it work after so much trouble?Well, at first sight, it depends on the basic purpose of the system. If its aim is to make people happy, it's undoubtedly a catastrophic failure. On the other hand, if it plans on making people believe they are happy or at least act as if they were, the answer may appear less immediate but little by little, you realize that for most of the characters, and therefore for probably most of the society, it comes to the same thing.Montag, the fireman who burns the books, is suddenly confronted to the emptiness of his life. Is he happy? No. He will refuse the system and fight, like Granger and the old Faber. Mildred, Montag's wife, has accepted it all. It's so practical for her to live without thinking, with a virtual family on screens around the walls of the parlor. She has friends she can talk with. She has plenty of leisure, goes on parties, but is she happy? Can she be happy when she frequently needs a bunch of pills to get dopey to the point of risking her life? Obviously not. Same for her friends, you'll see it fast.Two characters are really apart in this book.Clarisse, for example, doesn't like or hate that fake prosperity, simply because she doesn't care. She just does what she likes and she's happy. It's probably the only person you'll meet who is. Unfortunately, it will kill her but her short encounter with Montag will have been fundamental.Okay, I admit it, even if he's not from the &quot;good&quot; side, I've a compassion of some sort for the last important character of the story, Captain Beatty, the firemen's chief. He's really disconcerting, an opponent worthy of Montag. You quickly feel his cogency, his volubility. Despite his current lifework, it's easy to suspect he read a lot in the past and reflected over everything. He would once have been a precious ally for Montag but now, it's too late. He abides by the system and resigned himself, sincerely convinced of its ineluctability. So, of course, he must oppose Montag. The way he dies, the way he chooses to die, is terrible and you'll realize then what despair has haunted that man, how strong his disgust of life has been.Oh, while I'm writing this, I've just remembered a scenery. In fact, each time I think about Fahrenheit, this one always comes to my mind. At a certain point of the 2nd part, Montag thrust himself in the parlor occupied by Mildred and her friends who were watching their favorite show on the 3 walls, the White Cartoon Clown. Montag pulls the switch, and after some words exchanged about the coming war, he simply says &quot;Let's talk.&quot; The passage that immediately follows his request is powerful, from the bewildering words of Mrs Phelps about the children she never had to the furor of Montag appealing them to get out of his house, it's a total delight! I guess it's only there that the reader discovers in what terribly absurd world s/he was dived. This passage is a great moment of literature history, I swear you! :)If you make up your mind and wish to buy that magnum opus, I suggest you buy the 40th anniversary edition for Fahrenheit deserves a choice place in your library. The dustcover is beautiful, with the back reproducing the original illustration. Now, let's remove delicately the dust cover. Wow, there's a nice hardcover under it, the main sides are light brown and my fingers can feel the author's name raised slightly in the same color :) and on the black edge, title, author and editor are in gold letters. Hum! Hum! What's more? Ah, yes, a very interesting and recent foreword by Ray Bradbury, very instructive, it explains everything: the genesis of the book, the historical context, the how and the why. The original introduction (written in 1966) is still there, as captivating as the foreword, both of them are worth reading. From all points of view, I'm very proud to own this edition. I hope you'll feel the same pride."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I just purchased the Kindle version of this classic today. I paid $9.99.

I thought, how clever, to own a book on the demise of books on my Kindle. Ironic, that the Kindle version starts off with such a sloppy mistake. Ironic, and sorely disappointing."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Books are dangerous. They're full of ideas that make people think about the world, feel passion, and perhaps act out. That's not good for society; it causes conflict, uprising, and interference with the status quo. People who read and think scare people who don't, so most citizens have happily given up the right to decide what to think about and now let the government fill their brains with constant loud mindless entertainment. This managed input has equalized society; nobody feels inferior to anyone else and there's no conflict anymore. Dull minds, constant entertainment, and conformity make society run smoothly.Guy Montag works as a fireman. He burns books at night while his wife sits in her parlor and listens to inane media shows at high volume. But Clarice, the teenager next door, is different. Her family sits around and talks. They discuss things and they laugh with each other. Guy wonders what they talk about as he watches his wife talk to the strangers on TV and pop sleeping pills...Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 presents a possible frightening future in which intellectual pursuits and nonconformity are deemed dangerous and subversive. It's been more than half a century since Fahrenheit 451 was published and we've seen censorship laws actually become looser over the years and the advent of the internet has brought on the current \\"information age.\\" But that doesn't make Fahrenheit 451 irrelevant because it's about much more than literary censorship. It's about freedom of speech and individual rights. It's about thinking for ourselves and what might happen if we let the government tell us what we can see, hear, or own.Fahrenheit 451 resonates with me on so many levels. First of all, it's just superbly written. I love Bradbury's intense style which translates especially well on Blackstone Audio's version read by Christopher Hurt (sample). Here he describes the show that Mrs Montag watches all day:A great thunderstorm of sound gushed from the walls. Music bombarded him at such an immense volume that his bones were almost shaken from their tendons; he felt his jaw vibrate, his eyes wobble in his head. He was a victim of concussion. When it was all over he felt like a man who had been thrown from a cliff, whirled in a centrifuge and spat out over a waterfall that fell and fell into emptiness and emptiness and never -- quite -- touched -- bottom -- never -- never -- quite -- no not quite -- touched -- bottom ... and you fell so fast you didn't touch the sides either... never... quite... touched... anything.The thunder faded. The music died.\\"There,\\" said Mildred. And it was indeed remarkable. Something had happened. Even though the people in the walls of the room had barely moved, and nothing had really been settled, you had the impression that someone had turned on a washing-machine or sucked you up in a gigantic vacuum. You drowned in music and pure cacophony. He came out of the room sweating and on the point of collapse. Behind him, Mildred sat in her chair and the voices went on again...Second, I share Bradbury's ardent passion for knowledge and learning. The thought of lost information, burned books, mindless entertainment, meaningless small-talk, conformity, and intellectual malaise makes my stomach twist. I don't believe that we're in danger of the anti-intellectualism that Bradbury posits, but still his ideas get me riled up.Third, I'll admit that I'm a rebel at heart. While I recognize that obeying laws and paying taxes are a necessary part of living in a well-functioning society, I feel mostly distrustful and suspicious when the government increases taxes, takes over more functions in society, tells us what to believe, and tries to revoke constitutional freedoms. In this context, Bradbury's possible future doesn't seem so impossible anymore.I'm pleased that my school district assigns Fahrenheit 451 in its middle-school curriculum, though I find it a bit ironic that some publishers have edited the language to make it more \\"suitable\\" for teenagers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"An important statement against censorship and anti-intellectualism, Fahrenheit 451 presents a prophetic vision of a world where people are pre-occupied by 'popular entertainment' and distracted away from any serious thought and true learning (as represented by books). The disturbing similarity of this fictional world to the one we actually live in today, makes this a thought-provoking must-read.I must say, however, that I am not a big fan of the writing style. Points are driven home without much subtlety. It even sounds a little preachy in places. This style actually takes away from the importance of the message for me, much the same way that an over-eager preacher can sometimes diminish the impact of an important sermon. Even the imagery of book-burning, though very provocative, ultimately makes the world of Fahrenheit 451 seem more un-real and distant from ours than it actually is.The other problem is that the book never gets past the central premise to explore questions like why or how such a world might come to pass in any real detail. This is probably because it was originally written as a short novella. However, in this case, I would have liked to see a sequel!In the end, this is the kind of book that every thinking person should read for themselves, so read it and make up your own mind! :)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've been checking out some of the classics that I never gave a chance while in high school, now that I'm a much more aware and mature reader. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was something I always wanted to read but never got around to it. Well, I have finally read it and the time was very much well spent. Ray Bradbury offers a bleak and dim future where thinking for yourself is against the law.Guy Montag's life had always been simple. He understood the order of things, and he understood the nature of his job. He was a fireman, and that entailed burning books and burning down the buildings that hid them. He never questioned it once and never felt guilty for what he was doing. Things take a different route when he meets a peculiar girl who asks the tough questions that he has never had to answer. And with those questions, he starts to think and wonder why things are the way they are. Ever since the meeting with this stranger, Montag is curious about the true nature of his job, leading to dangerous revelations that will put his very life in jeopardy.Bradbury has created a magnificent piece of literature that attacks censorship and the numbing of society head on with no regrets and no remorse. He doesn't need to give us an exact year of this future, as that makes it all the more frightening. Even though this is a work of fiction, it seems so realistic and so possible that all of this could really happen to us. Think about it. We are now a &quot;TV Generation&quot; who spend a lot less time reading, people are trying to ban different types of books for different reasons, and anything that is deemed &quot;unpleasant&quot; is demanded to be &quot;fixed&quot; or &quot;taken care of&quot; so we can all feel happy and not deal with the pain and troubles of life. Bradbury captures all of this and does not give you a bitter rant about today's youth, but he uses all of that negative energy and creates something so profound and well established. It's no mistake that this fine novel has sold millions upon millions of copies and is forever deemed a classic.The writing is simple to read and it is a short book. You will have to give it a few pages before you can really get into it all, but make sure that you stick with it. Once it gets moving, there's no stopping the pages. Bradbury is great with imagery and provides excellent descriptions--but never goes overboard with them. It's such a short read that you could most likely finish it in a day or two if you put the effort into it. Turn off that TV for just a few hours or so and pick this up! It definitely sticks in your head once it's all said and done, and you will be thinking about everything that has transpired in this book.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is a tremendous work of fiction that is both thought-provoking and terrifying (in a subtle way). It really goes to show you how terrible things can get if censorship wins, and it really can happen if you think about it. If you haven't given this a read yet, I strongly encourage you to pick up a copy as soon as you can. This is a book that I know I will be re-reading again in the very near future. -Michael Crane"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury has taken an issue so overlooked even today, to have written something about the topic of censorship in the 1950s was quite a daring act. Ray Bradbury did it well enough, and with his ficticious novel Fahrenheit 451 he explores the horrible underbelly of education and society, and forces the reader to re-examine the values of our society.In the novel, the main character (protaganist) Guy Montag, is a fireman, but not what you'd expect, his job is to burn books and the houses that contain them, but then he meets a young woman named Clarisse who teaches him the wonderful truth of books, and a place where imagination and thinking are praised. Montag become obsessive with the idea of obtaining books, knowing that they must be wonderful treasures, so great, that people would give up their lives for them.Soon, like most things in life Clarisse fades away, but so does the thin strand that was Montag's grip on life. He seems to spin out of control, the books that he once destroyed now seemed to be destroying him, becoming his every obsession. Montag finds himself becoming afraid of everyone and everything, and he feels alone, unable to be helped.Fahrenheit 451 is a fabulous book dealing with an issue that still badgers people today even in the 21st century: censorship. This book takes an immediate look at the history of censorship, and sets forth startling revelations as to what will become of mankind if we take away the creative process, the independent, thinking spirit of man and gives a warning that must not be ignored. Fahrenheit 451 is an absolutely essential read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book pictures a world where, in order to keep everybody happy and orderly, books are denied the public and burned when found. Guy Montag (the central character) is a fireman (a servant of the public who burns books) who's life is turned around by several cicumstances. He meets a mysterious teenage girl on the sidewalk every night on his way home from work and gets into deep conservations with her. She opens his eyes to the world around him and leaves him hungering for something he can't explain. His wife is a virtual reality junkie and spends all her time listening to the radio or conversing with her electronic &quot;relatives&quot; via VR. Montag begins to see his wife as an empty, meaningless shell of a being and begins to steal books from the houses he burns.The characters are real and you understand them. The setting and technology isn't futuristic but that's not the focus. The plot isn't spell-binding, but it is interesting and it keeps your interest. While the book is short, it is full of symbols, representations, and philosophy. A similar book to this is &quot;Brave New World&quot; written by Aldous Huxley. In both novels, books are outlawed.Overall, the book focuses on the mind of man and what can prompt him to do certain things. This book may sound like a boring essay, but it's not. It makes you think and examine life in a different light."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"We live in a disposable society, where we are expected to do and say everything we are &quot;taught&quot; by the &quot;great educator&quot;, Television. Farenheit 451 is one of the most revealing books ever written and after 46 years, remains to be relevant. The reason being, it was written as science fiction and is slowly, but surely, becoming science fact. Although, I'm sure that he never meant it to be so, Mr. Bradbury has predicted the future to a degree.The main character, Guy Montag, is a man who is just doing his job. He's a fireman, which is kind of strange, because in the future everything is fireproof... except for books. Books have been outlawed, and it is the job of the fireman to find and burn hidden stashes of books. Why would someone want to burn books? you might be asking yourself.Throughout history man has always burned books that go against his: beliefs, religion, philosophies, government, etc.; because they saw these books as a threat. What better way to control a society, than if you take away their ability to think and reason on their own? Books allow us the opportunity to think and question our reality and what is going on around us. With out that, then we just become a society of mindless drones. Which is what we've become in Montag's future... slaves to our &quot;interactive televisions&quot;. In this book, television has become our extended families, while the real families are left by the wayside because the television families seem more real. Montag questions his actions after watching a woman refuse to leave her books, while they were being burned. He can't understand how someone could care for something so much, that they would be willing to die, instead of live with out it. Read the rest on your own, because you need to, not because you have to. Read this book and then look at the world around us. You'll see what I mean when I say that this book has turned from Science Fiction to Science Fact."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This Book Burns Your Brain!Ray Bradbury fires out another hit with Fahrenheit 451. This science fiction novel captures a society where books are outlawed. Fahrenheit 451 tingles your senses in trying to imagine a world with no written literature. Trying to imagine a society without any books is mind boggling and upsetting. Just think of how books effect our everyday lives. For instance, you wouldn't be reading this right now because I wouldn't be allowed to read this book and write about it. Bradbury paints a realistic image about a fictional society that replaces books with television because reading books or having them in your possession is illegal. The thing that is so realistic about this society that Bradbury creates is that it could very easily be the society that we live in. Our society spends so many hours watching television and watching movies that one day we could question the value of books and what they bring to our lives. The government controls censors of what we watch on television and one day they could prevent us from reading books because they have the power to do so. Guy Montag, the protagonist of the story, is a firefighter who instead of extinguishing fires, sets them. Books are supposed to be his enemy and he sets his enemy on fire with kerosene as his fuel. After Guy meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan, he starts to question the world that he lives in. He starts to wonder if books do have any real value like Clarisse says they do. She tells him how rich they are and how he should read one of them because it is a great experience. After he reads a book, he realizes that he does not want to live in this censored society any longer. The plot of the book then becomes Montag's journey with his internal conflict of censorship. He can not live in this ignorant society and struggles to get himself out of it. Bradbury, in Fahrenheit 451, has a very enjoyable writing style. His plot is fast-moving and his descriptions of characters and scenes are explicit. He beautifully depicts this futuristic society and the people that live in it. Overall, this is a work of art from Bradbury. This book was a fiery blast from start to finish. The suspense of this book never let you out of its inferno. For under six bucks you can hold the fire of the future in your hand."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"After listening to the excellent Book-On-Tape version of this book, I was depressed for a week. So why am I giving it five stars? Because this book and its characters affected me so much, this book literally forced me to reexamine the relationships in my own life.You surely know the basic story, from the Amazon description if from nowhere else. This is a depiction of a sick, but not unfathomable society. Science has advanced to the point where homes are constructed in such a way that they cannot burn, unless the fire is intentional. Firemen still exist, but they are only called out to burn books, and the houses (and sometimes people) that contain and love them.The concept is chilling, but the psychological effects of such a super-paranoid society are what I could not get out of my head. Guy Montag is a fireman, has been for decades. But in the back of his mind is an itch, that little spark of human curiosity that hasn't quite been burned out of him yet. He meets a girl, Clarisse, who isn't like all of the other people left in the world. She laughs, and doesn't conform, and challenges him with thoughts that she could not have gotten from the ubiquitous video walls that occupy most people's lives.Guy's curiosity is stoked, and adventures ... somewhat depressing adventures, ensue ...By the end of this chilling and frightening experience (which includes, by the way, scarily prescient &quot;Reality television&quot; shows a la Stephen King's The Running Man or Fox's Cops), like I said, I was depressed for a week. But I also found myself listening more to people, turning off the television to spend time with my wife, and ultimately inspired to stop being such a go-with-the-flow zombie that our shrink-wrapped culture demands."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"An excellent novel, but terrifying due to its plausibility. Not only, in today's society, does the story created by Bradbury seem possible, but it seems as if it could occur shortly. It does give one ideas to consider, especially about the mores of our society. Other than the underlying themes, this is wholly a good book. The plot is entertaining and fast-paced, and the characters are wonderfully developed. The humorous, futuristic household items, and some of the characters' attitudes lighten the mood and keep the book from becoming too cynical. Overall, this is an excellent book worth reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's classic vision of a prophetic destruction of society is beautifully addressed in Fahrenheit 451. It shows how the incineration of books, symbols for intelligence and wisdom, lead to nothing but ignorance and collectivist states of society that will eventually destroy mankind. The protagonist, Montag, is however an individualist in this futuristic society who stands for his own beliefs and does not conform to his destructive surroundings. This is a very powerful novel, however Ray Bradbury may have been inspired by other writers with the original idea of literature devoted to individualism. It was written in 1951, around the same time that George Orwell's 1984 was written. However the genius with this original and very revolutionary idea of incorporating individualism into literature is Ayn Rand, who wrote the classic novelette, Anthem, in 1937. Anyone who enjoyed Fahrenheit 451 will enjoy Anthem even more."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have enjoyed reading this book. everyone will enjoy it after the first reading.

Go Montag!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;Fahrenheit 451,&quot; by Ray Bradbury, shows the theme of men and women not thinking for themselves, but letting others make decisions for them. Many want a perfect world, where everything goes right, but when people gain knowledge of something it causes segregation of beliefs resulting in problems. Bradbury acknowledges this, but tries to convey the message that, with knowledge of the past, we can understand the reason for mistakes made and prevent them from happening again. Another message that is presented is that the people are afraid of knowing things: thinking scares them. They let others think for them, in this case the government.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is full of metaphors that, when understood, compliment the theme. One metaphor is the mechanical hound. It is a computerized animal used as the government's way of punishing its enemies. The hound shows the power dictatorship has the power the government has to enforce. The seashells which people listen to are used to promote the policies of the government. The seashells can be thought as to help, &quot;drift these people off to sea,&quot; as seashells would drift out to sea. Finally fire is used often as a subject of metaphors. Burning the books is a way to make them non-existent. The government doesn't want the books because the knowledge in the books contradicts the governmental policy. They burn them, like one would burn a piece of trash if they didn't want it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Part of the appeal of this sort of book, books like '1984' or 'Brave New World' is that we can look at them retrospectively. Written mostly in the earlier part of the last century, they predicted just what sort of messes we would have created for ourselves in the next. The ideas their authors came up with were always just possible; in many cases some of the things the authors dreamed up came true, or almost so. It's chilling to consider that these books were written as 'worst case scenarios' of the time in which we now live.So it is with Fahrenheit 451 - much of the appeal of this book is it's consideration of just how far the TV craze would go, and how dumbed down the western world would become. The book is set not very far into our future, possibly this decade - how close are we to the sort of censorship Bradbury imagined? How much has our sense of community disappeared? How dumb are we?The interest for me, lay in these questions. I wouldn't consider 'Fahrenheit 451' great literature. I didn't think the writing was particularly skillful, or the plot incredibly suspensful. But the ideas Bradbury writes about make this book great. It really is one of those modern classics you should bother to read, especially if you enjoy Dystopian fiction like 'The Handmaid's Tale, 'Brave New world', or '1984)' or science fiction of any sort. Another one that, although it may seem like light reading or pulp as you are reading it, will stay with you for a good few days after you've put it aside and moved onto the next book....."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It was another great work by Bradbury.

He never questions the laws of this society until he meets a seventeen year old girl. She places all of these wierd thoughts and ideas into his head. From then on he questions everything.

The people are not interested anymore in reading books, but they prefer to watch movies. The books during these last years have lost a lot of importance, and the tecnologies have been more important for the human beings. I don\`t think that our future is the same as the one in the book, but it can be a warning for everybody who loves the smell of books, touching their pages, holding them. The author I think tried to tell us that we are not going to miss the books until we have lost them."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This books is interesting. It's about a man named Montag who is a fireman but instead of putting out the fire, he starts them by burning the books he finds in other people's houses. In my own opinion I think this book is about reality, because even though we are no burning books a lot of people are losing interest in reading them. Peolpe would rather watch T.V.,play Nintendo,get on the computer and do everything from there than going through a book.

I personally loved this book, reading it just a day ago. I was entirely captivated with the plot, and the idea of censorship in the future, and that it was precise that it being a book would be censored is unbelievable.

As a well-rounded citizen who has been subject to almost everything, I thought this book was well written and well thought out. Like most of the other readers of this book I had to read this in school, but I was immediately drawn in by Bradbury's estimations of what the future will be like (note this book was written in the early 1950's). His imagination and creativity were so real; some of the devices in the book have since been invented. What a cool thing for Bradbury to more-or-less guess what the future is going to be like and then have some of his guesses come true. I would deeply encourage all literate people to read this book; who knows how close Bradbury's other ideas of the future are?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel is truly a work of art.

I hung on the natural similies and metaphors, and couldn't believe how correct Bradbury was in placing our future. To those who &quot;just don't get it&quot; I say I'm dreadfully sorry.

The loose ends left by Bradbury were overwhelmed by the extraordinary content and fascinating prophecies. While Bradbury wrote this novel in the early 50's, he was still able to capture the essence of what would seem to be our misfortune in the future. Although he could have spent more time developing the characters, Bradbury does a wonderful job of establishing the plot. It was not hard to picture the details and the setting in this story, as they seemed to come alive. The suspense in the book was tremendous and managed to keep you on your toes throughout the book. For all of these reasons, we believe that 451 is definitely worth reading and will stay a classroom favorite for years to come."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"trulely one of the most fantastic books ever written. it pulls you into the book like no other. i could not put it down.if you havent read any ray bradbury, start with this one. but read the others too."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book I read this quarter is called Fahrenheit 451. The author of the book is Ray Bradbury. The book takes place in the future. Some of the environments include: Montag's house, the fire house, and Faber's house. In my oponion, the city and the river were the most important sites in the book. The city is were Montag was chased, and the river is important because this is where Montag finally dodged the city officials. I think that Fahrenheit 451 would best be classified as a science fiction. It is this genre because it is set in the future. Also, it is make believe because firefighters don't burn books in our society. Ray Bradbury has written many short stories, novels, plays, and poems. At 12, he wrote his first short story. He has produced two of his own plays, made two musicals, and helped with an animated film. In 1962 Icarcs Mantgolfer was nomanated for an academy award. Ray Bradbury has had his own television show, named the Ray Bradbury Theater has won many different cable awards. The book is about a firefighter named Guy Montag. His job is not to put out fires, but to set books ablaze. As the story goes along he starts to question many things about his job and the books he burns. About this time Guy starts stealing books. He made many attempts to read them, but he didn't understand them. Guy then contacted Faber, a retired professor, to help him interpret the books. Then Beatty, the fire chief, suspected Guy of burning books. Because this was aganist the law, Bettay went to Guy's house to burn his books. At that time Bettay placed Montag under arrest. Fearing he might be killed, Guy flees from city officals. He finally loses them when he hides in the river. When Guy emerges he meets a group of retired professors and teachers. They helped Guy escape and they recite to him as they travel. That is where the book ended. . The main character of the book is Guy Montag. He is a firefighter. Montag was not very educated, but he was \\"programed\\" to set books on fire. Guy is important to the book because if he wasn't there then there would be no book. He is also important because he is the olny person with the drive needed to change the laws of owning books. He is married to Mildred Moontag. Another improtant character of the book is Faber. He is a retired professor who quit when the college where he taught closed. Faber, a very well educated man, had been illegally reading books very discreetly. Faber is improtant to the book because without Faber's help Montag never would have escaped. Faber is also the person who coached Montag whenever he was in trouble. I think the theme of the book is that we shouldn't take books forgranted. I think Farheniet 451 is saying that books are very important resources and that slowly with technology thay are becomming more and more obsolete. Overall I liked most of the book. There were many dead spots in the book that left me lost. At the begenning I really didn't catch on and understand the it. But, when it picked up, it was a very good and interesting book. This is why I would reccomend it to a friend."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"So far, Bradbury is a great decriber, i thought this book would be stupid, [A book about buring books] but by the end of the first paragraph i was amazed by the detail he gets to and how he describes Clariesse and how &quot;Crazy&quot; she is to the books society.Also his forshadowing is great [the vent grille]. i admire him, as a young writer i see what i'll have to do to make a book so popular as this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The sense of doom was so overwhelming as I slowly examined the book.

Keep in mind, this was written some 40 years ago, but his predictions can be alarmingly accurate. Montag's society's obsession with t.v. is frighteningly prophetic, as is the obsession with dieting. Also, has anyone ever thought of the similarities between the recently popular laser-light shows and the White Clown show? I must say that the most frightening part of this novel is how everything begins to move faster and the thoughts of the individual are lost - something I see happening in today's society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"At first it takes a while for one to understand the setting, but once it gets going this book just doesn't stop! An action-packed novel with a beautiful ending. Quite possibly Ray Bradbury's greatest piece of Literatue! Hands down this is one of the best books ever written. I think siskel and ebert said it best when they said, &quot;Two Thumbs Up!&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"OK... I absolutely love Ray Bradbury and every single one of his books! I read &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; and &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; and thoroughly enjoyed them both. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; only bolsters my love for his books. First of all, his writing is CLEAR! It's none of this wordy, incomprehensible Charles Dickens or wimpy, disgustingly melodramatic James Herriot. Bradbury gets straight to the point without dilly-dallying and remains extremely entertaining throughout. When I say he's entertaining, I don't mean that this book is a comedy. Far from it. The censorship issues brought up by the book-burning is a very serious topic. However, Bradbury's masterful words make it truly enjoyable to read. I couldn't put it down until I was done. A must-read!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"InFahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury has created a world that chillingly seems to reflect our present and near future. In this upside down dystopia, firemen burn books, women congregate with their fake wall (television) families, youth engage in high speed car chases, killing themselves and others, and products are promoted on 200 ft billboards, and hawked by Jesus Christ. In this world where supposedly everyone has everything one wants, no one is truly happy, no one loves anyone, and unhappy people overdose on drugs. No one slows down to smell the flowers, taste the rain, sit by a fire, talk with friends, or just sit and think. No one cares that that the world seems to have been at war for as long as anyone can remember, with fighter jets streaking above their homes everyday. After all, no one has to sacrifice anything; its always someone else's spouse or child that dies.Guy Montag was a faithful citizen of this world, satisfied with his job of burning books, until he has a chance encounter with his new neighbor, a strange, precocious 16 year old who is wise beyond her years. Clarisse McClellan changes his views of the world dramatically with her strange habits of tasting the rain, gazing at the moon, and asking pointed questions as to why he became a fireman, whether he loves anyone or whether he is happy. An awakened, transformed Montag, after failing to impress and change his shallow and depressed wife and others around him with his new-found wisdom, is discovered, hunted, and is forced to flee the city. He joins a vagabond group of outlaw-professors, who plan to restore the world by imparting the wisdom they have gained by memorizing books.This is the best novel depicting our future world that I have read. Other books, likeBrave New Worldpresent a frightening, realistic future, but have poor plot and characterization. On the other hand, books such as1984andAnimal Farmare thrilling and well told, but really do not reflect our future very well. FAHRENHEIT 451 does both, and does so brilliantly. Apart from depicting a realistic and scary future, Bradbury writes a tight, exciting plot packed with suspense, including fires, chases, murder, suicides, and nuclear war. I could scarcely put the book down, wondering what Montag was going to do next. Although it is but a short story, the characters, including Montag, his shallow but deeply depressed wife Millie, the youthful but insightful Clarisse, the cowardly but wise Faber, and the disillusioned arrogant bully Beatty are engaging and fully realized.If you have the BALLATINE 50th anniversary edition, the extra material (afterword, coda, and interview) is illuminating, but should be read with a grain of salt. One of the most powerful elements of a great book is that it reaches out to the individual reader, who is able to take it in according to his or her own experiences. The message the reader gets from such books ultimately may not be what the writer intended, but still be fully relevant. Reading the author's views and intentions for the novel can upset this great experience.The afterward is quite charming, an account of how Bradbury first typed the novel using a paid typewriter (it charged him a dime for 30 minutes, he spent $9.80.) Bradbury also mentions how his characters still visit him, and gives additional insights/alternatives plots, especially a fascinating and rather sad look at how the Beatty, once a mad lover of books, became an arrogant, obnoxious book-burning fireman.The coda is an amusing diatribe at those who want him to update his works to fit the modern times (include more women, blacks), or, more disturbingly, change his work (without him knowing it!). Such censorship is indeed frightening and should be avoided at all costs. However, one also gets the feeling while reading Bradbury's somewhat smug rant, especially while reading statements such as \\"the real world is the playing ground for each and every group, to make and unmake laws (p.178)\\" that Bradbury has never been a part of a denigrated minority. One doubts that Bradbury has ever experienced the disadvantages that comes with such membership, which includes having to put up with disturbing elements in books from insults (the 'n' word, savage) to works attesting to prove minority inferiority in a myriad of ways ('proving' a lack of intelligence, propensity towards violence, lack of morals) and finally calls for eugenics to destroy them altogether. Certainly Bradbury does not seem to have reflected on the fact the real world might be a very unfair playing field- with some groups having much more power and ability to make and unmake laws than others.The interview at the end was the most disturbing for me; Bradbury comes off as out of touch with both his book and the present world. He flatly denies that the US today with its unending and nebulous 'war on terror' reflects the unending war that his own book talked about, a war in which we sit comfortably while other people make sacrifices and other countries suffer. Even worse, Bradbury very naively states \\"there's no chance for censorship today.\\" (p.184). Tell that to Don Imus, the Palestinians, anti-corporate activists, and those critical of homosexuality, evolution, official versions 9/11 and global warming, and a myriad of other topics.Sadly, fifty years after his book, Bradbury does not seem to grasp the power of his own book; he does not really seem to appreciate how his vision of a mindless dystopia is rapidly becoming our reality."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought the book was pretty overrated. Admittedly, the concept was interesting and the story rolls around all right, but the superfluous metaphor-laden rambling passages really irked me. I can only sit through so much.I think I would have liked this book more if I didn't keep picturing Bradbury sitting somewhere with a painfully smug look on his face. But all in all, Fahrenheit 451 is worth reading, though not necessarily all it's cracked up to be."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reading this book for the first time at the beginning of 2003, I found it remarkable that a novel about the suppression of information in an oppressive police state stands as a powerful critique of the assaults on freedom and personal liberty that the U.S. Government is now engaged in in the name of protecting its citizenry from terrorists.Who exactly are the terrorists? In the view of the shadowy government represented in the novel, they are those who hoard and protect forbidden printed works, and they are those members of an underground information subculture that commits works of literature to memory in the hope that one day, the printed page will be welcome again.In the post-9/11 America of George W. Bush and John Ashcroft, the terrorists can be anyone with a foreign-sounding last name. Even blameless American citizens are suspect. Under a provision of the USA Patriot Act, the government can force public libraries to hand over records about what books anyone has checked out, and they've furthermore made it a crime for the libraries to inform those whose library records have been invoked.Bradbury depicts a nation in which individuality is frowned upon, in which the government is deeply suspicious of its own citizenry, in which suspected \\"criminals\\" can be hunted and murdered by the state without a trial, in which content is spoon-fed to the public. In light of news stories reporting on the Total Information Awareness project in development by the NSA, how much of this can be taken as fiction? How long will it be before the cautionary tales of Bradbury and Orwell and Huxley become a nightmare reality?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent novel that I highly suggest to those who like well-written, thoughtful books. The plot and the story in general are extremely interesting- not only due to the actual events, but due to Fahrenheit 451's frightening connection to our lives. The futuristic, dystopian setting where the government has censored all forms of high art and learning, and where humans have 'dumbed down' to an unbelievable degree, gives way to a story where humankind fights with itself to regain a civilized society.Fahrenheit 451 is no doubt a critisism of our society and a scary prediction of may be ahead. Don't miss this wonderful novel!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This short book has been around for over forty years and I'll bet it will be around for at least another hundred because the truth of its message is a constant reminder of the value of books and priceless-ness of freedom of speech.Ray Bradbury takes a simple scenario....what would the future look like if &quot;real&quot; media were the only allowed form of information, and books, especially fiction, was outlawed. At first blush, there would be a few who might say, &quot;well we don't read that much now...we get most of our information from tv, our entertainment from movies, or our computers.&quot; But it's more than that if you really stop to consider that when you choose to pick up a book of YOUR choosing your are excercising not only a basic intellectual freedom, you are also exerting your privacy, your right to choose how you'll spend your time, and how you'll choose to look at the world.Bradbury considers all of these things and the choices one man decided to make as a consequence. What was so exciting for me was to be able to contemplate these ideas within the context of a story told with beautiful language and images and a story that will grab you until the very end.I know this book is one of those that gets assigned in high school and then never sees the light of day afterward......well, as an ancient 40-year-old, I think that's a shame. It's a great read no matter what your age.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, a science fiction book written by Ray Bradbury, is a good read. In the book, Guy Montag, a fireman, is paid to burn books. In fact, all fireman are paid to burn books. This book, being a science fiction, takes place in the future. Guy enjoys his job. He gets paid well and understands the system, books are for burning. He is under the impression that books are full of nothing but garbage. He meets a girl named Clarisse who changes his views completely. He starts to become more interested in books. He hides books in his house. He suddenly realizes what he has been doing. This book is a somewhat difficult read. It may not be enjoyed by children under sixth grade. The sentences are somewhat long and complex. At times, the vocabulary is also difficult. I would rate this book fair. I would only recommend it to people who are heavily interested in science fiction."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The basic premise behind Ray Bradbury's novel 'Fahrenheit 451' is compelling. In the future, fireman don't put out fires, they start them. It is their job to seek out books and put them to the flame, making sure that no one indulges in the 'crime' of reading one. But what makes this nightmare so interesting, and relevant, is that it was not forced upon the people by their government, but was decided upon by the people themselves. Minority groups, religions, and ethnicities, who were offended by the words of writers, simply made reading unpopular and convinced the world that books were, first, a waste of time, and then the root of all evil. A wonderful 'Negative Utopia' novel in the tradition of '1984' and 'Brave New World' Bradbury's novel differs in his writing style. His prose is difficult to follow and at times leaves the reader unimpressed. If you can you're not easily turned off by Bradbury's odd and difficult way of writing perhaps you'll enjoy the deeper message of this work."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman who's job requires him to efficiently burn books when a call enters the station. In the future, the government, in control of millions of people, decides to make reading books against the law, fearing that a literate society would destroy itself.Guy, through the vision of a young girl and an old English professor, discovers his own wonderment of his surroundings, triggered through great ideas found in books. Discovering this universal wonderment lies at the foundation of the author's main theme, highlighted brilliantly through his distorted and domineering society.With this futuristic society and a distortion of trends found in today's culture, Bradbury captures his reader's attention and makes them open their eyes, hearts, and mind to the true importance of independent intellectual enhancement through reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What a profound Novel!This should be required reading to all students. But alas, the future Bradbury predicted has come to pass.... Today, we are seeing more and more \\"Concerned Parents\\" reacting with a mob mentality in banning books from libraries and schools. Most have never read the books they have chosen to vilify. Strange that only a few outspoken right wing groups think they speak for all of society.The irony of it all is that Fahrenheit 451 has been banned from schools and classrooms because of its \\"negative\\" views toward those individuals that ban books. What is more tragic than a books that decries book banning, being banned itself?Do yourself a favor.... read this book. Pass it along to your child. Read other banned novels and keep them in circulation.The days of the Fireman are quickly approaching.\\"Play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, as I trust shall never be put out!\\""},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I liked this book and I find it ironic that a book which deals with the issue of censorship, is itself censored and challenged. Complaints against this novel have ranged from its use of language (yes there is swearing) to characters drinking/smoking and ultimately the questioning of government. Heaven forbid that a book actually depicts things that occur in real life.What I enjoyed most about this novel was just how much it resembles life today. True, we are not a society who burns books in an attempt to repress freedom of speech and creativity, but we are a society that spends an exorbitant amount of time in front of the television watching reality programs and other mindless forms of entertainment such as video games. Ask a kitten what s/he has read recently and it's more than likely they will stare back at you with vacant eyes and a lot of hemming and hawing. Pitiful really.I also enjoyed the overall message about censorship. In fact, the part of the book I found the most fascinating was the coda wherein Bradbury gives a quick discussion of his dealings with the subject first hand. In his own words, \\"There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches. Every minority...[he goes on here to list various groups]...feels it has the right, the duty to douse the kerosene, light the fuse\\" (Fahrenheit 451 Coda 177). And ultimately that is what it boils down to, the idea that every time someone tries to censor a piece of literature, or a movie, or what have you, they are striking the match against creativity and freedom of expression.Unfortunately I did run into one problem that made it hard for me to really enjoy this novel and that was Bradbury's writing style. It was extremely dry and tended towards rambling. Some of the ideas were brilliantly flushed out, but others, like the war, were simply stated with little detail whatsoever. An old tom cat professor of mine once said that in the art of writing the idea is to show the story not tell it. In this regards, I found it very challenging to picture the events taking place within the novel.Regardless of that, this is one of those books which everyone should read at least once in their nine lives."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 populates most \\"Best Books\\" lists and yet it is still somehow under appreciated. I think some of this stems from critics focusing much of the attention on the censorship of books, which, while certainly an important aspect of the novel, is not necessarily its most compelling point. The most devastating scenes are those where it is clear that this society has lost its soul. In commenting on the war that wages around them, Mrs. Phelps states, \\"It's always some other woman's husband that dies.\\" Montag, the protagonist, is married to a woman who has attempted suicide multiple times, who can't remember where she met her husband, and who doesn't care about...anything.The images that Bradbury can call forth during the book's climatic moments are heart-wrenching. Books die like slaughtered birds. Bombs fall like seeds scattered by the hands of God. Sparks dance like fireflies.Yet, in the middle of all of the carnage and waste, there is hope. Hope that we will not forget the past and the lessons it teaches. Hope that even in an age where the iPods, massive television screens and casual violence that Bradbury predicted 60 years ago exist that we will not lose our humanity.This is a beautifully written book that has never been more relevant."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"First off, I'm not a literature buff, I just like to read. I happened to come across and read this book. It's now one of my all time favorites. It dark, thought provoking and hard to put down. Bradbury has one amazing imagination, (i.e. the Mechanical Dog) Brilliant."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book for school, and was really surprised that I enjoyed it. Ray Bradbury wrote this book in the 1950s and it seems that he was pretty accurate about the things that people would do in the future. I really enjoyed the way he wrote the book, it seemed very lyrical at certain points."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Having read '1984' and 'Brave New World', I was expecting this novel to be of the same quality, especially as it features on umpteen Books You Should Read lists.It's moderately interesting, but lack of character development means you don't really care what happens to Guy Montag as he breaks away from authority. Will the Mechanical Hound get him? Or not? Whatever...And as the far-fetched ending occurs - a bomb that flattens the city but appears to leave the free-thinking hobos, just a few miles away, untouched, I found myself curiously unmoved.Despite its feeling at times like a book written for a teen audience, Bradbury DOES give us something to think about. Although inspired by the 1950s world of McCarthyism and restriction of books, it has become relevant in a new way to 21st century readers: our society too is in danger of 'dumbing down' with endless entertainment and meaningless chat (witness everyone texting or tuned in to an IPod as they walk along, paying no attention to the world around them); angry young people kill for kicks just like Mildred Montag:'I always like to drive fast when I feel that way...It's fun out in the country. You hit rabbits, sometimes you hit dogs.'Interesting message but not a great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's last published book is a great thought provoking fantasy. What if we lived in a world where books were considered dangerous contraband and firemen weren't hired to put out but to start fires? We're already starting to experience news in shorter segments and everything's being reduced to soundbites. Will our attention span start to deteriorate to the extent that it is normal to only be able to focus for a few short minutes?Guy Montag is one such fireman whose wife subconsciously tries to commit suicide, and who after meeting a young neighbor, Clarisse, starts to think and question the world in which he lives. When he starts to steal and hide books in the walls of his house, he meets an old professor with whom he tries to formulate a plan to change the ruling regime who instill the fear of books among the population.

Ray Bradbury'sFahrenheit 451: A Novelis the tale of a future where books are deemed to be too dangerous for public utilization, and therefore illegal. In this future world, firemen no longer extinguish flames, but rather they douse piles of parchment and binding in kerosene before setting them ablaze, effectively exterminating not only the physical objects themselves, but also the potentially subversive ideas contained therein. Published in 1953, but as fresh today as it has ever been, it follows the plight of fireman Montag as he discovers the power of the words he has been unquestioningly eradicating. Armed with that knowledge, he gets drawn into a resistance movement.Half a century before they became realities, this visionary work predicted the rise and widespread deployment of security cameras, flat-screen televisions that cover a whole wall, and interactive reality TV. Bradbury's imagination and heart were boundless and on display nowhere more than inFahrenheit 451: A Novel- his best-known and best work. Let it be a primer for a further exploration of this prolific writer's work."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I picked up this book because I was just in need of something to read. Once I began, I could not put it down! Farenheit 451 is set in a not so far away distopian future where media rules and books are illegal. In this place, firemen start fires on books rather than put fires out. Guy Montag is fireman who begins to see the truth in books. When this is discovered though, he has to run for his life. This is a great book for pretty much everyone, but there is aare heavy phycological thoughs throughout the whole book, and sparce mild language. Overall, if you want a great book to read, choode this!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this out loud with my high school student. It was her assigned summer reading. I remembered reading this a long time ago or watching the movie. One remarkable thing about the book is how Bradbury describes the future where we are locked in houses and tied to a community of media devices. Because it was written at the dawn of television, I find it facinating that Bradbury would predict a world so similar to life now.The language in the book is very dynamic. It is a great book to read out loud. There is wonderful tension in the plot as the fireman turned rebel tries to escape the nazi-like government.This is the book about book burning. I was in Split, Croatia last summer and our guide pointed out where the Nazis burned the books in the town square. It sent shivers up my spine. You will feel that when you read this book, a book that cautions us about totalitarianism and social isolation."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ok so some of the stuff in this book seems like dated, mid-twentieth century Science Fiction predictions of a future we now know will probably never occur. But the themes in this book are timeless and the hero is just like you and me. Hopefully. If we a more people like the fireman in this book then perhaps half the holocausts of history would never have happened. then again during those same holocausts there were men and women like the fireman and they helped defeat the tyrants in power or save millions of lives by making the right decision (moral decision) over mindlessly following the status-quo. Bradbury's descriptions of fire are lovely. They are like flowers, like petals, like demons and like angels."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I always like to read a classic every once in a while, whether it be a mystery, literature, or good old science fiction. It seems that many of the classic science fiction novels deal more with man's attitude toward his surroundings rather than the stories of aliens and the future world gone crazy thru technology. This book takes the simple premise of a world where books are illegal and turns it into a Twilight Zone episode. The best part of a novel such as this is that the reader is forced to contemplate a scenario which is actually imaginable and decide how he or she would act and react. An interesting story to say the least....."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 absolutely cathes the reader's attention of the importance of books. In this story the government has become so corrupt that it has banned the ownership of any sort of literature. It is not until the day when protagonist Montag realizes, while talking to a young girl, how unhappy and naive he actually was. Bradbury takes the idea of a Utopia society and turns it completely upside downThis book shows the damaging effects on the censorships of books and stresses the importance of literature. This is a highly recommmended book to those seeking to open their eyes and realize the truth of how society can be. However, the story moves at a slow pace and many undifined things are exposed in the begining. Other than that, this is an exceptioally good book with an even better moral."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a science fiction book that is a very different type of book, and at sometimes confusing. No matter when you read it in you are able to imagine the future. The plot was complex and was suspenseful. And the characters in the book were not the same as some of the other characters you may have read about in other books. Montag the main character in the story was a fireman and his job was to make fire and burn books and not put fires out. Most of the people in the book seemed the same and rather dull, but there was one character that was different from all of the rest. Clarisse was a seventeen year old girl who was not as dull and flat as some of the other characters that you would read about. She would always be thinking about things others thought were foolish and strange. And when Montag meets her he begins to change. Books in this story was a danger to their society and mad people \\"unhappy\\" as the government would say. The style of the book was confusing and difficult, and it was also easy at other times. Parts of the vocabulary was difficult but it helped the story. The sentences described a lot and helped to create images of the near future. I would recommend this book to all science fiction lovers and also people who like to use their imaginations. This is because when you read the story it is very scientific and hard. If you don't like to read these types of books I would not recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 is an exiting book filled with suspense, you are always waiting to read what happens next. You can hardly put it down! Though it is not the style of book that I normally read, I liked it a lot, enough to read others like it. This was a good book, yet the vocabulary was lacking, and I have preferred other science fiction books, like Enders Game. I would definitely suggest this book to a wide variety of readers, including those who do not read science fiction books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 is a mediocre quality book. It is rather easy to read (7th grade level) and is also easy to follow. The writing style is different because the culture is very different from anywhere today. The plot is also different due to books are banned in this world. This book is recommended to people who dislike books because this book shows the world without them, so those people may reconsider their opinions."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Being in 7th grade I found this story to be a little confusing. The story took place in the future, when firemen start fires and not put them out. The plot involves a fireman named Montag who begins to question the way of society. At some points the plot got very confusing because the book would jump from scene to scene and from concept to concept. Ray Bradbury used many advanced words and metaphors and these contributed to the story getting confusing. Overall I enjoyed the book, and I would recommend this book to anyone after 8th grade because of confusion in the plot."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I just finished Fahrenheit 451 and feel like I did when someone gave me a shareware version of a video game. I learned the moves, became someone addicted, cleared the third level and found that I needed a code to get the rest of the game. Only Ray didn't give away the code to 451!This is clearly a fantastic story, horribly well written. I have wish listed several more of his books for future reading. Unfortunately 451 is long enough that you suspend some of the caveats used when reading short stories. With a book this long, I want developed characters to be resolved. Several characters just go away, which left me lacking at the end. Sometimes this is intended, and strong. In this case, it seemed thoughtless and abrubt.Don't miss the afterword and coda at the end. Very nice additions."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It truly is. Ray Bradbury's masturfully told story of censorship in the future show us what we may become: A civilization of mindless people who are so bent on being PC and &quot;happy&quot; that they end up burning all books. While that is a rough description, I don't wish to give too much away. Bradbury's characters all act realistically (something im a stickler for) and I love the way he writes, using metaphors constantly he achieves an amazing level of description while still leaving some things for the reader to figure out. People have told me that the beginning is confusing; while I don't feel that is true, if you do kepp reading because the last 100 pages (out of only around 200) will rivet your eyes to the pages. Personally, I love Ray Bradbury and feel that this is his greatest work, or one of them. But you don't have to like Bradbury to like this novel; if you want a great book that will truly make you think, and just a great read, by all means pick this one up. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of the finest books I have ever read, and certainly high in my ranking of Bradbury's novels. Bradbury paints a picture, in his very colorful way, of a completely governmentally-controlled society in which books are outlawed and television reigns over all. Guy Montag, a fireman (whose job description now involves burning illegal books), finds himself stuck in this mixed-up world, and eventually make a decision between what he knows and what he believes in, illustrating Bradbury's almost universal theme of conflict versus change. This novel is very applicable in today's society, even though it was written nearly fifty years ago, dealing with topics that are still active in the present. Bradbury provides a moral of sorts within this novel which conveys many of his deep-set beliefs, such disdain for television, hatred for censorship, and Bradbury's undeterrable love for books and the printed word. Very enlightening, reading this book will definitely cause one to think twice about many of today's common practices. A very thought-provoking and well-written novel; this book should be read by any fan of science fiction, if not everyone!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book follows the same outline of the great novel \\"1984\\" by George Orwell. This book deals mainly with the threat that censorship poses on a nation. Guy Montag, a fireman, has never had a problem going along with the norm until he meets a young girl who changes his perspective on life. He then begins to question why he burns books which leads him into trouble with his boss Fire Chief Beatty. There are many important lessons that one can draw from this book but mainly the idea that books never die and that they live on in people's hearts and minds as long as there lessons are remembered. This book can teach young people to appreciate the importance of books, a must read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"the book fahrenheit 451 was a decent book it involves a character named montag. he is a firefighter no, not the ones who put out fires . he burns books because its the law not to have them. later on in the book he grows to like books because of his own curiosoty, but he almost looses his life because of it. i wont give away the ending but if you want to know what happens then i suggest you read it. chances are youll like it"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's account of a bookless world is realistic in every way. Farenheit 451 is realistic in how it describes situations, people, and places throughout the book. In the beginning of the book it describes Guy Montag and a book burning. The author describes the book in how the books &quot;Flutter around like birds and the sky burns as black as night.Guy Mantag is a firefighter who, instead of fighting fires, he starts fires. Guy does this because of a massive government censorship act in order to keep people in line with the way they think. It is sort of like a cover up. Society agrees with this because they don't want to break the law.This book's in depth descriptions are so good they pull you in and its like your there. Farenheit 451 will fill you with a new way of looking at things."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I would recommened this book for anyone ages 13 and up. It's a hard read, but has a strong theme and interesting characters. I enjoyed the whole book until the ending. I didn't like the ending because it was a little bit confusing and sad. Besides that I enjoyed this science-fiction which has a strong resemblence to the Giver by Lois Lowry."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Just finished reading this book and found it quite entertaining. Instead of giving you a synopsis of the book as many other readers have done, I found it interesting how the entire premise of book banning has even resurfaced in recent years. The entire Harry Potter series has received significant press as to whether the books are appropriate for younger readers. Bradbury's observations are not very far off those seen today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was a very good book. The detail was very good. You could just picture the story. My favorite thing about the book was that you had to infer what happened to Clarisse. Was she killed, OR did she go to the railroad. I really think that the author Ray Bradbury is a great author because he puts the best similes in the the right places. For one example of a good simile is on page 3 of the book , \\"With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python sitting its venomous kerosene upon the world...\\" This talks about the nozzle that Montag uses to light the fires that burns the books. This book is a good book and I would recomend this book to anyone who wants to read it. It is filled with everything you could ask for in a book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman who job it is to start fires instead of stoping the. In this backwards world of his he burns books and the houses that they are hidden in. In this future world reading a book is against the law because it gives peoples ideas. Guy never qustioned his job until he actually thinks what it would be like to read a book.....I never never really thought what our world would be like with no books, but now that I think about it I can't believe how monotonous and boring it would be. Now that I think about it I am glad I dont live in a world like Guy Montag's.This book has become on of my favorites and I highly recomend you read it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Imagine a future where books are illegal, and the purpose of firemen isn't to put out fires, but to start them. The main character is one such fireman, his job to burn books(from where the book gets it's title---fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which paper burns), and doesn't think twice about it. But gradually, he meets people he finds perplexing, a girl who talks about rain tasting like wine, a woman who stays with her books until she is burned alive. His life is transformed when he hides a book, and opens it...Very engaging, but at times, so deep it makes your head spin."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is very intriguing both in what its theme is and also in how much the main character changes throughout the course of the story. It has great discriptions even if they are abstract and also a great development of characters within an action plot. I would have to say that my favorite character in the entire book was Clarisse. She seemed so soft, so fresh, so new, and so likeable, especially compared with some of the other characters in the book. She was so full of life and the joys she could find in it that I really enjoyed her character and I was very sad when she dies. This book always kept me interested with its implications and its deep meanings and because of that it always kept me thinking. I would have to stop for a few minutes to think about what I had just read but that is a good thing and it made me feel like I became more familiar with the book becuase of it. Overall I think that it is a very well written book in every aspect. The main character though not very likeable in the beginning becomes someone you can and want to cheer for as the book progresses. I really enjoyed reading this book and am glad that I did pick this book to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I keep coming back to science fiction written in the 50's and 60's. This novel is a perfect example of why I do this.I've read this a few times now, and it's always a pleasure to do so. It may not be the best written, but since it was one of Bradbury's first novels, I'm prepared to be tolerant of the writing style.The ideas presented here are still fresh and relevant today, and most certainly set the ground work for many of those which followed. It's influence can be seen in King's 'Running Man'(the original Bachman book, not the screenplay), and Ira Levin's 'This Perfect Day'.The central theme of the state imposing what the masses may/may not have access to, and that above all &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot;, can be seen in today's society to some extent.This is undoubtedly a single-sitting novel. Whenever I pick it up to read it, I find that it's easier to read to the end than attempt to put it down and come back to it later when I'm half way through. It is easy to read, and the story flows beautifully from beginning to end. A perfect book for a wet sunday afternoon."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I find most SiFi juvenile and shallow. This book is both thought provoking and an interesting study of human nature.I recommend it to readers of all types of literature. It is an excellent read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's novel, Fahrenheit 451, is an eye-opening science fiction novel that is definitely a recommended read for anyone with a passion for reading. Bradbury takes the reader into a dystopian society where many things seem backward. Firemen don't put out fires - they start them. Books are not read, they are burned. The government tells you what to think and what to discuss. Free thinking is discouraged. Maybe the most starling thing about the novel is that free thinking is not craved. A vast majority of the citizens are satisfied with their ignorance. They are comfortable with being nave. This brings the reader to an unsettling but very real conclusion: Are we as a society becoming more and more comfortable with our ignorance?The novel focuses on chronicling the eye-opening experiences of a middle aged firefighter, Guy Montag. Montag appears content with his job, but the reader soon learns that this is not the case. He begins to question everything when he meets a young girl named Clarisse. Clarisse is a very peculiar girl. She tells Montag that she enjoys taking walks and that she rarely watches the Parlor Walls, which would be our equivalent of television. Clarisse asks questions, an uncommon practice in their society. She asks if Montag has ever read a book, and if it's true that firemen used to put out fires (Bradbury 8). Montag is taken aback at the way she freely addresses him. Most surprising all of all, is when Clarisse is about to leave. Before entering her house, she stops and asks, \\"Are you happy?\\" (Bradbury 10). Montag scoffs and pays no attention to her seemingly irrelevant question, but later he begins to think more and more. Am I happy with the life I am living? Am I satisfied with burning books, houses, and sometimes even innocent people?Throughout this masterpiece of a novel, Bradbury frequently uses symbolism. Bradbury uses fire to symbolize cleansing. For the firemen, is it the cleansing of knowledge and what they perceive to be dangerous to the minds of the people. The chief fireman even says, \\"Burn all, burn everything. Fire is bright and fire is clean\\" (Bradbury 60). For Montag, fire is a cleansing of evil within the society. Montag sets fire to the chief fireman and believes that by doing so he is helping to cleanse the evil that clings to their society. Another example of symbolism in Fahrenheit 451 is a giant mechanical hound the resides at the fire station. The hound \\"slept but did not sleep, lived but did not live\\" (Bradbury 24). The firemen played a game with the hound where they would set a few animals lose in its vicinity and place bets on which animal it would kill first. The hound represents the government and fear of the government.Overall, Bradbury's novel is a thought-provoking classic that should not soon be forgotten. This novel will make you question the way you think, the way you interact with technology, and it might even make you want to turn off the computer and pick up a book instead."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"{my thoughts} - This book is interesting. It is futuristic and very engaging for the reader. It is about a guy named {guy montag}. He is a fireman but not the in customary sense of the word. Instead of putting out fires he starts them. The only fires started are the one's at residences houses where the individuals have books any books. They are banned not allowed and therefore those caught with books are subject to losing all their worldly possessions. This book is about his defiance of such laws, his determination and his will to make a stand for things he believes to be wrong.

Yes, we have a long way to go to be in a state where books are outlawed and firemen start fires instead of stopping them. But still, we have a good head start. People come home from work and plop on the couch and watch TV. You have to be an intellectual to read books. It's just not the norm anymore. In this book, TV has taken over people's lives with wall to wall TV screens. The imagination is lost in the hours of meaningless violence and comedy that is blasted through cables to people's homes. Then, through an array of events, the main character, Montag, starts to wonder about things and think for himself. With society frowning upon thinking, he's in a world of trouble.

This is a society where most people only care about themselfs. The firemen are more like policemen then firemen. They are responsible for up holding the law. If anyone if found to have a book it is the job of the firemen to take care of the situation. With flamethroughers in hand they burn not only the books but the building that houses them. It is said that firemen never have put out a fire. Guy Montag is a fireman. Occurring to Guy Montag: \\"It was a pleasure to burn.\\" Montag loved his job immensely. To him the sent of kerosene was like perfume. Montag always exempted thing for the way they were. He was \\"happy\\". He had all the things he needed to be \\"happy\\". Why should he change.

Also it was definely a cliff hanger! i couldn't put it down, i ended up so far ahead of my class that i had to stop reading so i could relate to what was going on in class!This was one of the better books that i have read in the past! especially being assigned for class i was extremely surprised that i liked it as much as i did! so i encourage that the future english classes of the sophomore year read this novel because it makes you think, learn what the true meaning of life is, and also improves your vocabulary and your reading skills!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book had some very good qualities. The novel leaves your mind provoked into hypothetical situations like the ones in the book. Knowledge is burned, individuality and poetry are frowned upon. Is this really too different from our society today? No, it's really not far off. This read has some interesting twists at the end and leaves you thinking."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],O={key:0},W={key:1};function S(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=w("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",q,[(e(!0),t(y,null,f(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),g(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",W,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",O,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",S],["__scopeId","data-v-57e5cb1a"]]),C=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/11.md","filePath":"guide/11.md"}'),E={name:"guide/11.md"},R=Object.assign(E,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(H)]))}});export{C as __pageData,R as default};
