The coverage of the field is comprehensive, including topics ranging from the classical methods of threshold measurement, to the modern methods of detection theory, to psychophysical scaling of sensation magnitude. The approach is one in which methods, theories, and applications are described for each experimental procedure. New features found in this third edition include: * methodological and theoretical contributions made in the field during this time period, * descriptions of adaptive procedures for measuring thresholds, context effects in scaling, theory of quantal fluctuations, multidimensional scaling, nonmetric scaling of sensory differences, and the relationship between the size of the DL and the slope of the sensation magnitude function, * new methods for measuring the observer's sensitivity of criterion and an expanded discussion of category scaling including the range frequency model and verbally labeled categories, and * methods used to control the observer's nonlinear use of numbers in magnitude estimation such as line-length scaling, magnitude matching, master scaling, and category-ratio scaling.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5J7ojwEACAAJ&dq=Psychophysics:+The+Fundamentals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Esther: Queen for a Reason (Young Reader's Christian Library)","description":"Faced with the challenge of saving her people, the Jews, Queen Esther spoke out.

Flowing from character to character and from year to year, the novel paints a moving portrait of love, loss and perception.

Vast in scope, exhaustive in original research, written with passion, narrative skill, and human sympathy, A People's Tragedy is a profound account of the Russian Revolution for a new generation. Many consider the Russian Revolution to be the most significant event of the twentieth century. Distinguished scholar Orlando Figes presents a panorama of Russian society on the eve of that revolution, and then narrates the story of how these social forces were violently erased. Within the broad stokes of war and revolution are miniature histories of individuals, in which Figes follows the main players' fortunes as they saw their hopes die and their world crash into ruins. Unlike previous accounts that trace the origins of the revolution to overreaching political forces and ideals, Figes argues that the failure of democracy in 1917 was deeply rooted in Russian culture and social history and that what had started as a people's revolution contained the seeds of its degeneration into violence and dictatorship. A People's Tragedy is a masterful and original synthesis by a mature scholar, presented in a compelling and accessibly human narrative.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EUedet2w_oAC&dq=A+People%27s+Tragedy:+A+History+of+the+Russian+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Couple's Guide to Fertility: Updated with the Newest Scientific Techniques to Help You Have a Baby","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"My animal kingdom, one by one","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vnVaAAAACAAJ&dq=My+animal+kingdom,+one+by+one&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ebony Tower (Isis Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l_8PAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Ebony+Tower+(Isis+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Key to Yourself","description":"Key to Yourself combines modern psychology and the same principles taught thousands of years ago by master teachers such as Jesus.

Within months she became the magazine s first fiction editor, discovering and championing the work of Vladimir Nabokov, John Updike, James Thurber, Marianne Moore, and her husband-to-be, E. B. White, among others. After years of cultivating fiction, White set her sights on a new genre: garden writing. On March 1, 1958, The New Yorker ran a column entitled  Onward and Upward in the Garden,  a critical review of garden catalogs, in which White extolled the writings of  seedmen and nurserymen,  those unsung authors who produced her  favorite reading matter.  Thirteen more columns followed, exploring the history and literature of gardens, flower arranging, herbalists, and developments in gardening. Two years after her death in 1977, E. B. White collected and published the series, with a fond introduction. The result is this sharp-eyed appreciation of the green world of growing things, of the aesthetic pleasures of gardens and garden writing, and of the dreams that gardens inspire.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ecBvDwAAQBAJ&dq=ONWARD+AND+UPWARD+IN+THE+GARDEN&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Haynes Kawasaki Zx600 and 750 Liquid Cooled Fours 1985 to 1997","description":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Motorcycles, Fourth Edition, is the most complete book on motorcycles, covering everything from how to choose and maintain a motorcycle and how to buy appropriate gear, to how to ride safely, and how to make the most out of trips on the open road.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=myKMPo82eZkC&dq=Haynes+Kawasaki+Zx600+and+750+Liquid+Cooled+Fours+1985+to+1997&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"East Lansing: Collegeville Revisited (MI) (Images of America)","description":"The modern city of East Lansing, Michigan is a thriving community of 46,000 people located just a few miles from the state capital building in Lansing.

In the course of his inquiries, Brunetti encounters an unusual cast of characters, but discovers nothing that seems criminal.

Medical Research for the Twenty-first Century","description":"Drs. Greek have written 2 books on why using animals as models for humans is not the best way to conduct medical research and drug testing. During their lectures and debates, the most commonly asked question was, \\"Well. What will we use if we don't use animals?\\" What Will We Do If We Don't Experiment On Animals? Medical Research for the Twenty-first Century is the answer to that question. Drs. Greek explain briefly why one species cannot predict drug response for another and describe what research and testing methods should be used today instead of animals. They also describe where our biomedical research dollars should be spent if we are to have cures for cancer, AIDS, and Alzheimer's. This book will appeal to science-trained and general audiences, animal lovers and science readers, public policy analysts, students, patients and patient support groups, and government watchdog groups.

Elisabeth Alione is convalescing in a hotel in rural France when she meets two men and another woman. The sophisticated dalliance among the four serves to obscure an underlying violence, which, when the curtain of civilization is drawn aside, reveals in her fellow guests a very contemporary, perhaps even new, form of insanity. Like many of Marguerite Duras s novels, Destroy, She Said owes much to cinema, displaying a skillful interplay of dialogue and description. There are recurring moods and motifs from the Duras repertoire: eroticism, lassitude, stifled desire, a beautiful woman, a mysterious forest, a desolate provincial hotel. Included in this volume is an in-depth interview with Duras by Jacques Rivette and Jean Narboni.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dUcxCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How MIDI Works (Teach Master)","description":"A beginners guide to MIDI, sequencing & digital audio recording with chapter summaries and practice exams.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1VYA-q8FVeYC&dq=How+MIDI+Works+(Teach+Master)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Powerpuff Girls Save The Easter Bunny","description":"When the Powerpuff Girls get swarms of bugs and rotten cheese instead of jelly beans and chocolate eggs in their Easter baskets, they realize that some evil monster must have hijacked the Easter Bunny and it is up to the girls to save the day.

Despite differences in language, appearance, or culture, maps are universal touchstones in human civilization. Over the centuries, maps have served many varied purposes; far from mere guides for reaching a destination, they are unique artistic forms, aides in planning commercial routes, literary devices for illuminating a story. Accuracy or inaccuracy of maps has been the make-or-break factor in countless military battles throughout history. They have graced the walls of homes, bringing prestige and elegance to their owners. They track the mountains, oceans, and stars of our existence. Maps help us make sense of our worlds both real and imaginary they bring order to the seeming chaos of our surroundings. With The Curious Map Book, Ashley Baynton-Williams gathers an amazing, chronologically ordered variety of cartographic gems, mainly from the vast collection of the British Library. He has unearthed a wide array of the whimsical and fantastic, from maps of board games to political ones, maps of the Holy Land to maps of the human soul. In his illuminating introduction, Baynton-Williams also identifies and expounds upon key themes of map production, peculiar styles, and the commerce and collection of unique maps.

Divided into five parts--each prefaced with a rationale and brief summary of its chapters--this volume presents contemporary thinking about task analysis together with a representative set of methods. Part I opens with seven chapters that form a book-within-a-book and introduce most of the main concepts, methods, and techniques discussed in more detail in later parts. Part II describes the use of task analysis in commercial IT projects and recognizes some of the important constraints on its use. Part III primarily concentrates on human issues--most relying on some particular psychological or ergonomic model. Part IV presents task analysis methods targeted at software engineering development. These methods, particularly where supported by CASE tools, are therefore practical for use in commercial projects. Lastly, Part V focuses on outstanding issues associated with task analysis, highlighting the main problems with it and analyzing how these might be resolved in due course.

Responding to the growing threat to their beliefs, factions of the Royalist Social Movement seek to restore the principles and former glory of the Great Generation. High above Terra, connected by tethers stretching from the surface to sixty-four thousand kilometers in space, is the civilian space station City of Heaven-home to more than a million citizens. A futuristic Tower of Babel, City of Heaven is humankind's greatest achievement. But, Ar'chaists, a radical sect of Royalism, are determined to force the world to bend its knee, with Ar'chaists assuming the Regency. In a single act of terror, they sever the tethers connecting City of Heaven, killing nearly all of its inhabitants and sending the city on a collision course with Terra, where millions more will surely die. In space and on Terra, survivors battle for control and the polifaith movement reaches a crisis that threatens to unleash a new global faith-cleansing that will rid the world of Royalism once and for all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZgWTZdFz29QC&dq=When+Shadows+Dream:+Twilight:+A+Short+Story+Collection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CAPONE","description":"The real story of how the federal government finally apprehended and convicted America s most notorious criminal, Al Capone. Drawing on recently discovered government documents, wiretap transcripts, and Al Capone s handwritten personal letters, New York Times bestselling author Jonathan Eig tells the dramatic story of the rise and fall of the nation s most infamous criminal in rich new detail. From the moment he arrived in Chicago in 1920, Capone found himself in a world with limitless opportunity. Within a few years Capone controlled an illegal bootlegging business with annual revenue rivaling that of some of the nation s largest corporations. Along the way he corrupted the Chicago police force and local courts while becoming one of the world s first international celebrities. Legend credits Eliot Ness and his  Untouchables  with apprehending Capone, but Eig shows that this wasn t so. In Get Capone, the man known as  Scarface  emerges as a complex man, doomed as much by his ego as by his vicious criminality. This is the real Al Capone.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I48z-9NgqAoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discourses of Brigham Young [1925 First Edition]","description":"List of charter members of the society: v. 1, p. 98-99.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ouYGAUeKbVMC&dq=Discourses+of+Brigham+Young+%5B1925+First+Edition%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Be Your Own Boss At Your Current Job","description":"Quit The Rat Race & Live Life On Your Terms! - The Ultimate \\"How-To\\" Guide Do you want to leave your 9-to-5 job and join the swelling ranks of a new entrepreneurial class?

A thief and a nobleman, both down on their luck, cross paths on a bitter winter s day in 1701. One is fleeing the gallows, the other, the young Christian von Tornefeld, has deserted his station in the Swedish army. Neither will reach his intended destination.

Convicted in a trial by his elders in Britain and hounded by rumors that he settled in Ireland for financial gain, the man who was to become Ireland s patron saint battled against great odds before succeeding as a missionary. Saint Patrick Retold draws on recent research to offer a fresh assessment of Patrick s travails and achievements. This is the first biography in nearly fifty years to explore Patrick s career against the background of historical events, and Roy Flechner leaves no stone unturned as he takes readers on a riveting journey through Romanized Britain and late Iron Age Ireland. Rather than a dismantling of Patrick s reputation, or an argument against his sainthood, Flechner s biography raises crucial questions about self-image and the making of a reputation. From boyhood deeds to the challenges of a missionary enterprise, Saint Patrick Retold steps beyond established narratives to reassess a notable figure s life and legacy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y_j6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Saint+Patrick&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chess Under the Microscope: Magnify Your Chess Strength!","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0mBLAAAAYAAJ&dq=Chess+Under+the+Microscope:+Magnify+Your+Chess+Strength!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contest Problem Book No 1: Annual High School Mathematics Examinations 1950-1960 (New Mathematical Lib) (Bk. 1)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CGE8AAAAMAAJ&dq=Contest+Problem+Book+No+1:+Annual+High+School+Mathematics+Examinations+1950-1960+(New+Mathematical+Lib)+(Bk.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Garter Snakes: Evolution and Ecology (Animal Natural History Series)","description":"The Garter Snakes: Evolution and Ecology is the first comprehensive review of the genus Thamnophis in nearly ninety years.

After a short period of practice, Todd could begin to see subtle changes in himself and in his life. The anxiety, resentment and worry that were so prevalent in his life began to disappear. Entering his life were the two things that he had always searched for-calm and serenity. As his practice continued, he began to feel immense changes and had several epiphanies of the presence of God.

In Mastering the Merger, David Harding and Sam Rovit argue that a laserlike focus on just four key imperatives--before executives finalize the deal--can dramatically improve the odds of M&A success. Based on more than 30 years of in-the-trenches work on thousands of deals across a range of industries--and supplemented by extensive Bain & Co. research--Harding and Rovit reveal that the best M&A performers channel their efforts into (1) targeting deals that advance the core business; (2) determining which deals to close and when to walk away; (3) identifying where to integrate--and where not to; and (4) developing contingency plans for when deals inevitably stray. Top deal makers also favor a succession of smaller deals over complex \\"megamergers\\"--and essentially institutionalize a success formula over time. Helping executives zero in on what matters most in the complex world of M&A, Mastering the Merger offers a blueprint for the decisions and strategies that will beat the odds.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BhxXf66FxW8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ecological Aesthetics: Art in Environmental Design: Theory and Practice","description":"Over a hundred projects by artists and landscape architects from the USA, Japan, Germany, Denmark, France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain and Italy present the broad conceptual repertoire of an ecological aesthetic whose designs focus on natural processes of growth, destruction and renewal.

The HISTORY OF THE GERMAN GENERAL STAFF is the first comprehensive history of the Prussian and later German General Staff from its earliest beginnings in the Thirty Years  War to the German unconditional surrender in 1945. With the dawn of the industrial age, war was taken out of the hands of monarchs and aristocrats. During the first decades of its existence the German General Staff was led by idealists with constructive political conceptions and ethical and Christian mentality. The emergence of the anonymous technicians, whose political convictions were either non-existent or formed by military necessity or ambitions, only served to aggravate an expansionist, adventurous, and militaristic national temperament. Hitler s decision to force his country into a war which could not end well and his deep hostility toward the General Staff created the greatest tragedy in its history when most of its members were continually torn by the struggle between human, ethical, and patriotic responsibilities on the one hand and by military obedience as exemplified in their military oath on the other. The continual conflict ended in the attempt on Hitler s life and also in the complete destruction of the German General Staff by Hitler himself...There were aloof and cold technicians, warm-hearted, emotional men with European conceptions, fanatical Nazis, gullible dupes, drill-sergeant types, and true idealistic aristocrats like Stauffenberg. The...HISTORY OF THE GERMAN GENERAL STAFF, which is based on tremendous research in German and foreign sources and on many interviews with German generals and staff officers who survived World War II, is considered the standard work in the field.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oclvCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coping and Prevailing with Multiple Sclerosis and other Life Struggles","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_AcDoVr9QvMC&dq=Coping+and+Prevailing+with+Multiple+Sclerosis+and+other+Life+Struggles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Party Crashers","description":"NATIONAL BESTSELLER ? From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Love Your Life comes a humorous and heartwarming novel about family and finding a second chance at love, set against the backdrop of the most fabulous party you ve ever snuck into.  Sophie Kinsella keeps her finger on the cultural pulse, while leaving me giddy with laughter.  Jojo Moyes, author of The Giver of Stars and The Last Letter from Your Lover It s been almost two years since Effie s beloved parents got divorced, destroying the image of the happy, loving childhood she thought she had. Since then, she s become estranged from her father and embarked on a feud with his hot (and much younger) girlfriend, Krista. And now, more earth-shattering news: They ve sold Greenoaks, the rambling Victorian country house Effie has always called home. When Krista decides to throw a grand  house-cooling  party, Effie is originally left off the guest list and then receives a last-minute  anti-invitation  (maybe it s because she called Krista a gold-digger, but Krista totally deserved it, and it was mostly a joke anyway). Effie declines, but then remembers a beloved childhood treasure is still hidden in the house. Her only chance to retrieve it is to break into Greenoaks while everyone is busy celebrating. As Effie sneaks around the house, hiding under tables and peeping through trapdoors, she realizes the secrets Greenoaks holds aren t just in the dusty passageways and hidden attics she grew up exploring. Watching how her sister, brother, and dad behave when they think no one is looking, Effie overhears conversations, makes discoveries, and begins to see her family in a new light. Then she runs into Joe the love of her life, who long ago broke her heart, and who s still as handsome and funny as ever and even more truths emerge. But will Effie act on these revelations? Will she stay hidden or step out into the party and take her place with her family? And truthfully, what did she really come back to Greenoaks for? Over the course of one blowout party, Effie realizes that she must be honest with herself and confront her past before she ll ever be able to face her future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WGRlEAAAQBAJ&dq=Party+Crashers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Innerverse","description":"Twenty years after the eastern third of the United States is mysteriously cut off and transformed into a police state of passive humans ruled by a ominous technology, agent Frank Sutter becomes the region's only hope.

Physical objects such as one s own body situate and define us; yet at the same time they are fundamentally indifferent to us. The melancholy of this rift is a rich source of inspiration for artists. Peter Schwenger deftly weaves together philosophical and psychoanalytical theory with artistic practice. Concerned in part with the act of collecting, The Tears of Things is itself a collection of exemplary art objects literary and cultural attempts to control and possess things including paintings by Georgia O Keeffe and Ren  Magritte; sculpture by Louise Bourgeois and Marcel Duchamp; Joseph Cornell s boxes; Edward Gorey s graphic art; fiction by Virginia Woolf, Georges Perec, and Louise Erdrich; the hallucinatory encyclopedias of Jorge Luis Borges and Luigi Serafini; and the corpse photographs of Joel Peter Witkin. However, these representations of objects perpetually fall short of our aspirations. Schwenger examines what is left over debris and waste and asks what art can make of these. What emerges is not an art that reassembles but one that questions what it means to assemble in the first place. Contained in this catalog of waste is that ultimate still life, the cadaver, where the subject-object dichotomy receives its final ironic reconciliation. Peter Schwenger is professor of English at Mount St. Vincent University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He is the author of Fantasm and Fiction: On Textual Envisioning, Letter Bomb: Nuclear Holocaust and the Exploding Word, and Phallic Critiques: Masculinity and Twentieth-Century Literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LM7vCAXMnbYC&dq=The+Tears+of+Things:+Melancholy+and+Physical+Objects&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Reality Matrix","description":"Bill Van Wyk, a mathematician, discovers an ominous sociological trend towards increasing occurrences of insanity, and decides that a mysterious outside force must be at work","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9563UsOodKMC&dq=The+Reality+Matrix&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Patrology","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Garden Trellis: Designs to Build and Vines to Cultivate","description":"The Garden Trellis is an exquisitely illustrated, yet very practical garden gift book.

For this new edition, there is a focus on the most important services provided in the state-local sector: education, health and welfare, public safety, and transportation. This textbook provides an examination and analysis of public finance practices and problems in a federal fiscal system, focusing on the fiscal behaviour and policies of state and local governments. The author presents detailed descriptions of significant institutions. Modern economic theory is applied to examine the way these institutions are used to produce and finance services, and to provide evaluation of alternative policies. Although the emphasis is on U.S. institutions and issues, much of the economic analysis can be applied to any federal system or to fiscal decentralization. This fully revised new edition sees updates throughout to data, topics, and applications. The Headlines and Applications sections reflect the most current policy issues affecting state and local governments. These include the effects of the Great Recession on state and local governments, changes in the tax treatment of internet purchases, the Affordable Care Act and implications for Medicaid spending by state governments, demographic changes and the implications for state-local finances, the implications of changes in automobile technology for transportation financing, and the potential for increased gambling activity.

(The Mexican American Experience)","description":"By the middle of the twenty-first century, one out of every six Americans will be of Mexican descent; and as health care becomes of increasing concern to all Americans, the particular needs of Mexican Americans will have to be more thoroughly addressed. Mexican Americans and Health explains how the health of Mexican-origin people is often related to sociodemographic conditions and genetic factors, while historical and political factors influence how Mexican Americans enter the health care system and how they are treated once they access it. It considers such issues as occupational hazards for Mexican-origin agricultural workers including pesticide poisoning, heat-related conditions, and musculoskeletal disorders and women's health concerns, such as prenatal care, preventable cancers, and domestic violence. The authors clearly discuss the health status of Mexican Americans relative to the rest of the U.S. population, interweaving voices of everyday people to explain how today's most pressing health issues have special relevance to the Mexican American community: - how values such as machismo, familismo, and marianismo influence care-seeking decisions and treatment of illness; - how factors such as cultural values, socioeconomic status, peer pressure, and family concerns can contribute to substance abuse; - how cultural attitudes toward sex can heighten the risk of AIDS and how approaches to AIDS prevention and education need to reflect core cultural values such as familismo, respeto, and confianza. The book also addresses concerns of Mexican Americans regarding the health care system. These include not only access to care and to health insurance but also the shortage of bilingual and bicultural health care professionals. This coverage stresses not only the importance of linguistic competency but also the need to understand folklore illnesses, herbal remedies, and spiritual practices that can delay the treatment of illness and either complement or compromise treatment. Of all the issues that face the contemporary Mexican American community, none is as important to its very survival as health and health care. This timely book gives readers a broad understanding of these complex issues and points the way toward a healthier future for all people of Mexican origin. Mexican Americans and Health and Chicano Popular Culture are the first volumes in the series The Mexican American Experience, a cluster of modular texts designed to provide greater flexibility in undergraduate education. Each book deals with a single topic concerning the Mexican American population. Instructors can create a semester-length course from any combination of volumes, or may choose to use one or two volumes to complement other texts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nCjABQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life and Times of Alfred the Great Pb (Kings & Queens S)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Handbook of the law of future interests, (Hornbook series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fb8-AAAAIAAJ&dq=Handbook+of+the+law+of+future+interests,+(Hornbook+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seven Men","description":"In Seven Men, New York Times bestselling author Eric Metaxas presents seven exquisitely crafted short portraits of widely known but not well understood Christian men, each of whom uniquely showcases a commitment to live by certain virtues in the truth of the gospel. Written in a beautiful and engaging style, Seven Men addresses what it means (or should mean) to be a man today, at a time when media and popular culture present images of masculinity that are not the picture presented in Scripture and historic civil life. This book answers questions like: What does it take to be a true exemplar as a father, brother, husband, leader, coach, counselor, change agent, and wise man? What does it mean to stand for honesty, courage, and charity? And how can you stand especially at times when the culture and the world run counter to those values? Each of the seven biographies represents the life of a man who experienced the struggles and challenges to be strong in the face of forces and circumstances that would have destroyed the resolve of lesser men. Each of the seven men profiled George Washington, William Wilberforce, Eric Liddell, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Jackie Robinson, John Paul II, and Charles Colson call the reader to a more elevated walk and lifestyle, one that embodies the gospel in the world around us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=deQ3CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chords & Scales for Guitar (Fast Track Music Instruction)","description":"Guitar Chords for Beginners contains 65 different chords arranged in easy fingerings.

According to Alfred E. Cave's The Pequot War and other accounts, the English and Mohegans supposedly marched \\"undetected\\" across multiple Indian territories, and at the Pequot village of Missituc on the Mystic River, trapped and killed between 300 and 700 men, women and children---thus launching the northern English colonies' first \\"total war\\" against Native Americans. What new understandings emerge when, for the first time, readers can examine these records and traditions against the actual landscape? What were the realities of New England tribal life, and of Native American war, in the 1600s? If the colonists of Massachusetts Bay and Hartford were in their own words \\"altogether ignorant\\" of how to locate, identify, fight, and control Native peoples, how did thoroughly-intermarried Pequots, Mohegans, Narragansetts and others exploit these crucial English blind-spots with astonishing, subtle and yet plainly visible counter-strategies? Why were guns, armor and European assault-tactics the wrong means of war in New England? What were the consequences near and far of the colonies' refusals to adjust? Tracking every step of The Pequot War from its origins to its aftermath and influences, Mystic Fiasco is its most comprehensive and detailed study. Its basis in the landscape exposes the fundamental but unexamined paradigms that hard-wired the American colonial psyche from those days to these. With user-friendly maps and illustrations by renowned historical artist David R. Wagner and the documentary expertise of historian Jack Dempsey, Mystic Fiasco is filled with resources that empower you to go and discover this \\"Mystic Massacre\\" and Pequot War for yourself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pHhx-fEQnmwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Force of Circumstance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t5wCvwEACAAJ&dq=Force+of+Circumstance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"As You Like It (The New Cambridge Shakespeare)","description":"Updated edition of the popular play As You Like It, containing material on criticism and performances.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pbwZcEr25HwC&dq=As+You+Like+It+(The+New+Cambridge+Shakespeare)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Downieville: Gold town on the Yuba (History of Sierra County)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Nanchang Diary: The Adoption of Victoria Santina Huang He Ping Tartivita","description":"Carmelo Tartivita recounts the journey he and his wife take in the adoption of their daughter, Victoria, from China, from the years of infertility, through the agonizing adoption process, their trip to China to collect Victoria, and finally to the joys of parenthood.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cJQKAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Nanchang+Diary:+The+Adoption+of+Victoria+Santina+Huang+He+Ping+Tartivita&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eat for Health: A Do-It-Yourself Nutrition Guide for Solving Common Medical Problems","description":"Outlines positive steps for improving health through changes in diet and pinpoints common medical problems caused by caffeine, salt, milk, processed foods, sugar, and fat","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XIRgAAAACAAJ&dq=Eat+for+Health:+A+Do-It-Yourself+Nutrition+Guide+for+Solving+Common+Medical+Problems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DK Handbooks: Shells","description":"A guide to seashells from around the world provides color photographs and concise descriptions of more than 500 species of seashells.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TikDAAAACAAJ&dq=DK+Handbooks:+Shells&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Measure For Measure (The Yale Shakespeare)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qIAEAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Social Construction of Sexual Harassment Law: The Role of the National, Organizational and Individual Context (Law, Justice and Power)","description":"Examines the contributions of national context and organizational context on understanding of sexual harassment laws within organizations, using a cross-national design based on the USA and Austria.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=htuPAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Social+Construction+of+Sexual+Harassment+Law:+The+Role+of+the+National,+Organizational+and+Individual+Context+(Law,+Justice+and+Power)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Handbook on Holy Spirit Baptism","description":"Don Basham provides helpful discussions on the subjects of receiving and ministering the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

Eventually destroying 775 buildings and causing millions of dollars in damage to the commercial section that we now know as Boston's business district, the Great Boston Fire of 1872 was a spectacular conflagration that destroyed \\"old Boston\\" and allowed a phoenix to arise from the ashes. This exciting new pictorial history brings to life the drama that began one Saturday evening in 1872 when a fire started in an empty hoop-skirt factory on the corner of Summer and Kingston Streets. At the time, Boston was in the throes of a epizootic disease that caused all horses in the area to be ill. This caused a virtual shutdown of transportation and city services and delayed the fire department's response to calls for help. By the time the breathless firemen arrived, the fire had already consumed the granite five-story factory and burst through the mansard roof, which acted as a flue and spread the fire. Within an hour, much of Summer Street was engulfed in flames and firemen from near and far were being summoned to combat the spread of the deadly blaze. By midnight, the fire had spread through Summer Street to Arch Street and was attacking Winthrop Square. Old Trinity Church, at the corner of Summer and Hawley Streets, had given itself up to the flames.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v3lzw5d2K8wC&dq=Kingston+(MA)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Storey's Guide to Raising Llamas: Care/Showing/Breeding/Packing/Profiting","description":"Topics include buying a llama, building a herd, breeding, feeding, health care, llama behavior, and using llamas as guardian and expedition animals","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LqyfAAAACAAJ&dq=Storey%27s+Guide+to+Raising+Llamas:+Care/Showing/Breeding/Packing/Profiting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women's Voices, Feminist Visions: Classic and Contemporary Readings","description":"As a leading introductory women s studies reader, Shaw and Lee s Women s Voices, Feminist Visions offers an excellent balance of classic, conceptual, and experiential selections including new contemporary readings.

In 1901, when Alma abruptly ended their passionate love affair in order to marry Gustav Mahler, the crisis served to transform Zemlinsky's talent into mastery. Only long after his death, however, did his music begin to receive its due. Zemlinsky was central to the musical life of Vienna and Central Europe, and this brilliant biography illuminates a social and cultural milieu that disappeared forever with the triumph of Hitler's Reich. Beaumont details the composer's early years as a prot g  of Brahms and Mahler, his complex friendship with his brother-in-law Arnold Schoenberg, the influence of his teaching on the boy-prodigy Erich Korngold, his kindly and helpful attitude toward the hypersensitive Anton Webern, and his heartfelt friendship with Alban Berg. Zemlinsky was one of the leading conductors of the interwar period, considered by both Schoenberg and Stravinsky the finest they had ever heard. Beaumont charts Zemlinsky's career from Vienna to Berlin, St. Petersburg, and Prague, providing insight into his Catholic-Sephardic background and investigating his keen interest in esoteric aspects of music, including color symbolism and numerology. The author's analyses of Zemlinsky's major scores are accessible and fully contextualized.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jmg9s141MekC&dq=Zemlinsky&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the first United States mint,: Its people and its operations,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Tc_t4yjbxf4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Ocean Apart: A Novel","description":"For six dreadful months, David Corstorphine has tried to come to terms with his young wife's death, while caring for his three motherless children.

Greg finds a strange pair of slippers under the bed and is too besotted to believe they might have been left by another man (which would also explain the bunches of flowers and boxes of sweets filling Ginny's apartment). Ginny goes off for a day in the country, supposedly to visit her parents but actually to break things off with her older married lover, Philip. Greg decides to follow her. The next scene is on the patio at the home of Philip and his befuddled wife Sheila, whose marriage is clearly under strain. Greg shows up unannounced before Ginny, and wrongly assumes that they are her parents. Greg asks for her hand from Philip, while Philip mistakenly believes that the strange young man is asking permission to marry Sheila. Once Ginny arrives, she convinces Philip to play the role of her father. Meanwhile, Greg still believes that Sheila is Ginny's mother.

Roosevelt. Affectionately referred to as  the little boss,  he would play an important part behind the scenes in shaping the destiny of the man who four times became President of the United States.  THIS BIOGRAPHY of Louis Howe is delightfully written and has the advantage of giving a number of stories which I am sure would never have been printed unless someone close to the work Louis did had undertaken to write it. The sidelights on the relationship between my husband and Louis and what this relationship meant to my husband s public life in the early days and in the struggles of his future life will, I think, be a valuable contribution to history. There has seldom been a story of greater devotion to another man s success but at the same time one realizes that this was not due to any lack of ambition on the part of Louis McHenry Howe. He loved power, but he also recognized realities and he decided that in the end he would exercise more power through someone else and he prided himself on the judgment he used in choosing the individual with whom and for whom he was going to work.  Lela Stiles shows discrimination and powers of observation which mark her as a real reporter. I found her book delightful reading.

Buoyant, confident, creative, the era seemed to be flowering into a true renaissance-until the disastrous fourteenth century rained catastrophe in the form of plagues, famine, and war. In Europe in the High Middle Ages, William Chester Jordan paints a vivid, teeming landscape that captures this lost age in all its glory and complexity. Here are the great popes who revived the power of the Church against the secular princes; the writers and thinkers who paved the way for the Renaissance; the warriors who stemmed the Islamic tide in Spain and surged into Palestine; and the humbler estates, those who found new hope and prosperity until the long night of the 1300s. From high to low, from dramatic events to social structures, Jordan's account brings to life this fascinating age.

Take thousands of hard-up writers and put them to work charting a country on the brink of social and economic collapse, with the aim of producing a series of guidebooks to the then forty-eight states along with hundreds of other publications dedicated to cities, regions, and towns while also gathering reams of folklore, narratives of formerly enslaved people, and even recipes, all of varying quality, each revealing distinct sensibilities. All this was the singular purview of the Federal Writers  Project, a division of the Works Progress Administration founded in 1935 to employ jobless writers, from once-bestselling novelists and acclaimed poets to the more dubiously qualified. The FWP took up the lofty goal of rediscovering America in words and soon found itself embroiled in the day s most heated arguments regarding radical politics, racial inclusion, and the purpose of writing forcing it to reckon with the promises and failures of both the New Deal and the American experiment itself. Scott Borchert s Republic of Detours tells the story of this raucous and remarkable undertaking by delving into the experiences of key figures and tracing the FWP from its optimistic early days to its dismemberment by the House Committee on Un-American Activities. We observe notable writers at their day jobs, including Nelson Algren, broke and smarting from the failure of his first novel; Zora Neale Hurston, the most widely published Black woman in the country; and Richard Wright, who arrived in the FWP s chaotic New York City office on an upward career trajectory courtesy of the WPA. Meanwhile, Ralph Ellison, Studs Terkel, John Cheever, and other future literary stars found encouragement and security on the FWP payroll. By way of these and other stories, Borchert illuminates an essentially noble enterprise that sought to create a broad and inclusive self-portrait of America at a time when the nation s very identity and future were thrown into question. As the United States enters a new era of economic distress, political strife, and culture-industry turmoil, this book s lessons are urgent and strong.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W1T2DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fenway: A Biography in Words and Pictures","description":"A richly illustrated study of America's oldest major league ballpark incorporates interviews with players, coaches, and fans as it chronicles a history of the park and the great teams and athletes who have played there, in an expanded and updated edition that includes more than thirty new photographs, an account of the 2004 World Series, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c3EWzsrzbDUC&dq=Fenway:+A+Biography+in+Words+and+Pictures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classifying the Universe: The Ancient Indian Varna System and the Origins of Caste","description":"This is a comprehensive examination of the 'varna' system - a classificatory scheme laid out in the classical Hindu Vedic literature and thought to underlie the concept of caste, which continues to exert a powerful and pervasive influence over Indian life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kF3DQgAACAAJ&dq=Classifying+the+Universe:+The+Ancient+Indian+Varna+System+and+the+Origins+of+Caste&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Magic Eye: The 3d Guide : A Training Manual","description":"Demonstrates various methods for experiencing the 3D pictures presented in the Magic eye books","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P4wVQEjTLoYC&dq=Magic+Eye:+The+3d+Guide+:+A+Training+Manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of Russia: Vol. II Since 1855","description":"Moss has significantly revised his text and bibliography in this second edition to reflect new research findings and controversies on numerous subjects.

Dervla Murphy never had any intention of spending three months in the vast territories of Siberia. Instead she had planned to go to Ussuriland, because it appealed to her as a place free from tourism. But by accident, or rather because she had an accident - a painful leg injury -, she found herself stymied in Eastern Siberia, a place she knew very little about. Although hardly able to walk, her subsequent experiences, in an unexpected place, and in an incapacitated state, provided many pleasant surprises. Above all she was struck by the extraordinary hospitality, generosity and helpfulness of the Siberians who made this strange phenomenon - a maimed Irish babushka - so welcome in their towns and homes. This book is an extraordinary story of fortitude and resourcefulness as Dervla Murphy finds friendship and culture in a seemingly monotonous, bleak and inhospitable place far from what we know as 'civilised'. Through Siberia by Accident is a voyage of Siberian self-discovery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sRrvGwAACAAJ&dq=The+Ukimwi+Road:+From+Kenya+to+Zimbabwe+(Transaction+Large+Print+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Video Discs: The Technology, the Applications, and the Future","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=apTbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Video+Discs:+The+Technology,+the+Applications,+and+the+Future&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Betty Butterfly and the Path of No Return","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JhslPQAACAAJ&dq=Betty+Butterfly+and+the+Path+of+No+Return&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yellow Brick Roads: Shared and Guided Paths to Independent Reading 4-12","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The English-Only Question: An Official Language for Americans?","description":"Explores the political, legal, educational, and sociological implications of declaring English the official language of the U.S., and traces the history of American attitudes toward English and minority languages","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7B50uY_bVKMC&dq=The+English-Only+Question:+An+Official+Language+for+Americans%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Story of a Clam: A Fable of Discovery & Enlightenment","description":"Story of a Clam is a special, magical tale of an egotistical clam who thinks he and his community are the center of the universe.

With little talent, they were usually out of it by Memorial Day. That all changed in the mid-sixties when the Cubs posted six straight winning seasons, reviving the franchise and generating almost unprecedented interest in the team. But they never won anything: not a World Series, not a pennant, not even a division title. This alone is not remarkable. What is remarkable, however, is that the Cubs fielded a veritable who's who of All-Stars and future Hall of Famers -- and yet never won. Managed by the Hall-of-Fame skipper Leo Durocher, the team included Ernie Banks, Billy Williams, Ferguson Jenkins, Ron Santo, Glenn Beckert, Don Kessinger, and Randy Hundley. To have such a collection of diamond luminaries and still not win is nearly unprecedented. Based on dozens of interviews with key participants and painstaking research, Durocher's Cubs recreates the magic of those years and explores what really happened on the field, in the clubhouse, and in the gilded offices of William Wrigley, the team's owner. It explains why this team is so fondly remembered. Finally, and most importantly, it answers the question that has left many Cub fans and baseball historians scratching their heads: why did this team, so laden with talent, never win?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9ZUAAAAACAAJ&dq=Durocher%27s+Cubs:+The+Greatest+Team+That+Didn%27t+Win&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dreamers & Schemers: Profiles from Carbon County, Wyoming's Past (Dreamers and Schemers Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fast & Loose the Buccaneers","description":"Easy-to-prepare, healthful, and delicious recipes for the Whole30 and beyond","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ALY-DwAAQBAJ&dq=Fast&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bad Choices: A Look Inside Planned Parenthood","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K5PCAAAACAAJ&dq=Bad+Choices:+A+Look+Inside+Planned+Parenthood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bullying (Talking About...(Raintree))","description":"Explains how, why, when, and where people get bullied as well as who does the bullying and what can be done about it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6wAJAAAACAAJ&dq=Bullying+(Talking+About...(Raintree))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Private Entrance","description":"BOOK THREE OF THE BUTTERFLY TRILOGY New York Times bestselling author Kathryn Harvey captivates again in this sensual tale of murder, corruption, and passion.

Northwest Africa abounds in such lessons, for it covers the first massive commitments of American forces in World War II. The continent of Africa became a gigantic testing ground of tactics, weapons, and training evolved through years of peace. The invasion stretched American resources to the limit. Simultaneously the country was trying to maintain a line of communications to Australia, to conduct a campaign at Guadalcanal, to support China in the war against Japan, to arm and supply Russia's hard-pressed armies on the Eastern Front, to overcome the U-boat menace in the Atlantic, to fulfill lend-lease commitments, and to accumulate the means to penetrate the heart of the German and Japanese homelands. The Anglo-American allies could carry out the occupation of Northwest Africa only by making sacrifices all along the line. Two campaigns occurred there: Operation TORCH which swiftly liberated French North Africa from Vichy French control, followed by a longer Allied effort to destroy all the military forces of the Axis powers in Africa. The latter concentrated in Tunisia, where the front at one time extended more than 375 miles, and fighting progressed from scattered meeting engagements to the final concentric thrust of American, British, and French ground and air forces against two German and Italian armies massed in the vicinity of Bizerte and Tunis. The planning, preparation, and conduct of the Allied operations in Northwest Africa tested and strengthened the Anglo-American alliance. Under General Dwight D. Eisenhower a novel form of command evolved which proved superior to adversities and capable of overwhelming the enemy. Richard W. Stephens Maj. Gen., U.S.A.

Ayling, 29th Massachusetts Volunteers (Voices of the Civil War Series)","description":"When New Englander Augustus Ayling responded to President Lincoln's first call for volunteers at the outbreak of the Civil War, he began a diary that he would keep until the end of the conflict. That recently discovered manuscript now provides us with an unusual panorama of the Civil War as seen by one man who fought in three different theaters. A company-grade officer in the Union Army for most of the war, Ayling was a highly literate, keen-eyed observer who described major events of the war in elaborate detail. Early in his service, he witnessed firsthand the battle of the Monitor and the Merrimack, the peninsular campaign of McClellan, the battle of Fredericksburg, and the retreat of Burnside. When his regiment was sent to Kentucky, he fell in love with a girl there, but they were parted by his unit's transfer to Mississippi in support of Grant's Vicksburg campaign. He was present at the fall of Vicksburg, one of the Union's most important victories. His brief wartime romance ended when he went back to Kentucky, suffering from malaria. After his return home on sick leave, he eventually rejoined his regiment outside of Knoxville, where it helped to repel Longstreet's troops. Following the war, Ayling was recalled to a regiment occupying Richmond and was made a judge advocate. From this vantage point he witnessed the beginnings of Reconstruction and of reconciliation between members of Northern and Southern white elites. And, as Charles Herberger notes in an epilogue, Ayling's military career did not end there: he remained in the army and was, for twenty-seven years, adjutant general in charge of the National Guard for the state of New Hampshire. Throughout his diary, Aylingeloquently described the difficult conditions under which soldiers served, revealing both the pleasures and problems of an officer's life.

Chapters illustrate the interaction of gender and ethnicity in mental health theory and practice, and discuss how cultural relevance and gender sensitivity can and must be incorporated into clinical work. The contributors are experts with extensive clinical experience with the specific groups of women they discuss, and many are themselves members of these groups, adding a unique and valuable dimension to their work. Inclusive in its approach and rich with illustrative case examples, WOMEN OF COLOR covers issues that affect both familiar and frequently overlooked groups of women. Emphasizing the heterogeneity of women of color, the book begins with in-depth discussions of cultural imperatives relevant to the mental health treatment of African American, American Indian, Asian American, Latina/Hispanic, and East and West Indian women. The second section provides a thorough review of the major theoretical orientations to psychotherapy and their applicability to women of color. The contributors critically assess the utilization of psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, family systems, feminist, and integrative approaches, and provide clinical guidelines for the application of each. Focusing on clinical management that incorporates a sensitivity to ethnicity, culture and gender, chapters also discuss the psychopharmacologic treatment of women of color. The diversity that exists among women of color is reflected in the final section's thoughtful examination of the mental health needs of such special populations as professional women, lesbians, mixed-race women, battered women, and refugee women. The stressors endured by women who are culturally stigmatized and/or institutionally disadvantaged are explored, and clear guidelines for working with these women are presented. Filling a significant gap in the literature, WOMEN OF COLOR is a major new resource for all mental health professionals, from students to seasoned practitioners. Accessibly written, it also serves as an excellent classroom text for courses in the psychology of women, women's studies, and gender studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uPPnwAEACAAJ&dq=Women+of+Color:+Integrating+Ethnic+and+Gender+Identities+in+Psychotherapy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Senseless Secrets: The Failures of U.S. Military Intelligence from George Washington to the Present","description":"In war, the difference between life and death often hinges on the accuracy of gathered information.

It addresses numerous social issues and how they are presented to the viewer by means of style, rhetoric, and narrative technique. The volume poses questions about the relationship of the documentary tradition to power, the body, authority, knowledge, and our experience of history. This study advances the pioneering work of Nichols's earlier book, Ideology and the Image. The rigorous discussion of modes of documentary representation, the relationship between narrative and nonfiction, and the representation of the body (including a chapter on pornography, ethnography, and power), give this book enormous value for the study of visual anthropology and ethnographic film. The often neglected relationship between signifier and referent is the special focus of this intensive study of documentary film. The concluding discussion of the representation of the body will also be of special interest to semioticians.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jq2cS7qARd8C&dq=REPRESENTING+REALITY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reflections: Twenty-One Cinematographers At Work","description":"This book includes: case studies of film lighting by some of the world's leading cinematographers ; every chapter is illustrated with reproductions of 35mm film frames ; lighting diagrams accompany 35mm workprints from workshops ; chapters about 'Breathless', 'Fearless', 'Seven' and 'The last Emperor' are presented with frames from selected sequences ; seven sections are cinematography basics, the key light, portraits, day interiors, night interiors, lab techniques and the design of sequences ; technical and aesthetic aspects of cinematography.

These materials gently develop concepts, and the practice of those concepts is extended over a considerable period of time. This is called \\"incremental development and continual review.\\" Material is introduced in easily understandable pieces (increments), allowing students to grasp one facet of a concept before the next one is introduced. Both facets are then practiced together until another one is introduced. This feature is combined with continual review in every lesson throughout the year. Topics are never dropped but are increased in complexity and practiced every day, providing the time required for concepts to become totally familiar. Algebra 1, third edition is made up of five instructional components: Introduction of the New Increment, Examples with Complete Solutions, Practice of the Increment, Daily Problem Set, and Cumulative Tests. Algebra 1 covers topics typically treated in a first-year algebra course. This set contains a student text, answer key, and test forms. A solutions manual is available separately.

First, the involuntary colonists of New Kashubia rescued their planet from crushing debt by becoming virtual-reality mercenaries, then they successfully revolted against the oppressive government of Earth, but now they are menaced by the Mitchegai, a species whose biology has made them inherently evil. The carnivorous adults lay and abandon vast numbers of eggs, some of which grow into vegetarian juveniles, which are the adults' only food supply. Their culture has no family life, they eat only meat, have nothing like sex., and their main pleasures are gambling, art, and killing each other. They are an ancient civilization, millions of years old, with thousands of densely populated star systems in their realm. Lacking an immune system, they must completely sterilize any planet before they colonize it. The region of the galaxy they occupy is rapidly expanding . . . and Human Space is their next frontier!

The Tories were the bosses party, while Labour represented the working class. Not any more. In a few short years, Tony Blair has transformed the relationship between Labour and the private sector to the point where Labour now claims to be the natural party of business. This new friendship has been cemented through a series of hue donations to Labour, often running to millions of pounds, from top business people and leading companies. Such generosity has been reciprocated with a string of peerages for prominent benefactors. Corporate supporters - including multinationals with questionable track records on union recognition, human rights and the environment - have reaped the rewards of lucrative privatisation contracts. Labour's natural supporters are increasingly disaffected. Membership is in decline as lifelong members rip up their party cards. Trade Unionists are opening asking whether the party deserves their continued support, while younger activists are giving it a wide berth in favour of the anti-globalisation movements. Meanwhile, a huge swathe of the electorate can't see any real difference between the major parties and simply don't bother to vote.

Although some of the techniques have been replaced by more modern methods, this classic book is still a valuable source of practical assistance as well as being a pleasure to read. About the Author Frank Twyman was a skilled craftsman in all aspects of optics. He joined Otto Hilger in 1898 to work on the production of simple spectroscopes costing less than  10 each. After the death of Otto Hilger, Twyman became Managing Director of Adam Hilger Ltd., a company known for the finest quality optical and mechanical work. He worked here from 1902 to 1946 and was very concerned with the practical aspects of instrument making; he designed many of the instruments himself and constantly strove to improve the techniques of optical grinding and polishing. In 1916 Twyman and Alfred Green, the foreman of the Hilger optical shops, patented the now-famous prism and lens testing interferometer that bears their names. Twyman also undertook fundamental studies in the annealing process for glass and invented new spectrophotometers and spectrographs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TQG8K7vjwNkC&dq=Prism+and+lens+making%3B:+A+textbook+for+optical+glassworkers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baseball's Most Wanted II: The Top 10 Book of More Bad Hops, Screwball Players, and Other Oddities","description":"Baseball has so many stars and scrubs, quotables and notables - so many that one book just isn t enough to cover them all.

And what political situations, what religious and cultural prejudices in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries gave rise to this confusion? Taking up these questions, John O'Malley works out a remarkable guide to the intellectual and historical developments behind the concepts of Catholic reform, the Counter Reformation, and, in his felicitous term, Early Modern Catholicism. The result is the single best overview of scholarship on Catholicism in early modern Europe, delivered in a pithy, lucid, and entertaining style. Although its subject is fundamental to virtually all other issues relating to sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe, there is no other book like this in any language. More than a historiographical review, Trent and All That makes a compelling case for subsuming the present confusion of terminology under the concept of Early Modern Catholicism. The term indicates clearly what this book so eloquently demonstrates: that Early Modern Catholicism was an aspect of early modern history, which it strongly influenced and by which it was itself in large measure determined. As a reviewer commented, O'Malley's discussion of terminology opens up a different way of conceiving of the whole history of Catholicism between the Reformation and the French Revolution.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=R859S0hvBKkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zips, Pipes, And Pens: Arsenal Of Improvised Weapons","description":"In this book, J.

In the prologue, the author tackles Americas current ambivalence about the churchs role in society. This section contains provocative statements and stories that take aim at the current trend toward political correctness, with its strict separation of God from government. In his points to ponder, Bayuk notes meaningfully that a statue of Moses holding the Ten Commandments stares down from the top of the Supreme Court building. On the whole, however, the author focuses on his vacillating relationship with God. Bayuk, who has written two books about coping with his multiple sclerosis, turns his struggles into warmhearted stories. He recalls in detail his long and happy relationship with his wife, his glory days of welling commercial real state, the ups and downs of owning a deli and a diner and of having learned to live with his disease. Throughout, the author recounts being torn between following his free will and following what he perceived as Gods instructions. However, his major defiance of Gods will seems to have been his reluctance to attend church. Bayuk recalls that he refused to go to mass for years, feeling frustrated when he spent hours at Pentecostal services and guilty when he did not. Readers may not view these moments as the powerful conflicts of God that Bayuk presents them as. The author later describes miracles that have occurred since he has become more spiritually involved. Here again, the reader may see his helpful daughter, a reconciliation between parents and children and the brother who raises some cash in a time of need, not as miracles but simply as blessings. Also, while the author is an engaging storyteller, hes also a bit repetitious. Nevertheless, Bayuk writes convincingly about the satisfactions of a faith-based life. A handy night stand book for those seeking spiritual affirmation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tCnM4kwH8LIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women's Lives: Multicultural Perspectives","description":"This interdisciplinary, multicultural text-reader provides an introduction to women's studies by examining U.S. women's lives in a global context and across categories of race-ethnicity, class, sexuality, disability, and age.

Beginning with the start of time itself, Knickerbocker reveals historical anecdotes, both real and imagined featuring social commentary, fresh perspectives on the past, and conversations with powerful historical figures. With humor and intrigue, A Knickerbocker s History of New York tells the tale of the discovery of New York, and explores the first Dutch settlements. While examining those origins, Knickerbocker muses about the ethics of colonization and the immoral treatment of Native Americans, with biting and brutal honesty. Still under the Dutch  rule , 1600 New York acted as one of the breeding grounds for many American Christmas traditions, some of which are still alive today. Under a comical microscope, A Knickerbocker s History of New York explores the effect the early Dutch settlements have on American culture, particularly in New York. Originally published in 1809, Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York earned acclaim for its innovative genre as one of the first American comedic works. With the mix of specific, inside jokes and universal humor, Irving s satire invites laughter from both his original audience and contemporary readers. With prose and wit that has remained fresh and hilarious even two-hundred and eleven years later, Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York contains a narrative that has earned centuries of influence. While playfully mocking both classic literature and historians, Irving was bold enough to even include a list of people, professions and properties that he intended to make fun of. Though Irving mixes fact with fiction, A Knickerbocker s History of New York provides useful insight on the history of Dutch Americans, as well as contributing thoughtful social commentary that finds itself still applicable to modern society. Now featuring a stunning new cover design and a modern font, this edition of Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York is both accessible and entertaining.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7ZosEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Answering Mormons questions","description":"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints currently boasts millions of members, thousands of missionaries, and congregations on every continent as well as in the vast majority of the world s countries. It s clear that their influence is still growing in our communities, places of business, and in the political arena. It s also clear that Christians need to be prepared to answer questions from Mormon friends, neighbors, co-workers, and from fellow believers as well. In this updated and expanded edition of McKeever s popular and practical book, authors Bill McKeever and Eric Johnson provide ready responses to the common questions Mormons ask. With more than six decades of combined experience, the authors tackle such tough questions as: Why don t you accept Mormons as Christians? Do you believe Mormonism is a cult? If the LDS church is not true, which church is? How can you explain the many contradictions found throughout the Bible? After offering analysis and responses to these and other questions, McKeever and Johnson provide helpful appendices that summarize Mormon beliefs, provide 101 Bible references to use in conversation, and expose common logical fallacies. Originally published in the 1980s, this volume has been--and will continue to be--a classic resource to help Christians become more successful in sharing their faith with Mormons.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CjlTjgEACAAJ&dq=Answering+Mormons+questions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Senator's Agenda (Dead Air Series, Book 3)","description":"Produced in association with the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago, the Encyclopedia of Radio includes more than 600 entries covering major countries and regions of the world as well as specific programs and people, networks and organizations, regulation and policies, audience research, and radio's technology.

To what do words having referential significance refer? What is the meaning of the words that do not have referential significance?

Dr. Adler maintains that these fundamental questions are not satisfactorily treated in the two main philosophies of language that have dominated twentieth-century thinking on the subject - the syntactical and 'ordinary language' approaches. Drawing upon the tradition of Aristotle, Aquinas, Poinsot, and Husserl, Dr. Adler's own discussion exemplifies the third approach, which he describes as \\"semantic and lexical.\\" In this now -classic work, the fruit of more than 50 years' concern with the philosophy of language, Dr. Adler advances a powerful theory of meaning and applies it to some outstanding philosophical problems.

Anthony Boucher was a literary renaissance man: an Edgar Awardwinning mystery reviewer, an esteemed editor of the Hugo Awardwinning Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, a prolific scriptwriter of radio mystery programs, and an accomplished writer of mystery, science fiction, fantasy, and horror. With a particular fondness for the locked room mystery, Boucher created such iconic sleuths as Los Angeles PI Fergus O Breen, amateur sleuth Sister Ursula, and alcoholic ex-cop Nick Noble. When Metropolis Pictures announces plans to make a movie out of an Arthur Conan Doyle classic, it triggers outrage from a group of Sherlock Holmes fans called the Baker Street Irregulars. In hopes of calming their protest, the studio invites the five members to advise on the film, and even throws them a celebration in a house numbered 221B. Also on the guest list is Los Angeles police detective A. Jackson. He was hoping to spend his night off hanging out at a Hollywood party with his brother, Paul, the famous actor. Instead he finds himself in one of the most bizarre murder cases he s ever encountered, complete with cryptograms and a disappearing corpse, all of which results in a  delightfully farcical narrative, which offers a surprise on nearly every page  (The New York Times Book Review).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hw2EDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alistair MacLean's \\"Death Train\\"","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Squeaky Clean Comedy: 1,512 Dirt-Free Jokes from the Best Comedians","description":"Squeaky Clean Comedy is a wide-ranging rundown of sidesplitting observations from the comedians we've loved throughout the television age.

Based on research in Italian and other European archives, the book concentrates on the factions at the Roman court and in the college of cardinals. The sacred college came under great international pressure during the election of a new pope, and consequently such figures as foreign ambassadors and foreign cardinals are examined, as well as political liaisons and social contacts at court.

Deal, coauthor of Leading with Soul Business, nonprofit, and public sector leaders are facing new and daunting challenges--rapid-paced developments in technology, sudden shifts in the marketplace, and crisis and contention in the public arena. If they are to survive in this chaotic environment, leaders must develop the skills they need to lead effectively no matter how fast the world around them is changing. Leading in a Culture of Change offers new and seasoned leaders' insights into the dynamics of change and presents a unique and imaginative approach for navigating the intricacies of the change process. Michael Fullan--an internationally acclaimed expert in organizational change--shows how leaders in all types of organizations can accomplish their goals and become exceptional leaders. He draws on the most current ideas and theories on the topic of effective leadership, incorporates case examples of large scale transformation, and reveals a remarkable convergence of powerful themes or, as he calls them, the five core competencies. By integrating the five core competencies--attending to a broader moral purpose, keeping on top of the change process, cultivating relationships, sharing knowledge, and setting a vision and context for creating coherence in organizations--leaders will be empowered to deal with complex change. They will be transformed into exceptional leaders who consistently mobilize their compatriots to do important and difficult work under conditions of constant change.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Cy7qAgAAQBAJ&dq=Leading+in+a+Culture+of+Change&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Dimensional Spline Interpolation Algorithms","description":"These volumes present a practical introduction to computing spline functions, the fundamental tools for fitting curves and surfaces in computer-aided deisgn (CAD) and computer graphics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DWG1DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Camel Crochet","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A stillness at Appomattox","description":"Recounting the final year of the Civil War, this classic volume by Bruce Catton won both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for excellence in non-fiction.

In I of the Vortex, Rodolfo Llinas, a founding father of modern brain science, presents an original view of the evolution and nature of mind. According to Llinas, the \\"mindness state\\" evolved to allow predictive interactions between mobile creatures and their environment. He illustrates the early evolution of mind through a primitive animal called the \\"sea squirt.\\" The mobile larval form has a brainlike ganglion that receives sensory information about the surrounding environment. As an adult, the sea squirt attaches itself to a stationary object and then digests most of its own brain. This suggests that the nervous system evolved to allow active movement in animals. To move through the environment safely, a creature must anticipate the outcome of each movement on the basis of incoming sensory data. Thus the capacity to predict is most likely the ultimate brain function. One could even say that Self is the centralization of prediction. At the heart of Llinas's theory is the concept of oscillation. Many neurons possess electrical activity, manifested as oscillating variations in the minute voltages across the cell membrane. On the crests of these oscillations occur larger electrical events that are the basis for neuron-to-neuron communication. Like cicadas chirping in unison, a group of neurons oscillating in phase can resonate with a distant group of neurons. This simultaneity of neuronal activity is the neurobiological root of cognition. Although the internal state that we call the mind is guided by the senses, it is also generated by the oscillations within the brain. Thus, in a certain sense, one could say that reality is not all \\"out there,\\" but is a kind of virtual reality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vqnuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood brother","description":"The Apache chief, Cochise, and Tom Jeffords, government scout, succeed in achieving peace after the army fails","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HZwBDetIsrIC&dq=Blood+brother&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Irish faction fighters of the 19th century (Anvil books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Frommer's Athens Past & Present (Frommer's Athens Past & Present)","description":"An ingenious book that brings ancient Athens to life-perfect for anyone traveling to Greece The 2004 Olympic Games are expected to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors to Athens between August 13th and 29th-and most of these visitors will take a break from the games to visit Athens' most famous tourist attraction, the Acropolis.

Backed by more than 1,200 trusted sources, this breakthrough guide reveals the many little-known advantages that only a responsive, nurturing parenting style can provide: Surprising evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding How attentiveness and touch impacts permanent brain development in infants Under-reported facts about how to reduce colic, food allergies, and illness Why sharing sleep is both safe and natural How to reduce future teen-year stress by bonding with your young child early At the forefront of a passionate, growing movement called \\"attachment parenting,\\" this warmly presented guide is a rare overview of information too often missing from parenting circles, pediatric offices, and financially motivated product promotions. Why Attachment Parenting? Cultures around the world that practice more natural forms of parenting have healthier infants who cry much less, toddlers who do not exhibit \\"terrible twos,\\" generally respectful teenagers, and independent adults who participate in family matters. A well-controlled study found sleeping outside of the parents' room brought 10.5 times the risk of SIDS as sleeping in the parents' room. Studies have shown that infants who receive frequent physical affection have lower overall levels of stress. In the United States and other industrialized countries, the infant death rate for formula-fed infants is twice that of exclusively breastfed babies.   Excerpt from The Baby Bond   Most would agree that children probably do not consciously remember the way they were treated during early infancy. Many recount this observation as support or comfort for their ideas about ignoring babies' cries for attention and providing minimal stimulation. Yet, it can be shown that while the specifics may be lost, unconscious memories are developed on the neurological and biochemical level from birth a baby's brain develops from day one according to its environment. Childhood, adolescence, and adulthood are all affected by this early programming. And, as far as the coveted independence goes, it has been shown that those who receive the most affection early on display the highest levels of independence as adults.

The Junction Boys tells the story of Coach Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant's legendary training camp in the small town of Junction, Texas. In a move that many consider the salvation of the Texas A&M football program, Coach Bryant put 115 players through the most grueling practices ever imagined.

Nathanson (author of THE DIRTY DOZEN and numerous other works and fellow alumnus of the HNOH) who wrote the FOREWORD to the book: The title of the book - DEJA VIEWS... - is itself a meaningful play on the French phrase deja vu - meaning, roughly, the startling feeling that strikes you that what you have just experienced you have experienced before. To anyone who shared those times, DEJA VIEWS OF AN AGING ORPHAN will be an exciting time travel adventure, comprehensive, varied, textured and evocative. To those who lived in those times but had no knowledge then of the milieu of the books real life characters and stories - and to those in the generations that followed, such as the children and grandchildren of the Home boys - the book will be a voyage of discovery. Many of the anecdotes and people profiles in the book, though not all of them, were written as columns that appeared over the years in THE ALUMNUS, the monthly publication of the Alumni Association of the Hebrew National Orphan Home and its successor institutions, Homecrest and Hartman-Homecrest. They are word pictures that have ripened and matured and been revised over the years by more acute memory and input from others. Some of these stories and brief biographies have even achieved the status of myths and legends. In addition, sowed amidst these pages of real persons and event, as a sort of literary seasoning and entertainment, are some short stories, identified as fiction, but which illuminate with their own truths. The index alone is a cornucopia of memories. The variety of people and themes that are remembered and summoned into the book is impressive. Some evoke nostalgia for a time that we didnt know was that good when we were living it; some bring a laugh - or a tear. And the focus is always on the boys - and the adults they became. In addition to the foregoing, I believe the best description of my book is contained in my INTRODUCTION, which is therefore reproduced here in its entirety. My older brother Al, myself and my younger sister Henny all became half-orphans upon the death of our mother in February 1929. Our father had to place us in orphanages when he found himself unable to provide the care required by a 9 year old boy, his 7year old brother and 2 year old sister. A1 and I were placed in the Hebrew National Orphan Home on Tuckahoe Road in the outskirts of Yonkers, NY while Henrietta was put into the Israel Orphan Asylum on East Second Street NYC. This separation was necessary because the HNOH accepted only boys, ages 6 to 16 (later HS graduation) whereas the IOA accepted boys and girls, ages 2 to 5. It was while I was in the HNOH that I became a \\"full-fledged\\" orphan, when my father died in 1938. And Ive been a \\"full-fledged orphan\\" ever since--although I didnt start \\"aging\\" until just a few months ago when I turned 78. But some years before that, my then new daughter-in-law, Susan was describing my wife and myself to her mother, including the fact that we were orphans (my wife having been raised in the Pride of Judea Childrens Home on Dumont Ave in Brooklyn where I worked after I had left the HNOH). To which Susans mother replied, matter-of-factly: \\"Well, so am I. And so is your father!\\" Momentarily surprised, Susan then elaborated: \\"No mom. I mean they were orphaned as children and raised in orphanages.\\" Her mother hesitated and then said: \\"Oh\\". This anecdote illustrates the fact that ultimately we all become \\"orphans\\". But that is not the focus of this work. Its focus is the child who lost one or both parents at a young, tender age and subsequently was placed in an institution--the orphanage. So when I titled this work \\"...OF AN AGING ORPHAN. I wasnt focusing on an older person who had been orphaned as an adult, but on an orphaned child who, fortunately, has been aging nicely.

Originating in the South in the early 1700s, they have today spread out across nearly all fifty states, playing a vital role in the settling of America, from Appalachia to the Pacific Ocean. A Caudill descendant himself, award-winning American historian Lochlainn Seabrook has penned a thoroughly captivating work entitled \\"The Caudills,\\" which focuses on the etymology of the family Caudill surname, the ethnology of the Caudills, and the genealogy of their ancestral line, dating back to 16th-Century Europe. Throughout its well researched 300-pages, one will find a treasure-trove of new, unique, and vital information, including a detailed discussion of the origins of the name and family, an extensive Caudill family tree, the Caudill family Coat of Arms, useful resources, and maps to Cawdor Castle in Scotland, with extra material on surname spelling variations and Caudill place-names. The Foreword is by Delmerene Caudill of Letcher County, Kentucky. With its wealth of helpful research material not only on this intriguing European-American family, but on allied families as well, \\"The Caudills\\" is a must-have for all Caudills, Caudill relations, and Caudill researchers. Unreconstructed Southern scholar Lochlainn Seabrook, the sixth great-grandson of Henrietta \\"Henny\\" Caudill (1753-1836) and a descendant of the families of Alexander H. Stephens and John S. Mosby, is the most prolific and popular pro-South writer in the world today. Known as the \\"new Shelby Foote,\\" he is a recipient of the prestigious Jefferson Davis Historical Gold Medal and the author of over 45 books. A seventh-generation Kentuckian of Appalachian heritage, Mr. Seabrook has a forty-year background in American and Southern history, and is the author of the runaway bestseller \\"Everything You Were Taught About the Civil War is Wrong, Ask a Southerner!\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=frp8jwEACAAJ&dq=The+Caudills:+An+Etymological&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Man the tool-maker","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TA9aAAAAYAAJ&dq=Man+the+tool-maker&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Country Affair","description":"Down-home charm and romance on the ranch.

My name is Rowan Gant, and I'm a consultant for the Greater Saint Louis Major Case Squad. It's a sometimes rocky partnership, but in general the cops find me useful to have around since I can hear the voices of the dead.

Mind you, I'm not at all happy about this curse of mine, but it's not like I have any say in the matter. I didn't choose it... It chose me. The worst part, though, is that every single time I help the police with a case, the psychic garbage that comes along with it follows me home. And, that brings me back around to the homicidal sociopath in high heels. There is more going on with her than just your average crazy, but I can't quite put my finger on what it is. Not yet, anyway... I'm pretty sure that's why I've got an extra bad feeling about this one-a very extra bad feeling. In fact, I think this mess is going to do more than simply follow me home.

The New York Times Book Review In the 1950s Elizabeth Marshall Thomas became one of the first Westerners to live with the Bushmen of the Kalahari desert in Botswana and South-West Africa. Her account of these nomadic hunter-gatherers, whose way of life had remained unchanged for thousands of years, is a ground-breaking work of anthropology, remarkable not only for its scholarship but for its novelistic grasp of character. On the basis of field trips in the 1980s, Thomas has now updated her book to show what happened to the Bushmen as the tide of industrial civilization with its flotsam of property rights, wage labor, and alcohol swept over them. The result is a powerful, elegiac look at an endangered culture as well as a provocative critique of our own. \\"The charm of this book is that the author can so truly convey the strangeness of the desert life in which we perceive human traits as familiar as our own. . . .

Covering the whole development of the Christian Church from St. Paul to the present century, the author illustrates the differing backgrounds and approach of many of the great mystics such as St. Augustine of Hippo, whose writings helped to create the Church's understanding of its mystical character; and St. Francis of Assisi, whose example proved an inspiration to many. The book gives much more than an opportunity to meet the great mystics: it also provides a framework for the analysis of true mysticism and false, contrasting Catherine of Sienna, a girl of the people whose transcendental mysticism benefited many in an age of ecclesiastical degradation, with the well-born and beautiful Madame Guyon, whose excesses brought mysticism into disrepute. Evelyn Underhill illuminates the whole of her subject by drawing attention to the differences of approach that can bring mortals along the road to the divine, from the zealous militancy of a Loyola to the passivity of the Quietists. This absorbing study by one of the great writers on mysticism covers every aspect of the subject and gives a clear understanding of the mystics' world in writing that is both informative and stimulating.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QoJKAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forty years a gambler on the Mississippi,","description":"Reproduction of the original: Forty Years A Gambler On the Mississippi by George H.

Minette captured Julia's heart, igniting a lifelong passion for cats equaled only by her love of food and her husband, Paul.

It reveals the intricate tapestry of a loving universe which orchestrates the delicate dance of oneness with All That Is, offering hope for a brighter future and the realization that we are not alone in the universe. The setting for the Ships of Song is deep within the North Carolina mountains at a date in the not too distant future. The earth has been experiencing violent environmental changes creating a fragile ecosystem and the collapse of the country's infrastructure. Elizabeth, the main character, is overwhelmed by their lack of food and the pending winter. She struggles between hope and despair wondering what will become of herself, her husband, John, and the hundred-fifty refugees who have gathered in their once tranquil valley. The story occurs in a single day with Elizabeth feeling she is called to \\"witness\\" the rising sun from the pinnacle high above the community. During her vigil she is unaware that she is whisked away between heartbeats to a place beyond time and space. She thought-walks and \\"witnesses\\" the moment of creation, the exploration of the universe, the inhabitation of Earth, their entrapment in consciousness and the long evolutionary process back to humanity's origins which culminate that night in the evening sky. Her day, which began in the fitful sleep of one unable to resolve their life, emerges into a day interspersed with a sense of mystery, magic and hope. Review In this visionary novel, the human mind has embedded memories of its evolution from a hybrid race of earth-dwellers and extraterrestrials. Tracing the lives of John and Elizabeth, a couple who feel compelled to leave the city to live in the hills, the authors introduce the reader to the possibility that we do have celestial guardians guiding us through our lives. Through ten thousand years of humanity's growth and achievements, Michael, Miriam, and many others hover silently and invisibly above our planet in great ships, observing the ebb and flow of our spiritual unfolding. Once in a while a human remembers, vaguely, the sentinels above, perhaps in a dream or while staring into a fire. And to help people remember, the Ships of Song emanate the great Om into the atmosphere. Occasionally Ship-dwellers are sent into the world of humans, as humans themselves. One comes to John and Elizabeth for a single hour, as their child Rebecca, who has drawn them together in the first place as a part of a grand pattern. As the novel reaches its crescendo and then gently draws to a bittersweet close, the reader is left wanting a sequel. Nicely done.

In the intervening years, the CIA launched a massive covert research program in the hope that LSD would serve as an espionage weapon; psychiatric pioneers came to believe that acid would shed light on the perplexing problems of mental illness; and a new generation of writers and artists in countercultural transition sought to break the  mind-forged manacles  of a new generation in rebellion among them, Timothy Leary, Ken Kesey, the Beatles, Allen Ginsberg, William Mellon Hitchcock, and Abbie Hoffman. Painting an indelible portrait of an unforgettable era and using startling information obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, Acid Dreams also exposes one of the most bizarre, shocking, and often tragic episodes in American history.

He is scrupulously at home in the intricate, dramatic background of Swiss socialist politics ...The result is a masterly study, often as compelling as its theme.' George Steiner, Times Literary Supplement \`This meticulous and definitive study ... supersedes most previous interpretations.' Colin Gunton, Theological Book Review \`it should quickly attain classic status. It is an exceptionally fine and erudite piece of work....The results of this painstaking attention to detail are truly ground-breaking. This is a major intellectual achievement, an interpretative act of great courage, and Barth studies will never look the same.' Graham Ward, Expository Times This book is a new, major intellectual biography of perhaps the most influential theologian of the twentieth century, Karl Barth. It offers the first full-scale revision of the well-known theologian Hans Urs Balthasar's seminal interpretation of Barth, which was first published in 1951. Drawing on a wealth of material, much of it unpublished during Barth's lifetime, as well as a thorough acquaintance with the best of recent German scholarship, Professor McCormack demonstrates that the fundamental decision which would control the whole of Barth's development - the turn to a new, critically realistic form of theological objectivism - was already made during the years in which Barth was at work on his first commentary on Romans. Professor McCormack further argues that the most significant subsequent decisions - both material and methodological - were made in Barth's Gottingen Dogmatics of 1924/5, and not later in the 1931 book on Anselm, as has often been alleged. Finally, he seeks to show that von Balthasar's description of a turn from dialectic to analogy, which provided the foundation for the neo-orthodox reading of Barth in the English-speaking world, fails to take seriously enough the extent to which dialectic remained a constitutive feature of Barth's outlook in the Church Dogmatics. This unique and important work provides not simply a fresh interpretation of Barth's development, but also a new paradigm for understanding the whole of Barth's theology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WnbnCwAAQBAJ&dq=Karl+Barth%27s+Critically+Realistic+Dialectical+Theology:+Its+Genesis+and+Development+1909-1936&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cunning Of The Mountain Man (The Last Mountain Man)","description":"Smoke Jensen is determined to find a way out of a New Mexico jail cell--as well as to escape the hide-hungry lynch mob who's after him for a murder he didn't commit.

Mr. Barton, a curate, with an income of eighty pounds a-year, with an angelic but sickly wife and a host of hungry little children, allows himself to be duped by the title of a 'Countess Czerlaski,' the handsome English widow of a Polish dancing-master. The countess quarrels with her brother, Mr. Bridmain, and throws herself on the hospitality of the Bartons. Her visit lasts beyond all reasonable time, the unfortunate couple are eaten up by the expense of providing for her, Mr. Barton's character is aspersed on account of his kindness to her, and Mrs. Barton dies of working for her. Mr. Barton loses his curacy, goes into another neighbourhood, and, after many years, revisits his wife's grave in company with his children. The next story tells how the Rev. Maynard Gilfil loved Tina Sarti, an Italian orphan, who had been brought to England by Sir Christopher and Lady Cheverel, and lived under their shadow in a dignified country house. Tina, however, had fixed her affections on Sir Christopher's nephew, Captain Wybrow; and when the captain pays court to a beautiful, rich, and lofty heiress, the little Italian girl is so exasperated by his conduct, that she resolves to stab him at an appointed interview.

The New Rank and File presents interviews with working-class organizers of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s who face the challenges of a new economy with the same determination and creativity shown by those profiled in the earlier book. Reflecting the increasing globalization of labor practices--and problems--The New Rank and File contains oral histories of workers in Guatemala, Palestine, Nicaragua, Mexico, and Canada, as well as the United States. In their narratives, rank-and-file workers from many different industries and workplaces reveal the specific incidents and pervasive injustices that triggered their activism. They discuss the frustrations they faced in attempting to effect change through traditional means, and the ways in which they have learned to advocate through innovation. In an incisive introduction, the Lynds set forth their distinctive perspective on the labor movement, with a focus on solidarity unionism: making decisions on the assumption that we all may be leaders at one time or another rather than relying on static hierarchies. Their insights, along with true stories told in the organizers' own words, contain much to inspire a new generation of workers and activists.

Early one morning, less than a month after her eighteenth birthday, Alexandrina Victoria is roused from bed with the news that her uncle William IV has died and she is now Queen of England. The men who run the country have doubts about whether this sheltered young woman, who stands less than five feet tall, can rule the greatest nation in the world. Despite her age, however, the young queen is no puppet. She has very definite ideas about the kind of queen she wants to be, and the first thing is to choose her name.  I do not like the name Alexandrina,  she proclaims.  From now on I wish to be known only by my second name, Victoria.  Next, people say she must choose a husband. Everyone keeps telling her she s destined to marry her first cousin, Prince Albert, but Victoria found him dull and priggish when they met three years ago. She is quite happy being queen with the help of her prime minister, Lord Melbourne, who may be old enough to be her father but is the first person to take her seriously. On June 19th, 1837, she was a teenager. On June 20th, 1837, she was a queen.

What accounted for this? For many social analysts, the history of post-Famine Irish depopulation was a Malthusian morality tale where declining living standards led young people to postpone marriage out of concern for their ability to support a family. The problem here, argues Timothy Guinnane, is that living standards in post-Famine Ireland did not decline. Rather, other, more subtle economic changes influenced the decision to delay marriage or not marry at all. In this engaging inquiry into the \\"vanishing Irish,\\" Guinnane explores the options that presented themselves to Ireland's younger generations, taking into account household structure, inheritance, religion, cultural influences on marriage and family life, and especially emigration. Guinnane focuses on rural Ireland, where the population changes were most profound, and explores the way the demographic patterns reflect the rural Irish economy, Ireland s place as a small part in a much larger English-speaking world, and the influence of earlier Irish history and culture. Particular effort is made to compare Irish demographic behavior to similar patterns elsewhere in Europe, revealing an Ireland anchored in European tradition and yet a distinctive society in its own right.

Washington, Hamilton, Madison, Adams, and Jefferson himself each had a share in shaping that remarkable era--an era that is brilliantly captured in The Age of Federalism.Written by esteemed historians Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick, The Age of Federalism gives us a reflective, deeply informed analytical survey of this extraordinary period. Ranging over the widest variety of concerns--political, cultural, economic, diplomatic, and military--the authors provide a sweeping historical account, keeping always in view not only the problems the new nation faced but also the particular individuals who tried to solve them. As they move through the Federalist era, they draw subtly perceptive character sketches not only of the great figures--Washington and Jefferson, Talleyrand and Napoleon Bonaparte--but also of lesser ones, such as George Hammond, Britain's frustrated minister to the United States, James McHenry, Adams's hapless Secretary of War, the pre-Chief Justice version of John Marshall, and others. They weave these lively profiles into an analysis of the central controversies of the day, turning such intricate issues as the public debt into fascinating depictions of opposing political strategies and contending economic philosophies. Each dispute bears in some way on the broader story of the emerging nation. The authors show, for instance, the consequences the fight over Hamilton's financial system had for the locating of the nation's permanent capital, and how it widened an ideological gulf between Hamilton and the Virginians, Madison and Jefferson, that became unbridgeable. The statesmen of the founding generation, the authors believe, did \\"a surprising number of things right.\\" But Elkins and McKitrick also describe some things that went resoundingly wrong: the hopelessly underfinanced effort to construct a capital city on the Potomac (New York, they argue, would have been a far more logical choice than Washington), and prosecutions under the Alien and Sedition Acts which turned into a comic nightmare. No detail is left out, or left uninteresting, as their account continues through the Adams presidency, the XYZ affair, the naval Quasi-War with France, and the desperate Federalist maneuvers in 1800, first to prevent the reelection of Adams and then to nullify the election of Jefferson.The Age of Federalism is the fruit of many years of discussion and thought, in which deep scholarship is matched only by the lucid distinction of its prose. With it, Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick have produced the definitive study, long awaited by historians, of the early national era.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IVASDAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Age+of+Federalism+-+The+Early+American+Republic,+1788+-+1800&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE SAVVY ENTREPRENEUR-An Insiders's Secrets to Entrepreneurial Success","description":"\\"Pryor brings exceptional knowledge and understanding of the entrepreneurial world ...

A central concern of the book is the relation between pragmatics and semantics, and Dr Levinson shows clearly how a pragmatic approach can resolve some of the problems semantics have been confronting and simplifying semantic analyses. The exposition is always clear and supported by helpful exemplification. The detailed analyses of selected topics give the student a clear view of the empirical rigour demanded by the study of linguistic pragmatics, but Dr Levinson never loses sight of the rich diversity of the subject.

He wrote the short story \\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\\" and compiled a satirical lexicon, The Devil's Dictionary. His vehemence as a critic, his motto \\"Nothing matters\\", and the sardonic view of human nature that informed his work, all earned him the nickname \\"Bitter Bierce\\". Despite his reputation as a searing critic, Bierce was known to encourage younger writers, including the poets George Sterling and Herman George Scheffauer and the fiction writer W. C. Morrow. Bierce employed a distinctive style of writing, especially in his stories. His style often embraces an abrupt beginning, dark imagery, vague references to time, limited descriptions, impossible events, and the theme of war. In 1913, Bierce traveled to Mexico to gain first-hand experience of the Mexican Revolution. He was rumored to be traveling with rebel troops, and was not seen again. Bierce was born in a log cabin at Horse Cave Creek in Meigs County, Ohio, on June 24, 1842, to Marcus Aurelius Bierce (1799-1876) and Laura Sherwood Bierce.His mother was a descendant of William Bradford. He was the tenth of thirteen children whose father gave all names beginning with the letter \\"A\\": in order of birth, the Bierce siblings were Abigail, Amelia, Ann, Addison, Aurelius, Augustus, Almeda, Andrew, Albert, and Ambrose. His parents were a poor but literary couple who instilled in him a deep love for books and writing.Bierce grew up in Kosciusko County, Indiana, attending high school at the county seat, Warsaw.He left home at 15 to become a \\"printer's devil\\" at a small Ohio newspaper.We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection.

Andrew Trees examines four attempts to answer the question of national identity that Americans faced in the wake of the Revolution. Through the writings of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison, Trees explores a complicated political world in which boundaries between the personal and the political were fluid and ill-defined. Melding history and literary study, he shows how this unsettled landscape challenged and sometimes confounded the founders' attempts to forge their own--and the nation's--identity. Trees traces the intimately linked shaping of self and country by four men distrustful of politics and yet operating in an increasingly democratic world. Jefferson sought to recast the political along the lines of friendship, while Hamilton hoped that honor would provide a secure foundation for self and country. Adams struggled to create a nation virtuous enough to sustain a republican government, and Madison worked to establish a government based on justice. Giving a new context to the founders' mission, Trees studies their contributions not simply as policy prescriptions but in terms of a more elusive and symbolic level of action. His work illuminates the tangled relationship among rhetoric, politics, self, and nation--as well as the larger question of national identity that remains with us today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5DlFDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Founding+Fathers+and+the+Politics+of+Character&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fV4wAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Counsels from the Holy Mountain: Selected from the Letters and Homilies of Elder","description":"This treasury of personal counsels and homilies given by Elder Ephraim clearly delineates the Patristic path to sanctification.

A good performance before the cameras can vault a contender to the front of the pack, while a gaffe spells national embarrassment and can savage a candidacy. The slim margin for error has led the two major parties to seek and achieve, under the aegis of the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates tight control through scripting, severe time limits, and the exclusion of third-party candidates. In No Debate, author and lobbyist George Farah argues that these staged recitations make a mockery of free and fair presidential elections. With urgency and clarity, this book reviews the history of presidential debates, the impact of the debates since the advent of television, the role of the League of Women Voters, the antidemocratic activity of the CPD, and the specific ways that the Republicans and Democrats collude to remove all spontaneity from the debates themselves. The author presents the complete text of a previously unreleased secret document between the Republicans and Democrats that reveals the degree to which the two parties not the CPD dictate the terms of the debates. In the final chapter, Farah lays out a compelling strategy for restoring the presidential debates as a nonpartisan, unscripted, public events that help citizens not corporations or campaign managers decide who is going to run the White House.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=opr-Tg5E5RAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Earliest Life of Christ: The Diatessaron of Tatian (Gorgias Reprint)","description":"First published in 1910, this Diatessaron is the earliest recorded gospel of the life of Jesus before the canonical gospel took its place.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s74XvgAACAAJ&dq=The+Earliest+Life+of+Christ:+The+Diatessaron+of+Tatian+(Gorgias+Reprint)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tolkien: The illustrated encyclopaedia","description":"Sections alphabetically list facts about the history, geography, sociology, natural history, and biography of Tolkien's imaginary world","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Nzh93npJTe4C&dq=Tolkien:+The+illustrated+encyclopaedia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Glory Cloak","description":"From childhood, Susan Gray and her cousin Louisa May Alcott have shared a safe, insular world of outdoor adventures and grand amateur theater -- a world that begins to evaporate with the outbreak of the Civil War. Frustrated with sewing uniforms and wrapping bandages, the two women journey to Washington, D.C.'s Union Hospital to volunteer as nurses. Nothing has prepared them for the horrors of this grueling experience. There they meet the remarkable Clara Barton -- the legendary Angel of the Battlefield -- and she becomes their idol and mentor. Soon one wounded soldier begins to captivate and puzzle them all -- a man who claims to be a blacksmith, but whose appearance and sharp intelligence suggest he might not be who he says he is. Through the Civil War and its chaotic aftermath to the apex of Louisa's fame as the author of Little Women and Lincoln's appointment of Clara to the job of finding and naming the war's missing and dead, this novel is ultimately the story of friendship between women -- women who broke the mold society set for them, while still reckoning with betrayal, love, and forgiveness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7Q60bieLaDcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cool Mom on the Hot Seat","description":"An entertaining account of raising a family today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YCSW9tOdXQgC&dq=Cool+Mom+on+the+Hot+Seat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frommer's Norway (Frommer's Complete)","description":"Frommer's Norway gives you the complete overview of insider knowledge on what to do in this picturesque country.

Richard Swinburne concludes that despite philosophical objections, most traditional claims about God are coherent (that is, do not involve contradictions); and although some of the most important claims are coherent only if the words by which they are expressed are being used in analogical senses, this is the way in which theologians have usually claimed that they are being used. When the first edition of this book was published in 1977, it was the first book in the new 'analytic' tradition of philosophy of religion to discuss these issues. Since that time there have been very many books and discussions devoted to them, and this new, substantially rewritten, second edition takes account of these discussions and of new developments in philosophy generally over the past 40 years. These discussions have concerned how to analyse the claim that God is 'omnipotent', whether God can foreknow human free actions, whether God is everlasting or timeless, and what it is for God to be a 'necessary being'. On all these issues this new edition has new things to say.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oyH4CwAAQBAJ&dq=Coherence+of+Theism,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Castle of Iron","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_0vWAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Castle+of+Iron&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Computer Challenges: Atari","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_CXJAAAACAAJ&dq=Computer+Challenges:+Atari&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How To Treat A Woman","description":"Guys, are you spending so much time making your career a success that your personal life is in the toilet?

Beginning with General Benjamin Franklin Butler, who boasted that \\"in six months New Orleans should be a Union city or - a home of the alligators\\", the Union generals who commanded Louisiana met with varying degrees of success in their attempts to enforce the constantly evolving Reconstruction policies of three administrations on a people who openly despised their conquerors. Covering the period from the fall of New Orleans to Federal forces through the collapse of Stephen Packard's Republican government in 1877, Army Generals and Reconstruction, by Joseph G. Dawson III, is a history and a detailed analysis of the army's responsibilities, accomplishments, and failures in Reconstruction Louisiana. Dawson shows how the decisions and attitudes of the army commanders were crucial to both the Republican and Democratic parties and how neither side could act confidently without knowing first how the generals would respond to their actions. He examines the army commanders' efforts to ensure that blacks and Republicans could exercise their civil and political rights, and he looks at the influence General Philip Sheridan exerted on Louisiana Reconstruction politics - both during his supervision of the state and after President Andrew Johnson reassigned him elsewhere. Based on a close examination of archival sources, Army Generals and Reconstruction reveals the full complexity of the army's involvement in this tumultuous period in Louisiana politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b8ZStQAACAAJ&dq=Army+Generals+and+Reconstruction:+Louisiana,+1862-1877&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moll Flanders (Norton Critical Editions Series)","description":"Moll Flanders is one of the best-selling novels of all time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5Q8LzwEACAAJ&dq=Moll+Flanders+(Norton+Critical+Editions+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In search of humanity: The role of the enlightenment in modern history","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k5sbAAAAMAAJ&dq=In+search+of+humanity:+The+role+of+the+enlightenment+in+modern+history&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Farewell Waltz: A Novel","description":"In this dark farce of a novel, set in an old-fashioned Central European spa town, eight characters are swept up in an accelerating dance: a pretty nurse and her repairman boyfriend; an oddball gynecologist; a rich American (at once saint and Don Juan); a popular trumpeter and his beautiful, obsessively jealous wife; an disillusioned former political prisoner about to leave his country and his young woman ward.Perhaps the most brilliantly plotted and sheer entertaining of Milan Kundera's novels, Farewell Waltz poses the most serious questions with a blasphemous lightness that makes us see that the modern world has deprived us even of the right to tragedy. Written in Bohemia in 1969-70, this book was first published (in 1976) in France under the title La valse aux adieux (Farewell Waltz), and later in thirty-four other countries.

This book is organized into two major parts encompassing 14 chapters that focus on diseases, pathogenicity, and pathogen variability. The first part of the book deals with general considerations of disease, the disease cycle, parasitism and pathogenicity, and the variability in pathogens. This is followed by a presentation of the mechanisms by which pathogens cause disease and plants resist disease. Core chapters focus on the effects of pathogen-produced enzymes, toxins, growth regulators, and polysaccharides on the structural organization and on the basic physiological processes of photosynthesis, translocation, and respiration. The chapters also discuss the defense mechanisms of the plant. Moreover, this book explains the genetics of host-parasite interaction, effects of environment on disease development, and control. The second part of the book deals with the infectious diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, parasitic higher plants, viruses, and nematodes. This part also looks into the noninfectious diseases caused by environmental factors. The diseases caused by each type of pathogen are discussed comprehensively as a group and are subsequently discussed individually in detail. This book includes diagrams of cycles for each disease to create visual images for better understanding of the disease and message retention.

More importantly, what did he think he knew? How did Wagner's attitudes towards the past shape his construction of the Ring cycle? Classically Romantic attempts to answer these questions through an examination of Wagner's intellectual background and the structure of the Ring itself. The book explores the differences between Wagner's \\"romantic classicism\\" and traditional \\"philological classicism.\\" Anticipating the \\"Great Books\\" movement of the twentieth century, Wagner's views were an interesting blend of classical formalism and romantic idealism. Wagner believed, for instance, that classical literature was important, not because it shed light on the past, but because it had \\"continued relevance\\" to each succeeding generation. The classics purified and redeemed ancient society, Wagner concluded, and only an equivalent type of work could purify and redeem the modern world. It was out of a desire to create a \\"modern classic\\" that Wagner's four-drama cycle, Der Ring des Nibelungen, arose. In Wagner's romantic view of the past, Greek tragedy was the only perfectly unified form of art. The composer believed that, in ancient tragedy, all the arts worked together harmoniously so as to guide the audience towards a single, significant purpose: a harmonious social order. In this way, although Wagner saw himself as imitating classical models, his ultimate goal was identical to that of many Romantic Age social reformers. Fundamental aspects of Wagnerian drama may thus ultimately be traced to the composer's unusual combination of the classical and the romantic. For example, Wagner's central concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk, the \\"total work of art\\" in which every artistic element blended perfectly with every other artistic element, has a direct connection to the composer's desire to recreate classical tragedy, the one form of art in which he believed those elements had been unified. By examining each of Aristotle's six constituent elements of tragedy (plot, music, speech, thought, character, and spectacle), Classically Romantic demonstrates what Wagner envisioned when he sought a perfect \\"union\\" of all the components of art. Perhaps most important of the book's contributions is its demonstration that the leitmotif, usually regarded solely as a musical phenomenon, was actually a thematic principle of construction employed on many levels of the drama. Wagner introduced were repeated themes of plot, characterization, speech, and imagery, all endowed with meaning in a manner precisely parallel to that of the musical leitmotivs. Moreover, since Wagner dictated nearly every aspect of how the original productions of his work were staged, even visual elements of the drama could be given a consistent, \\"thematic\\" role. Colors, images of light and darkness, and mist all serve as \\"visual leitmotivs\\" in much the same way that one can also speak of musical leitmotivs, leitmotivs of plot, character leitmotivs, and so on. Finally, Wagner's desire to bring all social classes together in a festival similar to the Great Dionysia of ancient Athens helps explain why the composer created the Wagner Societies throughout Germany in his own lifetime and why the Festspielhaus of Bayreuth was established as it was, with annual festivals rather than continual performances...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1_cZAQAAIAAJ&dq=Classically+Romantic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Earth's Last Fortress / Lost in Space (Ace Double D-431)","description":"Includes Part 1, Number 1 & 2: Books and Pamphlets, Including Serials and Contributions to Periodicals (January - December)","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lNcgAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Night!","description":"Say goodnight to the capital of Massachusetts!

Of mixed blood Tsa-la-gi, GaWaNi Pony Boy was able to conceive his philosophy and compile the methods of relationship training while touring the United States with a Native American drum band and consulting the Tribal Elders from many different nations and backgrounds. The methods and beliefs of relationship training come directly from the first great horsemen of North America. \\"Horse and rider are one. Theirs is a relationship of trust, harmony, and respect born of a way of life that is all but lost.\\" The stunning full-color photographs by Gabrielle Boiselle capture Pony Boy's serenity and unity with his close horse companions. The author's simple eloquence forges a deep, profound relationship with his readers that few books ever hope to achieve. As Pony Boy writes in the introduction, \\"For many [the Native American horseman] represents the ultimate rider. The essence of a horseman, both his skill and intuition, goes beyond the hours he spends in the saddle;.the folklore of every Native tribe are stories, tales, and beliefs to exemplify human's relations to other animals.\\" The book begins with an analysis of how horses came to live with the Natives of North America and horses' impact on Native life. The crux of relationship training, according to the author, is to understand \\"what it means to be a horse, react like a horse, and relate to other things like a horse;.\\" Native Americans were able to create such strong relationship with horses in a short time because they understood that \\"a horse is a horse.\\" Learning to balance the relationship between horse and human is the missing link to becoming a masterful horseman or horsewoman. The book describes not only the techniques involved for relationship training but also the belief system and attitude that must be applied to all methods of horsemanship.In addition to presenting the methods and philosophy of relationship training, Horse, Follow Closely also includes many stories and legends of Native Americans and their horses, all of which teach the reader something new about himself and his relationship with his horse.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=66UKBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An introduction to electrochemistry,","description":"Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive.

But when street smart, plugged-in reporter Percy Crenshaw is brutally murdered in the midst of pursuing a major story, she knows the stakes are high... Within days, cops have a suspect; then a confession. Yet Samantha suspects that something is very wrong, and her concerns keep coming back to the police. The cop who got the confession used tough tactics. The murdered reporter was romantically linked to a cop's wife. And all of the cops she's concerned about are close to her live-in boyfriend, Detective Chuck Forbes. Forced to prosecute a case in which the defendant may be an innocent man, Samantha must tread carefully to uncover the truth about Percy's murder -- without tearing her career, her home life, and the city apart. But just when she thinks her job can't get any more difficult, another more shocking crime comes to light...  Absorbing...Burke confidently lays out the procedural details.

Allan Greer takes a close look at the at society and its economy in three parishes in Lower Richelieu valley ? Sorel, St Ours, and St Denis ? from 1740 to 1840.

On May 25, 1977, a problem-plagued, budget-straining independent science-fiction film opened in a mere thirty-two American movie theaters. Conceived, written, and directed by a little-known filmmaker named George Lucas, the movie originally called The Star Wars quickly drew blocks-long lines, bursting box-office records and ushering in a new way for movies to be made, marketed, and merchandised. It is now one of the most adored-and successful-movie franchises of all time. Now, the author of the bestselling biography Jim Henson delivers a long-awaited, revelatory look into the life and times of the man who created Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Indiana Jones. If Star Wars wasn't game-changing enough, Lucas went on to create another blockbuster series with Indiana Jones, and he completely transformed the world of special effects and the way movies sound. His innovation and ambition forged Pixar and Lucasfilm, Industrial Light & Magic, and THX sound. Lucas's colleagues and competitors offer tantalizing glimpses into his life. His entire career has been stimulated by innovators including Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola, actors such as Harrison Ford, and the very technologies that enabled the creation of his films-and allowed him to keep tinkering with them long after their original releases. Like his unforgettable characters and stories, his influence is unmatched.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wPXhCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Practical Pistol Manual: How to Use a Handgun for Self-Defense","description":"Since more than 26 states have passed laws requiring training for concealed carrying of firearms, citizens and police have a duty to teach the safe and responsible use of the weapons. In eight other states that permit concealed carry with no training required, men and women have a moral obligation to learn how to carry and use their firearms safely and responsibly. This handy little book contains everything a novice gun owner needs to know to start learning the basics of competent and safe pistol use, as well as the essentials of using a gun in a potentially violent confrontation with a criminal. It is an ideal textbook for state courses required for concealed carry permits. While there are many excellent books on handguns, marksmanship and self defense, all are designed for those who want to be expert in those subjects. There are no other books which address the specific concerns of someone who simply wants to carry a concealed firearm safely and responsibly until now. Bill Clede serves on the Connecticut State Police Firearms Advisory Committee which determines what training in his state will and will not include. A fruitless search for a suitable text is what prompted him to develop this book. One of Clede's primary goals is teaching how to avoid discharging the firearm in the first place, defusing aggressive behavior without resorting to shooting someone. The Practical Pistol Manual brings all these concerns together -- safety, competent shooting, and how to deal with violent behavior -- in one concise and affordable book. This is the only book that fills the need of a text for novices that covers safety, competent shooting, and how to deal with potentially violentencounters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Tcu-PAAACAAJ&dq=The+Practical+Pistol+Manual:+How+to+Use+a+Handgun+for+Self-Defense&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Problems in the Origins and Development of the English Language","description":"This companion to THE ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE expands on material in the main textbook.

I researched diet and nutrition, exercise, and how certain supplementation and secret weight loss techniques can really, truly, absolutely work! And they did for me... and lots of others who've followed my purpose-driven techniques. The amazing thing is; that I didn't have to destroy my body with torturous exercise regimes, or even eat blank meals - or go on boring starvation diets. Which I'd definitely done in the past. In fact, I did all this by changing a few key things within my lifestyle, and that gave me dramatic, unbelievable results! I personally know how it feels to be overweight (obese actually), and all the emotional and physical pain that it brings with it. So, I invite you to regain your life again, just like I've done!

So, what are you waiting for? Take back your life now and never look back! Hi, my name is Nat Lee, and I've spent most of my life looking pretty good and feeling great. That was up until I started eating on the run and allowing my busy life as a mom to take hold of me. While working too. In truth, I knew I should eat great food, but time constraints and \\"motherly craziness\\" got the better of me. I made sure my son ate well. But I didn't, which was silly, really. Parenting is one of those things that just takes over your life, I suppose. So, anyway, I kinda ate loads of stuff I shouldn't, and drank sodas and milkshakes an awful lot. Chocolate and takeout became my best friend, and I became overweight, by anyone's standards. No one really told me I looked bad, I mean, most people aren't that obvious. But when I was diagnosed with a severe illness and bedridden for four years, it became time to do something to help my recovery. I made the change as soon as I could. Since reading Emma's books, I've lost 18.5 kg (which is 40 amazing pounds). And I've managed to keep it off by following her wonderful advice, and by using her awesome, easy-to-do recipes. I live relatively simply, but her guide to nutrition and her tips and tricks have helped me a bucket load. Thank you Emma, you've literally changed my life!

In the midst of a brutal civil war that devastates the country and claims the lives of two fellow workers at the Jane Goodall Institute, she provides tender loving care to a large group of orphaned chimpanzees who have been rescued from poachers and pet traders. Life with the chimpanzees is not all joy. The frisky youngsters frequently attack and bite fellow-apes and caretakers. A baby chimp is stillborn. A powerful, escaped male launches a near fatal assault on one of the keepers.

No, I'm not insane-at least I hope I'm not. Actually, what I am is a Witch with a rare talent, even for Witches. I can hear the voices of the dead-murder victims, to be specific. Personally, I consider it less a talent and more a curse, especially given all the grief it brings me. But the cops think otherwise, which is why I find myself consulting for them on a regular basis. In fact, the running joke is that they should just go ahead and give me a badge. I sometimes fear they might make good on that threat. However, like I said, it has been a while since any dead people have so much as given me the time of day. I'll be honest, even though I never really wanted them to talk to me in the first place, now that they have stopped it seems almost like a piece of me is missing-a big piece. As fate would have it, at the same time I've become persona non grata with the dead, it looks as if a serial killer is at work in the St. Louis area. The murders are pretty heinous, too, and that's just the sort of thing that usually turns the rumbling chatter of the victims into a deafening roar and a blinding migraine for yours truly...but not this time, and I have no Earthly-or even unearthly-idea why. What I do know is the Major Case Squad could benefit from my help on this, but I've got nothing to give them. Nothing at all... Unfortunately, it seems that there is now someone else with my rare affliction instead of me.

And the message it promulgated, Islam, came of age during an extraordinarily rich era of interaction among monotheists. Jews, Christians, and Muslims not only worshipped the same God, but shared aspirations, operated in the same social and economic environment, and sometimes lived side by side, indistinguishable by language, costume, or manners. Today, of course, little of this commonality is apparent, and Islam is poorly understood by most non-Muslims. Entering Islam through the same biblical door Muhammad did, this book introduces readers with Christian or Jewish backgrounds to one of the world's largest, most active, and--in the West--least understood religions. Frank Peters, one of the world's leading authorities on the monotheistic religions, starts with the central feature of Muslim faith and life: the Quran. Across its pages move Adam, Noah, Abraham, David, Solomon, John the Baptist, Jesus, and the Virgin Mary. The Quran contains remarkably familiar accounts of Genesis, the Flood, Exodus, the Virgin Birth, and other biblical events. But Peters also highlights Muhammad's very different use of Scripture and explains those elements of the Quran most alien to Western readers, from its didactic passages to its remarkable poetry. Peters goes on to cogently explain Islam's defining features--including the significance of Mecca, the manner of Muhammad's revelations, and the creation of the unique community of Muslims, all in relation to the Judeo-Christian tradition. He compares Jesus and Muhammad, describes Islamic commandments and rituals, details the structures of Sunni and Shi'ite communities, and lays out central Islamic beliefs on war, women, mysticism, and martyrdom. The result is a crucial and extremely accomplished book that offers Western readers a professional yet highly accessible understanding of Islam, and at a time when we need it most.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HYJ2c9E9IM8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Con Game and (Yellow Kid) Weil (American Autobiography)","description":"Bilked bankers, grifted gamblers, and swindled spinsters: welcome to the world of confidence men.

TONY HILLERMAN On the night of September 14, 1935, George Conniff, a town marshal in Pend Oreille County in the state of Washington, was shot to death. A lawman had been killed, yet there seemed to be no uproar, no major investigation. No suspect was brought to trial. More than fifty years later, the sheriff of Pend Oreille County, Tony Bamonte, in pursuit of both justice and a master s degree in history, dug into the files of the Conniff case by then the oldest open murder case in the United States. Gradually, what started out as an intellectual exercise became an obsession, as Bamonte asked questions that unfolded layer upon layer of unsavory detail. In Timothy Egan s vivid account, which reads like a thriller, we follow Bamonte as his investigation plunges him back in time to the Depression era of rampant black-market crime and police corruption. We see how the suppressed reports he uncovers and the ambiguous answers his questions evoke lead him to the murder weapon missing for half a century and then to the man, an ex-cop, he is convinced was the murderer. Bamonte himself a logger s son and a Vietnam veteran had joined the Spokane police force in the late 1960s, a time when increasingly enlightened and educated police departments across the country were shaking off the  dirty cop  stigma. But as he got closer to actually solving the crime, questioning elderly retired members of the force, he found himself more and more isolated, shut out by tight-lipped hostility, and made dramatically aware of the fraternal sin he had committed breaking the blue code. Breaking Blue is a gripping story of cop against cop. But it also describes a collision between two generations of lawmen and two very different moments in our nation s history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OeISsYwfRSoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of Philosophy: Volume 7 Part1: Modern Philosophy-Fichte to Hegel (A History of Philosophy, Volume 7, Part 1)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IFshAQAAMAAJ&dq=A+History+of+Philosophy:+Volume+7+Part1:+Modern+Philosophy-Fichte+to+Hegel+(A+History+of+Philosophy,+Volume+7,+Part+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lives on the Line: American Families and the Struggle To Make Ends Meet","description":"Shattering many common stereotypes about the underclass, this compelling new account of life below the poverty line focuses on the lives of America's poor children, detailing their lives, struggles, and privations in vivid detail.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wNIoAAAAYAAJ&dq=Lives+on+the+Line:+American+Families+and+the+Struggle+To+Make+Ends+Meet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scaling Down","description":"How to make more of less--the book that shows you how to simplify your life, control clutter, and pare down your possessions for a move into smaller living quarters.

Alone and childless, Efuru realizes she surely must have a higher calling and goes to the lake goddess of her tribe, Uhamiri, to discover the path she must follow. The work, a rich exploration of Nigerian village life and values, offers a realistic picture of gender issues in a patriarchal society as well as the struggles of a nation exploited by colonialism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nYtIAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marcy Catches Up","description":"Seventeen-year-old Marcy's romance at a Colorado ranch becomes more serious than she intends, but at the end of the summer she returns to her home and her special friend Steve.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t8q5PAAACAAJ&dq=Marcy+Catches+Up&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wallace Stevens : Collected Poetry and Prose (Library of America)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to Develop Powerful Telephone Skills: Five 20-Minute Self-Study Sessions That Build the Skills You Need to Succeed (A Dartnell high-performance skill builder)","description":"Every time you talk on the phone, you create an impression of yourself & your organization.

Over the course of ten days, he shadowed the Dave Brubeck Quartet during their extended British tour, recording an epic interview with the bandleader. Brubeck opened up as never before, disclosing his unique approach to jazz; the heady days of his \\"classic\\" quartet in the 1950s-60s; hanging out with Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Louis Armstrong, and Miles Davis; and the many controversies that had dogged his 66-yearlong career. Alongside beloved figures like Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra, Brubeck has achieved name recognition beyond jazz. But finding a convincing fit for Brubeck's legacy, one that reconciles his mass popularity with his advanced musical technique, has proved largely elusive. In Dave Brubeck: A Life inTime, Clark provides us with a thoughtful, thorough, and long-overdue biography of an extraordinary man whose influence continues to inform and inspire musicians today. Structured around Clark's extended interview and intensive new research, this book recounts one of the last untold stories of jazz, unearthing the secret history of \\"Take Five\\" and many hitherto unknown aspects of Brubeck's early career-and sharing details about his creative relationship with his star saxophonist, Paul Desmond. Woven throughout are cameo appearances from a host of unlikely figures, from Sting, Ray Manzarek of The Doors, and Keith Emerson to John Cage, Leonard Bernstein, Harry Partch, and Edgard Var se. Each chapter explores a different theme or aspect of Brubeck's life and music, illuminating the core of his artistry and genius. To quote President Obama, as he awarded the musician with a Kennedy Center Honor: \\"You can't understand America without understanding jazz, and you can't understand jazz without understanding Dave Brubeck.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kjqRDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roads from the Ashes: An Odyssey in Real Life on the Virtual Frontier","description":"When a wildfire destroyed her home and worldly possessions in the hills above Los Angeles, it didn t take Megan Edwards long to recognize an opportunity. It took her husband a little longer ( Give me five minutes to grieve! ), but they were both soon planning to make the most of their sudden  stufflessness  and hit the road. They did so a few months later in a freshly built four-wheel-drive motorhome that was even more unusual because of the office in the back instead of a bedroom. This all happened back when  Internet  had not yet entered the lexicon but  email  had. The mobile office would allow Edwards to file stories with the newspapers she wrote for by cell phone. That was the idea, at least. At the beginning of 1994, cell service was patchy, unreliable, and expensive. They also thought they d be traveling for six months or so, when, they believed, they d settle down and get back to normal. But five years and thousands of miles later, they were still on the road. In that time, they d watched the Internet grow from a mysterious fad prized by people in remote locales into an unstoppable universal phenomenon. They started a website, RoadTripAmerica.com, to share road tripping tips and ideas. Slowly, their dream of being  at work, at home, and on the road, all at the same grand time  became a reality. This edition marks the twentieth anniversary of Edwards s memoir, which was first released in 1999. At its heart a story of making lemonade when life gives you lemons, this memoir is also a riveting and at times hilarious look at the early years of the World Wide Web. With a new introduction by the author and a foreword by Chris Epting, enjoy an armchair adventure across North America when the Internet was young. This edition also includes 22 photos dating from when the author lived on the road. -- Megan Edwards","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TLBVDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fast Guide to Cubase Vst","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eLEyQAAACAAJ&dq=Fast+Guide+to+Cubase+Vst&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark City (Sun and Moon Classics)","description":"Dark City, Charles Bernstein's twentieth book, is an at times comic, at times bleak, excursion into everyday life in the late 20th century.

Richard Almond's study brings vividly to life the universality and centrality of hunting to medieval societies, both as an economic necessity and as an expression of medieval humanity's almost atavistic sense of oneness with nature. 'Medieval Hunting' dispels some of the myths and misunderstandings surrounding hunting, including the persistent views that it was exclusively an aristocratic, male pursuit. Using a wide variety of contemporary textual and art historical evidence, Richard Almond shows that hunting, including fishing and poaching, was enjoyed by women as well as men.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c007AwAAQBAJ&dq=Medieval+Hunting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zoophabets","description":"Illustrations of make-believe creatures for each letter of the alphabet with descriptions of where each lives and what he eats.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HjrOOQAACAAJ&dq=Zoophabets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Other Septembers, Many Americas: Selected Provocations, 1980#2004","description":"\\"Let me tell you, America, of the hopes I had for you,\\" Dorfman writes after the fall of the Twin Towers, remembering back to an earlier September 11 in 1973, when he was on the staff of Salvador Allende, then president of Chile, the day he was removed from office and murdered in a coup in which the U.S. government was complicit. \\"Beware the plague of victimhood, America . . .

By 1914, the European military powers had adopted offensive military strategies even though there was considerable evidence to support the notion that much greater advantage lay with defensive strategies. The author argues that organizational biases inherent in military strategists' attitudes make war more likely by encouraging offensive postures even when the motive is self-defense. Drawing on new historical evidence of the specific circumstances surrounding French, German, and Russian strategic policy, Snyder demonstrates that it is not only rational analysis that determines strategic doctrine, but also the attitudes of military planners. Snyder argues that the use of rational calculation often falls victim to the pursuit of organizational interests such as autonomy, prestige, growth, and wealth. Furthermore, efforts to justify the preferred policy bring biases into strategists' decisions biases reflecting the influences of parochial interests and preconceptions, and those resulting from attempts to simplify unduly their analytical tasks. The frightening lesson here is that doctrines can be destabilizing even when weapons are not, because doctrine may be more responsive to the organizational needs of the military than to the implications of the prevailing weapons technology. By examining the historical failure of offensive doctrine, Jack Snyder makes a valuable contribution to the literature on the causes of war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gf6tDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Ideology+of+the+Offensive:+Military+Decision+Making+and+the+Disasters+of+1914+(Cornell+Studies+in+Security+Affairs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Coming of the Maori","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W2jTwQEACAAJ&dq=The+Coming+of+the+Maori&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Koko Bear's New Potty","description":"This delightful read-aloud story for children uses parenting author Vicki Lansky s lovable unisex character, KoKo Bear, to show that toilet training is only a part of the larger process of growing up.

Helen, have been looking for: A rustic retreat from the pressures of adulthood back in London. Complete ignorance of agriculture, local culture, and the language? Not a problem. The key to success lies in mastering a few simple lessons about the simple life.... 1) Indoor toilets are for wusses. As are running water, heat, and electricity, apparently. But does the absence of creature comforts really matter when you're young and in love? Or in lust and reasonably fond of one another? 2) Love means maintaining the mutual delusion that everything is perfectly fine. The fact that The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly was filmed near your little corner of paradise is cool--not weirdly prophetic. As long you both understand that acclimating to hovel (er, farm) life and its necessary privations (no mixed drinks, no hot showers, no clean underwear) may take a while, everything will be just dandy. No really... 3) Foreigners are weird. This means you. One of the richest rewards of life in a rural community is getting to know your neighbors: The salt of the earth who will give you the shirts off their backs, or a funny, farting puppy; who will feed you pork sausages until you're sick, and will laugh at just about every stupid thing you do. Over the course of one (long) year, Shaun and Helen will learn what it's like to take a relationship for a test drive on the wrong side of the road, as they get a crash course in the sublime and ridiculous intricacies of.... How Not to Live Abroad.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6_63sTfr0hsC&dq=How+Not+to+Live+Abroad:+Surviving+Rustic+Bliss+in+the+Spanish+Countryside&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robert Maillart and the Art of Reinforced Concrete","description":"The Swiss engineer Robert Maillart (1872-1940) built bridges and industrial buildings of startling originality. His innovative use of concrete, especially in the design of thin arch structures, and his introduction of a wide range of new engineering forms, make him a seminal figure in the history of modern engineering. Focusing on 14 of Maillart's major works, this book provides a stunning full-color visual presentation of engineering structures as works of art in their own right and as images for new possibilities in architecture.Previous studies of Maillart - including the pioneering essays by Sigfried Gidieon and Max Bill - were based on black and white illustrations taken in the 1930s. For this German and English dual language book, Maillart's Swiss structures were rephotographed under the author's supervision. With the added dimension of color and looked at from the point of view of a wellknown structural engineer, they present Maillart in a totally new perspective.Billington explains in detail how Maillart's ideas unfold from his first design, the 1901 Zuoz Bridge, to his last, the 1940 Lachen Bridge. He analyzes these works using engineering criteria and raises the provocative notion that structure is a fertile ground for new forms that remain to be realized in structural engineering and in architecture.David P. Billington is Professor of Civil Engineering at Princeton University.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xGNAAQAAIAAJ&dq=Robert+Maillart+and+the+Art+of+Reinforced+Concrete&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In memoriam","description":"Composed by Alfred Tennyson as a requiem for his college friend Arthur Henry Hallam, who died suddenly of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1833, \\"In Memoriam A. H. H.\\" is a poem written over a seventeen year period and completed in 1849. Widely considered as one of the greatest poems of the Victorian era it is a richly lyrical work which meditates on the search for hope in the wake of a great loss. The length of this work and the period of time in which Tennyson took to complete it speaks volumes as to the personal impact of the loss of such a close friend. Central to this work is an examination of death and spirituality as part of the grieving process. Tennyson's psyche can be seen transforming through the course of this work. What begins as a spirit filled with doubt and despair transforms into one of faith and hope by the end of the work. \\"In Memoriam A. H. H.\\" is a powerful examination of death and loss, one in which the author exposes a very personal process of how he dealt with the loss of one of his closest friends.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YYztrQEACAAJ&dq=In+memoriam&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Scottish chiefs (Her Works)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7P8nAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"At the End of Your Rope, There's Hope : Parenting Teens in Crisis","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MWLOtQKqGOoC&dq=At+the+End+of+Your+Rope,+There%27s+Hope+:+Parenting+Teens+in+Crisis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women in ministry today","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sociology: Exploring the Architecture of Everyday Life","description":"The Eighth edition of David Newman s Sociology: Exploring the Architecture of Everyday Life once again invites students into the world of sociological thought.

After setting out Fernel's views on the nature of man, Sherrington proceeds to develop his own thoughts, drawing upon a wide variety of philosophical theories. Using Fernel as a historical case study, the book demonstrates how any scientific outlook is always part of its age, and shows how views on the eternal enigmas of mankind, mind and life have changed radically over time. Sherrington's book is important in the history of ideas for its assessment of the value of advances in natural science as a framework for the development of natural theology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4wnsPwAACAAJ&dq=Man+on+his+nature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frommer's Singapore & Malaysia (Frommer's Complete)","description":"Provides information on attractions, accommodations, restaurants, shopping, and nightlife.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cpgVApnm8ncC&dq=Frommer%27s+Singapore&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dutchman's Flat","description":"TURN HOME, RIDER In this land, the place you leave behind might not be there when you get back.

He had climbed the castle turrets to survey his kingdom, learned to duel with the sharpest blades, and stirred up palace intrigue in disguise. That is, until one day when his identity is suddenly shattered by the revelations of a blind woman: He learns that he isn t a prince at all, but a wretched slave. In a kingdom where ruthlessness is part of everyday life, Thom fears this new truth could be deadly. He takes flight, running from the life he knew and the one he despises, but the call to free his people beckons him home. Armed with a magic stone, which instructs him through surreal visions, he must topple his once beloved brother who has since become a tyrannical king. A fantastical retelling of the story of Moses, Thom s adventure forces him to question if he can succeed in his quest without truly understanding who he is. Because it seems he must unravel his past, present, and future before he can let his people free.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mO1VDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Letters of John: The NIV Application Commentary: From Biblical Text...to Contemporary Life","description":"Most Bible commentaries take us on a one-way trip from the twentieth century to the first century.

How is it that Christmas is not merely surviving, but actually gaining in importance? This book provides the first comparative study of the Christmas phenomenon, based on direct observation of how the festival is actually celebrated in diverse social contexts. It begins with some general theories of Christmas, including the first full English translation of \\"Father Christmas Executed\\" by Claude L ?evi-Strauss, and then focuses on two controversial issues. First, the relationship between Christmas and materialism is examined and interpreted in the United States, Japan, and Trinidad. The second theme is the debate over the place of the family in Christmas celebrations; this section ranges from discussion of quarrels and tensions sparked off by the festival to a study of a deliberately anti- (or non-) nuclear family Christmas, and examines evidence from Sweden, Britain, and the Inupiat of Alaska. Christmas is rapidly becoming the focus for a constellation of activities such as gift-giving, the marking of the seasons, and the celebration of extended family networks which otherwise would have seemed to be in sharp decline. This collection represents a fascinating and significant contribution to understanding how and why Christmas has developed into the global festival celebrated today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yn-BAAAAMAAJ&dq=Unwrapping+Christmas+(Oxford+Studies+in+Social+and+Cultural+Anthropology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"String Straight-edge and Shadow (the Story of Geometry)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O07EPAAACAAJ&dq=String+Straight-edge+and+Shadow+(the+Story+of+Geometry)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eleanor Powell: A Bio-Bibliography (Bio-Bibliographies in the Performing Arts)","description":"Eleanor Powell began her notable career at age 12, by dancing in a supper show at an Atlantic City hotel.

These superpartners will have wide ranging implications, from cosmology to observations at high energy accelerators, such as CERN's LHC. In this 2006 text, the authors develop the basic concepts of supersymmetry and show how it can be incorporated into a theoretical framework for describing unified theories of elementary particles. They develop the technical tools of supersymmetry using four-component spinor notation familiar to high energy experimentalists and phenomenologists. The text takes the reader from an abstract formalism to a straightforward recipe for writing supersymmetric gauge theories of particle physics, and ultimately to the calculations necessary for practical applications at colliders and in cosmology. This is a comprehensive, practical and accessible introduction to supersymmetry for experimental and phenomenological particle physicists and graduate students. Exercises and worked examples that clarify the material are interspersed throughout.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QpwM_3PA2KAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What I Remember: 1924 Editions","description":"This carefully crafted ebook: \\"We (A Dystopian Science Fiction Classic) - The Unabridged Original 1924 Edition\\" is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents. We is a dystopian novel which is set in a dystopian future police state. D-503 lives in the One State, an urban nation constructed almost entirely of glass, which allows the secret police/spies to inform on and supervise the public more easily. The structure of the state is analogous to the prison design concept developed by Jeremy Bentham commonly referred to as the Panopticon. Furthermore, life is organized to promote maximum productive efficiency along the lines of the system advocated by the hugely influential F.W. Taylor. People march in step with each other and wear identical clothing. There is no way of referring to people save by their given numbers. Males have odd numbers prefixed by consonants, females have even numbers prefixed by vowels. Along with Jack London's The Iron Heel, We is generally considered to be the grandfather of the satirical futuristic dystopia genre. Yevgeny Zamyatin (1884-1937) was a Russian author of science fiction and political satire. Due to his use of literature to criticize Soviet society, Zamyatin has been referred to as one of the first Soviet dissidents.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-1NjDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Food Choice and Obesity in Black America: Creating a New Cultural Diet","description":"Anthropologist Eric Bailey uses a cultural and holistic analysis of African American food preferences to show how black Americans generally perceive health, body image, food, dieting, physical fitness, and exercise.

Written by V. Raymond Edman, who is best remembered as the fourth president of Wheaton College in Illinois and as the writer of many devotional books, They Found the Secret shares the failures, hardships, yearnings, accomplishments, and ultimate hope and faith of twenty well-known and little-known Christians. There are those of yesteryear like John Bunyan, and of more recent years like Richard C. Halverson and William P. Nicholson. There are clergymen like A. J. Gordon, and laymen like Dwight L. Moody. Some are well known, like Charles G. Finney and Oswald Chambers, while others may be little known or even quite forgotten, like J. A. Wood. There are mystics like Andrew Murray and practical men like Charles G. Trumbull and Robert E. Nicholas. There are women as well as men: Frances Ridley Havergal of England, Amy Carmichael of India, and Eugenia Price of contemporary America. The details of each of their experiences are quite different, yet as you listen to their stories and watch their lives, you will see a pattern that reveals their secret: Out of discouragement and defeat they have come into victory. Out of weakness and weariness they have been made strong. Out of ineffectiveness and apparent uselessness they have become efficient and enthusiastic. Their collective testimony to the reality of the joy and power of the Spirit-filled life is unanimous. Their lives and work have shaped the Christian faith and paved the way for those who have come after them. And from their stories, you too can find the path to deeper faith and a more vital relationship with God.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TipfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grad Guides BK4:Phy Sci/Math/Ag Sci 2004 (Peterson's Graduate Programs in the Physical Sciences, Mathematics, Agricultural Sciences, the Environment & Natural Resources)","description":"Pt. 1.

Others followed, and eventually this small area was dotted with settlers. In the years since, those settlers and their descendants witnessed the strife of the Civil War, the rise of the coal-mining and logging industries, the coming of the railroad, and countless smaller upheavals. Drawn largely from the memories of long-time residents, this delightful book revisits two hundred years of history in the communities surrounding what was locally called Windrock Mountain. The stories Augusta Bell recounts take us from Oliver Springs--which had its origins in the grist mill Moses Winters built in 1799 and which later became a \\"boom town\\" with a fashionable resort hotel--to places like New River Valley, Graves Gap, and Duncan Flats. She depicts the everyday lives of the mountain people as well as the extraordinary events that sometimes shattered those lives--such as the Coal Creek War of 1891-93, in which miners squared off against state militia, and the two mine explosions that came a few years later, sealing up 268 men deep inside the mountain. Bell also tells of happier times, as when the famous Windrock Mine opened above Oliver Springs in 1909. Tapping a rich lode of folklore and oral tradition, along with other historical sources, Circling Windrock Mountain offers a view of Appalachian life that defies old stereotypes. Far from being static, the communities described here saw an amazing variety of changes to which they adapted with resilience and ingenuity. The Author: Augusta Grove Bell, a writer who now lives in Charlotte, North Carolina, has been a newspaper reporter and teacher. From 1958 to 1970, she lived in Anderson County, Tennessee, where she worked for the Oak Ridger and wrote feature stories that form much of the basis for this book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YICCaL68bQwC&dq=Circling+Windrock+Mountain:+Two+Hundred+Years+in+Appalachia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Joy of Living","description":"A New York Times Bestseller! For millennia, Buddhists have enjoyed the limitless benefits of meditation. But how does it work? And why? The principles behind this ancient practice have long eluded some of the best minds in modern science. Until now. In this groundbreaking work, world-renowned Buddhist teacher Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche invites us to join him in unlocking the secrets behind the practice of meditation. Working with neuroscientists at the Waisman Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior, Yongey Mingyur provides clear insights into modern research indicating that systematic training in meditation can enhance activity in areas of the brain associated with happiness and compassion. He has also worked with physicists across the country to develop a fresh, scientifically based interpretation of the Buddhist understanding of the nature of reality. With an infectious joy and insatiable curiosity, Yongey Mingyur weaves together the principles of Tibetan Buddhism, neuroscience, and quantum physics in a way that will forever change the way we understand the human experience. Using the basic meditation practices he provides, we can discover paths through everyday problems, transforming obstacles into opportunities to recognize the unlimited potential of our own minds. With a foreword by bestselling author Daniel Goleman, The Joy of Living is a stunning breakthrough, an illuminating vision of the science of Buddhism and a handbook for transforming our minds, bodies, and lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e2AK_aZDNWUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ann Pillsbury's Baking Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wWe_swEACAAJ&dq=Ann+Pillsbury%27s+Baking+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Season of Migration to the North","description":"After years of study in Europe, the young narrator of Season of Migration to the North returns to his village along the Nile in the Sudan. It is the 1960s, and he is eager to make a contribution to the new postcolonial life of his country. Back home, he discovers a stranger among the familiar faces of childhood the enigmatic Mustafa Sa eed. Mustafa takes the young man into his confidence, telling him the story of his own years in London, of his brilliant career as an economist, and of the series of fraught and deadly relationships with European women that led to a terrible public reckoning and his return to his native land. But what is the meaning of Mustafa s shocking confession? Mustafa disappears without explanation, leaving the young man whom he has asked to look after his wife in an unsettled and violent no-man s-land between Europe and Africa, tradition and innovation, holiness and defilement, and man and woman, from which no one will escape unaltered or unharmed. Season of Migration to the North is a rich and sensual work of deep honesty and incandescent lyricism.

The BE was easy to fly and very stable - but it was difficult to maneuver and very easy to shoot down. Tarrant Tabor - The Tabor was grotesque, a massive misfit of an experimental bomber that predictably came to grief on its first flight. Avro Manchester - The twin-engined Manchester would fly all the way to Berlin and back - only to burst into flames over its own base. Messerschmitt Me 210 - The Me 210 was developed as a successor to Goering's Destroyer, the Bf110. It was a disaster with a phenomenal accident rate. Martin B-26 Marauder - They called the B-26 the Widow-maker, fast and powerful, with some savage characteristics. Reichenberg IV - a manned version of the V-1 flying bomb, was a desperation weapon, its pilots intended to fly suicide missions against Allied shipping. Tu-144 - Rushed prematurely into its test program to beat the Anglo-French Concorde, the TU-144 was intended to be Russia's supersonic dream.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XpLHDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America: Pathways to the Present","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dLq_AAAACAAJ&dq=America:+Pathways+to+the+Present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gods, Demigods & Demons - An Encylopedia of Greek Mythology","description":"The essential guide to more than 540 supernatural figures of Greek mythology as well as notable mortals from Acantha the nymph to Zeus, king of the gods.

Joanne Punzo Waghorne highlights how the formal religious spaces-temples, churches, and mosques-have been confined to allotted sites on the map of Singapore, whereas various  spiritual  organizations, particularly of Hindu origins and headed by a guru, still continue to operate as  societies  classified by the government with other  clubs.  These unconventional religiosities are not confined but ironically make their own places, meeting in ostensive secular venues: high-rise flats, malls, businesses, and community centers, thus existing in the overall space of religion, commerce, and the state. The book argues that State of Singapore also operates between the secular and the religious, constructing an overarching spatial regime that both accommodates and yet rivals the alternate spheres that spiritual movements construct under its umbrella. Both spatial configurations challenge the presumed relationships between myth and reality, religion and commerce, the ethereal and the concrete, the sacred and the secular, on the levels of self, community, and polity. Singapore, now deemed a model for urban development in Asia, also offers an understanding of a new post-secularity and perhaps reveals where the urbanized world is headed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kobEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magic of Wheat Cookery: A Revolutionary New Cookbook: Over 300 Exciting Recipes Featuring the New Fantastic Time N' Motion Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BWmFsD0-JZoC&dq=The+Magic+of+Wheat+Cookery:+A+Revolutionary+New+Cookbook:+Over+300+Exciting+Recipes+Featuring+the+New+Fantastic+Time+N%27+Motion+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dumpling Soup","description":"Marisa gets to help make dumplings this year to celebrate the New Year.

The interception of the Zimmerman Telegram, the deciphering of the German Enigma machine, the Soviet's damaging penetration of the British Foreign Service through the \\"Cambridge Five\\" spy ring, and the U.S. counterintelligence coup known as Operation Venona (which remained classified until 1995) are just some of the dramatic episodes detailed here.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

She challenges the prevailing orthodoxy of Western historians to show how Moscow saw the presence of US troops in Europe in the 1940s and early 1950s as advantageous rather than as a check on Soviet ambitions. The author points to a complex web of concerns than fuelled Moscow's actions, and explores how the Soviet leadership, and Stalin in particular, responded to American policy. She shows how the Soviet experience of the United States and Europe, both before, during and after the Second World War, led Moscow to a policy that was not simply fuelled by anti-Americanism. Six chapters cover events from the wartime conferences of 1943 until the death of Stalin. A final chapter places the book in the context of the current debate over the causes of the Cold War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qXG8AAAAIAAJ&dq=Stalin%27s+Cold+War:+Soviet+Strategies+in+Europe,+1943+to+1956&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Teaching Art In Elementary Education","description":"This comprehensive, up-to-date art methods text presents fundamental theories, principles, creative approaches, and resources for art teaching in elementary through middle school.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G07WRd0Zn-EC&dq=Teaching+Art+In+Elementary+Education&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Autogeddon","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BQmIzgEACAAJ&dq=Autogeddon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hotel Du Lac","description":"In the novel that won her the Booker Prize and established her international reputation, Anita Brookner finds a new vocabulary for framing the eternal question \\"Why love?\\" It tells the story of Edith Hope, who writes romance novels under a psudonym.

Green examines the adjustments of Japanese foreign policy in the decade since the end of the Cold War. Green presents case studies of China, the Korean peninsula, Russia and Central Asia, Southeast Asia, the international financial institutions, and multilateral forums (the United Nations, APEC, and the ARF). In each of these studies, Green considers Japanese objectives; the effectiveness of Japanese diplomacy in achieving those objectives; the domestic and exogenous pressures on policy-making; the degree of convergence or divergence with the United States in both strategy and implementation; and lessons for more effective US - Japan diplomatic cooperation in the future. As Green notes, its bilateral relationship with the United States is at the heart of Japan's foreign policy initiatives, and Japan therefore conducts foreign policy with one eye carefully on Washington. However, Green argues, it is time to recognize Japan as an independent actor in Northeast Asia, and to assess Japanese foreign policy in its own terms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JgfQwAEACAAJ&dq=Japan%27s+Reluctant+Realism:+Foreign+Policy+Challenges+in+an+Era+of+Uncertain+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Passport Brazil (Passport to World)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fkTOysabnSEC&dq=Passport+Brazil+(Passport+to+World)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frommer's Portable Virgin Islands","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3rrWwQEACAAJ&dq=Frommer%27s+Portable+Virgin+Islands&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Burntwater","description":"In Navajo country, where the land is thick with legends and forgotten histories, a writer sets out to find a place that no longer exists except on a few old maps: Burntwater. The story opens when two friends get stuck in a remote pocket of the desert as a winter storm moves in. They are taking a wandering route across the Four Corners region, curving through Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona on a long arc into the mythic heart of the country. As they travel, the author calls up past experiences in this land where the past flows seamlessly into the present. He remembers a medicine man whose chanting could start the cold engine of a Volkswagen. He describes an act of sabotage against an oil company by two Vietnam vets armed with deer rifles. He recalls how a winter of herding sheep for a Navajo family and a search for a Hopi known as the Sun Chief led him further into a human landscape as strange and compelling as the terrain. This book takes the backroads, crossing the Colorado Plateau from the headwaters of the Virgin River to the mouth of the Dirty Devil, from the badlands below Twin Angels to a remote mesa in Bandelier. As the miles go by and the stories unfold, there is a growing sense of mystery, of words not spoken, of messages carried on the wind. Reaching the Shrine of the Stone Lions, the writer recounts a near-fatal descent into the Grand Canyon where he finds a way to reconnect with the beauty of life.

Examines the healing and ceremonial powers of the honeybee and the hive ? Reveals bee shamanism s system of acupuncture, which predates the Chinese systems ? Imparts teachings from the female tradition and explores the transformative powers of the magico-sexual elixirs they produce Bee shamanism may well be the most ancient and enigmatic branch of shamanism. It exists throughout the world--wherever in fact the honeybee exists. Its medicinal tools--such as honey, pollen, propolis, and royal jelly--are now in common usage, and even the origins of Chinese acupuncture can be traced back to the ancient practice of applying bee stings to the body s meridians. In this authoritative ethnography and spiritual memoir, Simon Buxton, an elder of the Path of Pollen, reveals for the first time the richness of this tradition: its subtle intelligence; its sights, sounds, and smells; and its unique ceremonies, which until now have been known only to initiates. Buxton unknowingly took his first steps on the Path of Pollen at age nine, when a neighbor--an Austrian bee shaman--cured him of a near-fatal bout of encephalitis. This early contact prepared him for his later meeting with an elder of the tradition who took him on as an apprentice. Following an intense initiation that opened him to the mysteries of the hive mind, Buxton learned over the next 13 years the practices, rituals, and tools of bee shamanism. He experienced the healing and spiritual powers of honey and other bee products, including the  flying ointment  once used by medieval witches, as well as ritual initiations with the female members of the tradition--the Mellisae--and the application of magico-sexual  nektars  that promote longevity and ecstasy. The Shamanic Way of the Bee is a rare view into the secret wisdom of this age-old tradition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=55aGvwEACAAJ&dq=The+Shamanic+Way+of+the+Bee:+Ancient+Wisdom+and+Healing+Practices+of+the+Bee+Masters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Resource Manual for a Living Revolution","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y1zaAAAAIAAJ&dq=Resource+Manual+for+a+Living+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Moonchild","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Scenes Beyond the Grave (Life After Death Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8WQOAAAACAAJ&dq=Scenes+Beyond+the+Grave+(Life+After+Death+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Their Own Words - WWII: The European Theater (Topics Entertainment-History (CD))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ic3aAAAAMAAJ&dq=In+Their+Own+Words+-+WWII:+The+European+Theater+(Topics+Entertainment-History+(CD))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Eye of Shiva: Eastern Mysticism and Science","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DHPXAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Eye+of+Shiva:+Eastern+Mysticism+and+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"10 Reasons to Abolish the IMF & World Bank (Open Media Series)","description":"A veritable \\"Globalization for Dummies,\\" 10 Reasons to Abolish the IMF & World Banklays bare the most common myths of globalization in a clear and understandable way.

Conceived as an effort to educate the public about how international institutions of \\"free trade\\" are widening the gap between the rich and poor globally, Danaher reveals how the lending policies of the IMF and the World Bank fail to benefit Third World peoples, and instead line the pockets of undemocratic rulers and western corporations while threatening local democracies and forcing cuts to social programs. Through anecdotes, analysis, and innovative ideas, Danaher argues that the IMF and the World Bank undermine our most basic democratic values, and calls for reframing the terms on which international economic institutions are operated using the principles of environmental sustainability, social justice, and human rights.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WDKSqU84dOkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Demon Circle","description":"One man tries to escape his past by moving to a friendly, small town, only to discover the same coven of devil worshippers who murdered his wife years before.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9n4GAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Demon+Circle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Australian flower paintings of Ferdinand Bauer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_mY3uwAACAAJ&dq=The+Australian+flower+paintings+of+Ferdinand+Bauer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Urban transportation planning in the United States: An historical overview : final report","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OC2fRmF6IqIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Antique Roses for the South","description":"\\"Belinda's Dream\\", \\"Katy Road Pink\\" and \\"Georgetown Tea.\\" The names alone evoke images of glorious cottage gardens and arching trellises laden with perfumed blossoms.

Eisenhower's Highway Act sought to strengthen America with the sort of roads system and military advantage Germany's Autobahn provided in World War II; Kennedy looked to space, the Peace Corps, and the schools to improve America's actual and perceived status in the eyes of the world; LBJ continually found concerns about Southeast Asia pressing in upon him notwithstanding his desire to found a new Great Society in the United States. However, despite the Cold War and demands of international politics, these three presidents were continually involved in critical debates about the domestic future of America, and their roles and victories in these debates have left deep impressions upon American society. This volume provides readers with access to the primary documents both foreign and domestic that reflect the debates that have had such a strong influence in shaping the United States. This resource covers thirty-two key issues and initiatives of the Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson presidencies. An introductory overview of each president's administration provides a useful window through which to assess the specific debates and documents addressed, and each of these individual issues is also supplemented by a brief introductory discussion. Among the issues covered are: Eisenhower's attempt to establish a new look for national defense, the Eisenhower doctrine, and the National Defense Education Act; Kennedy's Alliance for Progress and Peace Corps programs, his role in Cuba, his plans for America in space, and his work on arms control and the Limited Test Ban Treaty; and Johnson's Civil Rights Act, Model Cities Program, war on poverty, and role in the ground and air wars in Vietnam. A timeline provides a chronological backdrop for the subject, and recommended readings following each section offer helpful direction for further study.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QsIdCSALXGsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Almost Remembered (Almost Texas) (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 867)","description":"15th Anniversary Celebrating fifteen years of romance Silhouette INTIMATE MOMENTS ALMOST, TEXAS WOMAN WITHOUT A MEMORY There were some things Allison Leary couldn't remember, but her memories of Chas Jamison was clear.

At the core of the book are discrete literary studies of Scotland and Shakespeare, Walter Scott, R.L. Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle, the modern Scottish Renaissance of the 1920s and more recent cultural and literary phenomena. The central theme of literature and popular 'representation' recontextualises literary analysis in a broader, multi-faceted picture involving all the arts and the changing sense of what 'the popular' might be in a modern nation. New technologies alter forms of cultural production and the book charts a way through these forms, from oral poetry and song to the novel, and includes studies of paintings, classical music, socialist drama, TV, film and comic books. The international context for mass media cultural production is examined as the story of the intrinsic curiosity of the imagination and the intensely local aspect of Scotland's cultural self-representation unfolds.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=63qJDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nothing Routine","description":"\\"Nothing Routine\\" is a collection of travel essays that span four continents and five different methods of travel. \\"The storylines are compelling and often harrowing, and the work has a wonderful blend of humor, insight, self-deprecation, and reflection.\\" --Carolyn Kott Washburne, adjunct assistant professor, Department of English, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DxGxPAAACAAJ&dq=Nothing+Routine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"News from the New American Diaspora: and Other Tales of Exile (Literary Modernism)","description":"Publisher Description","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rd5lAAAAMAAJ&dq=News+from+the+New+American+Diaspora:+and+Other+Tales+of+Exile+(Literary+Modernism)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Workplace Wars and How to End Them: Turning Personal Conflicts into Productive Teamwork","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Bride's Money Book: How to Have a Champagne Wedding on a Ginger-Ale Budget","description":"Shows how to plan an affordable wedding, suggesting elegant alternatives to expensive choices","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MzMctfV01T0C&dq=The+Bride%27s+Money+Book:+How+to+Have+a+Champagne+Wedding+on+a+Ginger-Ale+Budget&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The thirteenth resolution","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uqCTHAAACAAJ&dq=The+thirteenth+resolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Graphical Pitcher 2005","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ju_ZPAAACAAJ&dq=Graphical+Pitcher+2005&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Perricone Promise: Look Younger, Live Longer in Three Easy Steps","description":"Through superfoods, nutritional supplements, and state-of-the-art topical applications, the \\"New York Times\\" bestselling author of \\"The Wrinkle Cure\\" presents an astonishing program to reverse the aging process, inside and out.

In Our Fire Survives the Storm, Daniel Heath Justice traces the expression of Cherokee identity in that nation s literary tradition. Through cycles of war and peace, resistance and assimilation, trauma and regeneration, Cherokees have long debated what it means to be Cherokee through protest writings, memoirs, fiction, and retellings of traditional stories. Justice employs the Chickamauga consciousness of resistance and Beloved Path of engagement theoretical approaches that have emerged out of Cherokee social history to interpret diverse texts composed in English, a language embraced by many as a tool of both access and defiance. Justice s analysis ultimately locates the Cherokees as a people of many perspectives, many bloods, mingled into a collective sense of nationhood. Just as the oral traditions of the Cherokee people reflect the living realities and concerns of those who share them, Justice concludes, so too is their literary tradition a textual testament to Cherokee endurance and vitality.

But it is also a deeply troubled one, on the verge of financial collapse. Within 15 years Social Security will begin running a deficit. Overall, the program is more than $26 trillion in debt. Without fundamental reform it will not be able to pay the benefits it has promised to our children and grandchildren. That has prompted the most far-reaching discussion of the purpose and structure of Social Security since the program was enacted in 1935. Not so very long ago, Social Security was rightly regarded as the  third rail  of American politics touch it and your career dies. But no longer. Polls today show that the vast majority of Americans support proposals that would allow younger workers to privately invest at least part of their Social Security taxes through individual accounts. For more than 25 years the Cato Institute has led the debate for Social Security reform, arguing that the program is fundamentally flawed and calling for greater freedom and choice for working Americans. Social Security and Its Discontents represents the best of Cato s publications on the issue. It includes essays by the nation s top economists and Social Security experts, discussing Social Security s finances; the urgent need for reform; how the program treats women, minorities, and low-income workers; and the options for reform. Edited by Michael D. Tanner, this collection is essential reading for anyone who cares about what kind of country we will leave to our children and grandchildren.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rWOQAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essentials of Obstetrics and Gynaecology for Clinical Officers and Midwives: Vol. I: OBSTETRICS","description":"A Medical book, on Gynaecology and Family Planning, mainly for medical personnel but also useful to the general public.

Acclaimed as the Julia Child of Mexican cooking, Kennedy has been an intrepid, indefatigable student of Mexican foodways for more than fifty years and has published several classic books on the subject, including The Cuisines of Mexico (now available in The Essential Cuisines of Mexico, a compilation of her first three books), The Art of Mexican Cooking, My Mexico, and From My Mexican Kitchen. Her uncompromising insistence on using the proper local ingredients and preparation techniques has taught generations of cooks how to prepare and savor the delicious, subtle, and varied tastes of Mexico. In Oaxaca al Gusto, Kennedy takes us on an amazing journey into one of the most outstanding and colorful cuisines in the world. The state of Oaxaca is one of the most diverse in Mexico, with many different cultural and linguistic groups, often living in areas difficult to access. Each group has its own distinctive cuisine, and Diana Kennedy has spent many years traveling the length and breadth of Oaxaca to record in words and photographs \\"these little-known foods, both wild and cultivated, the way they were prepared, and the part they play in the daily or festive life of the communities I visited.\\" Oaxaca al Gusto is the fruit of these labors and the culmination of Diana Kennedy's life's work. Organized by regions, Oaxaca al Gusto presents some three hundred recipes most from home cooks for traditional Oaxacan dishes. Kennedy accompanies each recipe with fascinating notes about the ingredients, cooking techniques, and the food's place in family and communal life. Lovely color photographs illustrate the food and its preparation. A special feature of the book is a chapter devoted to the three pillars of the Oaxacan regional cuisines chocolate, corn, and chiles. Notes to the cook, a glossary, a bibliography, and an index complete the volume. An irreplaceable record of the infinite world of Oaxacan gastronomy, Oaxaca al Gusto belongs on the shelf of everyone who treasures the world's traditional regional cuisines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CtaIQAZIbG8C&dq=The+Educator%27s+Guide+to+Texas+School+Law:+Sixth+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Skateboarding","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dancers in the Dark","description":"The #1 New York Times bestselling author of the beloved Sookie Stackhouse novels brings you a reader-favorite tale of passion and terror in a classic paranormal romance.

This takes energy. If fossil fuels continue to be the key source of energy their waste product, carbon dioxide, will produce disagreeable changes in the climate. Depletion of fossil fuels will cause the cost of energy and fuel based chemicals to spiral. Climate change and high fuel prices will thwart these aspirations and will increase the probability of lethal international conflicts over energy supplies. We must stop using fossil fuels. Optimistically, we could switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources (solar, wind, etc.). Regrettably these sources are difficult to harvest and unreliable. They cannot, alone, serve as a base load energy supply for humanity. Fission nuclear power yields extremely hazardous waste for which no fully agreeable disposal method has been developed. Laurence Williams applied aerospace systems analysis techniques to seek a new energy system. An End to Global Warming presents his results. He shows why we must stop using fossil fuels and evaluates a host of alternatives to arrive at a robust energy system that will modernize world energy production and protect the environment. A by-product of this system will ameliorate problems associated with supplying potable water and in processing waste. The nations that develop the system described in An End to Global Warming will be gifted with huge financial reward and the pride in knowing that they have preserved the earth for all mankind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TJtSdZktaqkC&dq=An+End+to+Global+Warming&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ralph Waldo Emerson: Essays and Journals (The Programmed Classics)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sMogQAAACAAJ&dq=Ralph+Waldo+Emerson:+Essays+and+Journals+(The+Programmed+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dolls and Accessories of the 1950s","description":"Dolls and Accessories of the 1950s contains over 590 color photographs of dolls made of hard plastic and vinyl, and accessories produced for these dolls during the 1950s.

After more than a dozen moves in twenty-five years of marriage, Joanna Harrison is lonely and tired of being a corporate wife. Her children are grown and gone, her husband is more married to his job than to her, and now they're about to pack up once more. Panicked at the thought of having to start all over again, Joanna commits the first irresponsible act of her life. She runs away to Pawleys Island, South Carolina, a place she's been to just once. She finds a job as a live-in companion to Grace Finelli, a widow who has come to the island to fulfill a girlhood dream. Together the two women embark on the most difficult journey of their lives: Joanna struggling for independence, roots, and a future of her own, as her family tugs at her from afar; and Grace, choosing to live the remainder of her life for herself alone, knowing she may never see her children again. Entwined is Paul Harrison's story as he loses his wife, his job, and everything that defines him as a man. He takes off on his own journey out west, searching for the answers to all that has gone wrong in his life. One thing remains constant: He wants his wife back. Joanna, however, is moving farther away from her old life as she joins a group dedicated to rescuing endangered loggerhead turtles, led by a charismatic fisherman unlike anyone she's ever met. The Richest Season is a stunning debut about three very different people, each changing their lives when such transformations are usually long over.

It does so with a story that features a surprising and beguiling romance between an adventurous British trader and a young island girl, against a background of increasing and mysterious hostility. Are the native islanders plotting against the couple, or is it the other white traders? The result is a denouement that is astonishing in its violence. Told in the unadorned voice of the trader, it is a story that deftly combines the form of the exotic adventure yarn with the moral and psychological questing of great fiction. The Art of The Novella Series Too short to be a novel, too long to be a short story, the novella is generally unrecognized by academics and publishers.

My name is Rowan Gant. I'm a Witch with an unfortunate gift-I can hear the voices of the dead. Not just any dead, mind you. I hear the spirits of murder victims. Personally, I think of it as a curse. The cops, on the other hand, consider my uncommon talent an invaluable investigative tool, which is why I often work for them as a consultant. Too often, unfortunately, and believe me, it is taking a serious toll... Just over one year ago I was called in to help the Major Case Squad track down Eldon Andrew Porter, a spree killer determined to resurrect the Witch hunts, trials, and executions of the 15th century. He left a string of tortured bodies and screaming souls in his wake, and then he turned his violent attentions to me. Fortunately, I survived our face-to-face encounter, though just barely. After that, Porter disappeared-vanished without a trace-and he stayed that way. Until now, that is... Eldon Porter is not the kind of fanatical sociopath who simply gives up, and to be honest, I never believed he would. I've been expecting this all along. Now he is intent on giving me a one-way ticket to Hell, with an extended preview right here on Earth. But he should make no mistake-if I'm going, I have absolutely no intention of taking the trip alone. If I have to kill him before he kills me, I will. Whatever it takes, I am going to end this...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_hQDAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Law+of+Three:+A+Rowan+Gant+Investigation+(Rowan+Gant+Investigations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Latent Variable Models: An Introduction to Factor, Path, and Structural Analysis","description":"This book provides an introduction to a rapidly-growing area in the social and behavioral sciences -- the modeling of systems in which one or more variables are hypothesized, but not directly observed.

Through a exploration of twenty-six selected battles, military historian Brian Todd Carey surveys the changing tactical relationships between the four weapon systems - heavy and light infantry and hevay and light cavalry - focusing on how shock and missile combat evolved from tentative beginnings in the Bronze Age to the highly developed military organization created by the Romans. The art of warfare reached a very sophisticated level of development during this three millenia span. Commanders fully realized the tactical capabilities of shock and missile combat in large battlefield situations. Modern principles of war, like the primacy of the offensive, mass, and economy of force, were understood by pre-modern generals and applied on battlefields throughout the period. Through the use of dozens of multiphase tactical maps, this fascinating introduction to the art of war during western civilization?s ancient and classical periods pulls together the primary and secondary sources and creates a powerful historical narrative. The result is a synthetic work that will be essential reading for students and armchair historians alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kuSfBwAAQBAJ&dq=Warfare+in+the+Ancient+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dylan Thomas in America: An intimate journal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i2xbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Dylan+Thomas+in+America:+An+intimate+journal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"RECORDS OF EMIGRANTS FROM ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND TO NORTH CAROLINA, 1774-1775.

Set against this vivid backdrop, The Last Summer (of You and Me) is the enchanting, heartrending story of a beach-community friendship triangle and summertime romance among three young adults for whom summer and this place have meant everything. Sisters Riley and Alice, now in their twenties, have been returning to their parents  modest beach house every summer for their entire lives. Petite, tenacious Riley is a tomboy and a lifeguard, always ready for a midnight swim, a gale-force sail, or a barefoot sprint down the beach. Beautiful Alice is lithe, gentle, a reader and a thinker, and worshipful of her older sister. And every summer growing up, in the big house that overshadowed their humble one, there was Paul, a friend as important to both girls as the place itself, who has now finally returned to the island after three years away. But his return marks a season of tremendous change, and when a simmering attraction, a serious illness, and a deep secret all collide, the three friends are launched into an unfamiliar adult world, a world from which their summer haven can no longer protect them. Ann Brashares has won millions of fans with her blockbuster series, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, in which she so powerfully captured the emotional complexities of female friendship and young love. With The Last Summer (of You and Me), she moves on to introduce a new set of characters and adult relationships just as true, endearing, and unforgettable. With warmth, humor, and wisdom, Brashares makes us feel the excruciating joys and pangs of love both platonic and romantic. She reminds us of the strength and sting of friendship, the great ache of loss, and the complicated weight of family loyalty. Thoughtful, lyrical, and tremendously moving, The Last Summer (of You and Me is a deeply felt celebration of summer and nostalgia for youth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kDIp8-Y7z78C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Striking Out","description":"Up until now, Billy Baggs's life has been loaded with nevers.

It attempts nothing short of assembling the countless puzzle pieces that answer the questions: Why am I here? Is there a spiritual purpose to life? What is the connection between centuries-old spiritual teachings and recent scientific discoveries? What are the spiritual laws of manifestation? How can I use them to bring happiness and success while achieving spiritual unfoldment? For Ford Johnson, solving this puzzle has been his life's quest. He is first and foremost a \\"God-seeker,\\" one who yearns to understand the mysteries of life. To be successful in this search, he had to discover and assemble scattered pieces of truth through an investigation that was broad in scope and deep in scale. The result is a work that is as much a journey for the reader as it was for the author -- an astounding journey to higher consciousness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IfgEAAAACAAJ&dq=Confessions+of+a+God+Seeker:+A+Journey+to+Higher+Consciousness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Smell Culture Reader","description":"Here is a much-needed overview of what is arguably our most elusive sense.

But how did they come to be here? What were their agricultural, spiritual, and hunting practices? How did their societies evolve and what challenges do they face today? Eminent historians Theda Perdue and Michael Green begin by describing how nomadic bands of hunter-gatherers followed the bison and woolly mammoth over the Bering land mass between Asia and what is now Alaska between 25,000 and 15,000 years ago, settling throughout North America. They describe hunting practices among different tribes, how some made the gradual transition to more settled, agricultural ways of life, the role of kinship and cooperation in Native societies, their varied burial rites and spiritual practices, and many other features of Native American life. Throughout the book, Perdue and Green stress the great diversity of indigenous peoples in America, who spoke more than 400 different languages before the arrival of Europeans and whose ways of life varied according to the environments they settled in and adapted to so successfully. Most importantly, the authors stress how Native Americans have struggled to maintain their sovereignty--first with European powers and then with the United States--in order to retain their lands, govern themselves, support their people, and pursue practices that have made their lives meaningful. Going beyond the stereotypes that so often distort our views of Native Americans, this Very Short Introduction offers a historically accurate, deeply engaging, and often inspiring account of the wide array of Native peoples in America. About the Series: Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, Very Short Introductions offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UoEcHdhIt5oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tools for Structured Design: An Introduction to Programming Logic","description":"The author's objective is to analyze a problem and express its solution in such a way that the computer can be directed to follow the problem-solving procedure.

The first goal is to explore the difference between fairness and justice in language assessment. The authors distinguish internal and external dimensions of the equitable and just treatment of individuals taking language tests which are used as gatekeeping devices to determine access to education and employment, immigrant status, citizenship, and other rights. The second goal is to show how the extent of test fairness can be demonstrated and improved using the tools of psychometrics, in particular the models collectively known as Rasch measurement.  This book will have an enormous impact on the field of language assessment. Using Rasch analysis models to explore and identify sources of unfairness, the authors make a compelling case for fairness in the design and implementation of language assessment instruments and for justice in the interpretation and use of test results.

The cops, on the other hand, consider my uncommon talent an invaluable investigative tool, which is why I often work for them as a consultant. Too often, unfortunately, and believe me, it is taking a serious toll... Just over one year ago I was called in to help the Major Case Squad track down Eldon Andrew Porter, a spree killer determined to resurrect the Witch hunts, trials, and executions of the 15th century.

To some authors the main features of gnosticism--belief in a secret revelation available only to an initiated elite, rejection of the physical world, and escape into the self--seemed reminiscent of modern cult groups and secular movements. However, Philip Lee, noting that most of the early gnostics were firmly ensconced within the Church, locates modern gnosticism within the Protestant establishment itself. \\"As a Protestant, I believe I have identified the elusive modern gnostics and they are ourselves,\\" he writes. In this penetrating and provocative assessment of the current state of religion and its effect on values in society at large, Lee criticizes conservatives and liberals alike as he traces gnostic motifs to the very roots of American Protestantism. With references to an extraordinary spectrum of writings from sources as diverse as John Calvin, Martin Buber, Tom Wolfe, Margaret Atwood and Emily Dickinson among many others, he probes the effects of gnostic thinking on issues ranging from politics to feminism, from ecology to parenthood. The ethical ramifications of such a gnostic turn have been negative and frightening, he maintains. The book points to positive ways of restoring health to endangered Protestant churches. Calling for the restoration of a dialectical faith and practice, Lee offers an agenda for reform, including a renewal of obedience to the scriptures and an affirmation of life and creation within the circle of the extended family.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ulT5DAAAQBAJ&dq=Against+the+Protestant+Gnostics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Human Cathedrals","description":"John Sweet's lean and muscular poetry causes a lot of excitement, evident by his long publications list and a series of earnest and diverse chapbooks.

Few controversies continue to stir as much emotion as this one, and public confusion is often the result. This volume brings together seven experts--judges, lawyers, prosecutors, and philosophers--to debate the death penalty in a spirit of open inquiry and civil discussion. Here, as the contributors present their reasons for or against capital punishment, the multiple facets of the issue are revealed in clear and thought-provoking detail. Is the death penalty a viable deterrent to future crimes? Does the imposition of lesser penalties, such as life imprisonment, truly serve justice in cases of the worst offences? Does the legal system discriminate against poor or minority defendants? Is the possibility of executing innocent persons sufficient grounds for abolition? In confronting such questions and making their arguments, the contributors marshal an impressive array of evidence, both statistical and from their own experiences working on death penalty cases. The book also includes the text of Governor George Ryan's March 2002 speech in which he explained why he had commuted the sentences of all prisoners on Illinois's death row. By representing the viewpoints of experts who face the vexing questions about capital punishment on a daily basis, Debating the Death Penalty makes a vital contribution to a more nuanced understanding of the moral and legal problems underlying this controversy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0HrLcIS-shoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Going Once","description":"From New York Times bestselling author Sharon Sala.

His scrupulous attention to facts and details, combined with his eloquence, poetic style, and moral energy, convey a spirited sense of reality. The dramatic narrative is populated by vivid characterizations of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, Mirabeau, Danton, Robespierre, Lafayette, Marat, and other heroes and villains of the era. \\"No novelist has made his creations live for us more thoroughly than Carlyle has made the men of the French Revolution,\\" observed George Eliot. In his company, the scenes of the Revolution are plainly visible, and the pages of this book offer a walk through the streets of 18th-century Paris with a well-informed guide.

The Boston Red Sox. For a hundred years, no two teams have locked horns as fiercely or as frequently  and no two seasons frame the colossal battle more perfectly than 2003 and 2004. Now, with incredible energy and access, leading sports columnist Mike Vaccaro chronicles the history of the greatest rivalry in sports, and the two stunning American League Championship Series that define a century of baseball. October 17, 2003: A night no Yankees or Red Sox fan will ever forget. At 12:15 am, bottom of the eleventh inning of game seven of the ALCS, New York third-baseman Aaron Boone launches a ball over Yankee Stadium s left-field fence. The Yankees win their 39th pennant  and send the perennially vexed Boston Red Sox home . . . again . . . suffering another devastating loss to their longtime nemesis. October 20, 2004: A year later, an eerie reprise  but this time things are different. After losing three straight to the Yankees, Boston has charged back to win the next three, forcing a decisive game seven. From the start of the game Boston is in control, and by winning this game they march toward their first World Series victory since 1918. These two explosive years define an extraordinary, epic rivalry  from Mariano Rivera and Roger Clemens to Pedro Martinez and Curt Schilling, Derek Jeter and Aaron Boone to David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez, from nearly a century of Yankee domination to the undisputed breaking of  The Curse.  With the razor-sharp instincts that have made him a top sports journalist, Mike Vaccaro delves into the history of the rollicking rivalry: a vicious collision in 1903 (between the New York Highlanders and Boston Pilgrims) that draws first blood; the era of Babe Ruth and his legendary trade from the Red Sox to the Yankees, ushering in the notorious Curse; the golden age of DiMaggio and Williams; the unstoppable power of Mantle and Maris; the heart and soul of Fisk and Yazstremski versus Pinella and Munson; and the modern era of dueling owners, skyrocketing payrolls, and a renewed rivalry that attracts sell-out crowds even to Yankees-Red Sox spring training games.

After the Second World War, it stayed involved, helping to preserve freedom in half of Europe, and creating an infrastructure of global governance that gave the world a remarkable half century of (for the most part) peace and prosperity. In Cousins and Strangers, Chris Patten, one of Europe's most distinguished statesmen, scrutinizes the final years of the twentieth century and how the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 fundamentally changed the nature of this Western alliance. Today, the threat of terrorism, economic competition from Asia, and a seemingly unbridgeable cultural divide have strained the alliance to a moment of reckoning. Patten argues that America's status as the only superpower must be reined in, but he also warns Europe against too ardently challenging U.S. leadership. He questions whether Britain needs to choose between bolstering its \\"special relationship\\" with the United States and forging a greater role in a united Europe. Drawing on more than three decades of experience in government and international diplomacy, Patten brilliantly investigates the three-way relationship among Britain, Europe, and America and how all three must adapt to cope with the economic and political challenges of the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_c66AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lettered City (Post-Contemporary Interventions)","description":"Nineteenth-Century Spanish America: A Cultural History provides a panoramic and accessible introduction to the era in which Latin America took its first steps into the Modern Age. Including colorful characters like circus clowns, prostitutes, bullfighters, street puppeteers, and bestselling authors, this book maps vivid and often surprising combinations of the new and the old, the high and the low, and the political and the cultural. Christopher Conway shows that beneath the diversity of the New World there was a deeper structure of shared patterns of cultural creation and meaning. Whether it be the ways that people of refinement from different countries used the same rules of etiquette, or how commoners shared their stories through the same types of songs, Conway creates a multidisciplinary framework for understanding the culture of an entire hemisphere. The book opens with key themes that will help students and scholars understand the century, such as the civilization and barbarism binary, urbanism, the divide between conservatives and liberals, and transculturation. In the chapters that follow, Conway weaves transnational trends together with brief case studies and compelling snapshots that help us understand the period. How much did books and photographs cost in the nineteenth century? What was the dominant style in painting? What kinds of ballroom dancing were popular? Richly illustrated with striking photographs and lithographs, this is a book that invites the reader to rediscover a past age that is not quite past, still resonating into the present.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H3eiCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bishopric: A Handbook on Creating Episcopacy in the African-American Pentecostal Church","description":"The Bishopric: A Handbook on Creating Episcopacy in the African-American Pentecostal Church addresses the need for assistance and training for the proliferated Episcopacy within the African-American community.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6JMuxEE63BUC&dq=The+Bishopric:+A+Handbook+on+Creating+Episcopacy+in+the+African-American+Pentecostal+Church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nursing Baby","description":"For more than 40 years, mothers have depended on the wisdomand warmth of Nursing Your Baby.
