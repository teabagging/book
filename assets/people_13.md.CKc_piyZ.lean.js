Also, both are really more like tragic character studies with a few funny scenes thrown in to keep you from falling into a depressive stupor as the characters' lives spiral downward.I came to read this novel after hearing so much about how hilarious it is. For sure, the narrative, and in particular, I.J. Reilly's character hooked me into wanting to read more. But gut-busting-funny it was not. For one, the main character is an extremely odious and dis-likable person that just made me want to punch something every time he opened his mouth. Secondly, all the supporting characters are just as tragic and fairly dis-likable themselves (except maybe Jones or Angelo, who are merely pathetic). I guess you could consider it a mark of writing genius that such an attention-getting story was crafted from such horrible people, although I suppose its success may depend largely on readers who enjoy others' misfortunes?In any case, there isn't much plot to speak of. This novel is more like a study of people's lives, and follows several characters around on their various misadventures, and how their lives all connect at some point. If you're looking for a fast-paced or action-driven story, this isn't it. The characters themselves are completely fascinating, and it's worth reading, if for no other reason than to get into the world of some truly bizarre and train-wreck-like people. I felt like the ending was abbreviated, but it's possible the author had intended to write more episodes in I.J. Reilly's life at some point.Overall, I gave this book three stars mainly for false advertising. It's actually a pretty tragic novel, and I wasn't really prepared for a bit of melancholy right before bed. Also, I really disliked the characters, and it's hard to enjoy a book when you hate what you're reading. And while it was not particularly explicit, it was rather vulgar and suggestive at parts, and that can be a turn-off for anyone who leans toward more tasteful material. Worth reading once, if you have a strong stomach."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I saw a review trashing this book, calling it a sedative. When I read it a few weeks ago, I found it amusing here and there most of the way. But I was not deeply impressed, most of the way. The obstacle, for me, was that Ignatius Reilly's behavior was too absurd to identify with. He could not be real to me.At some point, late in the book, I permitted Toole to impose his universe on mine and it all became Theater of the Absurd (which does not work unless one yields to the playwright). Then, the book became hysterically funny. I am a school bus driver and was up in Golden Gate Canyon (northwest of Denver) alone for the better part of seven hours. Toole's book was my companion. There is a scene in the book, the last scene with Dr. Talc. It took me about half an hour to read a simple paragraph in that scene because I was laughing so hard, I had to keep putting the book down. There was a single sentence which brought on three separate paroxysms of laughter, doubling me over. I had to work my diaphragm with my fists to force air into my lungs. Two hours later, I went back and read that paragraph and it started all over again."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I gave this book four stars only because I felt that, while it's considered a modern classic, the writing lost some tension in places. The ending was also a bit over-simplified, but actually its simplicity makes for a charming, romantic spin on a book that would otherwise be a scatching satire of the working-class overweight man-child who still lives at home (and has an axe to grind about everything and everyone).This book has a reputation for being funny, and that it definitely is, however, probably the most salient feature of this book is John Kennedy Toole's mastery over dialouge. From the \\"vagran\\" African-American porter Jones who works at the Night of Joy to crazy, insane, deluded protagonist Ignatius, to commie sex-positive lecturer-in-training Mryna Minkoff (\\"the musky minx\\"), Toole hits these voices pitch perfect every time.If you are a fan of Tom Robbins and his masterful dialogue and surrealistic satires and adventures, you will probably enjoy this book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I started reading this book and could not put it down. The story is captivating and the characters are compelling, original and, of course, hilarious! An absolute scream. I practically wet myself with delirious laughter!I am going to buy a copy of this book for all of my friends this coming holiday. Laughter is the best medicine and CoD delivers them by the truckload.I particularly loved Toole's depictions of: morbidly obese sneaky misanthropic dishonest middle-aged misfits unable to function in society; women as uneducated gold-diggers, bullied into submissive, subservient roles by their sons or employers; African Americans as foul-mouthed, lazy, viscious and scheming malcontents; Hispanics as spineless and clueless; old people as surly and senile; and of course, homosexuals as prancing foppish leather queens.Man alive! I just can't decide what's best about this book: the parade of cultural stereotypes or the chronicle of a hero who has turned his life into a train wreck. They're both great! This is good old-fashioned American humor at its best. I think we can all agree on that -- Maury and Jerry aren't living on thousand acre estates for nothing. Am I right? Huh!? C'mon - don't leave me hanging!It's a shame we'll see no more quality writing from this author. The Pulitzer was hardly enough! A Nobel Prize would scarcely do justice to this wonderful and timeless contribution to English literature. Confederacy of Dunces should be mandatory reading for all students, everywhere. At each and every grade level. There should be degree programs offered at the Masters and PhD level focusing solely on developing a greater comprehension of this tome, this Rosetta Stone of human behavior.A gospel, really. The foundation of a new religion, that we could devote our lives to. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and L. Ron were hacks! We could all memorize quotes and passages from CoD that would be relevant to particular aspects of our lives that would guide us in our daily living and bolster us when times got tough. We could petition our state legislatures to change their license plate slogans to \\"What Would Ignatius Do?\\" or simply \\"WWID?\\"Buy this book! You won't be disappointed! I'd give it 10 stars if I could. And if you wouldn't, yourself, it's probably because you're humorless."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is incredibly written, and it's hard not to appreciate its clever dialogue, interesting characters and crazy story. The protagonist is Ignatius J. Reilly, a 30-year-old man who lives with his mother in New Orleans. Ignatius basically wastes time and takes advantage of his mother all while constantly complaining that he has been mistreated by others. Ignatius manages to get into all sorts of complicated situations, from getting arrested to selling hot dogs to working at the Levi company. The whole story is a fantastical masterpiece and you have to marvel at the author's creativity.That said, I wasn't as engaged in this book as I thought I would be, and I think it's because it's difficult to sympathize with almost any of the characters. They all have good qualities, but sometimes I found myself getting annoyed at their irritating foibles and habits. It's a funny story, but when you're not invested in the people involved it's tough to care about what happens to them."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is one of the best written, funniest books I have ever read. I have read it twice.

If you have read this book and feel that it deserves less than 5 stars, you deserve a sound lashing with a lute string."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have not read thousands of books. Not even hundreds. But I know an exceptional book when I read it. To me the fact that this book kept me from putting it down even when I was exhausted from my day was proof enough. You will not find such a great gathering of characters with such distinct and original peronalities in any other novel. A true gem. Ignatius J. Reilly will not be forgotten for as long as I live. I can only thank Thelma Toole for not letting her son's work go to waste."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I came across this Pulitzer Prize winner for $3 at a used book store. The title was enough to catch my eye, as I vaguely recognized it from a Swift quote.In the inside cover I found the [true] story behind the novel and was hooked - penned by a recluse, hidden in an attic, author committed suicide, years later mother takes manuscript to skeptical English professor who ends up publishing it, novel wins posthumous Pulitzer.What a great book. Our hero is a cross between Holden Caulfield and Don Quixote, with a touch of Rodney Dangerfield thrown in. His rididulously bombastic manner makes for a hilarious read; I haven't laughed out loud like this since parts of Angela's Ashes. Although he does absolutely nothing to earn it, you find yourself slightly endeared to Ignatius J Reilly. Top five funniest books I've ever read. Markedly ahead of its time; could have easily been written 2 years ago instead of 40."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"\\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is far from a perfect book. In reality, it probably is not a finished product. John Kennedy Toole perfectly captured the character of the morbidly obese hemorrhoid of man that is fly in the soup of so many people. Though the story meanders at times, it is a wildly entertaining, fast-paced read.A virtual vagrant in his mother's house, Ignatius Reilly is sucked into the mire of New Orleans when he is forced to leave the comforts of his own room. Feasting on snack cakes, the frustrated scholar sees himself as being above the fray. Ignatius fails to notice that he contributes to the problem as much as anybody. His misadventures take him into unique situations, creating laughable scenarios. Still, no part of the book is as hilarious as the vile diatribes against perceived offensive elements of society.The supporting charcters are often stereotypical and often slow the progress of the story. This is also the case when Ignatius hurdles into one of his proselytizing letters. The reader is eager to get back to the misadventure of Ignatius. Still, it is remarkable how it all ties together in the conclusion.Many have failed to find the humor in this book because they know an Ignatius J. Reilly-type and empathize with the character in the book. No humorous attempt will get an consensus response. I can not imagine disliking this work."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I've read about this book for years. I've probably stood in a bookstore and read the forward (by Walker Percy) half a dozen times. Finally, a copy came my way in a used bookstore, and it was cheap enough that I felt I shouldn't resist. Turns out I was right, and I could have spent a lot more money without wasting it.Ignatius J. Reilly, the main character of this outrageous masterpiece, is something unique to me in literature. I'm struck how in his own way he's similar to Holden Caufield, the protagonist of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\". Both are completely alienated from society around them, both completely misunderstand their surroundings and the world they live in, and both have a rather perverse view of life and what they want out of it. Reilly, though, is older, has a college degree (you wonder how he got it) and a more formed, if twisted, view of life. He won't ride in the front passenger seat of a car (because it's a \\"deathtrap\\"), is terrified of Greyhound Scenicruisers (once spent a trip to Baton Rouge in one, sick out of his mind), and is a history major who against all the evidence believes that the advent of the Reformation and the Renaissance, and the Enlightenment afterwords, were the beginning of the downfall of World society. He actually wants to start a Divine Right political party, so that someone can be crowned hereditary and unlimited ruler of America. He habitually drinks Dr. Nut, an amaretto-flavored soft drink available in New Orleans (where all this takes place) in the sixties. He blunders through life, bellowing strange pronouncements in a weirdly dignified, pompous voice that is somehow charming and bewildering at the same time. He's definitely an original.The book's plot consists of him careening through the city of New Orleans, having been expelled from home by his mother, who insists he get a job. What makes the novel interesting is that while no one else Ignatius encounters is really up to his level of weirdness, no one is completely normal, either. Everyone has some sort of misconception or screw-up in their make-up, and Ignatius seems to bring out their weirdness, emphasizing it. When he gets a job in the office of a factory, we meet several people in the office who he works with. So one character never realizes Ignatius is male, and refers to him by the name of a former female coworker. Another thinks a woman working for her would \\"go to pieces\\" if she retired, so (against the woman's wishes) she keeps making her go to work, with comical consequences. Ignatius' mother has troubles of her own, a boyfriend who's a bit of a problem because he sees communists everywhere, a friend with a son who's a policeman, and who tried to arrest the commie-hunter, and so forth. At one point you watch a stripper with a weird act involving a bird, but her act goes horribly wrong in a comical fashion. At another point Ignatius is trying to form a political party exclusively of gays, believing that since they're so habitually neat they'll outlaw warfare. When the lesbians show up and break up the party things get really funny.I have to confess I'm confused why he had trouble getting this thing published. Interestingly, I read somewhere on the net that Robert Gottlieb was involved in working with Toole on the book at one point, and encouraged him, but didn't think it was publishable in its current state. Gottlieb's a good editor, though I suspect he must have been pretty young at the time. Even so, it must be jarring to him now to realize that this book is as good as it is--it won the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for fiction--even though he apparently thought it needed more work.Regardless, I would recommend this book highly, especially to anyone with a sense of humor."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"If I were allowed 10 novels on a desert island, this would be one of them!!!This was a very difficult book to read. I could barely go 10 pages without laughing hysterically.I didn't know it was possible to write like this."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I suppose it is no coincidence that as I decide to read John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces that the horrendous Louisiana oil gush would erupt in the Gulf of Mexico. Both are perfect indictments of the incompetence performed by those around us who would have us believe that they should be in charge and know what they are doing. Like the wreckage of the oil gush, this work by John Kennedy Toole is an ingenious novel that illustrates the incompetence and corruption that will ceaselessly flow when initiated from a broken valve.Toole's work is a masterpiece of language and satire, centering, or perhaps orbiting around Ignatius J. Reilly, one of the more interestingly conceived characters I've ever read. A semi-educated giant of a slob in every sense imaginable and with no redeeming qualities, Ignatius waddles throughout the work, influencing typically for the worse anyone and everyone coming within his obese sphere of decay with his unfocused intellect. Unable to relate to anyone in New Orleans or society in general, Ignatius latently creates an intricate path of destruction in his avoidance of any type of employment while plotting social revolution on various fronts. That is, only after finding change for the movie theater. Ignatius is a contradiction of sloth and intellect, using his education to further his avoidance of reality. Whether forced to file the most menial of papers or selling hot dogs on the street, Ignatius would rather stage a worker revolt to have an afternoon off at the movies. Eerily similar in character to W.C. Fields, he is a bumbling spark that ignites the lesser incompetence and avarice all around him.A Confederacy of Dunces is a work of slapstick in dialogue, where the patois of the New Orleans cops, office workers, exotic dancers, hot dog vendors and \\"vagrants\\" found throughout the city clashes with that of the \\"learned\\". Where whispers of lurking perverts or \\"comuniss\\" can get one arrested, the novel is a commentary on irrelevant intellectualism versus the reality of class struggle in the American South. As hilarious as the work is, it is a brilliant yet skewering glimpse at the plight of the so-called educated in everyday life, where people manipulate others into obeisance, even if they themselves don't know to what end."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"this book is so original, hilarious, at times a little heartbreaking just because you can feel the character's raw emotions. so well done, a must read"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is the most cleverly worded and entertaining book I have ever read.

Once you start to place all of Ignatius's idiosyncrasies, you're in for some very special laughs. I was depressed when the book had to end, because I was simply enjoying too much, and have never read anything quite like it. You may also enjoy Charles Bukowski, if you like this book.If you have tastes that differ from top 20 best seller list, 5th grade reading level stuff, this is for you. If you really want to know that this book is great, give it to someone who only reads Dan Brown type novels, and they will despise this...then you know you've got something great!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I don't even know how to begin to describe how fun and unique this book is. I think you have to be in just the right mood to enjoy it, but whatever it was it was one of the most entertaining experiences I've had in a really long time. The book is so preposterous, and original, that I have no idea how the author came up with any of it--but I love it. Initially the main character, a blundering oaf of a man, Ignatius Reilly, is utterly repulsive, but by the end of the book he's somehow won me over and I think he's a true hero of our blighted age. I love that despite the fact that he's pretentious, self-absorbed, patronizing, obese, and ridiculous that he is completely unrepentant about it. The book is way ahead of its time and, I suspect, so is Ignatius. I am a huge fan now.Busily,Justice"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Perhaps one of the best books that no one has heard of. Without spoiling the plot, I find it suffice to say that John Kennedy Toole has created one of the greatest literary characters of the 20th century. This book is hilarious, due in main part to the protagonist of the story. Ignacious is an intelligent, naive, gluttonous, and sloth-like young man finding it difficult to break his outer shell and join the rest of the world in reality. I don't know what else to say, but just need to read this book. You will smile, maybe laugh outloud, but most importantly you will have a great time while reading of his misadventures and strategic blunders."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Confederacy of Dunces is one of the worst books I've ever read. It certainly did not live up to its billing. I found the book dated, and lacking humor in today's society (that of course assumes it was humorous when it was written). The humor is distasteful and offensive. There is nothing madcap about the adventures of Ignatious Reilly--he is simply a pathetic overweight individual. I am sorry that I wasted money buying this book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I read this book, as others had, becuase it was so highly recommended. Those that dislike the book may be in the minority, but with over 100 negative reviews, we are not alone. Some brave souls have the courage to shout, in the words of Jon Lovitz, \\"It stinks!\\"Well, reader, it stinks. Not only is tbe book unfunny, but the main character, Ignatious J. Reilly, is the most loathesome characeter in literature. Onboxious, self indulgent, belligernt and whiny, Reilly spends page after page either 'bellowing,' screaming or 'thundering' whevever he is asked to perform the most routine courtesy (such as paying a hot dog vendor after scarfing six franks). The passages where is is not screaming are dedicated to his incessantly whining about his \\"valve.\\" Reilly takes a job as a file clerk and responds by throwing each document in the garbage and spending his days finger painting. He gets a job as hot dog vendor and eats all his wares then lies to and \\"thunders\\" at his boss, claiming that all the hot dogs were stolen and \\"how dare he\\" place \\"senstive\\" Reilly in such danger. Reilly's \\"valve,\\" of course, suffers. Each chapter is a repetition of this theme. I finished the book hoping that it must get better, hoping that Reilly would learn, change, or die. None of this occcurs. He is as obnoxious in the final chapter as in the first.Nor is Reilly the only obnoxious, melodramatic character. His mother, Eileen, insessantly complains to her friend about the \\"disgrace\\" and \\"dishonor\\" of Reilly working as a hot dog vender. Mrs. Levy (wife of a former boss) complains and whines about everything under the sun. Then there's George, the pornography peddling bigot: the reader is treated to George's vile diatribes against homosexuals and African Americans.Like Reilly himself, Confederacy is, at heart, a bloated, malodorious waste of space."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have just finished reading Confederacy of Dunces. At 41 years old, I have no heistation - not a moment's - in shouting as loudly as possible that this is, quite simply, the worst piece of utter cr*p I have ever read.I am open-mouthed in complete astonishment that anyone can say this is anywhere near approaching \`good' or even \`readable'. It is just cr*p. There is no alternative but to resort to the vernacular. So, the author committed suicide because no-one would publish it? Really, you don't say? If I'd have been around, I would have shot him and saved him the bother. God in Heaven, I was ready to commit suicide within 50 pages! There is not an ounce of skill in this; no rhyme nor reason. What is the point of this book? It starts nowhere, it goes nowhere, it ends nowhere. The lead character, Ignatius J Reilly, is as unlikeable and unbelievable as he is fat. Other characters just drift in and out like ... I don't know what. I am lost for words to describe how turgid this waste of paper is.The dialogue is just ridiculous. It doesn't make sense. At the start, Ignatius and his mother have the most nonsensical conversation that alternates, line by line, between togetherness, hatred, stupidity... And then much later in the book, Ignatius has some seemingly drug-induced psycho-babble between himself and an effete Dorian Greene. It is IMPOSSIBLE to even follow this dialogue, let alone make sense of it. It is the sort of stuff you'd expect a 12-year-old to write, it really is.One reviewer on Amazon says he farted he laughed so much. I sat frowning at how such rubbish ever made it into print.I had the Penguin version with the striped box of popcorn on the front. If you have yet to buy this book (declare bankruptcy to avoid the prospect), flick to page 271 and read from the top to the end of the chapter on page 283, or as far as you can get before the bookshop staff get restless. If you haven't been put off by these pages, then, OK, this book is for you. God help you.I admit that I raised my personal rating from one-out-of-ten to two, purely because I thought: there must be a point to this, there must be something at the end that will make me think this was worth my time. But no.

At the risk of being numbered among the 'confederacy' by some of the more smug reviewers, I find the showers of praise heaped on this pile of ordure incomprehensible, let alone the fact that it won a Pulitzer.Leave aside the inherent and all-pervading meanness of every single character. Leave aside the constant inconsistencies in their behaviour and the ridiculous unreality of the situations they find themselves in. Even leave aside the loud grinding of machinery heard throughout, as the author laboriously winches the pieces into place for the next piece of utterly implausible 'slapstick' comedy. The real question is, what is the reader supposed to take away from all this? Are we supposed to sympathise with the odious Reilly? What point is the author trying to convey? As the heading says, beats me.In the final analysis, do any of the characters learn anything? Do they grow and develop? Has there been some unifying meaning to their experiences? Do we genuinely care what happens to any of them? No to all."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"After having read the onslaught of rave reviews I finally decided it was time to crack the covers of this book. Yes, it won the Pulitzer Prize, but was also rejected by every major publishing house for seven years. After having read extensively such authors as Updike, Bellow, Steinbeck, Vonnegut I must say that I find this book stunning in its mediocrity, painfully boring, and too exaggerated to even pass as social satire.Someone of Ignatius' intelligence and originality would not be on the social and behavioral level of a three-year-old. To be so perceptive what the world is concerned but to have no inkling of self-awareness is just plain impossible.As for being a comic masterpiece, I did not laugh once, it rarely even made me smirk. People who talk of &quot;side-splitting laughter&quot; do not seem to get out of the house much anymore. I probably enjoyed most his pseudo-intellectual indictment of society, although the whole thing is just social commentary in reverse, instead of social progress it advocates a return to theocracy and the Dark Ages, which is potentially interesting at first, but then just became redundant and annoying.I enjoyed one person's review in particular calling people who did not see the &quot;genius&quot; in this book the real &quot;Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, but I wonder if the dunces are truly those who cannot think for themselves and just go by the old if-it-got-a-prize-it-must-be-amazing motto. I really have to wonder about this Pulitzer...From the first page onward this book is pure drudgery, the dialogue is witty but seems to take place in some kind of void, the characters are somewhat unique but completely flat and predictable. If you want true comic anti-heroes I suggest you read &quot;Pnin&quot; by Vladimir Nabokov, or some other book by a real author."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Well, count me in the 'I didn't get it, either' camp too.I'm not exactly sure which parts of the book were intended to be laugh-out-loud humorous (unless the humor was in the burp-n-fart category and the 200 times the word 'weiner' or 'weenie' was mentioned): A grown man pushing a hot dog cart dressed as a pirate? A pants factory where most of the office staff doesn't bother to show up for work? A woman being stripped by a bird? I will admit that these situations were entertaining, but...funny? Maybe I'm jaded by 20-some-odd years of watching sitcoms where situations like that are commonplace. I don't know.I didn't love Ignatius or any of the other characters, but I didn't hate them either. Any book that can make you feel any sort of strong emotion is generally a good one. But this one...I just felt that everyone was sad, pathetic and most of the fringe characters were stereotypes (the bungling cop; the unwashed, free loving, folk-song-singing hippy; the flamboyant gay men; the burly lesbians; the lazy African-Americans; the idiot stripper; the demented senior citizens).

Then I reached the back cover.Confederacy of Dunces is the Anti-Atlas Shrugged. Where, in the latter the central characters are Supremely attractive, smart, and ambitious, each pursuing some Monty-Burnsian master plan, in Confederacy, everyone is inhumanly vile, unattractive, ignorant, and lazy -- losers all, not so much living as ambling through life in a Brownian sort of way, inflicting unpleasantness and misfortune on everyone that crosses their path. Evidently this is the stuff of laugh out loud high comedy and there's much money to be made in the novelization of all the Three Stooges shorts.With no apology to Sam Gross, \\"That's not funny. That sick.\\" This isn't humor, it's sad and depressing. By mid-way through the book, what kept me turning the next page was a misplaced hope that the author's innate sense of justice and decency would have Jack Torrance come down from the Overlook and plant a fire axe squarely between the shoulder blades of each and every character in this book. If I wanted to immerse myself in the absolute worst that humanity has to offer, I don't need to read, I can sit back and watch Elimidate.John Kennedy Toole apparently came to an untimely end due to severe depression.

If you've lived a very sheltered life (and the author apparently lived with his mother and didn't the house until he committed suicide) this may seem funny; I felt that I wasted time that could have otherwise been spent reading a GOOD book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"First off, the book is hideous. A novel to glorify the weakness of mankind. This is the first book I have ever thrown in the trash. I could not disgrace the various authors of my collection by placing this novel on the shelf.The comedy of this book is in it's reviews. To glorify this novel is to glorify disparity, vulgarity, and despair. If these reviews were written as a joke on mankind, the least the reviewers could have done was credit the proper reviewer...Ellsworth Toohey.It's not even good drivel. It's a poor, vulgar rendition of Catch-22 without plot or character development.Anyone who knows who Ellsworth Toohey is or can answer the following question will find nothing but frustration and disgust in this novel.Who is John Galt?"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I love characters that fly in the face of conventionality. I love irreverant characters who challenge the way we see the world.Ignatius is neither of these. His rantings on the ills of society from the safety of his bedroom in his mother's house were empty and silly. He is a completely unbelievable character, or at least one with whom I could not empathize. His twisted view of the world is so anathema to the realm of common experience that I'm surprise anyone can put themselves in it.Try as hard as I did, I couldn't raise enough interest in the characters to even finish this book.Read John Irving instead -- He's much funnier, can turn reality in interesting twists and still be believable, and has more important things to say about what it is to be a human being in the world."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"According to the Forward, by Walker Percy, this young author suicided in 1969. By doing so he missed seeing so many of his perceptions of humanity and social conditions in the US carried to their ultimate logical extreme. Toole was obviously an observant young writer, able to voice opinion well without communicating the underlying bitterness one would expect of a person on the brink of self-homicide.Perhaps Toole intended the characters to be caricatures. If so, he failed. The characters are merely the (not particularly) extremes found in the population pool of the 20th Century US, created and presented to the reader within a plot probably believed to be humorous. Readers might find the humor an uncomfortably realistic portrayal of human flaws.The book is certainly well written. It's an interesting read with excellent characterization, plot, and setting. It's also a book I didn't enjoy reading. Toole's astute awareness of human motivation, stupidity and the direction society was headed was, for me, overshadowed by the fact of his suicide.Toole guessed right about the direction and perceived correctly about many facets of the human condition, then deliberately curtailed his own experience of that life. Reading the book without that knowledge would have made it enjoyable and had me laughing through every page."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Why? Because it won a prize and because all the real smart folks love it. So I unless you want people to think you're square you need to love it, too. Oh, don't look for anyone not detestable in it. Heck no. That's what's so funny. Masterbation is sooooo funny. Gosh, how clever to have your character masterbate. I guess that's why he was a genius, huh? I never would have thought of that.

It's like the Emperor's new clothes. There's nothing there but a lot of self indulgent, pompous tripe.Let's list what the author can't do:1. Write characters one can empathise with (note I don't say 'identify with' or 'like'.2. Figure out a plot that would do credit to anyone beyond 2nd grade. A plot is more than having a cast of characters walk through a series of events.3. Be funny, in any but the clumsiest way, and only if your idea of humour is sniggering at deformity and after it's been telegraphed at you from a paragraph or two away. The only joke is the one that was made on me; I bought it!4. Be interesting. Where are the IDEAS??? This is warmed over, under-salted porridge! Nothing sparkles off the page, no ideas gleam like nuggets within the lines. It is uniformly grey.5. Write well. A great author can hold your attention with the beauty of his wordcrafting. He can write memorable prose about the tiny things in life. He can make the words leap off the page. Toole can'tDon't waste your money on this. There are thousands of good books out there. This isn't one of them."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I heard that the book was a comic masterpiece so I gave it a try. After reading the Preface I was prepared to withstand a slow start that was supposed to grow slowly towards a climactic ending (or at least an interesting ending). A friend of mine was given the book and she tried to get through it 2 or 3 times but she kept getting to a point that she couldn't push through. I was able to push through because I expected a payoff later on that never came.None of the characters are completely likable. They are all idiots at one point or another and they repeatedly act in a way that I have trouble believing a normal person would. If this was a play, television show or a movie I would say that all of the characters were overacting. They would constantly repeat the same stupid sayings over and over and over again throughout the book. The whole time I am thinking how unbelievable this dialog is because normal people don't act this way. This was just stupidity. It might even be bearable if it was only a couple of screwballs characters but instead everyone is inept. There was no one to route for or to identify with and it simply was not entertaining to read.The only good thing that I can say about the book is that the title is appropriate."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I don't know why I never knew about A Confederacy of Dunces when it was first published. But I just listened to it as an audiobook, and it was one of the most enjoyable books I've experienced in years. The book is an impressive character study and commentary on New Orleans and the world in general in the early 1960's. Everyone of the characters in this story is so lifelike and beautifully crafted so that you feel these are people you know, not just characters in a book. The dialogue is pure genius.The protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, is hilarious as the big, intellectual slob who is always criticizing and pontificating at everyone from his mother to the people who are trying to buy hot dogs from him on the street. The Jones character is superb: the super-wise and wisecracking, cynical down-and-out black man. I loved them all: Ignatius, his mother Irene, Mr. and Mrs. Levy, Patrolman Mancuso, Lana Lee, Darlene, Miss Annie. Well, maybe not Myrna Minkoff and Miss Trixie so much. But they all had a role to play. I simply didn't want the book to end; it was like losing your new-found friends.This is a book you don't want to miss. Read it or better yet, buy it as the audiobook read by Barrett Whitener.

I wasn't looking for War and Peace or Jane Eyre and I enjoyed it to the last page. Of course I loved Moby Dick and still think THAT was just a story about a white whale and the men who hunted it.Reggie"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This novel's brawl of a plot revolves around one of the most memorable characters in 20th century American fiction: the grossly rotund, incredibly verbose and most heavily egocentric braggart Ignatius Reilly. An oafish loser, in some respects, Reilly also exercises a most beautiful mind and lyrical tongue. Revolving around Reilly is a cast of freakish characters that are also defined by their weaknesses and unfulfilled dreams. The setting is New Orleans. And this literary trip into a grim and desperate part of the Big Easy is definitely worth taking."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I loved this book! This is the kind of book that makes you want to overuse exclamation marks in your review!The vocabulary is wonderful and the main character's worldview is just plain comical. On many occasions, I laughed out loud.I am sorry I will not be able to read this author again."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I began reading this book during a drunk driving assembly. I will admit it now - I have no idea what was said during that assembly. I *do* know that &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; is an entirely absorbing, hilarious novel that entertains from the very beginning. And by &quot;very beginning,&quot; I mean the Foreward:&quot;&quot;There was no getting out of it; only one hope remained - that I could read a few pages and that they would be bad enough for me, in good conscience, to read no farther. Usually I can do just that. Indeed the first paragraph often suffices. My only fear was that this one might not be bad enough, or might be just good enough, so that I would have to keep reading&quot; (vii-viii).The characters are addictive and quirky - even the ones you don't like. I actually didn't care for pompous, arrogant Ignatius, but I did enjoy him - it's impossible to read his rants and strange ideas without cracking up. And I became very fond of many of the other characters - and are there a lot of them. Several different plots weave through &quot;Confederacy,&quot; each with its own cast, loosely tied together until the end.Patrolman Mancuso and the police department...Dorian Green and his friends...Mr. Levy, Mrs. Levy, and the exercise board (&quot;Leave the board out of this!!!&quot;)...the &quot;Night of Joy&quot; bar...and, of course, Jones. My favorite, beloved Jones. &quot;Negro,&quot; &quot;vagrant,&quot; trying to get people into the &quot;Night of Joy&quot; for a show (&quot;Hey! All you people draggin along here. Stop and come stick your a** on a Night of Joy stool...Night of Joy got genuine color peoples workin below the minimal wage. Whoa!&quot;) Jones is, ironically, possibly the only entirely sane character in this book. &quot;Whoa!&quot;Basically, I love this book. It's hilarious, I finished it last week and believe me - if you're hoping for it to be a nice, sane read, I kindly suggest you find a lute string and stab yourself with it. It'll save you a little suffering.Because this book is insane in a way that only Kurt Vonnegut can compare to.And I love every page of it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Probably the funniest book I've ever come across, it, unlike a lot of novels that are humorous, has a great plot and wonderfully defined characters. So many books that are funny are simply small episodes strung together with no real &quot;meat.&quot; Not the case with CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES.Why it's taken this long for Hollywood to make this into a movie is beyond me (and it's still not done!) Everything is right there--the brilliant dialogue, the great setting of New Orleans, and the star character, Ignatius.But forget about whether or not Hollywood succeeds with their attempt at this Southern classic. After all, they've managed to mangle other works like MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL and a few others. And if they don't do justice to CONFEDERACY they'll certainly be hearing from several generations who have come to love this book.The only bad thing I can say about CONFEDERACY is that you'll never be able to actually own a copy for yourself--you'll be continuously giving away which ever copy you have at the moment, whenever you find someone who hasn't read this magical, entertaining, and rollicking book.It sounds cliche to say &quot;this is a classic,&quot; but that's exactly what it is.Also recommended: THE MOVIE GOER, NEON BIBLE, BARK OF THE DOGWOOD"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces is chock-full of unforgettable and unique characters, especially its \\"hero\\" - Ignatius J. Reilly, an obese, egotistical, self-proclaimed authority on EVERYTHING. He has a knack for failing at whatever he does; in many ways he's an almost grown-up Charlie Brown (without all of Charlie's good points). His misadventures are downright hilarious, as are those of the other characters. The plot isn't terribly complicated, but pay attention, because even seemingly insignificant encounters ultimately play a larger role in the novel. In my opinion, this book truly deserved the Pulitzer Prize and I highly recommend it; John Kennedy Toole was able to not only bring the characters to life but also give the reader an idea of what life is like in vibrant New Orleans. However, this is not a book for the easily offended because it is definitely not politically correct."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is an amazing book-- for the way it was published as well as the content. The first copy I bought ( Inow have at least 3) is nearly worn out because I kept it in my desk drawer when I was working, and when I got too stressed out, I'd just grab good ole Ignatius and very soon, the stress was all gone. There's nothing like an evening at the Night of Joy Bar to alleviate stress! My only regret is that the dumb old publishing powers that were in his day didn't latch onto this masterpiece so that Toole would still be with us. I wish I knew what happened in that car on the way to New York!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"What a same that John Kennedy Toole wont be providing any more wonderful novels. This book rates as one of my new favorites and certainly deserves the praise it has been given. This book is very refreshing in that it deals with psychologically complex characters without giving into modern judgments of their actions. Confederacy also manages to portray a very small character with a very small life in an epic manner which is a challenge that most novels do not rise to."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I keep reading how wonderful this tome is. I keep hearing how it is a classic. I have tried upon three separate occasions to get through this mess of a book.

It will not entertain you, it will not make you feel smarter, it will not make people think you are smarter...after they read it too. The lead character is the type of person everyone can hate.

I hated every single flipping page of this overblown and overhyped crap that as soon as I finished it--and I stuck with it, so agonizingly long, right to the end--I tossed it in the woodburning stove and giggled blissfully as the pages curled in consuming fire.This book is not comedy, straight or black or slapstick or satirical. It is not a work of genius or intellect. It's a rambling screed by a rejected and untalented hack, pushing himself and his own directionless existence onto the fictional page. It's a glorification of everything that's wrong with the America we're stuck with, sloth and waste and taking deep pride in the lack of ambition and calling it independence. This garbage holds up lack of personal pride, absence of self-resepct and absence of personal self-worth as worthy attributes, something that is honorable to strive for. It glorifies the marginal existence, and the conscious decision to live one.Make a statement for literature. Buy a copy and throw it in the fire, down the sewer, into a chipper, in the recycle bin, please."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"First, I will admit that this is quite possibly premature, given that I am only 2/3 through the book. But so far it's moderately disappointing. The story is entertaining as so many reviews have pointed out, but I was expecting more.This book was recommended to me in the course of a conversation about Tom Robbins (as in \\"if you like Robbins, you'll love...\\"), and it has not lived up to the expectations set out in that conversation. I was given to believe that Toole wrote with the same abiding passion for the words he chooses as does Robbins, but I have yet to see that. Sure, Reilly's own musings and proclamations are fun and eloquent, but that eloquence is gratuitous as often as it is anything else. And outside of that, the rest of the book, while it does a good job of character development, is a little on the bland side.In terms of a literary ride, this is a rollercoaster with one loop, a couple of drops, and a lot of long flat track in between. But if you want a ride on the prose equivalent of a mechanical bull, pick up Tom Robbins.Follow-up - finnished the book and I stand by what I said above."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book was one of the worst books I have read reciently. The book could have been two sentences...There is a fat guy who suffers from dillustions of grandure. Go read Don Quito if you want a funny version of this story... An all around bad book with only one plot device, and a main character that I could neithor love nor hate because he was a completely flat character.

Reilly, is too fantastic to believe. the one character i really belived and found terrific was &quot;Jones&quot;. here is a ripe character. everthing else is overwrought and silly.

However, this rambling opus has a poorer center of gravity than its protagonist. The humor is pedestrian at best and the characters, sparsely drawn, wilt in the New Orleans heat. This is just another fine example of how book awards in general are misguided endorsements of sub-par work. There is a very good reason why this book was rejected by various publishers...it isn't very good. Toole casts a very large net, but catches very few fish in his attempt to capture an incendiary and convoluted period in American life. It appears that Toole is making an attempt at clever historical fiction, but shrouds the work in ludicrousness in order to hide its short comings and general failings."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The author of this atrocious book has given us the most annoying character in the entire history of literature. Imagine reading the story of the spoiled little brat kid who lived down the street from you when you were younger. The kid who always talked back to his mother and got everything he wanted. Who wants to read about a person like this? The story itself moves along at a terrible pace. It switches from one unfunny episode to another with a bit of difficulty, usually relying on the main character going home to go to sleep at the end of the chapter, and waking up to a new, irritating adventure."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Well, after reading a host of rave reviews I decided to give this book a whirl. Supposedly a comedy, I cannot recall laughing once during it, and with a wholly predictable story it failed to delilver.

Ignore all of the cries of \\"loser lit,\\" because this book is far more than that. Certainly, Ignatius Reilly is a loser by the standards of the society in which we live. He is an outstanding example of unfulfilled potential. He seems to hate everything about the society that casts him aside and jeers at him. However, the quote from which this novel derives its name is eerily true--you can tell a true genius when all of the dunces in his midst form a confederacy against him, and there is something genuinely brilliant about Ignatius' many critiques of our society. Despite his apparent lack of common sense, the truth behind many of his objections to various facets of the modern West is undeniable. This genius glows brighter when viewed in light of its age (the book was written during the early 1960s, before the cultural tumults of the latter part of that decade and the sexual, social, and moral shifts that followed), which bares the strangely prophetic nature of Ignatius' worldview. The book could have been published yesterday and would not have lost any of its relevancy.No collection of 20th century literature can be adequate without a copy of Confederacy of Dunces."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Taste and decency! Theology and geometry! Lashed until she drops! If nothing else, Ignatius J. Reilly's catchphrases are the one thing you will take away from this book. Reilly is one of the funniest characters in literature: pompous, obese, unabashedly selfish, a little crazy, and with a style of speaking and writing that is surely unique. His letter to Mr. Abelman still makes me laugh when I think about it.The book is not great though. Apart from the terrific Ignatius Reilly, few of the characters work. Many pages are wasted on Mrs. Levy and Miss Trixie, their annoying scenes about as funny as a punch in the solar plexus, although I did like Miss Trixie's gait explained mathematically. The Darlene-bird and Mancuso-costume slapstick routines may be funny for their time, but do not work now. And despite what Walker Percy says in his foreword, the Burma Jones character is a cliche and a caricature. The sob-story about Reilly's dog was unnecessary -- there is no cause for sentimentality in a work of such nature -- and if Toole was alive when the book was published, they would have certainly excised that part.But Reilly does work, and he works so spectacularly that this book is a must read for this one character alone. And how many books can you say that about?"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is a hilarious book from start to finish. The main character reminds me of an early version of the Coen Brothers' Big Lebowski. Ignatius Reilly is a a fat, gassy, opinionated man who seems to grate on everybody's nerves. The story basically centers on his misshaps as he applies for (and bungles up) certain jobs. If you are looking for a straightforward, linear plotline, this is not the book for you. Tons of pages are taken up by the main characters monologues (which are HILARIOUS) and the characters around him are allowed to develop. Ignatius' relationship with his mother is very funny too. This book is highly recommended and deserves the Pulitzer Prize that it got."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Obese, pedantic and hopelessly eccentric, Ignatius J. Reilly stands like Gargantua over all other characters in modern literature. He leads us on a series of his misfit adventures through the French Quarter of New Orleans. Age 30 and living with his mother, he is an over-educated oaf who sits around the house watching TV with disgust and laboriously filling up 'Big Chief' tablets with his reflections on life. His rantings on the world of work, love, religion and other topics leave no one safe from his fiery invective. His pseudo long-distance relationship with a liberated feminist named Myrna Minkoff reveals his attachment to his mother's apron strings. Stereotypical characterizations of other minor characters give the reader a balanced cornucopia of madness and genius. Comic relief is the order of the day in this brilliant novel. I absolutely loved it!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I found this little book on a $1.99 table and read about the accolades. Bought it ($2.12 including Indiana tax). read it, CONSUMED IT, loved it. A perfectly magnificent book about a perfectly magnificent fellow and his permutations. I cannot say enough about the use of conversational English and the use of absurdist situations to convey the free/futile situations that Ignatious finds himself in. Mom worship, self-deprecation, sappy attention to the old who should have been moved on years ago,attention to detail...all strong, serious, intelligent reasons to read this book. This book literaly changed the way I look at me, at you, at the people we influence and are influenced by....I saw human nature at its belt line and I approved and disapproved while being mightily entertained.At the end Ignatius ends up just being another adolesant who moves, grooves, and behooves according to the mores of his time. I cannot think of another character who caused me to relate so completly. (Ok, Maybe Holden Caulfield) Loved this book. They have been trying to make a movie of this forever.

From the first page, this book has the reader's attention all the way through to the end, and not once was I able to state that I found the book 'boring'. With its complex system of characters and plots, 'A Confederacy of Dunces' is one of the strangest, yet most interesting stories in a long while. Though behind the many dilemmas of Mr. Ignatius J. Reilly, there is a tragedy. If perhaps the overweight, and well-educated man who is the protagonist had decided to do something with his life he might not have been stuck at home with his mother, and trying to inspire a conspiracy of some sort anywhere he goes. Not to mention his ex-girlfriend who he is constantly at war with, Myrna 'Minx' Minkoff. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to any reader. No matter who you are, anyone is able to relate in some way to this wonderful novel."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This easily ranks up there with the work of Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor in its depiction of a weird and often-disturbing region of the country. Its wit is over-the-top, yet sublime. I can't understand the reviewers who need to LIKE the main character in order to enjoy the book! Of course you hate Ignatius! That's the point. Imagine how much great literature you'd miss out on if you had to feel some sort of kinship with the protagonist. The book, written when it was, is mind-bendingly terrific. It's like an Edith Wharton novel, written seventy years later, transported South, and injected with gallons of humor. I can't say enough good things about it. I really pity those who dislike it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"\\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.\\"--Jonathan SwiftThis quote introduces the novel, \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\", and explains the main character's view of the world. Ignatius J. Reilly is what one might call an indignent butthead. No one is smarter than Ignatius, or so he thinks. Anyone that disagrees with what he has to say or does is a fool. Because Ignatius feels this way, virtually everyone in the world is a fool who can't grasp the level of thinking Ignatius's mind reaches. Ignatius lives a virtual bum's life, shacked up (most of the time, at least) in his bedroom of his mother's house. He is constantly occupied by the lack of taste and decency in the world that surrounds him. All the while, he claims to be pursuing a writing career, but only writes scraps and pieces of his daily activities and thoughts. Ignatius constantly degrades and criticizes everyone he comes in contact with, especially his mother. The novel is a comedic piece of work, and the bulk of the laughter one might get from it comes from the conversations Ignatius engages in with the people he knows or meets; in particular, the letters he and ex-girlfriend, Myrna Minkoff, send to one another are quite hilarious.Nevertheless, the novel only works because of Ignatius: the portly, overdramatic, under-sexed character most can't help but love and hate at the same time. The other characters, such as Myrna and Ignatius's mother, are all interesting and funny on their own. But they help to solidify one's disdain for Ignatius, and thus their appreciation for the novel. His arrogance and pretentiousness drive the novel and make it a pleasure to read--if one can handle the abomination that is Ignatius J.

Laugh out loud funny with a dark underlying and warped underbelly, this rollicking and twisted tale is now a southern classic. The main character of Ignatius has got to be the funniest and most disturbed individual ever to grace the written page. Why this book wasn't made into a movie long ago is beyond me. Would also recommend another great book, similar to this one in its scope, humor, and insight: Bark of the Dogwood by Jackson McCrae."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Toole's book is an ambitious work of comedy, highlighted by one of the most memorable literary creations ever, Ignatius J. Reilly.Reilly is an unforgettable character, a self-described anachronism who dresses in a plaid flannel shirt and a green hunter's cap, all the while bemoaning the loss of \\"taste and decency\\" in modern times, equating the breakdown of the Medieval system with the ascendancy of chaos and lunacy. He fills notebooks with vitriol detailing his contempt for the regular dregs of society, imbibes and belches up countless bottles of Dr. Nut, and likens his mother to an adolescent floozy. A portly man, he lounges, eats, and farts constantly, his sedentary life interrupted only by a need to find a job.Reilly's escapades as a working man who never works are simply hilarious. His first job is at a pants factory, where he files away papers by throwing them in the garbage, ignores his boss, and befriends an elderly senile employee named Miss Trixie. After being fired for planning an uprising in the warehouse, Reilly finds a job that is perfect for him--pushing a hot dog cart through downtown New Orleans, dressed in a pirate's costume. When his hot dog cart is stolen, Ignatius smartly quips, \\"The human desire for food and sex is relatively equal. If there are armed rapes, why should there not be armed hot dog thefts?\\"While the character of Ignatius Reilly is undoubtedly exaggerated and perhaps even absurd, Toole uses Reilly to render his indictment of contemporary society, the novel becoming a vehicle in which hoi polloi are relegated to the role of the dunce, forever confined to a world of indecency. Ignatius is the unconventional hero, tragically confined to the fringes of society.The great tragedy of the novel, however, is author John Kennedy Toole's inability to heed the advice of his own protagonist. In troubling times, Ignatius Reilly, ever devoted to medieval philosophy, would have reminded Toole of Boethius's rota fortunae. Wait long enough and the wheel of fortune will turn your way. Tragically, in his depths of despair, Toole ended his own life, unable to wait for that final turn. Along with this novel, I'd like to recommend another quick Amazon pick: The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is the funniest book I have read since &quot;Catch-22&quot;, and like that book, &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; uses its humour to make a larger point.As we follow around the repulsive Ignatius through his misadventures in New Orleans, we are reminded that there are really sad people out there, people who live the grandest of lives in their own heads, but in reality are nothing more than hot dog vendors.The strongest parts of this novel are the wonderfully catoonish and hilarious secondary cast of characters, espcially the ancient secretary Miss Trixie. Jones the floor sweeper and Patrolman Mancuso are also well drawn here, and we cannot help but love everybody in this story, even the pseudo-enemy Mirna Minkoff.It is intersting how the life of the author, John Kennedy Toole, seems to follow that of Ignatius. Toole knew he was destined for greatness, but ended up committing suicide in frustration because his book was not being piblished. It is a shame, as he never saw this work published, flourish, and eventually win the Pulitzer Prize.This is an excellent novel, one with a towering wit that should appeal to almost everybody who has a hidden cynic within themselves."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"'A Confederacy of Dunces' was a tremendous surprise to me as a reader. The story hit me like a blast of flatulence and sarcasm. It is a totally unpredictable read. The sheer freshness and originality will first stun you, then leave you gasping for more.The main character Ignatius, a big mind in an even bigger body, walks the streets of New Orleans pronouncing judgement upon everyone and everything that crosses his path. The belligerent behemoth leaves behind a wake of social destruction and confusion that would put Godzilla to shame. Meanwhile he entertains and educates his hapless reader by sharing the fruits of his medieval mind, his contemplations and jottings, giving an ultimate understanding of everything that was wrong with the 20th century.A marvellously funny read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"How could anyone say that this book is about nothing? Toole incorporates so many social, political, and personal issues. In an era of social change, he writes liberally of the Civil Rights movement, gay rights, and political activism. Toole's offcolor humor is not always well understood (especially by me), but the humor I did understand made the book worth the read. Toole's grotesque descriptions of Ignatius and his overly active valve were hilarious. The ending of the book did seem a little rushed, which is why I only gave the book 3 stars. For all of the odd happenings that occurred, everything wrapped up too nicely in the end. I enjoy a happy ending, don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't even classify it as happy because Ignatius was still really weird in the end, maybe even more so than in the beginning. Overall though, I really enjoyed the book. Read it for a good laugh, but prepare yourself for Ignatius' appalling antics."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces is a book that you will love or hate; there is no middle ground. The excellent use of dark humor will leave you rolling on the floor for quite some time if you are one that enjoys such humor. On the other hand, if you do not care for subtle ironic and dark humor then you will most likely find this to be one of the most painful reads in your life.The book revolves mainly around Ignatus. Ignatus is an obese man who lives with his mother in his thirties and has many strange ventures throughout the book. These ventures are absurd and he will basically leave turmoil wherever he goes. The people he meets then enter the story and you hear the outcome of what becomes of them after Ignatus has encountered them. Not all of the people he meets will come to a sticky end, but the book will touch on some issues using the characters to convey a message through some of the characters realizations.The book does not only hold excellent entertainment value but it is also a great piece of modernism that offers some of the characters as metaphors for issues or problems in our country that where apparent then, and some even today.I personally enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a dark outlook, and is able to laugh at dismal things. Also I believe that it is a good read because of all that it brings to light, and one should read it critically to see the points the book touches on."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I loved this book.

This novel revolves around the daily misadventuresof Ignatius as he tries to find work inNew Orleans and the peoplehe comes in contact with.These encounters are incredibly funny andbizarre yet the author never lets the scenes collapse into absurdity.Each episode of hilarity rapidly falls apart in stupendous specatcleas Ignatius tries his hand at secretarial work, as a hot dog vendor etc. The supporting characters are also fully realised and bursting with life-the hipster Jones trying to sabotagehis pathetic job, Ignatius's mother and her friends, and especailly Myrna Minkoff our hero's improbableformer girlfriend. Anyone who enjoys a good long laugh or a revealing look into New Orleansand the 60's will love this extraordinary book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"All I can say is that I was reading this book late one evening on my apartment balcony and I had to come back inside, because I was laughing so hard I started disturbing the neighbors.

Needless to say, I loved it.It is most important here to note that rarely does someone recommend anything to me I enjoy as much as them. Nor have I ever recommended anything to anyone else who loved it as much as me. Great book!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"An excellent book, if a bit odd. The adventures of Ignatius and his crazy outlook on the world kept me laughing, due mostly to the sheer absurdity of the world he inhabits. The characters in this book are all memorable--eccentric in so many ways, but brought to life by the gifted late author. Though Ignatius' views and habits are a bit revolting at times, he's still a very fascinating (and amusing) character, whether or not you love him. Don't take the book too seriously. Just enjoy it for what it is."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Having lived in New Orleans for nearly all of my life, I instantly had a connection with the book. I feel that those who do not 'get' the humor of the book are probably not familiar with the city of New Orleans... New Orleans is a city which honors and respects &quot;characters.&quot; I do not mean character in the literary sense, but as an explanation of an eccentric personality. Every character in the book is such a &quot;character&quot;. It is true that most of them are what society would classify as its lowest eschelon. There are no truly honorable characters in the book, with the exception of Burma Jones. (out of space) READ IT"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book made me laugh out loud over and over again in many public places. Poor, pathetic Ignatius- so misunderstood by the public at large. Haven't we all been there at one time, or every day? I think the book itself is also misunderstood by the general populace. As for the people who don't get it, we on the other team know your type and could tell if you'd get it or not before you even picked up the book. Just kidding (a little)! I think John Ritter's character in Slingblade is carrying the paperback edition of this book in a brief scene. He answers the front door or something and I really think he's holding this book. Everyone should read this book- if you hate it that means something."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Not only is Ignatius one of the most memorable characters to come off a page since Vonnegut was in his prime, the entire Crescent City is invoked in the patois of Jones, the cityscape (looking towards Algiers, the Lucky Dog carts, Canal St), the whole seedy, sensual, seductive wench that is New Orleans. The author had a gift for dialogue that has me green with envy. What a tragedy he took his life before his mama got his manuscript into Mr. Percy's hands. I wonder how much of Ignatius' misanthropy was autobiographical?"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I am currently in the midst of reading this thoughtful and humourous novel. I am an avid reader and am reading other books at the same time. What I would like to mention is how I came to discover _Confederacy of Dunces_. It was mailed to me by a dear friend from Canada. In a letter she tells me how much she adores it and how she laughes out loud each time she re-reads it. The book was accompanied with a self-portrait photograph and a wonderful scent within its pages. Though it hasn't been very often, everytime I open the books a nostalgic and pleasant smell assaults me and makes me thinks instantly of the time we spent together. I love fiction, and attempt to write myself, but sometimes I have trouble accepting everyday life. I am enjoying the read but even more I am enjoying the momories it envokes. For if good literature succeeds in reinforcing the idea of a life-affirming ethics it can be the most gratitfying of all passions."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have come to the sad conclusion that those who fail to see the humor in Toole's masterpiece are seriously lacking the genetic components which enable a human being to laugh. Yet, one individual's taste(or lack of taste) in comedy can be forgiven. What can't be so easily forgiven is the dismissal of Toole's writing ability. To say that Toole's writing is amateurish displays a questionable ability to discern quality. &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; is magnificent; almost unanimous raves and a Pulitzer Prize are hardly negligible affirmations of this. Toole was indeed a Maestro."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"nothing else to say...those who don't think it's funny, don't get the nuances of human behavior...they probably also think the movie &quot;TWISTER&quot; was a brilliant film.

I am eager to read that one."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Just when you think you've forgotten this delicious book, a memory will pop up regarding the chattering Miss Trixie... or perhaps a bottle of Dr Nutt.

That being said, I regret that I am only able to give this book 5 stars, and not 6!I snatched up this book at Borders one day, knowing nothing about the background. I didn't have a clue that it was awarded a Pulitzer until I read the cover a little closer. At any rate, this marvelous book pulled me into the story in a way that very few others have been able to. It is keeping &quot;Catch 22&quot; and &quot;THe Sound and the Fury&quot; company on my shelf of books I read at least once a year.Rehashing what I thought of the book could never do it justice. Ignatius is one of the most complex characters I have ever had the privledge of reading. That being said, the book is not at all pretentious and not at all &quot;artsy fartsy&quot; as some Pulitzer Prize novels are. I was expecting more heavy, intense reading that would take me a month or so to complete. This book is a page turner all the way. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It all begins with a car accident, which forces our main character, Ignatius Reilly, to get a job, thus, his adventures begin. He is an obese and arrogant slob who is ready to criticize everyone and everything that he sees in the modern world. What he sees, he loathes, and he documents all of his observations or rants in his Big Chief Notebooks. He takes on a series of jobs where he wreaks havoc and irritates everyone he comes in contact with, especially his Mother. The only person who seems to share in his world view is his equally crazy girlfriend Myrna Minkoff who lives in New York and whom he keeps a running correspondence with. This book is hilarous and but it is also rather sad, because nobody really understands Ignatius except for Myrna, and I absolutely loved the ending, it was perfect. This is an incredible book that I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for the Great American Novel...because THIS IS IT!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book had me laughing out loud throughout.Ignatius' way of speaking, his mannerisms, his &quot;valve&quot;; it was all just brilliantly funny.What a shame that Toole has only two published works.

I got this book to read while traveling, and because of that I was in public places as I read. Everywhere I went with this book people gave me strange looks because of the countless times I laughed out loud. I was almost brought to tears on more than one occasion. Not only is the story funny, it has a lot of heart and a deep and poweful meaning and purpose. It is about dreams, aspirations, love, successes, failures, relationships. A Confederacy of Dunces is a spiderweb of captivating characters and situations.

So much is wrong with life. This book, however, is something that is right. All must read it and be awed."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book deserves its cult status as an off-kilter comic masterpiece. John Kennedy Toole surely nailed the unique cultural quirks of the back streets of New Orleans and its eccentric denizens. Toole's comic plotline is brilliantly written, as the personalities that have the misfortune to be associated with the self-obsessed and obnoxious Ignatius J. Reilly all come together in a hilarious comedy of errors. There is also a subtle undercurrent of melancholy here, particularly regarding the travails faced by Ignatius' long-suffering mother. Toole's characters are uniformly fascinating and unique, though I must dock the novel one star because I totally can't stand Ignatius as a person, albeit a fictional one. Perhaps that was Toole's intention, but Ignatius really stretches the boundaries of believability at times. Thus, it's difficult to determine whether the reader is meant to cheer Ignatius on in his delusional eccentricities, or to curse him for insulting and degrading everyone around him. (I'll leave it to the English professors to decide if that's the sign of a truly well-constructed character.) I was also a bit dissatisfied with Ignatius's fate and comeuppance at the end of the novel - his overbearing self deserved either way less or way more. Regardless, this novel is definitely funny throughout, and quite poignant at times, while documenting a unique culture and its even more unique characters. John Kennedy Toole deserves to be remembered as a writer of great skill, and we can wonder what could have been. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius is certainly a one of a kind character who at various times can make you crack a wide smile. His \\"Working Boy\\" journal entries and letters to Myrna are examples of Toole's talent for comedic writing.However, I like to compare this novel to running on a treadmill - it takes up time and effort, but in the end, you don't get anywhere. Deep and developed characters can only take a book so far when there is an utter lack of a plot. Although Ignatius' interactions with numerous denizens of New Orleans can be amusing, it's simply the same behavior over and over again. There is a myriad of events that occur but there is no progression. By the time the reader gets to the end, the only character that has learned something throughout the 300 pages is Mr. Levy which I found to be very odd since he was for the most part a secondary character.I rated this book 3 stars because Ignatius' uniqueness cannot be ignored and it is an absolute shame that the world will never get to experience his antics ever again. What is also a shame, however, is that more wasn't done with the characters the first and only time around."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy TooleA Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole is about an immensely overweight man who wears a green hunting cap over his balloon shaped head named Ignatius J.

He must battle through life from getting a job to complaining about people that scare him. On top of all of this he still lives with his mom whom which spoils him every step of the way through his long, yet absurdly funny, journey he calls a life. Ignatius thinks that everyone surrounding has a problem whether it might be an oddity they may have or their customs of life and how they do it. He has trouble with landing a good job even though he has a master's degree. Ignatius can't even work at a hot dog stand withought ruining the job by eating the hot dogs and not paying!In this book there are not that many things I disliked. In fact, there probably is only one thing I despised in this hilarious novel. The one and only thing I disliked about this book was the many characters in this book get confusing at times and made my head spin.What I particularly enjoyed about this book was the descriptions of the characters. John Kennedy Toole did an amazingly excellent job describing the characters in such detail yet, at a comical fashion as well. I also enjoyed the real life accents and slang used in this book. This way of bringing out the characters gives them their own personality that is fairly realistic to the present. I really enjoyed Ignatius. Ignatius was just funny anywhere he went. Whatever Ignatius tried to do, it always ended up into something hysterical.This book was one of the best novels I have read so far and really enjoyed the way John Kennedy Toole made all of the characters from Ignatius to Bartenders. This book was one big laugh all the way! Just the way the characters acted, talked, and their personality was hilarious."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I received this book some 10 years ago as a gift and have since bought 8 copies and given them as gifts with the note...&quot;If one ever wondered what it takes to be awarded the Pulitzer...&quot; Ignatius' pompous arrogance and amoral naivite never cease to amuse and delight me and the fact that the characters come full circle bringing otherwise unrelated people into contact is magic.

Valves! Toole has the gift of taking the mundane and elevating it to the hysterical. He manipulates humor in ways that are both obvious and subtle at once: the workers trying to carry Ignatius while they strike, for example, make us laugh as we picture this possibility; the character &quot;Dorian Greene&quot; makes as laugh as we complete the subtle reference. Dorain GREENE!!! While the book always puts me in stitches, I find it somehow awfully depressing. In the end, Toole seems to tell us that only those who are the most out of touch with their surroundings and their objective realities are our true geniuses. The rest of us become the dunces in confederacy. I gave this book a ten because in addition to providing us with well-developed characters, a side-splitting tale, and an interesting setting, Toole uses those instruments to communicate that dismal prediction. It kills me that we don't have Toole around to entertain us further and expound on his theories about society. But then, I don't know Toole's personal history, and perhaps he felt besieged by a similar confederacy."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Scan the numeric ratings given to this American literary masterpiece by the previous reviewers.

I am still moved to hysterical laughter by much of the comedy in the book, and I am amazed at how timely the book remains even now in its 35th year, to our knowledge, of existence. I did my master's thesis on the sociolinguistic aspects of the novel. My thesis was, and remains six years later, that the more standard the speech of the character, the more non-standard, unorthodox, and downright crazy that character is. Ignatius himself is a grand example of just such a paradox, and Myrna (that saucy minx) is not far behind. Meanwhile, Irene, Santa, and Angelo, with their Gulf Southern Gulf Central dialect, are the &quot;salt of the earth,&quot; who are not very smart, but are as good and genuine as any positive person you could hope to meet. And then there is Jones, whose Ebonics dialect is amazingly well captured by Toole. He is the character who, though with some flaws, makes a vital connection between the presence of Ignatius Jacques Reilly and real trouble. I love this book and I will always consider it my favorite novel because it is so lively that the characters quickly become old friends to you. I appreciate the plot twists and levels, and I am intrigued by the delicate mixture of the hilarious with the profane, the disgusting items with the episodes of genuinely sensitive moments. I am always amazed at Toole's awesome ability to mix various members of society as it was in New Orleans and have them come alive as non-stereotypical, believable, if artsy, characters. I will always regret that the circumstances of John Kennedy Toole's writing life did not work positively and happily for him in his lifetime. Still I am grateful to Thelma Toole for her persistence in getting the novel published."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"&quot;A perfect 10? Really?&quot; you ask. How could it not be?

The beauty is in the language and the imagery. American English hasn't been used so artfully in a century or so; it is flowery, floriferous, and florid. The imagery is so deceptive in its simplicity, one is amazed the technique isn't commonplace. Toole describes scenes as we would see them but would be unable to describe adequately.

We should weep for the loss of John Kennedy Toole"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The funniest book, by far, that I have ever read.Mr Toole's genius runs rampant through every page.Ignatius, mother with her wine in the oven, Jonesin a cloud of smoke working for minimal wage, Mancuscosniffing and dripping in public toilets, and allthe rest of these magical characters are a gift tohumanity. Each time I read it, it gets better. Thetragedy of Mr Toole's personal story is almost offset by thescope of this brilliant work. I often give thanksto Mrs. Toole for not giving up, and finally beingable to share her son's gift with the rest of us."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I'll admit to chuckling at times while reading this book, but in my opinion it's far from the greatest comic novel ever written as some make it out to be. Toole's representation of the lower strata of New Orleans society was more effective to me than the exaggerated humor represented by I.J. Reilly. About half way through the novel, Reilly started to wear thin on me, and I garnered more amusement from some of the secondary characters, like the factory owner and his wife, and Reilly's radical girlfriend. A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is not a bad novel, and had Toole not taken his own life, he could well have become a major author, but for humor, writers like Roth, Irving, Heller, West, and Vonnegut, are more to my taste."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Another reviewer wrote that this book was the funniest he'd ever read and I totally agree with him. The characters, starting with the bizarre Ignatius P. Reilly, are to die for. Knowing some of the characters who hang out in 'The Quarter', I realize that Toole used character-types that he had encountered in Louisiana and especially odd-ball New Orleans.After over 900 reviews I won't even make a stab at summarizing this wonderful book but, as most of you know, Toole unfortunately committed suicide before publication or even acceptance. I heard that his mother, on finding the manuscript in his apartment, haunted agent/publisher offices until she found someone who would actually read it. The rest is history.Toole wrote another book, \\"The Neon Bible\\", when he was only 17. I recommend that those who love 'Confederacy' pick up 'Neon.' It is a very different book than 'Confederacy' but the insights about human nature that Toole had at only age 17 are awesome, even a little frightening. When I think about Toole's suicide, I think about these two books...maybe Toole knew too much and what he knew, killed him.Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"funniest book i have ever read. i have recommended this book to friends and co-workers. no one isdisappointed. i have given up trying to get my original copy back. i now own one that i refuse to lend.a true must read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius J. Reilly is quite an interesting character. At times, I wanted him to succeed so badly that when he finally mucks things up, I wanted to ring his neck. It's just this kind of love-hate connection to the character that made this book so funny and such a quick page-turner. The author also gets New Orleans just right, from the locations to the accents of the various characters. The dialogue is never boring, trite or hokey, it flows well and even makes the odd and dissonant Ignatius read as a flesh and blood person and not a fictional hodge-podge of opinions. A great pleasure, highly recommended..."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is a story about a very weird bunch of characters. Reading this was kind of like watching 40 year old virgin and Benny hill goofyness. Some of the comedy is moronic and strange but this book was hilarious. The guy who wrote this must have been one strange individual. He couldn't get his book published and killed himself. Then his mother took the manuscript and got it published and it won a pulizter! LMAO. I enjoyed reading it, but you have to take this book in the context its written in. It is meant to be a goofy, juvenile ridiculous book. If you cant read something like that don't bother you won't like this book. The main character is something else. HE IS VERY WEIRD!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have never met another person who has read the book and not loved it. When I was about ten years old, my mom was in the bookstore and couldn't decide on anything so I showed her this knowing nothing about it but liking the name and the cover. Quickly it spread through my family and finally to every generation. The imagination that went into this book is so unique and funny, and some may say tragic. Yet, though it is widely known that Toole died (suicide) w/out attempting to publish this, I cannot help but believe that this book had to be a grand triumph for Toole, if even a triumph through the acknowledgment of living a ridiculous life in a ridiculous world. (I am not referring to his suicide incidentally) And no insult to Toole, but only the grand finale that so many people come to and after which they resign to higher freedom with less answers. Anyway, there is no need to analyze this. There's really nothing I can say other than that you might find more humor in this book than you thought the world could hold. As long as you've picked up a single work of fiction and enjoyed it, I'd say this is a safe bet. The ultra-literate don't hype this up like other books but can't deny it's brilliance and those just looking for good character development and a good story will be hard pressed to find anything better (maybe ever). I hope you buy C.O.D.'s and convince others to read it. FINAL POINT: if there was ever a book not to be apprehensive about buying, this is it. That is, unless you've got some really serious hangups regarding civil rights. There are hardly any particulars in life that one can count on for joy. Joy is usually unexpected. Yet, almost without deviation, this book brings joy to everyone who reads it. R.I.P. John Kennedy Toole.I'll recommend another book that is also fun only because the author has passed on and wrote enough books that not too many people take him seriously. The book I'll mention is pretty hilarious.

'Confederacy of Dunces' is genius."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This Pulitzer Prize winning novel, is very funny. The main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, is an obese, strangely dressed, man whose highly intelligent vocabulary adds to the comedy of this zany adventure. After reading the book I listened to it on CD and enjoyed hearing the dialogue as it made the characters come alive."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"One of the reasons this book made it into my top 25 list (see homepage) is that I found it very funny.I stopped laughing when I read the true story that the writer himself never got to see his book published and that in fact no one wanted to publish it. His mother had to sit down in the office of a a literature professors at some small university demanding that he should read the manuscript, or she wouldn't leave his office. He liked it and helped get it published and it won the Pullizer prise the year it came out.Does anyone know how difficult it is to write good humour. There are billions of suspense novels, zillions of contemporary novels, thrillions of science fiction and fantasy books, but only a handful of really funny books (Mark Twains short stories, The witches books of terry Pratchet, Calvin &amp; Hobbs cartoons, the Topper books). John Kennedy Tool is a genius who died to young and his hero, &quot;Ignatius J. Reilly is a grotesque, a gargantua, who lumbers through New Orleans leaving chaos in his wake&quot; and he also leaves chaos among the reviewers in Amazon.com and why? Because humour are so difficult and so individual. Either you love it or you don't. Either or is normal.A deeply funny book, that will prolong the life of many people."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is a novel people either love or hate, a one star or five star book. Those who give it one star often state they don't understand why others think it so funny. I won't pretend to answer for everybody, but I can give one or two possible explanations for my rating.As revolting as we find the notion, many of us see a little bit of ourselves in Ignatius J. Reilly. All of us can be critical of others, thinking ourselves or the organizations we belong to better than, at least, SOME other person or individual out there, in a variety of areas(race, religion, politics, intelligence, morality).Also, many of us have compromised our ideals and our future hopes &amp; directions as Ignatius has (although he thinks of himself as a profound writer, his longest-lasting job is as hot dog vendor). One of the funniest scenes of the novel is when Ignatius is negotiating his salary as file clerk. Believing himself better than the $60/week salary offered, his interest changes when he finds out his employer will include bus fare in the offer.Besides the reasons stated in the pop psychology above, I also enjoyed the novel because of the flow of the language, the glimpse into an &quot;other class&quot; side of life we may not be familiar with, and the idiosyncrasies of the characters brought to life by the author."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is hilarious - a must read! The first time I read it, I couldn't help laughing out loud. If you just need something that's fun to read, this book is it!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book in print; however, readers from Louisiana and especially the New Orleans area should beware of the unabridged recorded version. This city has many many idiosyncratic pronunciations of street names, etc., French as well as Native American, (e.g., Tchoupitoulas St.). The recorded version is rife with mispronunciations, which is a real distraction to readers from that area. The New Orleans accent is also unique to the South, and it is this reader's fondest wish that those who record books about southern Louisiana be more careful in recruiting native Orleanian or Cajun readers, or at least long-time residents of those areas in order to have the accent be more authentic."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"My God, what a beautiful story! I have never laughed at a written work so hard in my life as the first time I read *A Confederacy of Dunces* during a summer break when I was twenty years old. John Kennedy Toole's dialogue -- sometimes witty, sometimes deliciously dumb -- pierces the the quaint pieties of Southern America and the staunch dogma of the Catholic Church as both institutions are hurtled into the frenetic dystopia of the future. Behold Ignatius Reilly, self-righteous hypocrite and bygone moral authority: so loudly out of place in his own century that he both condemns and embodies the sins and petty schemes of a civilization in collapse.In reading *Dunces*, I was haunted by the author's ultimate tragedy, as I'm sure most readers are. The dialogue is so rich, the characters so compulsively funny -- so *intimately* funny -- that after frequently laughing so hard I gasped for air, I became outraged at the literary establishment that passed on this brilliant work, and at the vicious elite that drives its brightest talents to desperation.*Dunces* gave me a love for New Orleans that I have never been able to pay back with a personal visit. Sadly, the New Orleans of John Kennedy Toole's masterpiece has been devastated by Hurricane Katrina. By most accounts, it seems that the Crescent City will never be the same, largely due to George W. Bush and his own confederacy of dunces who failed to rescue the drowning city for nearly a week in 2005.It is likely that *A Confederacy of Dunces* will be one of a very few American comic novels to merit preservation for the next several centuries. I pray that the city that gave birth to it will live as long."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is a great read and you will be falling over from laughter.

If you've never read it, get this book NOW!!!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"\\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is one of my all-time favorite novels. Set in 1960s New Orleans, it tells the story of Ignatius J. Reilly, a pompous, self-important, obese slob who still lives with his mother and has delusions of grandeur while constantly being shocked by the state of the modern world and half-heartedly attempting to keep a job and write a novel.Based on this and Toole's \\"Neon Bible,\\" it's a tragedy that he passed away so young, as we'd lost one of America's great novelists before we knew he existed.One of the finest aspects of the novel is Toole's remarkable ability to convey the particular patois and accent that belongs specifically to Southeastern Louisiana, and more specifically, New Orleans.Rarely has a book actually made me laugh out loud, but \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" did just that several times. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.So many authors are always attempting the proverbial \\"great American novel.\\" With \\"Dunces,\\" Toole may juat have accomplished that feat."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"John Kennedy Toole committed suicide so I'm sure if he live to see his story gain such success but if you haven't read it, it's a laugh out loud joy.

I laughed out loud until i cried. This book is brilliant!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The book A Confederacy of Dunces is wonderful, yet terrible. Its main character, Ignatius J Reilly, is a learned yet pompous jerk. Though there are many other characters that are as annoying as Mr. Reilly, he is by far the most heard of in the book. I happen to have had the not so wonderful pleasure of meeting someone quite similar to Mr. Reilly, and trust me it's not as \\"interesting\\" as one would think. Ignatius waltzes around everywhere he goes thinking that he is wonderful and that despite the great odds, he is right and everyone else is wrong. His sole ability is to instill a passionate anger and deep resentment in people.For me, throughout the book, Ignatius is not so much the character you love to hate, just the character you hate. He is rude, a slob, and stuck-up. Mr. Reilly speaks down to all, except of course the only person he obeys, his one-and-only pyloric valve, which is constantly closing and opening giving him great trouble. He floats around from one job to a second job and then stops. He worked at Levy Pants and was promptly fired for starting a riot of all things. He then became a hotdog vendor. This was an awful job for him because he had to walk around all day selling horrible hotdogs. And as some of you may know, Ignatius is a). Not the most normal looking person, even in New Orleans, and b). Ignatius hates walking. Plus when he is working as a hotdog salesman he is rude to people and even refuses some people hotdogs. On top of all of this, he brings the owner of the company very little money, mainly because he eats most of the hotdogs while attempting to sell them. Ignatius was never willing or ready to work, and I seriously doubt that if the story continued he would.The story continues in its annoying way for a while. It introduces new characters, and makes plot changes, for instance, when Myrna Minkoff comes into the scene, writing constantly to Ignatius about how well her campaign is going. We're not exactly sure what their relationship is, though. And how could we forget Mr. and Mrs. Levy? Mrs. Levy did so terribly on her psychiatry test that people couldn't even give her an \\"F.\\" And then there's Mr. Levy, who hates his father's company so much he won't give it so much as a glance. The plot keeps things moving along for a while in everyone's case. But something that amazes me is that Toole is able to unravel such a twisted plot, and have the book still dish-out such huge amounts of justice.Everyone else gets what they deserve in the end, everyone that is except for Ignatius. Ignatius is spared. From my point of view this is the worst possible ending -- for Ignatius anyway. Some people might argue with me, but I know for sure that most readers will most definitely share my view. The ending, the part that's supposed to unravel it all and bring the wrath of the hammer of justice down upon all who are deserving of it, fails. The guiltiest man is spared. Ignatius gets away unscathed and intact. This angered me so much that I forced myself to try and see something that I was missing.The answer to why Ignatius doesn't get his just desserts finally came to me in an extremely clich&eacute;d epiphany. I had been asking the question, \\"When, if ever, would Ignatius get what he had coming?\\" And I realized that there was only one answer. The gears that turned Ignatius' wheels of justice had no teeth. Nothing too terrible ever happened to Ignatius because the gears that brought down justice would just slip and slide across one-another. I also realized that this rule can be applied to so many of all the fools of the world. Fools are able to blindly bumble through life, and come out virtually untouched. In a weird way the idiots of the world are eerily protected by some anti-karmic force. This is why Ignatius gets away with all of his shenanigans.John Kennedy Toole is a wonderful writer. And he can make the most annoying interactions seem quite funny. The book is well written and has such a wonderful topic, yet for anyone who has ever met an Ignatius before, the book will definitely be a different read -- not necessarily worse or better, but different."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is one of my favorite all time classics. It is also the only book I have ever read that I had to put down because I was laughing too hard to read it. It is funnier if you have ever been to New Orleans and understand their accent. I lived there for a year so I was able to pick it up quickly. Put this book on your must read list. Interesting note: The author committed suicide before the book was ever published or won the Pulizter. What a shame. I hope he is laughing in heaven.

The continuously alienated Ignatious seeks through a variety of pauper-like jobs to find his freedom from his mother and overweight physical bearing. Farce after farce reveals itself as Ignatious becomes a victim of the bureaucratized, run-down, corrupt, Southern capitalist system of New Orleans. Ironic is the tone and tome of the book, as perhaps the same sluggishness that characterized many of the characters of the book was present in the dense, muggy climate of New Orleans pre-Katrina."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces basks in the same limelight as the acting of Laurel and Hardy or The Three Stooges through John Kennedy Toole's character Ignatius Reilly. A Confederacy of Dunces truly is an American novel whose characters are over the top, who all like to hate the quasi(?) intellectual protagonist, fat and flatulent Ignatius Reilly. Self-absorbed and flat-out wrong most of the time, Ignatius pinballs his way through life comically messing up anyone and everyone (who has the misfortune to run into him) through his bungling, over-bearing thought process. A great read, a great book. Kudos to John Kennedy Toole."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Anyone who cannot appreciate John Kennedy Toole's humour needs some serious therapy. Several years ago, I read this as part of an informal reading group. The characters are memorable. The plot is unforgettable. Leave your prejudices and bad mood at the door. It is NOT advisable, however, to read this in public - people moved away from me in the CTA because I couldn't control the snorting, guffawing and sheer laughing out loud. I still look forward to re-reading this book..."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I'm not going to lie: almost every time I have ever been forced to read a book or story for any sort of class, I end up hating the book, just because I start to associate it with my teachers, or just school in general, two things I've never particularly liked. However, Confederacy of Dunces, which I had to read for one of my classes at Cornell University my freshman year did not suffer this fate at all; it is by far one of the funniest, most innovative books I have ever read in my life and would recommend it to anybody who considers his or herself funny. As an avid Simpsons viewer, I was delighted to see the tremendous (no pun on Ignatius' size intended) similarities between main character Ignatius T. Reilly and Star Trek geek, the famous Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons. Both characters consider themselves to be geniuses, surrounded by a confederacy of dunces, are disgusting goliaths, are extremely rigid in their actions, and the thing I find funniest, speak in such an outdated and complex way! I the case of the Comic Book Guy this means commanding Lisa by saying, \\"Answer me these questions three,\\" instead of speaking to her in normal order, or Ignatius whining, \\"My olfactories are already beginning to send out distress signals,\\" instead of saying, \\"This place smells.\\" The similarities continue: both characters live in towns filled with complete idiots, Homer exemplifying the dunces of Springfield, and Ignatius' mother, a prominent fool in Ignatius' world. Despite the fact that everyone around them is a complete \\"mongloid\\" as Ignatius would say, the hilarious thing is that these men are no less like children than Lisa or Bart Simpson: Ignatius still lives at home and relies on his mother for food and financial help, Comic Book Guy is obsessed with his comic book facts that have little value to anyone, both are unbelievably out of shape and often helpless because of this (in one episode, Comic Book Guy rips the back of his pants ice skating, and can do nothing, and Ignatius is limited in his actions throughout the novel), and the list continues. The most amazing thing about these similarities is the fact that John Kennedy Toole wrote this book nearly a half-century before Comic Book Guy ever made it into the world. That a character from a novel so long ago, can have a clone in one of the world's funniest shows of all time shows how hilarious of a character Ignatius is. Senses of humor change: watch Leave it to Beaver, and you might just have to kill yourself, and no doubt people from that era would be horrified at some of the things we find funny today. As well as being a great comedy with parallels to the Simpsons, the story itself is an intricate and well written series of carefully interwoven lives that affect each other in small but important ways until a fantastic and fitting ending that leaves you wanting much, much more. I recommend this book to everyone: it will have you rolling because of Ignatius' ridiculous antics, and devouring each page to find out what kind of problem he will end up in next. Read this book, if you've got a sense of humor!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It's just a shame that he only wrote two books before committing suicide."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Imagine a massively obese middle-aged man, who always wears the same hunting cap and parka, living in a small shack with his mother, and handwriting his magnum opus on the decline of the West since the glorious medieval era. His mother constantly hounds him to find gainful employment, leading him to bizarre misadventures as an office clerk and hot dog vendor. How could this situation not be funny?Some reviewers talk about the latent sadness in this book. It's hard to see, unless you empathize with Ignatius, or imagine that the author empathized with him. I myself empathized with Ignatius-- perhaps a little too strongly-- as I read this book during a period of unemployment and have always had academic aspirations. Some will easily discredit and dismiss Ignatius and his pen pal Myrna-- but isn't it somewhat sad that someone as astute and creative as Ignatius won't find a place in this world unless he fits into some kind of occupational niche?But hey, maybe I'm being a bit too heavy-- the book's damn funny. My favorite scene: when Ignatius writes a fake letter, pretending to be his boss, threatening to \\"lash the pathetic shoulders\\" of an unsatisfied customer.

I have heard from several college buddies and teachers that I would like the dark humor and character study aspect of it. I really enjoyed this book. It's funny and very interesting. It grabbed my attention from the very first chapter. Normally I read non-fiction because it takes too long for the story to grab hold of me. This was not the case with \\"A Confederacy of Dunces.\\" The descriptive language, the characters, the twists were all well crafted and well written. I loved the interplay between the seemingly non-connected character, and how they all got tangled up in the wake of Ignatius J.

I would recommend to fans of Vonnegut, because of the similar dark humor and social commentary."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"\\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" will never be loved by the masses. Satire is a close cousin to sarcasm, and as any practicer of sarcasm will tell you - not everyone gets it. Dennis Miller is either a genius or an idiot depending on the listeners in the audience. That is the best way to describe, \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" - you will either love it or hate.... probably not too much in between.Ignatius Reilly may be the most colorful character written in the 20th century. He is rude, oddly intelligent on obscure ways, racist, narcissistic, and completely insane. He combines every bad mannered characteristic that you have encountered. You are supposed to both hate and pity his pathetic existence. This is the genius of John Kennedy Toole - he has created a character that is larger than life and has illuminated the insanity of his narcissistic ramblings.I am not sure ow to explain the writing style - it can be difficult to follow. At times Toole changes perspective from paragraph to paragraph and intermingles the characters thoughts almost randomly. The prose is vey strong, but \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" was a slow read for me. it is difficult to explain it, but the style is similar to Faulkner - and it certainly is not everyone.Many people compare \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" toDon Quixotebut to me it reminds me more ofA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. All three combine ridiculous scenes, and some not-so-subtle social commentary. However, Toole is able to match the wit of Twain but is able to elevate the style of writing. One of the criticisms of Twain was that he wrote children's books (an unfair criticism in my view). Make no mistake - Toole has written a book for adults (and parts are rather vulgar).Final Verdict - It really is a shame that Toole only left us this one work - perhaps he would have never been able to match \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" but it would have been interesting to have seen how he progressed as a writer.5 Stars"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It seems that half the reviews of this book together form a collective discussion of whether the book is \\"funny\\" or not. This argument misses the point. While the book is darkly humorous, that alone wouldn't make it a great book, which it is.The simple fact is that this is a fantastic, American novel. It deals with the classic American themes of freedoms, race, ambition, and self-definition. It rises above exploiting stereotypes and actually explores them. It adds something to psychology instead of haphazardly and incoherently borrowing from it, as so many other novels do.Don't read this book \\"because it's funny;\\" Read it because it is a great book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Most folks it seems abhor reading with a near violent, reflexive revulsion. Almost as if the mere suggestion would cause a spontaneous eruption of projectile vomiting directed forthwith at the unfortunate proposer. People just hate to read. But this is a book that could inspire a change of heart in even the most hard-core anti-literate. It's a clich&eacute; you've heard a million times before (with a strong contempt for empty superlatives it's not something very likely to arise from this source again), but Confederacy of Dunces was a genuine pleasure to read.Anybody who can't understand why this book has such a strong and enduring popularity probably didn't like the Seinfeld show. Two guys created Seinfeld, Jerry and Larry David, the latter arguably providing the majority creative input. This book has a tremendous deal in common with both Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm, so much so it's safe to call it a dirty precursor to both. The absurdist humor derived from the ridiculousness so commonplace in the mundane every-day takes a very particular perspective to appreciate, and reframe in a comedic fashion. As testament to the success of both this book, and those shows witness the massive commercial and critical success of both. If you happen to find yourself in the small minority who doesn't appreciate this type of humor, then you won't enjoy this book.The understated subtlety of this work belies a masterfully sophisticated writing style and truly original story. In addition to being hilarious, this book is a celebration of a powerfully individualistic personality (and of individualism itself), and though they are rebuffed as deviants by the collective, it's a reminder of how important authentic iconoclasts are in our increasingly conformist society."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The first time I started reading this (many years ago) I was probably about 20 or 21. It was on the suggestion of someone older than me, who's opinion I valued, and who kept talking about how hilarious the book was. I got a chapter or two into the book and gave it up, disappointed as I didn't think it was funny at all.Time goes by (several years) and I pick the book up again to have another go at it. The book is amazing! It is not funny as in 'funny HA-HA', so if you go in expecting that you will, like I was the first time, find yourself disappointed. However, if you allow yourself to take the trip and see the characters and the situations, I don't know of many better ways you could spend your time.I love this book and if you are just about to read it for the first time, I actually envy you!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"We have seen the character of Ignatius J.

Is he Huck Finn navigating the gothic waters of a South filled with disparate quirky characters and a whole host of preconceptions, misconceptions, and derelictions? Ignatius is all of these and more. The real genius of Toole's sprawling tragi-comedy \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is the uniqueness of the main character and the cast of dunces at the fringes, the fringes of the tale and the fringes of society.When people talk of this novel, they talk of its humor. I didn't find it rolling on the floor funny, like I have with books like \\"Catch-22\\", or parts of some of Don DeLillo's novels. But I did find several scenes so uncommonly placed together with an imaginative patchwork of human freakish delights that it couldn't help but place a tattoo on your brain. That's a little deeper than laughing sometimes. There's the \\"Night of Joy\\" bar where Jones rearranges the dust on the floor and the proprietress takes charitable donations for an orphanage (illicit racy picture ring in reality). There are the misguided political rallies that I.J. Reilly heads up at Levy pants and another for a drag queen party that turn out to be not more than Quixote swashbuckling a wooden sword at spinning windmill blades. The beauty is that people take part for the entertainment, for the diversion from boredom, for the fact of being human and reveling in Reilly's misguided idealism for kicks and grins.To cap off the novel, for the ending there is an escape (not to give it away with details) with a little future hope thrown on top of all the mired downtrodden tragi-comedy we've come to know and love as Reilly journeys along searching for the right words to scrawl across the myriad of Big Chief tablets strewn across his medieval cave of a room. To give the author credit it becomes a suspenseful escape, one that we as readers care about and leaves us with some hopes. What more could you want in a novel? So from Myrna Minx, Miss Trixie, and Paradise Dogs, read on brothers and sisters, WHOA!!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The story is well-known that John Kennedy O'Toole killed himself before he and his wonderful book could be discovered thanks to the insistent efforts of his mother. What is less well-known is just how enjoyable reading this book is. Ignatius O'Reilly is one of the finest, most amusing characters ever to walk through the pages of a book. Once you meet him, he'll occupy a permanent little corner in your mind and you'll laugh every time you remember."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I loved this book! The characters are outrageous and hilarious! It is one of the few books that I can quote from after reading it at least six years ago! Many of my friends loved it too. To me, it is a 'cult type' book. You either get the humor or your don't. I was saddened to hear that the author had committed suicide. He was quite a wit!!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is a remarkable book - a true classic masterpiece. It is funny and warm and insightful and is written in language that is moving and engrossing. This is a book that grabbed me and wouldn't allow me to put it down. It is a shame that Toole's dream of having this book published wasn't realized while he was alive. His suicide was a waste of fantastic talent."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius Reilly is an over-educated medievalist philosopher who lives with his mom and can't seem to hold a job. He is also quite possibly the most entertainingly original character in all of American literature. His misadventurous exploits are unlike anything you can possibly imagine, and if you aren't careful you'll laugh so hard that you'll hurt yourself."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I am utterly obsessed with this novel. I am an avid reader and finally got around to reading this gem, never imagining that it would affect me so profoundly. Ignatius is a fictional character without equal - unparalled in his bombastic ramblings, unabashed egotism, and unintentional wit. A Confederacy of Dunces is an irreverent comedy, tinged with undertones of sadness and apathy. I have read and re-read passages that have caused me to both chuckle and laugh out loud. In my opinion, an unquestionable must read!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Bought this book sight unseen from QPB a few years ago and was absolutely amazed, as was the professor quoted in the foreword, at its high quality. As the first person to publish Emily Dickinson's poems must have felt, surely no writer this good could possibly have gone unpublished!I have read thousands of novels over the years and maintained my own personal reviews and ratings. My highest rating, five stars, is reserved for true classics that reward unlimited re-readings. Very few books receive that accolade. This is one. &quot;Dunces&quot; is one of the funniest books ever published in the English language, tragicomic in the Rabelaisan, Cervantes sense of the word, but also falling-down-on-the-floor hilarious. Laughed 'til the tears came, and then I couldn't stop weeping. Couldn't stop turning pages, just to see what could possibly happen next.It is tempting to regret Toole's death, and to wonder if perhaps he would have produced more works of this caliber. In great art, though, quantity seldom equals quality. Toole was a shooting star who captured in &quot;Dunces&quot; his bittersweet understanding of the human condition for the edification of all future generations."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Looking for an American Literary Classic? Discard those notions of \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" or \\"Tom Sawyer\\" or the like. This is the greatest book written by an American author, and one of the greatest ever written. It's on the level of Don Quixote (indeed, the main character, Ignatius, could be compared to Don Quixote), on the level of any great novel ever written. what makes it so great? The comedy of Ignatius, the philosophical, obese, lazy man who thinks to highly of himself and who any Native New Orleans resident could compare to someone they once met (I was born and raised down there. I can think of at least 3 people myself.) There's also the tradgedy of poor Mrs Reily, the vagrant Jones who needs to work as a porter to evade jail time, and the depressing Officer Mancuso who is looked down on so by his commanding officer. There's also the realism of the city, or indeed, the country depicted here: The failing Levy factory, The sleazy Night of Joy bar, and the strange residents of The Big Easy who interact with each other so comically throughout the book. This blend of such ideals react to make a classic novel.Why must our high school students be forced to deal with the dated ideals of \\"Huckleberry Finn\\", ecspecially when it (and other novels) are passed as comedies? Although Confederacy of Dunces is 40 years old (published around 20 years ago), it still pertains greatly to today's social ideals and is still hilarious. This is the kind of comedy and realism that should be passed through the teenage mind.Still, it's for everyone. Yes, It does pertain more to New Orleans residents/natives, but everyone will find parallels with their own lives in this novel. They will find great amounts of humor through the protagonist and the people he affects. And they will, indeed, find a great novel that can be treasured for ages."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Anyone who is looking for that gem, searching far and wide to find that one book that must be read: look no further! This is one of the best books I've ever read, even better than Catch 22 and Kurt Vonnegut's The Sirens of Titan.If you're tired of books being called \\"hilarious romps\\" when they rarely make you fall out of your chair laughing, then find refuge in A Confederacy of Dunces. You won't regret it. (And a keep a dictionary handy.)"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Have you ever found a book that you re-read every few years and see in a new light each time? This is one of those books. O'Toole shows an almost Einsteinian genius for seeing the same people, things and events quite differently through the eyes of his different characters. To Jones, Ignatius is &quot;that green-cap, fat mother.&quot; To Mrs. Levy, he's &quot;the young idealist.&quot; To patrolman Mancuso, he's &quot;a suspicious character.&quot; To Lana Lee, he's &quot;a threat to her investment.&quot; To the aspiring exotic dancer Darlene, he's &quot;the big crazyman.&quot; To his long suffering mother, he's the perfect son (for a while, anyway). To sweet Santa Battaglia, he's &quot;that Ignatius.&quot; To himself, of course, he's the last word on &quot;decency and geometry.&quot; What O'Toole pulls off, amazingly, is to present each view in a convincing, believable way. (Given the plain craziness of this book, that in itself is an accomplishment.) The comedy, absurdity and sheer lunacy of the scenes, events and dialogue in this book are brilliant: Ignatius' letter to Abelman's Dry Goods (&quot;Mr. I. Abelman, Mongoloid, Esq...If you molest us again, sir...Yours in Anger...&quot;); Jones' running commentary (&quot;Hey!...Whoa!...Oo-wee&quot;); Darlene's careful practice for her big opening night (&quot;There sure was plenty balls at that ball...&quot;); Ignatius' take on the nude photo of Darlene reading Boethius (&quot;Some destitute woman intellectual was doing anything for a dollar.&quot;); Santa's compassion and way with words (&quot;Get the hell away from that stove Charmaine and go play on the banquette before I bust you right in the mouth...Lord,them kids is sweet...Charmaine! Get the hell outside and go play on your bike before I come slap your face off.&quot;) There is so much here. Despite the obvious comedy, there is a serious side here, too, that's hard to put your finger on. Walker Percy's Foreward says of the book, &quot;It is also sad. One never quite knows where the sadness comes from....&quot; True enough. I'm hardly the first to say you will either love it or hate it. In any event, simply the number of reviews here tells you it's no ordinary work."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is the kind of book that a person rarely buys on his/her own inspiration. It isn't a New York Times bestseller. It isn't one in a series. It isn't by a well-known author. And the first character the reader encounters is loud, tremendously overweight, strangely dressed and possibly mentally ill man who doesn't immediately arouse the typical reader's sympathies. If you skipped the prologue and just began reading the first page or two while standing in a bookstore, you might not even be impressed. But read just a little while longer and author Toole will have sunk his hooks into you. This book is an odd masterpiece. It's a comic tour-de-force whose characters shine. It's Seinfeld set in the seedy side of New Orleans. It's what would happen if comedian Lewis Black finally snapped and moved from Manhattan to the Creole Capital. It's absurd, but it is even more funny.If you don't believe me, just read the prologue someday. Walker Percy recounts how this manuscript first came to his attention. He discusses how he tried and tried to get out of having to read it. Eventually he decided that he'd just read a few pages so that he could honestly say that it was no good and be done with it. But after picking up the script, he writes that he first endured a &quot;sinking feeling&quot; when he realized it was better than he thought; then later, he had a &quot;prickle of interest&quot;; finally, he writes, &quot;surely it was not possible that it was so good.&quot;But it is that good: it won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. The tragedy is that John Kennedy Toole isn't a better known author -- he killed himself in 1969. This book certainly is a fantastic way of keeping his memory alive."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Do you have one of those friends that always seems to be getting themselves into the strangest situations? That is just a bit - off? This book allows us to follow an oafish, irritable, hilarious, charming, clueless man as he makes his way from adventure to adventure, job to job. Our hero, Iganacious, has an opinion about EVERYTHING - his jobs, the people he meets, his mother, his bloated body. The normal parts of life - taking a cab, stopping for a bite to eat, shopping - are always fodder for a funny episode with Ignacious.This book is charming. It is funny. It is easy to read. Even though Ignacious is truly a horrible guy - everything he touches seems to lead to problems for other people - you can't help but laugh and enjoy his company. Whether he is leading factory workers on a strike that ends in nothing more substantial than a broken flower pot, or whether he is crashing and ruining a ladies' auxiliary art show, Ignacious always seems to find the world not quite as he expects it to be. As each new day starts, you find yourself wondering &quot;what next?&quot; As you turn the pages, you're never sure what new funny adventure he'll lead you on. The writing is crisp and fun, and you will immediately tumble into the twisted, convoluted, bizarre, obscene, cracked up world that Ignacious lives in. You'll even start thinking like he does a bit if you aren't careful.This book is fun - FUN! - and a quick read. It well deserves the Pulitzer it received. It's a hidden gem. Catch it!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces is fascinating not just for its very interesting background story or its masterful wit and phrasing: part of the greatness here is that most of us (I think?) have encountered some intellectual who, like Ignatius, seems to be attached to some better time or philosophy, constantly offended by the frivolity and lack of dignity of modernity. His sense of superiority and disapproval will induce belly laughs if you have ever associated with college undergrads who aspire to be serious academics.Myrna Minkoff, our hero's object of disgust/love is a caricature of espresso swilling, nietzche quoting college girls who are \\"just doing it for the cause\\" (or maybe just feel important...)If you are a student or a medievalist, if you have ever been oppressed by that vixen Fortuna or known yourself to have a rich Inner Life that the philistines around you would clearly be incapable of understanding, the book will be a sure favorite."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The power of this unquestionably brilliant literary work is the fusion of highbrow intellect with strategically incisive lowbrow absurdity. For that alone, the author has not only climbed Everest but staked his flag firmly at the peak. This flawless interweaving of the two \\"forces\\" (intellect and absurdity) forms one seamless garment of devastating comedy--with wit, in its truest and noblest sense, being the operative mechanism.The book's protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, is simultaneously repulsive and yet utterly beloved, for those who possess the means to perceive the undertones and deft brushstrokes of tragicomedy in which Toole cloaked his hero. He is astute and yet inane. He is virtuous and yet insane. And that's just the beginning. All that is required to truly revel in this gem-of-a-book is a genuine possession and/or grasp of...wit! It thrills me that this offering continues, by its very nature and existence, to actively separate the geniuses from the \\"dunces\\" of the titular \\"confederacy.\\"Ignatius J. Reilly is a slob to end all slobs. An overeducated sociopath living in near-squalor in early 1960s New Orleans, he observes the world through a dual lens of disdain and absolute fascination. This causes his \\"worldview\\" to be both spot-on and irrevocably skewed. There are key passages in this novel that point (with subtle but bracing measures of sadness and poignance) to certain traumatic events in Ignatius's formative years that have set him upon his current course of bluster and bilious obsession. Again, herein lies part of the glory of this work--an effortless fusion of truth and psychosis, via comedy. You despise Ignatius, yet you feel a curious sympathy for his plight...and the palpable melancholy that underlies his grandiosity.Ignatius's mother, Irene, is a confused, erratic, down-at-heel woman just past middle-age, torn between love for her behemoth son and her own sense that true contentment (which she's never had or perhaps deserved) is slipping away from her. She lives with her son as if not quite aware that she's housing a radioactive alien from another planet. The jaw-dropping rapport between the two is now the stuff of literary legend. When Fate (or \\"Fortuna\\") leads them from a drunken automobile mishap into a whirling cyclone of constant misadventure, the stage is set for an indictment of modernity the likes of which no other author of the past 100 years could possibly have crafted.The characters and denizens in this tour-de-farce are spun-out for the reader like Cleopatra being rolled from the interior of a carpet at the feet of Caesar. The reader is indeed \\"king\\" here, for the reader is instantly made sovereign \\"viewer\\" of a world that includes everything ~and~ the kitchen sink. We have Burma Jones, a jaded, near-vagrant, but visionary black janitor forced to work under the tyrannical rule of one Lana Lee: cold-hearted, scheming proprietress of a seedy Bourbon Street strip-club called \\"The Night of Joy.\\" There's Darlene, the good-hearted B-girl whose idea of stardom and self-improvement is moving from the stool to the stripping-pole (with pet in tow). There's Gus Levy, reasonable, rational playboy and put-upon owner of a dilapidated pants-factory and his wife, a terminally bored harridan whose questionable \\"interests\\" sow hilarious chaos and oppression upon everyone remotely connected with her life (except for her \\"true love\\"--her sexually stimulating exercise \\"board\\").There's Patrolman Mancuso, a dimwitted member of the police force who must prove his mettle or suffer humiliating consequences at every turn. There's Mancuso's aunt, Santa Battaglia, a froggy-voiced old bawd who appoints herself matchmaker, bowling coach, and all-around Svengali to the dizzy Irene Reilly and her sinking fortunes. There's the inimitable Miss Trixie, an octogenarian accountant at Levy Pants who is too senile and exhausted to do anything except wander aimlessly (\\"as if tacking into a gale\\") toward interference and the vague hope for Easter hams and the paradise of \\"retirement.\\" Of course, there is Myrna Minkoff, the \\"minx,\\" the nymphomaniac beatnik who is both Ignatius' nemesis and, ostensibly, his secret love.The manner in which all of these characters somehow manage to collide or affect each other toward eventual ruin and/or redemption is delineated in a mastercraft of plot, sub-plots, and brilliant \\"asides\\" approaching pure sorcery. Toole's work is never anything less than rib-crunching, knee-slapping, brain-freakingly hilarious on a multitude of levels. Every line of madcap dialogue, every gesture, every plot device, every motif, every \\"prop\\" is flawless. To reiterate, the comedy comes at you from the stratosphere, from the gutter, from the mundane, and everything in-between. The sheer cohesion of all these levels is the key that makes it not only a superior work in a lofty sense, but eminently readable in an almost base, common way. Pure magic. The coup de grace is that the \\"dunces\\" of Reilly's (and Toole's) world don't \\"get it,\\" and they're (still) apparently not meant to. Not allowed to. Oh, the irony!'A Confederacy of Dunces' is a must-have for any intelligent, genuinely witty reader, and that kind of reader always and obviously has room for the savoring of comedy. The book is as magnificent (if not quite as classic) in its own way as Cervantes' 'Don Quixote.' If you're one of The Chosen, don't read it in public. You'll be mistaken for a hysterical menace (as you're rolling on the floor, on the subway, perhaps) and they'll cart you off to Charity Hospital."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Very funny entertaining book.

In that respect he is similar to Melville's Bartleby, Cervantes' Don Quixote, and similar classic types. One never knows what he is going to do, what bizarre demonstration he will lead, what strange letter he will write, what paroxysm of self-assertion he will undergo.However, it may be the manner of narration, but this book just didn't \\"grab\\" me till halfway through.

There are two ways of looking at these classics--either for mere consumption, or, collecting them for your shelf to read and reread again. Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn were both books I would just not buy in cheapest form. The original reproduction prints, at around $12, are SO worth it. Books are more than just printed words. The bindings, the artwork, the way they heft and feel, and even smell, is important too. I still have an ancient copy of Treasure Island which is one of the coolest BOOKS I have.

In it, Ignatius J. Reilly, the pathetic, slovenly 30-something, highly literate but socially inept momma's boy has run-ins with the law, loses job after job and fails with women, all the while expounding his down-his-nose view of the world. The ultimate loser. This book is SO funny I constantly laugh out loud (it's one of the few books I've EVER read more than once). But it's also sad. A true tragicomedy. And it still reads as fresh as if it were written in today's world. Sadly, this was Toole's only full-length novel. But what a masterpiece it is!Not only is it funny as hell, but the dialogue is on the mark when it comes to New Orleans dialect. John Kennedy Toole had it down to a T. One of my favorite passages follows. It speaks of Santa Battaglia, aunt of Patrolman Mancuso, girlfriend of Ignatius J. Reilly's mother:---Santa grabbed the picture on the mantelpiece, a photograph of an ancient and hostile-looking woman in a black dress and black stockings standing in a dark alley paved with oyster shells.\\"Poor momma,\\" Santa said feelingly, giving the picture a loud, wet kiss. The grease on the glass that covered the photograph showed the frequency of these affectionate onslaughts. \\"You sure had it hard, kid.\\" The little black coals of Sicilian eyes glared almost animatedly at Santa from the snapshot. \\"The only picture of you I got, momma, and you standing in a alley. Ain't that a shame.\\"Santa sighed at the unfairness of it all and slammed the picture down on the mantelpiece among the bowl of wax fruit and the bouquet of paper zinnias and the statue of the Virgin Mary and the figurine of the Infant of Prague. Then she went back to the kitchen to get some ice cubes and one of the kitchen chairs. After she had returned with the chair and a little picnic cooler of ice cubes, she arranged her best jelly glasses on the mantelpiece before her mother's picture. The proximity of the picture made her grab it and kiss it again, the ice cube in her mouth cracking against the glass.--See what I mean?A Confederacy of Dunces is part slapstick, part tragedy, part philosophy, part soap opera, part crime novel, and part character sketch.This particular edition [1996, Wings Books (hardcover)] contains a sensitive and elucidating foreword by famous Southern writer Walker Percy. In it, he praises JKT both for his ability to put his finger on the pulse of New Orleans as well as for his character portrayal. Mr. Percy also explains how the novel first fell into his hands and ultimately how it came to be published."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Many critics have considered \\"A Confederacy Of Dunces\\" as a masterpiece among post-modern literature and reading through the novel really is some kind of enjoyment. The life of Ignatius J. Reilly, a very well educated 30-year-old man who goes to any lengths or rather doesn't go in order to not integrate himself into the \\"system\\", the modern world (by modern he means the entire time since the medievals) which he totally dislikes in all concerns, is presented in an at some place hilarious and diverting way. It is, however, a little on the long side; there are, for example, several intermissions which do not belong to the actual story but are Ignatius' own-written material in which he tries to point out all the negative aspects of this modern world he is forced to live in, but these are quite dispensable and not very amusing at all, even though it is all part of the irony which encloses Ignatius.Apart from that I can recommend the book, if you are looking for an entertaining novel, which is an extraordinary piece of literture, because it presents the live of an extraordinary man, and can connive some needless lengths. You will certainly laugh out loud at some points!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is farce. You are not supposed to identify with the main character, Ignatius. He is a despicable, foolish person.The few readers I know that didn't like or understand the book, had trouble with this concept. I heard, \\"I just hated that Ignatius\\" or \\"I don't get it.\\"Ignatius is delusional, and his twisted view of the world gets him into a lot of trouble. Think of Voltaire's Candide. Though Candide's problem was optimism....Ignatius' is something darker, more outlandish.A wonderful read. I've read it many times, and it never fails to make me laugh."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius J. Reilly is my new hero. He walks, nay he waddles the streets of New Orleans unparalleled in wit, anger, style and girth. Steer clear of Ignatius for he is a human wrecking ball, who will take down all who oppose him, spoil their plans and take them down with him as Fortuna gives his \\"wheel\\" a downward spin and he falls (with much more force than the typical human.)John Kennedy Toole must have had a lot on his mind when he wrote this novel, while it is at one level just about the disastrous exploits of Ignatius, when looked at on a deeper level the novel is clear social criticism, complimented with an excellent story. And oh, there is plenty to criticize in New Orleans. The book pokes gentle fun at a variety of things, from the Louisianan police force, to the gay society, to hot dog vendors to social activists. John Toole certainly has a knack for criticizing society in a way that amuses and informs. The police officers are made to go undercover with a variety of preposterous costumes that would be fit for Mardi Gras, and only Mardi Gras. The social activists all have outrageous beliefs about sex and are portrayed very stereotypically, as is the gay and lesbian scene, which Ignatius has a brief and most unfortunate encounter with. Toole mocks the working man as well, when Ignatius incites a riot with his fellow workers at Levy pants, the workers blindly follow Ignatius and blindly follow the boss when he quells the rebellion. The biggest social critic of all is Ignatius himself. He watches T.V. programs and goes to the movies where he screams back at the screen about the garbage he is watching. He goes to art shows and forces them to close down due to his criticism. He mocks, teases, taunts and whines, and his big mouth always gets him in trouble.Along with social criticism, another well-defined aspect of this novel is the character development. You care for every one of Toole's characters and hang on their every word. Ignatius, who is constantly complaining about his valve. (A scientist might say that Ignatius is referring to his digestive system, but Ignatius J. Reilly is certainly not a scientist (however he is educated.)) Mrs. Reilly, Ignatius' alcoholic mother who hides bottles of wine in the oven and inadvertently bakes them. Agent Manusco who is desperately trying to nab a \\"suspicious character\\" so his punishment of costume wearing will desist. Senile Ms. Trixie who thinks Ignatius is \\"sweet old Gloria\\". The pornographer, Lana Lee, and her stupid b-girl Darlene. (Lana Lee would be called the \\"antagonist\\" in a normal novel, but this is certainly not a normal novel.) Jones, a black man who is discriminated against and speaks in a delightful mixture of \\"sentence enhancers\\" (expletives) sarcasm, and slang.

Once you get to know Ignatious and what makes him tick, everything that comes out of his mouth will have you laughing hysterically. Though at times you feel sorry for the guy, you can't help laugh at the life he has made for himself. Will Ferrell is playing him in the movie version which is coming out in 2005 - so read this before the movie."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I loved it! There's really nothing more I can say."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Having just finished the book a mere 5 minutes ago, I have not fully collected my thoughts. My initial reaction at the conclusion of this novel was that the book was okay. It had humorous moments, but nothing that immediately stands out. The protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, is quite the character. He's disgusting, disrespectful, and downright irritating at times. He provided almost all of the entertainment through his \\"the world is out to get me\\" attitude (which is probably one of the reasons for the title that Toole chose). If someone touches him, Reilly immediately claims to have been assulted and promptly tells that person that he better have an attorney on hand because he was about to get sued. On the surface, it's Reilly's personality as well as his appearance that causes the reader to harbor dislike towards him. Unfortunately, this can overshadow the humor that comes from those very characteristics. I know that I was turned off by Reilly's whole presence, which at times, made this novel unreadable because I honestly thought I was going to get sick from the way that Toole portrays him. Once I got past that initial reaction, I learned to deal with Reilly and the novel became a lot more entertaining and amusing. Overall, I do recommend this novel because it is completely unlike anything else that I have ever read. Ignatius' behavior is outrageous and unpredictable. His speech is very eloquent and formal, which provides the most amusement because most of the ideas he spews forth are insane. His interactions with other characters, such as his mother or his ex-girlfriend, are unreal. I would never want to be treated the way that Ignatius treats people but I find it strangely tolerable in this novel where nothing seems to agree with society's standards of decency."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"In lieu of adding to the myriad of opinions and analysis over this particular book, I want to offer a suggestion for the reader who wants to get through this, but is reluctant.. the key that finally unlocked this work was, for me, imagining Ignatius as the comic book store owner from the Simpsons. See if it doesn't work for you!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ezra Pound wrote that if you can keep going back to something and it has lost nothing, well then, you have Art of the first intensity on your hands. 'A Confederacy of Dunces' has this quality for me as does Widor's toccata: Symphony #5 op. 42 by a organist good enough to play it or Duvall's 'The Apostle', to name a couple of other masterpieces.There are so many great reviews of 'Dunces' here that I won't even try. However, here's the thing, where I work [a retail chain store] we renamed 'Levy Pant', we have our Trixie, I have a sign above my desk: \\"Where you keep them motherf'ing broom?\\", maybe a sign: \\"Nice Wine....$3.99.\\" when we have one on ad for $3.99. We have a Lee mother, If you shop at our store, one of our cashiers might make your change with something like, \\"Your change is 94 cent.\\" etc. etc. So, I guess when a book alters the actions of your life, it must be pretty good. I know that on days when I'm feeling sunk, I can go back to it and it will snap me right out of it.And ain't most of our corporations managed more like \\"Levy Pants\\" than anything else nowadays?"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I loved this book. My reasons? Too many to get into; besides, others have covered them. A work of genius--and that's exactly what the author John Kennedy Toole was in my humble opinion. Too bad he isn't around to see how many people admire and respect this incredible creation of his. His name lives on in his work. As far as the rare negative response here and there:I say too bad for them, because they just don't get it, the same way some people don't get jazz (the greatest music ever invented). It's their loss. Pick up a copy, or give one to a friend. I had to give it five stars. 'Nuff said, as Stan &quot;The Man&quot; Lee used to say."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces- what an interesting name! By Robert Kennedy Toole, this book tells of an extremely smart, elefantile man named Ignatius Reilly and his adventures through the city of New Orleans. It has cops, crashes, and thugs. Ignatius has to go to work for the first time in his life, and is totally unprepared for office work or hotdog selling. His mother doesn't think too, too much of him and plans to get married- it doesn't help that she keeps cheap wine bottles stashed away in her rickety old oven. Finally, she realizes that a whining slob like Ignatius needs some help, so she decides to send him to a -beep-, but a friend of his comes to help, so he gets away to -beep- A great read!!

I've observed an interesting phenomonon along the way: New Orleans natives, especially those who grew up when D.H. Holmes still existed and you could &quot;Meet me at The Mouth&quot; at Ponchatrain Beach, are often offended by the book's depiction of our fair city. They squeal, &quot;We're not like that,&quot; and &quot;No one in the city lives like that,&quot; convinced that they lived completely normal lives Uptown, in the Irish Channel, or in Metry. It's difficult to examine yourself in a mirror that magnifies to the intensity of A Confederacy of Dunces - every zit's exposed - and laugh. So, if you're not a native or a resident, read this book and laugh at the hilarity of a culture that is currently waning. And if you are a native, put your pretentions aside and stare at yourself, your parents, whoever, dead on and laugh. Do it for the memory of K&amp;B.

I was surprised that I found it very sad. All the sadder because we will never be able to enjoy more books by this author. The book is so well written that I could smell Ignatius's room. I could visualize the floor strewn with paper covered with words that only had meaning to Ignatius. I felt sad about the situation he and his mother found themselves in trying to keep ahead of the bill collectors. Sad because this overeducated man had presumably been protected from life by his mother. This is a wonderful book. I did find it humorous in parts, but for the most part I just felt sad."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"From the opening paragraph, I was prepared to loathe Ignatius Reilly, the obese, pompus, over-educated, lute-playing sloth! After just a few pages of his hilarious mishaps, however, I was hooked. He and all the other lunatic characters made me laugh so hard while reading it on a plane that a flight attendant had to bring me a glass of water. Toole was a genius; who else could intertwine Ignatius among plot lines involving a bumbling rookie police officer, the heir to the Levy Pants empire, a sex-crazed activist, gays, bowlers, criminals, and sundry other kooks? You must read this book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Enough said. Buy this book and hang onto it for a very long time. Because you're gonna want to read it again and again. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book was recommended as a &quot;good read.&quot; Initially it seemed fatuous (pun intended) but after 20 pages I could not put it down. It shows a real, seamy side of New Orleans and real characters: the fat, spoiled, 30 year old Mama's boy, educated way beyond his common sense (if he had any). Yet his actions, philosophy, and intense emotional interaction with those around him ring true. A totally unique white whale, trying to swim upstream, but afraid to leave New Orleans.

Ignatius is the personification of the obnoxiousness that resides in all of us, and Toole's carefully crafted words paint a vivid picture of New Orleans, Levy Pants, and his mother's house. His letters to the Minx are somewhat tedious, but humouress nonetheless, his descriptions unique, apt, and crass.

I came upon it accidentally and must say, I think I was intrigued after reading that the author had committed suicide and then posthumously won a Pulitzer prize. What a great loss. John Kennedy Toole obviously had much talent and who knows what potentially could have been written by him. The book is funny, touching, and downright bizarre at times.

If you think you know New Orleans from visits to the French Quarter during Mardi Gras, please read this novel.As this is about to become a major motion picture, now is a great time to read this timeless novel. At a minimum it makes for an interesting and fun novel. At its best it is a colorful and many say accurate depiction of New Orleans and many of the the unique personalities living there in the 1960's."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is just different than most.

All the characters blend so perfectly together and caused me to go through such an array of emotions. Sadness for Ignatius' mother, shame at Mr. Gonzalez's lack of backbone, fits of laughter at Miss Trixie's one-liners (every time she calls Ignatius Gloria I couldn't help but crack up!), intense hope that it would all work out in the end, and many more along the way. I was constantly bracing myself for what hilarious (and probably unsettling) antics Ignatius would be up to next. Ignatius' hilarious diatribes are so incredibly clever, I can't believe they are not the work of a team of comedians, but one brilliant mind.Overall, it is an amazing novel. Prepare yourself, it is probably unlike any other book you've read before. I can understand why it is not everyone's cup of tea, but it is certainly worth a sit down. If you don't like it, I'm sure you can give it away to someone who will love it.

Reilly is put upon to exit the safety of his snug (though trashed) bedroom of his mother's home and find a job. The result is a cause-and-effect satire which is (apparently) a monument of American Literature. I didn't really like it. It simply wasn't my kind of book. Don't get me wrong, I got a few laughs...and I can understand how people with a certain sense of humor (those who love cause-and-effect satires like Seinfeld or those who like laughing at the inadequacies and hypocrisies of humanity) would really enjoy this book. It also has a little Freudian satire in it. I just found the characters really annoying (I know I was supposed to). Couldn't get into it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Avoid reading this book in public. People will think you're strange for laughing so hard alone."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Given the fact that Ignatius J. Reilly is a pompous, flatulent git, it makes be wonder exactly why it is I loved this book so much. Ignatius shows us the worst in us, yet because he never amounts to much, he also shows us that he is not to be emulated. One of the opening paragraphs wherein Toole describes Mr. Reilly's odd and unsanitary costume, his &quot;fleshy balloon of a head,&quot; and that fact that he scans the crowd &quot;looking for signs of bad taste in dress&quot; perfectly sums up Ignatius and his world view. I didn't care that I didn't agree with him at all, but rather, for some strange reason, found it interesting to follow this &quot;working boy&quot; (which was another paradox) in his rather mundane misadventures."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"One of the two of John Kennedy Toole's greatest and only works is A Confederacy of Dunces. I found that the words that Toole wrote seen to bring the reader into the story and lets their imagination take them right next to Ignatius and the other characters. I view this book as one of the greatest literature works of our day. Although I view some parts of the book as disturbing and disgusting, I find that I was able to see things from Ignatius J. Reilly's point of view, some of the time. I was able to laugh at the mishaps that Ignatius constantly gets in to, however, I could never fully understand where he was coming from due to the fact that I have never been to New Orleans. I couldn't help but laugh at the constant insulting that went on between Myrna Minkoff and Ignatius in their letters that they continuously sent to each other. I have seldom laughed so much while reading a book. I highly suggest this book to almost all people that ask me for their opinion. It's funny and probably one of a kind."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Not since Vonnegut's &quot;Player Piano&quot; has there been such a dead on, satirical commentary on the American way of life. Toole's New Orleans characters are deftly crafted; comically absurd but not cartoonish. His masterpiece is Ignatius T. Reilly, a bloated, pseudo-intellectual gas bag, who pontificates endlessly about the evils of society while consuming vast quantities of junk food and pulp entertainment. Equally interesting is Jones, a chain smoking, hip talking, black man struggling desperately to stay on the right side of the jail cell door by maintaining a janitor position in a seedy strip club. Most entertaining for me was Jones' manner of expression; a dialectic and animated version of street talk that contained absolute nuggets of truth."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is my very favorite book ever. It makes me laugh so hard every time i read it. For the people who don't like this book because the characters are obnoxious, I think that is weak criticism . Most of the people in great literature and most entertainers in general would not be welcome in my house -- it's their broad and outlandish behavior that makes them entertainers, not friends. But their flaws often, as here, create a hilarious comment on an individual's &quot;worldviews&quot;, as Ignatius would say. I have given this book to numerous people and almost everyone thought it was absolutely hilarious.

I have read this with my book club, and given perhaps 100 copies of the book to different people (students, friends) in need of a laugh or some intellectual stimulation.

What John Kennedy Toole observed in 1963 New Orleans resonates with the U.S. thirty-five years later. The protagonist is so poignantly described that he can't be far from Toole himself. Bear with him for the first few pages and you'll be hooked on this unlovable character to the finish, where the story's perfect symmetry implodes on itself.

The two make a pair of human beings (if one would consider the former a human being) operating at polar ends of the morality spectrum. Neither understand the other, and as each day passes, the frustration and trapped feeling rises more and more in the mother of Ignatius J. Reilly: Blundering Fool.The story begins with Ignatius and his mother running into a desperate patrolman, Mancuso, whose only aspiration in life is to bring down his first criminal. When Mancuso targets Ignatius, all hell breaks loose and the 30 year old man becomes four, and screams for his mother's assistance. Ignatius' outrageous attempt to remain unemployed and sunken into the depths of his bedroom with pen and notepad in hand, constantly scribbling ideas and random thoughts proves his laziness and carelessness of his mother's well being. His mother, widowed Mrs. Reilly, is relentlessly struggling to get her inactive lump of a son out into the world to seek employment. After a minor car accident, Mrs. Reilly finally convinces her son to get a job in order to pay for damages caused by the accident. Levy Pants to the rescue! Ignatius receives, to some degree, employment at an office, which manages a trouser-producing factory. After a few weeks working for the easily confusable, and deceived Mr. Gonzalez, Ignatius becomes reluctantly comfortable as a filer. Ms. Trixie, an old, should have been retired 10 years ago, senile employee is trapped at Levy Pants by the owner's psychotically devoted to saving the world from any kind of sociological sufferingwife. Mrs. Levy believes that what miss Trixie needs is to be notified of how much she is actually needed. In the end of his career as a Levy Pants Associate, Ignatius certainly goes out with a bang! In a ridiculous attempt to lead the factory workers to revolt against the management for underpayment and mistreatment, Ignatius fails quite explosively and is immediately fired. In endeavoring to prove to his mother that this is fate, or \\"Fortuna\\" telling him that he is unfit for employment and is left with no other choice but to lay in his room writing, and vigorously attacking the various self pleasing materials which he has kept since his adolescent days, he is once again forced to find another job.While Ignatius is between jobs, we are introduced to Myrna Minkoff via a letter written to Ignatius to inform him of her success of becoming an activist in up-state New York. He writes back with a loathsome and offensive attitude claiming that she is obsessed with [love]and politics. Finally, Ignatius stumbles upon his final job. Meanwhile, Mrs. Reilly is making friends (one of which happens to be the policeman who tried to arrest her son). The new-found acquaintances are continuously warning her that her son is to be locked up in a mental hospital, but she just can't find it in her poor soul to make the call.As a hot dog vendor, Ignatius has once again found refuge in a plush job and wastes his time sitting on street corners and eating the merchandise. An encounter with one, Doriane Greene proves to be a rather ointless part of the story, other than emphasizing even more Igantius' insanity. The two decide to throw a party, which Ignatius takes as an opportunity to lecture to the participants about peace on Earth, while Doriane simply wants to make fun of him in a gathering of friends. Ignatius is persistently thinking of ways he can show Myrna Minkoff how he can outdo her, but upon arriving at this party, he finds he is the laughing stock of the house.Ignatius runs to the nearest bar, \\"Night of Joy\\" where is depending on the showing of a [dancer] whose picture he cam across during one of his escapades as a vendor. Lana Lee, the owner of the bar notices this familiar, fat face, and immediately panics for fear of running off the good customers. All goes wrong within the first few minutes of the act, and the [dancers] aid in show (a cockatoo) flies off and attacks Ignatius. He tumbles out to the street in a wild attempt to release himself from the bird and ends up in the papers for creating such a scene. Finally, Ignatius' mother calls Charity Hospital to come and take her son away. Speaking to soon, she gives her idea away to Ignatius bye saying goodbye and leaving the house. Myrna Minkoff randomly shows up at his house and takes him back to New York with her, rescuing him from the Psycho Ward before they arrive to carry him off.The novel is basically a cluster of characters, which are all troubled in some way. I really enjoyed reading the book, because of the comedic content. However, a plot was difficult to locate. All of the characters wound together in a way that was quite fascinating and logical. However, like I said, what is the point? I can't say that I recommend this book to anyone, unless they are simply bored and are looking for an autobiography of an irrational, and sad man who has nothing to live for but himself."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A satirical anecdote of the decay of lower-class New Orleans, John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces presents a 30 year old, overweight and highly educated ape of a man living at home with his poor, driven-to-drink mother.

In endeavoring to prove to his mother that this is fate, or \\"Fortuna\\" telling him that he is unfit for employment and is left with no other choice but to lay in his room writing, and vigorously attacking the various self pleasing materials which he has kept since his adolescent days, he is once again forced to find another job.While Ignatius is between jobs, we are introduced to Myrna Minkoff via a letter written to Ignatius to inform him of her success of becoming an activist in up-state New York. He writes back with a loathsome and offensive attitude claiming that she is obsessed with sex and politics. Finally, Ignatius stumbles upon his final job. Meanwhile, Mrs. Reilly is making friends (one of which happens to be the policeman who tried to arrest her son). The new-found acquaintances are continuously warning her that her son is to be locked up in a mental hospital, but she just can't find it in her poor soul to make the call.As a hot dog vendor, Ignatius has once again found refuge in a plush job and wastes his time sitting on street corners and eating the merchandise. An encounter with one, Doriane Greene proves to be a rather pointless part of the story, other than emphasizing even more Igantius' insanity. The two decide to throw a party, which Ignatius takes as an opportunity to lecture to the participants about peace on Earth, while Doriane simply wants to make fun of him in a gathering of friends. Ignatius is persistently thinking of ways he can show Myrna Minkoff how he can outdo her, but upon arriving at this party, he finds he is the laughing stock of the house.Ignatius runs to the nearest bar, \\"Night of Joy\\" where is depending on the showing of a stripper whose picture he cam across during one of his escapades as a vendor. Lana Lee, the owner of the bar notices this familiar, fat face, and immediately panics for fear of running off the good customers. All goes wrong within the first few minutes of the act, and the strippers aid in show (a cockatoo) flies off and attacks Ignatius. He tumbles out to the street in a wild attempt to release himself from the bird and ends up in the papers for creating such a scene. Finally, Ignatius' mother calls Charity Hospital to come and take her son away. Speaking to soon, she gives her idea away to Ignatius bye saying goodbye and leaving the house. Myrna Minkoff randomly shows up at his house and takes him back to New York with her, rescuing him from the Psycho Ward before they arrive to carry him off.The novel is basically a cluster of characters, which are all troubled in some way. The title is quite fitting. I really enjoyed reading the book, because of the comedic content. However, a plot was difficult to locate. All of the characters wound together in a way that was quite fascinating and logical. However, like I said, what is the point? I can't say that I recommend this book to anyone, unless they are simply bored and are looking for an autobiography of an irrational, and sad man who has nothing to live for but himself."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I fell in love with Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces from the first page I read. I literally couldn't put it down. The main character Ignatius J. Reilly, a 30 year-old medivalist who lives at home with his mother and works as a hot dog vender, will either crack you up or seriously disgust you through his frequent loud belches. I found it humorous instead of offensive.The book has many different subplots of very diverse characters that all tie together by the end of the novel; a classic comedy. The book reflects various characterisitcs of \\"The Big Easy\\" through the different scenes and character's \\"habitats\\".Eventually all of the different scenerios tie together at the end through who else, but Ignatuius J.I would recommend reading this book simply for pleasure. It will literally make you laugh out loud."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"For me this novel was all about momentum. It started out rough, but then picked up until by the end I wanted more. Think Toole found his stride about a third of the way through.

A prolific reader herself--the best trait I inherited from her--I wondered how she happened upon such a gem. The protagonist is incredibly concerned with his internal workings--has anyone ever had a more in depth relationship with their pyloric valve?--and yet so lazy, as to frustrate every effort to reform him. I have read this book several times in the last two decades, and invariably give my copy to someone else. That's what led me to Amazon to order another one. Please read this book--and cry at the waste of the life of the author.

I really wanted it to be funny, and I could see these ridiculous scenarios building up to their humorous climax in anticipation, but they quite simply weren't funny. I get what the author was going for - this absurd, delusional, quixotic train-wreck of a slob in Ignatius. It was a clever book at points (especially Ignatius' writings). I did laugh to myself a couple times, but most of the time, the humor missed the mark for me, and when something tries to be funny and fails over and over it just gets tired.I kept waiting for this to get funny all the way until the end of the book, it just didn't happen. Not a bad book per se, but given the accolades it's received, and the fact that it's a Pulitzer Prize winner, I'm very dissappointed.

Not knowing what the novel was about, I was surprised to find it to be one of the best novels ever written. In one sentence, its a comic masterpiece. From the first page you are hooked and laughing. The characters are well-written and formed. On the same page you will love Ignatius, piety him, and dislike him. A good story revolves around its characters, not the circumstances. No book does this better then Confederacy. There is no boiler plot, build-up, suspence,or reality. However, it has Ignatius , the most unique character ever written into a novel. He is egotisitc, dirty, a slouch, idealistic, crazy, a day dreaming, narcessitic slob. He doesn't have one redemming quality about him. However, you can never forget him and you don't want to forget him. The sad part is Toole himself. He was an amazing writer, a hidden genius, who died too soon."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I thought A Confederacy of Dunces was ok. Although I know many people that really enjoyed the book, I found it to be a little long and repetitive at times. There are many funny parts to the book; I found myself laughing (most of the time in my head, but laughing nonetheless) every now and then, even though a lot of the humor is crude and gross. Ignatius is an interesting and unique character, and I feel Toole did a good job of character development. Every character in the book has their own personality, and they are deep enough as to where the reader feels like they really know them. Along with the comedy in the book, however, Toole slips in a lot of social commentary.If you're looking for a funny read, A Confederacy would be a pretty good choice. It wasn't the best book I've read, but it certainly was not the worst."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I did not really enjoy this book. Everyone raved about it, but I can't see why. I thought Ignatius Reilly was an annoying, unfunny jerk. I couldn't find anything amusing or interesting. I thought the attempt at humor was forced, obvious and rather pathetic. I could not finish the book because it was torture to read more than half of the book. I wish I could get a refund in all honesty. The prose was the only reason why I gave the book two stars."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"To be sure, we all have different tastes and opinions. For all the rave reviews I read prior to picking up this book, I feel like I'm missing something. As the title to this review suggests, I'm reminded of those 3D prints that became so popular during the 90s. I never saw the object back then and I don't see the humor and brilliance of this book now.Take this with a grain of salt as I threw in the towel after 100 pages. I just couldn't convince myself to press on in hopes that somehow Toole was weeding out the unenthusiastic readers through the first 5 chapters with hilarity to ensue for the remainder of the book.While Ignatius Reilly is a humorous and wholly original character, I found the book to be more bizarre and absurd than funny. In my opinion, a comedy should make you laugh out loud which this did not.Clearly a great many people love this book and find it hilarious. I'll count myself in the minority and pick up some Elmore Leonard or Carl Hiassen the next time I want to laugh while reading."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Yuck. Just Yuck.

The writing is flawless, the characters vivid but not necessarily appealing, particularly the manic and obnoxious protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly.

Not many in between. I'm not sure where the camp of lovers are coming from. This book was not funny. I repeat . . . not funny! I didn't laugh once through the first half of it which is how far I could stand to read. It portrays a pathetic fat slob of a jerk that deserves all the bad that life deals him.

If a few hundred pages on farting are your idea of great literature, then by all means, buy this book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Based on the reviews contianed at this web site, I bought this book as a summer read.While the characters are fascinating, the humor is practically non-existant. It seems that this book has become a sort-of &quot;cult classic&quot;. And like most cult classics, it's really not as good as most people make it out to be. I mean, is the Rocky Horror Picture Show that good? No. But it is a cult classic.There are indeed some colorful characters in the French Quarter and in this book, and Toole captures their idiosyncratic behavior pretty well. And he does an exceptional job of capturing the language spoken by the locals. But to call this collection of semi-humorous vignettes a comic masterpiece is a cruel hoax on readers.In my opinion, this is another example of a person becoming famous for his work by dying, preferably in a tragic (Toole commited suicide) way.To qoute another reviewer, &quot;This is an example of how a nondescript work can become so inflated by the great American hype-machine as to finally emerge as some sort of accepted masterwork, never to be equalled, unparalleled. I'm surprised Toole wasn't posthumously awarded the Nobel as well.&quot;Fortunately, the Nobel prize is never awarded posthumously."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I just finished reading this book and I cannot explain how disappointed I am. If you want to read about a bunch of dunces go for it, because that is ALL this book is! Every character is a moron. Each in their own way. The only two characters that had any redeemable qualities were side characters. Jones, a black man who was simply trying to get by without going to jail, and Mr. Levey a man who inherited wealth from his father. Mr. Levey somehow has a bit of a conscious and if it were not for the fact that he had been handed everything and his wife was a typical gold digger, he may have been a decent person. Jones is a confused black man who is just trying to keep from going to jail and is rightfully afraid of the police.Ignatious is the main character and from the moment I met him I wanted to strangle him. In every way imaginable, he is a worthless piece of a human! Occasionally he will make some smart remark about how the justice system in america has failed or about how psychiatry wards not helpful to their patients, but these moments only last a few seconds and then Ignatious is back to his self centered, judging, deceiving and confused self.As far as I can tell, Ignatisous' mom let him become the way he is, and now regrets it, but she is too stupid and beta to do anything about it. There is police officer who for some reason wishes to stay loyal to the police force even though they treat him like crap and he is too stupid to do anything worthwhile. There is a trashy bar owner who thinks her bar is classy. There is a woman who works in that bar who wants to be a professional dancer.I'm not going to lie, I didn't get any of the references in this book so maybe that is where I missed the hype. Overall it didn't go anywhere and there were no characters I could connect with or enjoy hanging out with. On top of that, this book was so dreary and pitiful it brought my spirit down too. The writing really is not bad, but not great either. If your sense of humor finds slow, haunting, miserable ignorance in itself funny, maybe you will like this book. Ill stick to something more upbeat like Tom Robbins myself."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Although EXTREMELY well written, I couldn't stand the main character - an ignorant, obese, socially inept, genius sloth of an a-hole . . . a frustrating example of what's wrong with human beings, and shows how bad parenting can destroy a society"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The first chapter of this novel bored me to tears.

At the end of &quot;Dunces,&quot; I felt sullied, yet also sad. I feel as though I'd watched a crime take place -- no, several crimes take place -- and yet could do nothing to stop them. This book, along with &quot;Foucault's Pendulum,&quot; perhaps the most pretentious book ever written, are the only two stories I've read that I cannot, in good conscience, recommend to anyone.

Only a few books ever have made me laugh out loud continuously: Douglas Adams' Hitchhikers Guide was one; a few P.J. O'Rourke books made me guffaw.

I met one just recently. P.S. Read the book completely before reading the author's biography. Just trust me."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A statue in New Orleans commemorates Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero (or anti-hero) of this novel. The statue is located on the former site of a department store outside which, in the opening pages, Ignatius waits for his mother. The unfortunate Mrs Reilly is in the store buying generous supplies of cakes for Ignatius' greedy consumption. As he waits, Ignatius searches the passing crowd for \\"signs of bad taste\\". Before long, his gross size and eccentric dress attract the attention of a police patrolman, and after he treats the patrolman to some unrestrained remarks he is almost arrested. He manages to deflect the patrolman's attention to a similarly vociferous elderly man who is obsessed with \\"communiss\\", and in the end it is the man who is hauled off to the police precinct.The statue is fitting because John Kennedy Toole has in this book sculpted a fine memorial to New Orleans and its people as it and they were in the early 1960's. That was when Toole (born 1937) was himself about the same age as Ignatius. In as much as Ignatius is an exaggerated version of Toole as he saw himself (of Irish immigrant stock, educated but not very employable, a single man living with his mother, and with similar casual work experience to Ignatius), the statue can also be seen as a memorial to Toole, who committed suicide before the book was published.All the characters introduced in that first scene, including the police patrolman, are carried right through the book. When the patrolman and the elderly man reach the police precinct, Burma Jones is added to the cast list. Jones is a man of color in every sense of the word, a great spokesman - through Toole - for his race, and key to the developments that ultimately bring about the denouement of the book. If you find Ignatius' greed, sloth and personal habits hard to take, you may well prefer Jones - not that Jones is any kind of saint.All the characters and situations are finely described, and most certainly based on reality. In truth, though, they are caricatures. Elements of real people have been combined to produce characters that are larger than life, more naive, and produce a crisper and funnier dialogue than anything ever actually heard; and yet they have the ring of authenticity.On finishing A Confederacy of Dunces, you are likely to feel that you have got to know New Orleans much better - especially as it was before 2005, when hurricane Katrina drew a permanent line beneath the past. You will also have been much entertained, whilst at the same time being shown something rather sad both about the people portrayed and their creator."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is in response to the person who tried to compare Janet Evonovich to John Kennedy Toole.

The tragedy of Toole's suicide robbbed the world of a great writer and commentator on the human condition.Favorite character: Myrna The Minx.Favorite Scene: the short lived hot dog cart job"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Set against the tumultuous backdrop of the 1960s, A Confederacy of Dunces is a book unlike any other that I have previously read. I have often heard it referred to as THAT book, a kind of complement coming from those in the know. Having read it, all I can say about it is that THAT book is stupendous on many different levels, from its forceful yet literary bluntness to its all-around observational astuteness, from character development all the way down to the colorful scenes in which New Orleans is \\"lovingly\\" depicted. And above all else, the rude, ribaldry and stand-offish humor is just too good of a reading pleasure to pass up, a book that's all laced together into episodic lunacy and idiocy. A Confederacy of Dunces will make you want to read it and read it and read it all over again till it's just torn and tattered. No hyperbole here. Just honesty.With impeccable writing prowess that is evocative of modern Southern writing, A Confederacy of Dunces just crackles with societal acumen, raunchiness and absurdity.At the beginning, the main character-Ignatius J. Reilly-a thirtieth, idiosyncratic intellectual lay-about who's better at preaching his doctrine of the end of the world through its vices then he is about truly combatting the influences they hold over him, is in search of a job. It is a deplorable task set by his beleaguered mother, Irene, a not full-blown lush with a penchant for muscatel, whose frayed nerves cause her to crash slightly into a building, whereby she needs to make financial amends. Hence, he is cast out into the wide world, using his own warped ideological thinking and the philosophical beliefs-as espoused by Boethius-as one would clutch onto the Bible and Jesus Christ in order to combat the known modernism of a sometimes off-kilter pop culture. And never mind the Blessed Virgin Mary, whom many people seek in times of woe and confusion (for he and his mom are both semi practicing Catholics), Ignatius has his own female goddess, Fortuna, a kind of feminine Holy Spirit, if you will, who he constantly accuses, till the end, at least, of his misfortune and mea culpa misery.But once out in the open, to his mother's joy, he becomes a job seeker, and the jobs he falls into, well, it's quite something. He partly wants to pursue this endeavor in order to put Myrna Minkoff, an on and off again friend/girlfriend in her place; she is a bleeding heart bohemian with a guitar who is always involved in one social cause or another. She cares about Ignatius, even sees brilliance in him. Yet, she sees that he is stunted and repressed, and she wants to unlock that. For her, it is all a matter of sex. Once he lets loose, he will be free, for that normal human inclination cannot simply be locked away and forgotten. And Ignatius, much to his credit, certainly does try. She exists in the novel through flashbacks, a series of correspondences and then, in the very end, the two teammates are finally reunited.While the correspondences between Ignatius and Myrna are entertaining, it's not until Ignatius lands a job with Levy Pants and then Paradise Vendors, a hot dog company, that things just start to blow up. And somehow, it all goes back to the Night of Joy, a dive of a strip bar whose proprietress, Lana Lee, is a money hungary, hard-bitten, cut-throat businesswoman. She's involved in a side pornography photo ring and hates Ignatius with every fiber of her being, for he and his mother entered her \\"establishment\\" in the early part of the novel, and she had him pegged as a bizarre freak who was not good for her business. Also in Lee's employ is Darlene and Burman Jones; the former is a ditzy but good-hearted dancer who wants to better herself by doing a classier strip tease involving her pet cockatoo: Harlot O'Hara, the virginal Southern beauty. Quite a show! The latter is the bar's janitor who gets paid below the minimum wage, a sum that he resentfully agrees to, for if he does not, he will get arrested for being a vagrant. Lana Lee surely does take advantage of the Jim Crow attitude, but Jones is ever mindful and ever patient. But his actions are seen throughout the novel and culminate with Lana Lee's eventual morals charge arrest alongside those of a couple of mannish and violent lesbians. And Angelo Mancuso's rise, from incompetent police officer who initially tried to arrest Ignatius at the beginning of the novel, to top-notch cop. There are so many interlocking stories that offer equal hilarity, for these are just snippets.A Confederacy of Dunces is truly a cyclone of inventiveness, word play, colorfulness and sheer storytelling. All the characters who encounter Ignatius either get their just deserts or reap positive benefits from their meeting. The characters Gus Levy, Burma Jones, Angelo Mancuso and Miss Trixie are cases in point who benefit from their encounter with Ignatius. The story first and foremost is about the man Ignatius, a true brother to Don Quixote, a bloated, long-winded fat slob who thinks that the world is screwed up and he's the only normal one in it. It's actually a relatable kind of thinking. Stop the world. I want to get off. I know I've said that more often than not. It is about the interlocking idiots who make up our lives, the confederacy of individuals either for us or against us. But at heart, there is goodness. There is just a short supply of tolerance in dealing with them. And Ignatius is the exemplar in the testing of that tolerance. A great book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is definitely a character piece, that character is Ignatius J. Reilly. So moral that he has turned himself inside out and become a monster of complaints. His world view is frustration at stupidity and in overwhelming himself with this frustration he becomes essentially an ass. He puts himself into situations that are outrageous for the fact that everyone is laughing at him, yet he is trying to bring forth the obvious and save these people from their ignorance and so inside he is perpetually laughing at others' stupidity.It reads like a dream, the words that spurt forth from Ignatius' mouth are trite yet moral, and verging on delusion it's hard to believe that you are buying into how off the cuff he is. Yet it works. In a fashion this is a coming of age story for a late late bloomer. Ingatius still lives with his mother at thirty. Ignatius and his mother have driven each other into domestic delirium that is balanced only by how controlling they are of each other.Ignatius comes across like many who dwell in the nest for too long, that he is eternally sighing at the hopelessness of everything, for instance when his mother crashes the car at the start he responds: \\"Ignatius rolled down one of the rear windows and studied the fender that was pressed against the wall. 'We shall need a new headlight on this side, i imagine.'\\"The fact that I've spent this review scratching only the surface of this character piece with descriptions of the inner world of the story and not its machinations should be in itself testamant to how absorbing this book is.Four and a half out five plus a sniffflip."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"In a few short pages, Toole had me hooked. The characters were well developed and immediately I was emotionally involved. The lunacy of the situations added to the story as much as the deep descriptions of sights, sounds and locations. What I found most amazing was how timely this novel is. While it was written many years ago, it is a story for our time, with many adult children returning home to the nest. I wouldn't be surprised to find many Irene's out there, just wishing their &quot;boy&quot; would &quot;make good&quot;"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This novel is quite possibly the funniest book ever published in the English language. That is all that needs to be said. Read it as soon as possible -- your life will be better."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Brilliant, hilarious, a must read"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"There are few joys more special than laughing uncontrollably in places you really shouldn't. This book wasn't just a great read, it was great medicine."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Reading this on the subway, I laughed so hard I started bawling. Never before have I been the one people on the NYC subways rolled their eyes at. Since I have read this masterpiece, I talk about molutov cocktails all the time and I tell everybody they deserve to be &quot;lashed until they drop&quot;. It's sick how funny this book is."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I'd like to address the criticisms in the relatively few one-star reviews of Dunces. Yeah, it's a story about a fat guy and his drunk mother. But if you didn't discern the love that Toole had for these and the other misfits in the book, you weren't paying attention. Great literature can take many forms, one of which is the loving and skillful portrayal of one's characters, farts and all. Is The Canterbury Tales disqualified due to its obsession with flatulence? No. Do we ignore In Cold Blood because of the unsavory main characters? Of course not. It is my life's mission to turn 100 people on to this book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book made so much sense, that I want it to give birth to my child. It really gets to the crux of what it is like to be a complete looser in today's society. My mother has tried to teach me this lesson for years. Walker Percy is the true definition of a fiction novelist, unlike my mother."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces is the most carefully crafted piece of comic writing I've ever laid eyes on. Bold, unapologetic characters with every imaginable point of view (and a number of serious social pathologies) collide within author John Kennedy Toole's virtuoso rendition of 1960s New Orleans. The star-crossed antics of our hero, the elephantine and manipulative Ignatius J. Reilly, disgust us, shock us, and surprise us. But most importantly, they make us laugh out loud. Don't read this one on your way to work: you might find yourself on a commuter train looking around for the most sympathetic-looking fellow passenger in order to have someone with whom to share the good parts."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"&quot;...the complexity of my worldview, the decency and taste implicit in my carriage, the grace with which I function in the mire of today's world...&quot;The dolts such as those immediately preceding this review cannot comprehend the profound wit that Toole utilizes to mold his main character Ignatius, and his story in general. It is my opinion that those who love this book do so on two levels: (1) no other &quot;literary&quot; novel exists with a funnier story and prose style, and (2) the book connects with many readers with high feelings of joy that is somehow ironically accompanied by comcomitant feelings of melancholy. I believe that the latter sentiments are due to the fact that most intelligent people find many things in this world, including society, to be baneful in nature due to common idiocy and mediocrity - and resultingly are cloistered within themselves, ever hopeful that there might be others out there who think and act like they do...Ignatius is a ! laughable idiot that can only be created as such from an intelligent, humorous, and unfortunately cynical individual such as Toole. In sum, I find comfort that this book is either hated or loved by those who read it - it would be an &quot;insult to proper theology and geometry&quot; if everyone loved Toole's story."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"You'll wish intensely that the author would have stayed with us longer and given us more of his brilliant perspective on life, love, sanity, loneliness and family. Alas, this and a short novel written as a teenager are all there are to indicate John Kennedy Toole lived and observed a section of life never revealed so well before or since.Without question, Ignatius is one of the great characters of American fiction. There is a little (only a little, thank God) of Ignatius in all of us and recognizing him will make you laugh uproariously at times and shake your head in pity at others.His long-suffering mother, his dazed and bewildered co-workers and the floatsam and jetsam of New Orleans are truly unique characters. How many books by white authors feature a truly wise and truly independent African-American character?You'll never forget meeting Ignatius. He'll creep into your thoughts, your humor and your language. You'll hear him whenever you feel outraged a! t being forced to live with the rest of us heathens or cheated for someone's inability to see your genius.Finally, you'll recognize that the hilarious and sad life of Ignatius probably mirrored Toole's; and you'll understand why he didn't stay to write more novels. In a way, that's alright. He did it right with this one."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I read bits and pieces of this book and what i read wasnt good. The people in the book are weird with strange ideas. Whats up with furtuna? Who is that ? Jones is full of himself and doesn't care about society. He tries to get on a woman on the bus. santa is a ols woman who tries to be young. it wasn't my type of book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I've heard so much about this book and was able to pick up a copy for 50 cents at a used book sale. I'm glad that's all I spent; nothing about it engaged me. Ignatius spends so much time playing the victim, he reminds me of people I know in real life and can't stand. His mother's no better, clucking and fussing over him when she should be kicking him out of the house. I stopped about a third of the way through chapter 2, they irritated me so much."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have no idea why people insist on praising this book. I couldn't finish more than 3 chapters. Some of the most painful reading imaginable. It may be that the author has captured the flavor of some community somewhere that I know nothing about, but I cannot imagine anyone wanting to be a part of such a community, nor why anyone would wish immerse themselves in it such a community by reading this book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I was too annoyed with the main character.He is this fat annoying man who blames everyone and victimizes himself for every single situation.I find myself to be able to read through books easily and relate well...I see the satire in this.But I was very annoying and I could not find myself continuing this book any further.I don't recommend this book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"4.5 stars with 915 reviews. I expected to really enjoy this book. I am now on page 74 of 415 pages (i.e., 17% of the book). I am still waiting for it to get funny. The book is boring. The characters are unlikable. I doubt I will finish it. I don't understand what it is that everyone finds so funny about this book.At best this book will give your vocabulary a workout. I would give this book zero stars if that was an option."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I chose this book because of it's &quot;humor&quot; and the intrigue of a work by someone who later commit suicide, sick yes but the truth. i didn't enjoy it. The main character really got under my skin and when i'm quick to laugh, i seldom did and was disappointed. Strangely it wasn't the counter-culture themes, the transvestites or the racial issues that bothered me, it really was Ignatius who repelled me at every turn. Maybe that's the point and that makes this a really good book.. maybe, but good book i want to read again, and i almost wish i'd never read this in the first place."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Overall-The opening quote from which the title originates is probably the most insightful thing this book has to say.Just because you have a good quote it does not mean that your book necessarily deserves the mountains of praise that are heaped upon it or a Pulitzer Prize. There are just some books I don't \\"get.\\" Something either goes completely against my own personal tastes or I am a member of the Confederacy of Dunces whichever your point of view is on the subject.I apologize wholeheartedly I think the reason I didn't \\"get\\" this book is the same reason I didn't \\"get\\" the big Sideways craze a few years ago; I find the main character totally unlikable. He's spoiled, he whines, he has a tendency to vomit and he is totally dependent on his mother. Every time the story seemed to be building momentum Ignatius J. Reilly would do something stupid or say something stupid or relate the story of the Greyhound Bus for the 75,000th time. I understand that ultimately the story is supposed to be one of how he broke out of his shell and took his place in the working world but the next time I want watch the hum-drum life of the working world get lampooned I'll watch Clerks."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Although I'm usually pretty critical of books, it takes a lot in order for me to give a book only one star. I picked this one up because it had won a Pulitzer and I was going to New Orleans soon and wanted some relevant (fictional) reading. I don't deny that Toole had some ambitious aims when he began this book--and yes, I agree it's a satire. But I didn't find it that effective because I could barely recognize humanity in these people. I usually think of satire as a social criticism involving humor and exaggeration. This book is filled with exaggerations--but I really didn't find it funny at all. Moreover, I could see what types of connections the author was trying to make with his critique, but I didn't find them at all compelling or even believable. In fact, I found the casting to be trite and ill-formed and am forced to agree with previous reviewers in saying that the majority of the book seemed redundant and annoying."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I was really looking forward to this book but then found myself force reading to finish it. Part of the problem is that I really took a dislike to the main character - a completely worthless individual who all you learn from is how not to be. If you like to be inspired by stories this is not for you.(I didn't even find it amusing - are fart jokes really worth a Pulitzer?)"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I've gotten into arguments about whether this book is any good. OK, reasonable minds may differ, but I'm baffled by the 400-500 positive reviews of this novel. I don't know how it rates as Literature (O'Toole obviously put a lot of effort into it anyway), but the story is uninteresting and the humor is utterly sophomoric. Imagine someone inserting chopsticks up his nostrils for laughs--that's what this book is like, somehow. When I tried reading it in high school (when I would read just about anything), I lost interest quickly; it was only a couple years ago that--after hearing someone rave about it again--I managed to slog through to the end. Boring boring boring. I'm not going to change anyone's mind by writing a long critique of it--which would be nothing against the avalanche of praise hereabouts. All I'm going to do is try to list some books and other stuff I DO find funny, or not funny:--> Some books and stuff I DO find funny: Catch-22; The 776 Stupidest Things Ever Said; Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (esp. Restaurant at the End of the Universe); This is Spinal Tap; Wayne's World; Groundhog Day; The Darwin Awards; The Far Side; Seinfeld; Liar's Poker; The Onion (1/3 of the time); Letterman in the 80s-mid 90s; Saturday Nite Live when it was still any good; early Eddie Murphy standup routines; Mike Luckovich--> Some books and stuff I DON'T find funny: Austin Power II (didn't catch the first one); The Onion (2/3 of the time); SNL in the past 5-6 years (the lame jokes are not that different from O'Toole's); Steve Martin; recent Eddie Murphy movies; Art Buchwald.So that's me, and I DON'T find Confederacy funny at all. I know there are probably a lot of people who'd agree with me about all of the above picks--and yet still find Confederacy funny. There's no accounting for it. But I'll suggest that, if you just try reading the first 3 pages of the book, and you're not amused by it already, you never will be."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"As some have reviewed, I was one of those captivated by the prologue. The story of how the book was published is far better than the story itself. I too, found it difficult to pick up this book once it was put down. A mish-mash of vignettes, dream states, and letters by the 'hero' created a mood of boredom and disappointment. The boredom came from this book just not being funny. The disappointment mainly at how much time I was wasting in continuing to read it. I believe in finishing what I started and was determined to the end to give this a chance. The joke was on me. I was the true dunce. In reflection, maybe that's the irony here?"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I read reviews of this book that said it was funny, so I decided to give it a try. I didn't find it amusing at all, a lot of the jokes were about Ignatius' \\"valve\\". I don't think six year old musings about gases and other bodily fluids particularly entertaining. Ignatius is a one-of-a-kind character, but rather irritating. He's always complaining about something. I'd suggest A Prayer For Owen Meany instead of this book, but who knows? You might enjoy it *if* you have that kind of humor."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I loved the book! After reading what everyone else commented on, no one really talked about how Ignatius Reilly was the true way we all should live our lives. We have forgotten the true vision of the American dream, we need to come back to our senses. The American dream isn't about materialistic wealth (look at Ignatius). But he had one thing many of us don't embrace, self-satisfaction. We are caught up in a world of fast cars, beautiful people, and lots of money. We need to remind ourselves that we need to be content with ourselves before anything else. In my opinion, Ignatius is beautiful in his own mysterious ways. JDK"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is one of those books which has everything to be consider a classic! It was wonderfully written, the description of the characters and places where the story takes place is brilliant. And the best part is that you can't but laugh out loud all along while you're reading this book. This kind of humor can only be found in great authors such as J.D.Salinger himself. This book has everything...a great plot, lovable characters, and madness all over it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I discovered this book by a friend's recommendation. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. I laughed and laughed! Twelve years later, I am still rereading it and still laughing. The book is a brilliant blend of comedy and tragedy, a 180 proof distillation of the human spirit. I haven't read anything better, although I know a dozen books I'd rank with it, including Catcher in the Rye, Catch-22, The Fountainhead, The Last Detail, Breakfast of Champions, and In Watermelon Sugar. If you don't try this one, you're missing a great chance. Obviously some people don't get it, don't like it, etc. Those of us who do like it, love it. It's worth a try, believe me."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is perhaps the most consistently funny novel I have yet read. Toole had a fine sense of the absurd, wonderful characterization, and a keen ability with language. It is a true pity that this book was his last effort. Arguably, it was his only effort; &quot;The Neon Bible&quot;, a teenage effort 'discovered' some years later, reads as if it was from a completely different writer. What a loss. (Should I sign this &quot;Tad, your working boy&quot;? hmm... nah)"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"There has never been a character so richly developed as Ignatious Reilly. The author--sadly, deceased--introduced me to the seamy side of New Orleans through the eyes of this offbeat lunatic while incorporating tremendous humor and humanity into all his characters. A classic, one to be read over and over again. I can pick this book up now and turn to any page and find myself laughingly absorbed in its brilliant plot. No doubt Toole anticipated a sequel, and his suicide is a great loss to the literary world."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius Riley is one of the greatest characters in all of literature. His constant complaining about everything (from his valve to Myrna Minkoff) had me laughing almost to the point of insanity! Fabulous book. I would recommend this book to anyone whose quest is to readd al great American literature."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have read this book 5 times now. I live in New Orleans and find this to be a truth to what this city is truly like. I laugh out loud at Ignatious! And, if you can believe it, New Orleans built a statue in dedication of him. HAHA!It's actually a true story. The writer committed suicide after finishing it. His mother found the transcripts underneath his bed and published it. If you want a good description of New Orleans with a twist you have to read this! It's execelent!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Sirs: I have to be careful so as not to address all my letters as _____________ Mongoloid, esq.

I went to New Orleans and accidentally came back with four rolls of film with hot-dog vendors. People have attacked me in the subway overcome with joy that they saw another person reading the book. (I didn't get it then, but now that I do it to others it makes perfect sense). I carry the book around with me on days which might turn out to be not so happy. And lastly, after reading some negative reviews ---Is my paranoia getting completely out of hand or are there people in world who don't like this book!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is a great novel. The characters are so painstakingly three-dimensional, so pitifully self-important, so realistically unimportant, so catastrophic and triumphant in spite of themselves. Ignatius Reilly will remind you of everyone you ever loved and everyone you ever hated. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Some people retire to play golf or go fishing or travel. I retired so I could have time to read. I have read this book 7 times over the years, and it is simply the best novel I have ever read. I was reading it in the Oakland,Ca. airport one day with tears streaming down my face from laughing. Two people came over and asked the name of the book as they wanted to buy it just from my reaction. I can pick up this book and open any page and start laughing at the manic goings on. I cannot reccommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I also was suckered into buying this book based upon some user comments. Hopefully my comments and those of a couple of others here will enable someone else to escape the same fate.In summary, this book is boring rubbish!The characterisations are good but that is all this entire book has going for it -- the story is bland and boring. We do not care one iota for any of the characters.However, with great determination I struggled through the whole book in the vain hope that some element in the story would make the exercise worthwhile. But no, reading this book was a complete waste of time."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"After reading this lousy book I am mystified that anyone could think highly of it. Poor writing, cartoonish one-dimensional characters, and a general attitude that people and life are despicable and worthless. It reads as if its intended audience was to be adolescent boys on ritalin. I tossed this trash into the recycling bin afterwards."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Apparently, this book is a comedy. I could't tell by reading it though. I think I laughed once near the end of the book. That's about it. True, the main character is ridiculous and the situations are absurd. But none of it is funny. It's just a long, repetitive, boring story about an annoying character that nobody could warm up to. If you read the first page and you don't laugh, drop this book, because it's going to be 400 more pages of the same slop."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Indeed this book has some genius in it, on the whole I thought it was just a little too much and I can't understand why there are those who think this is a great book. How can this book be mentioned along with Don Quixote? Miguel de Cervantes was a great novelist."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"If you like your stories and plot simple and direct and sophomoric 'Three Stooges' like humor, this book is for you."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"One doesn't need appetite suppresents when thinking of the protagonist of this lugubrious overwritten dirge. I couldn't help but wonder if the dunces referred only to the characters in the novel, or to those who paid for it as well.There is no beauty, insight, meaning or reason for this book. Avoid. Unless you crave the grotesque."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Hated every page. Boring. Impossible-to-like characters, annoying dialog, and very little plot. I suspect that Ignatius J. Reilly describes the late author; he was indeed an extremely unhappy young man. I hope I never pick up drivel like this book ever again. That this book was given any literary prize whatsoever is flat-out astonishing."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"For years I have seen this text on recommended-reading lists. I finally read it. What are people thinking? Because of the lack of any character with any redeeming characteristic, this turned into one long tedious reading of a book that starts nowhere and goes nowhere. Due to the lack of any discernable plot, the protagonist of this text remains untransformed by any of the ludicrous slapstick that repeats endlessly like a needle stuck in a record groove. With memorable lines like, &quot;Oh my God!&quot; repeated endlessly (closely followed by the equally side-splitting line, &quot;My valve!&quot;) you quickly realize that the author has no clue how to develop the main character into a person with whom a reader could identify.If this isn't bad enough, the book also contains a shallow and mean-spirited depiction of gay sterotypes. Women come off as stupid and whining nags. In short, it is impossible for any intelligent person to sympathise with any of this book's characters. Do not waste your time reading this overrated, fly-blown waste of paper."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A bristling manifesto that attests to the dangers of being over-educated."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I needed an audio book to listen to while commuting, and during the first two disks I was certain I'd found the perfect one: \\"Confederacy ...\\" was ROFLMAO funny. But by the end of end of disk 3 the antics produced only smiles, and when it came time to change to disk 5, Ignatius and most of the other characters were either so annoying or so over-the-top that I didn't care what happened to any of them.One positive: the narrator of the audio version, Barrett Whitener, is superb. He must have created 15-20 different voices, each was unique and ideally suited for the character's personality, especially Ignatius'."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Just remember, the people who have claimed that this book is not worth reading are probably the same people who love davinci code and feel that it warrants scholastic conversation.To those who think that the comedic events in this book are commonplace and can be seen on any current sitcom, you are correct. Most sitcoms have reused formulaic situations to little entertainment (think any Friends episode). But remember, this book was written in the 1960s, long before Pop Culture overused every single theme available.Dunces is a book well worth the read. The characters may not have a redeemable value, but they certainly have depth and development. Toole was clearly not attempting to portray a correct way of living or thinking. Instead he was most likely satirizing the opposite. What he did succeed in was writing a book of both literary and entertaining value, painting an interesting and enlightening picture of a lively time and culture."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I read this book around 1988 and have passed it around to friends over and over again. I have picked it up and reread it all the way through and also just poked through it. Ignatius is quotable, his sad, pathetic self is an amusing portrait of a loser, and self proclaimed intellectual who just can't get it together in this life."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The fact is that we New Orleanians all have known Ignatious Reillys . . . and their mothers! In fact, none of these characters are drawn any larger than reality in \\"da quahtahs\\" and \\"da nint wahd.\\"Ya gotta live there a while to understand but this novel was a snapshot of the kind of misfit that New Orleans specializes in. For the most part, these kind of people find their niches in New Orleans' most arcane troposphere and somehow cobble together a rich and interesting life. Every once in a while someone comes along who is so outre that even New Orleans doesn't know what to do with 'em. John Kennedy Toole was one of those lost souls. Fortunately, the world received a fantastic gift in the master piece \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\". You've got to read it to understand.Whatever you do, do NOT get excited and rush out to buy Toole's only other published work, The Neon Bible. It was a travesty, fought tooth and nail by executor Dr. Kenneth Holditch, forced by the courts in order to provide revenue for greedy cousins. The Neon Bible was a piece of half-baked juvenalia that Toole himself never tried to publish (it wasn't even finished). It, as opposed to Confederacy, is practically unreadable.All told, \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" should be required reading material before landing at Moissant Airport. Read and laugh. Then, read and use it as your streetmap of the Quarter. Either way, enjoy this flash of brilliance from a slender taper that blazed for a moment in time . . . before giving way to the darkness . . . but, in that moment, how he blazed!10/13/05 Let me add that I have now listened to C of D on audiobook and re-loved it all over again! The narrator is clearly not from New Orleans---mangles an accent or two, mispronounces street names,keeps saying \\"Sahnta\\"---but generally he does it justice and does a great job with the pomposity of Ignatious. Having read many of these reviews now, I would say that either you get it or you don't. Love it or hate it, read (or listen to it) and you WILL learn something real about New Orleans. I also think that post-Katrina, we can know some things from this book about why things turned out the way they did."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is a combination of slapstick and the driest humor imaginable. It's a &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; for the well read and over-educated."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Take one very eccentric city--N'Awlins, the Big Easy. Take some very eccentric characters, everyone from a madame-slash-barkeeper to a beatnik down from New York to some very Confirmed Bachelors to the world's worst stripper. Surround them with the most eccentric of all--Ignatius Reilly, a man by his lights so pure he can't even hold a menial job at the public library because it would cause him to &quot;slop glue all over their best-sellers.&quot; You have A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES.There are two levels of satire--the easy, Saturday Night Live type that pokes fun at easy figures like fatuous politicians and hypocritical ministers and then the scathing, down-deep kind that goes after everyone. This book goes after everyone, which is the source of its humor as well as its chief weakness. Jews, cops, lesbians, gay men,widows, bimbos, suburbanites, and so on and so on behave just like their worst stereotypes. If you think this is funny, read the book. If you think this is offensive, leave the book alone. If you stay for the book, you'll be treated to a rollicking, picaresque plot and encounter in Ignatius one of American literature's true originals. For what it is, A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is first rate."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Anyone who has read A Confederacy of Dunces will tell you that the main character, one Mr. Ignatius J. Reilly, is difficult to love. He's barely likeable on many scales - I found myself completely disgusted and appalled by him most of the time. His grotesque personal hygiene practices, his arrogance and his assumptions of superiority over absolutely everyone he meets are all revolting. I admit I didn't start to lighten my disgust for Ignatius until the last 100 pages (maybe because I simply got used to all of the belching and discussions about his \`valve'... but the rubber glove discussed at length at the end of the book did bring back my yelps of disgust as I read), but I still loved the book and found myself thinking about it several times a day.A Confederacy of Dunces is a sort of parable, where the wackiest of characters each has a specific part to play in their own story and the overall book. John Kennedy Toole ties them all together in the silliest but most skillful way. Some notable characters are his \\"poor, poor\\" momma, who has to support and put up with Ignatius, but then berates him and continuously complains and nags at him. (Which one do you feel more sorry for?) Patrolman Mancuso is just another cop on the beat, or so you think, until you find out he is the laughing stock of the whole precinct. The Department forces him to dress up in lewd costumes \\"to go undercover\\", but they only do it so they can laugh at him. My favorite, though, is (Burma) Jones, a black out-of-work \\"vagrant\\" who is trying to start his own kind of revolution and who adds spice and comedy to every conversation he's in (\\"Whoa!)I think the key to enjoying this book is: as readers we must keep in mind what this book is - a remarkable and ambitious work of classical-style fiction, not a snapshot of real life. It sounds simple, but many readers do it - we attempt to identify with the characters of the book. And if they are likeable or if they have traits of friends or family, the characters almost feel like \\"friends\\" to us by the end of the book. This is a story where most readers cannot possibly do this because the characters are so unrealistic. But this does not detract from the book in any way - it teaches us to like the story for other reasons than the obvious, and isn't this a good lesson for all of life? Not all things that are good are so simple to see right away - sometimes we have to look a little harder.John Kenney Toole created a masterpiece in A Confederacy of Dunces, but it may only be realized by true lovers of reading, and this is why I gave it only four stars. If you love literature or reading or writing, you will love this book. It is by the amount of emotional response that this story elicits that we can judge this book, not by whether we \`like' the main character. Whether you hate or love or feel sorry for Ignatius, you will be impressed by John Kennedy Toole's writing and his story development. I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole. Highly recommended.He's egotistical, erudite, ejaculatory (literally), and explosive. He's \\"emptily verbose\\" (Merriam-Webster's definition number 3 for \\"gassy\\"). He's also that-gassy, a man with a flux. He's Ignatius J. Reilly, a monster of a man with a master's degree, a faulty pyloric valve, a love for Boethius and The Consolation of Philosophy, a hatred for modern life, a passion against anything to do with sex (at least sex involving a second person), and a distinctly lower-class New Orleans lifestyle. He's also a man about whom his own pet phrase could apply: \\"Do I believe what I am seeing?\\"Set in the New Orleans of the 1960s, A Confederacy of Dunces begins with an incident with an overzealously inept policeman that leads Ignatius, one of the most unforgettable characters of American fiction, into a world with which he is unfamiliar and ill-equipped-work. As a result, he encounters a cornucopia of characters-from the cynical female owner of the laughably named \\"Night of Joy\\" to the wizened owner of the equally ill-named \\"Paradise Hotdogs\\"-who are as unforgettable as Our Hero. The most memorable is undoubtedly the generically named Jones, who, behind his dark glasses and his cloud of cigarette smoke, manages to see the world, its people, and the ironies of situation all too clearly. There are also Ignatius's wine-loving mother, his irascible neighbor, and \\"Myrna Minx\\"-the closest Ignatius has ever had to a girlfriend.Ignatius, taken away from his magnum opus (written on a series of Big Chief tablets strewn everywhere in his room in his mother's house) and the modern movies he so likes to deride, touts the value of The Consolation of Philosophy and bemoans the work of Fortuna while attempting to leave nothing to chance. To feed his laziness and lack of desire to work, he works hard at being sly, devious, and manipulative. He carefully plans and plots his efforts from the perspective of a man who has little perception of human nature; the results are hilariously unexpected-the whims of Fortuna. In the end, Ignatius's life, such as it is, will never be the same thanks to his forced interaction with the outside world.A Confederacy of Dunces will make you laugh out loud and, at the same time, you will probably detect an undertone of sadness, even hopelessness. As Walker Percy notes in his introduction, perhaps this is due to the knowledge that author Toole committed suicide. But perhaps it is equally due to the absurdity of modern life that the adventures of the larger-than-life Ignatius reveal at every turn.Diane L. Schirf2 June 2002."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This was quite possibly the funniest book I have ever read. It was shaped around the star role of Ignatius, but carried a slew of characters who had me bursting with laughter. It is a shame Toole did not stick around a bit longer to grace the literary world with the skill we are so desperately in need of."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The author's command of the language is breathtaking. His depictions of the characters are razor-sharp. The book is a magnificent creation.I still didn't like it. The protagonist makes me cringe, and I spent much of the book trying to will him to get himself together. Only a good writer can get readers involved like that, of course. I just don't like to get involved in this kind of unhappy, depressed tangle -- not in real life, and not in literature.I recommend that people try the book. Some will abandon it after 50 pages. Some readers will enjoy it immensely. Very few will ever forget it.Finally, I offer the opinion that the author was a genius. I did not care for the subject matter of this book, but I say the same of some of the works of Charles Dickens. If this author had lived, I think he would have created a large body of significant work and that I would have enjoyed a good part of it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I know A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is a classic, has won tons of awards, and is some people's favorite book of all time, but I found myself underwhelmed. Ignatius was original and a lot of the writing was hilarious, but the plot was so clunky and uninteresting that I spent a lot of time wondering where the book was going. I tried to give Toole the benefit of the doubt, but over time even Ignatius and his little stories became repetitive. I grew bored reading about a character without any real plot to bring it all together. When I finally got to the climax I had a 'this is it?' reaction."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have been disappointed in the past by great comic novels. This time, I laughed out loud on the subway to and from work at scenes of bewitching absurdity. Ignatius has a way with words that is sharply at odds with his position in the world. If you can't laigh at the hot dog vendor who eats his own profits well then, I feel sorry for you!The adventures are silly, and delightfully so. I think a person who doesn't get this book is taking Life too, too seriouslY! Lighten up and enjoy the racous New Orleans nightlife, the mad stereotypes. Irene, Lana and co. are just flights of fancy that will divert you from reality."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"If I'm being sent to Angola (the prison or the nation) and get to bring just two books? As of today, I go with Confederacy and an ESV Bible (we'll make it the Reformation Study Bible in black leather).After 805 reviews here, I have nothing new to add. Just joining my voice to the recommendation list, and sharing my own small experience with this wonderful book.I was up til 4:30am reading it last night and only got to p. 39, between the laughter, and wanting to re-read a well crafted paragraph over and over. Kind of like the very first time you popped R.E.M. 'Murmur' into your CD player -- you just had to listen to each sng a hundred times.The interesting part to this experience last night -- I had just heard a talk by Anne Lamott about her Xian faith and being an artists. Wonderful stuff. Met her afterwards and bought her new acclaimed book, Plan B. Well, I didn't even crack the cover of the (certainly amazing) Lamott book all night, because that would require pulling me away from Confederacy.Take David Brooks' DNA and splice its best parts with Flannery O'Connor's. Add in some Jaques Maritain and P.J. O'Rourke. Take the child that results and drop him into Uptown New Orleans -- when science can achieve this we may finally get another comic novel approaching this. Until then, we have Confederacy, and nothing else.As has been noted in several of these reviews, Toole was a college instructor in New Orleans in the late 60s. He wrote this novel and saw it rejected by all the major publishers. He killed himself in response, age 32. So his mother took the manuscript and forced it upon Walker Percy in 1976, who thought she was silly, but gave a look to the first page only because he rashly promised her he would. He said he knew quickly he was reading the best comic novel of the 20th century. Through his intervention it was finally published in 1980, more than ten years after Toole's death. It immediately won the Pulitzer.Its main character Ignatius Reilly is a New Orleanian freak through and through (his sole bus ride to Baton Rouge made him vomit). He may be the only 300 pound sloth in history to wear an undersized lumberjack shirt on Canal St. Percy has called him a mad Thomas Hardy, a fat Don Quixote, a perverse Thomas Aquinas, all rolled into one.Disclaimer: It is roughly R-rated. Not good for many homeschooled 13 year olds."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ok, my title may seem to have a touch of hyperbole but I stand by it...My buddy picked this up as a birthday present from a school library where he worked as a janitor. I feel kinda bad about that but it's one of my favorite possessions. I read this about once a year.Ignatius J. Reilly exists in a lot of people but no one has ever painted in black and white print such an intrusive, brilliant, (...) belly-pain-laugh inducing, exact portrait of such a person in any book, movie, anything I've ever seen.He's Homer Simpson disguised as an enlightened sophisticate, with a Master's Degree, apparently in disapproval.Some seem to be turned off by such a hypochondriac slob profit-eating hot dog vendor and that's understandable but how anyone can not roll over with laughter at just the prose and style itself:Ignatius telling his poor, poor mother for the like 27th time of his horrifying (but completely uneventful and quite successful for the Greyhound company) bus ride from New Orleans to Baton Rouge:\\"Speeding along in that bus was like hurtling into the abyss.\\" and \\"I vomited several times. The driver had to stop the bus somewhere in the swamps to let me get off and walk around for a while. (His poor, poor mother) The other passengers were rather angry. They must have stomachs of iron to ride in that awful machine.\\"The man is remarkable in his obliviousness to his negative impact on his surroundings yet unwaveringly certain of his profound insight into all societal ills. Kinda like Bill O'Reilly!And the descriptions of Jones, an oft-harassed black guy in the 1960's south, who drills down his observations of the goofballs around him with keen and rational wit coming out of a cloud of cigarette smoke just slay me.I swear to God, if you are a fan of stylistic but original writing and that effortless arrangement only a few people can do with the English language - Tom Wolfe, Joseph Heller, and even Dave Eggers (and Eggers is gonna blow my review for some people - as if anybody is out there is poking around at 1981 fiction novel critiques...) check this book out. In some circles it is considered one of the greatest American novels ever.It's a rip-roaring hoot. Free at your public library (unfortunately not at City High in Iowa City though). The first 10 pages will tell you if you want to keep going or not."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is an amazing book, alternatively hilarious and heart breaking.Ignatius is often cited as a reason not to like the novel, and I confess he's a repulsive human. But I don't think it's the lack of hygiene, compulsive masturbation, flatulence or obesity that turn people off of Ignatius. He stands as a question to every social convention and class distinction, every rule and law, across the board. He objects to the idea of blacks becoming middle class, not because he wants to keep them down, but because he is horrified of the middle class. Likewise, his anti-feminist attitudes that are a function of his peculiar notions of sexual morality. For that matter, his sabotage and indolence on the job is a function of the fact that he does not want a job, but is forced into employment. Ignatius irritates people because he requires you to think about some of your simplest assumptions about life and morality.The comparison to Don Quixote is not a bad one, but it is far from complete. He has elements of vejk as well, and is ultimately an original. The dialect writing is on a par with any Southern writer, including Faulkner. The humor is grand, and while I keep hearing that it's being developed for the screen, my stock reaction is that I'm stunned that no one has made it into one already. Virtually every scene in it is almost designed for the screen.Toole's characters are so complete and compelling, and the situations he engineers for them are so clever and amusing, it's easy to take the book less seriously than it deserves. For a book written in the South in the 60's, it deals with a remarkable number of social issues that really didn't break through until after Toole was dead. Gay rights, the sexual revolution, feminism, social responsibility, the anti-war movement, the social safety net, geriatrics/elder-care, it's all in there. Some of it had started to break the surface by the time Toole killed himself, but he was way ahead of the curve on so many things.For that matter, Ignatius ultimately raises the question of whether society has an obligation or even the right to 'help' mental misfits who don't want help. Ignatius has to be outrageous specifically because his legal and benign idiosyncrasies are interpreted from the start as being criminal and menacing."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book was great. Toole is masterful in creating amazingly funny images. Very easy to read and made me laugh a lot at many of the situations the main character, Ignaitius faces. Definitely worth buying and reading...Now to the long review, for all of you who have the patience to read something like this:The genius of John Toole shines in his \\"Confederacy of Dunces,\\" a novel about a strange, poor middle-aged man removed from reality of the present. The novel uses several key strategies to make its reader laugh. Most important of all is the character of Ignatius, a young man and the main character of the book. Toole also uses tools like extreme exaggeration and stereotyping, and he relies on Bergson's idea of mechanical encrusted on the living as the means of comedy. Because of the use of these tools, the book moves and makes the reader laugh and sympathize with poor Ignatius, a slow, big hunk of a human.On the first page of the book the reader runs into the main character's description, which, by the end of the book, becomes synonymous with the character's name, Ignatius. Just analyzing the description (or a part of it, not to spoil the fun and waste too much space) itself can bring great insight into the success of the novel.A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs... Ignatius himself was dressed comfortably and sensibly... The voluminous tweed trousers were durable and permitted unusually free locomotion. ... (13)The basic description of Ignatius keeps on in the similar manner. Toole shows the main character of the book, a rather large man in his middle thirties, to have a very disturbing appearance. His jacket is old and smelly and makes him look like a lumberjack. His hat adds to the overall hilariousness of the outfit and provides an extra object to make fun of. Ignatius himself is described as being of extreme proportions, and, when walking, all of his weight shakes with each and every fold of his presence. Toole creates a very powerful image of Ignatius, a large barely moving mountain. Amongst normal (not to Ignatius' perception, however) people, who would not have much trouble of walking or running, Ignatius is the king of taking breaks and lunch times, showing him restricted from certain human flexibility.Henri Bergson, in his study of laughter, \\"Laughter: an Essay on the Meaning of the Comic,\\" proposes the following idea: in order for a comic to be funny, he should lack the adaptability of a human being. This has been known as \\"the mechanical encrusted on the living,\\" since robots and other mechanized devices can not adapt to their surroundings as much as humans can. To clarify this idea, here is a typical example of such behavior. Imagine a person walking on a street, and there is a banana peel laying on the ground. There are two possibilities: the person walks around the banana, or steps on it and falls. When would people on the street most likely laugh or chuckle? If the person walks around the banana, nothing happens. (A couple of gloomy faces walk away, perhaps) However, if the person steps on the banana and falls down, a loud roar appears. This situation is funny because any person should be able to miss the peel, but if they don't, they are less adaptive than viewers, and thus more mechanical.Ignatius immediately jumps out as being more mechanical than people around him. Primarily, his physical shape makes him into such a comic: at one point of the book, he and his 80-year old mother run up the hill. Ignatius prompts his mother to stop running because he is afraid of his heart failing. This situation is already funny - Ignatius can not keep up with an 80 year old woman - and signifies another tool used by Toole to make his book work as a comedy, but more on that later. Since Ignatius can not keep on going, he is less flexible and that makes the reader both laugh at and sympathize with the mountain of a human being. Throughout the whole novel, Ignatius nags and whines about his life, or how he has broken something after bumping into something else. Ignatius also acts like a five year old, whenever he feels like, thus becoming less adaptive to his surroundings. Another reason for Ignatius to be a comic character is the way he dresses. His old, smelly, dirty, ragged clothes show externally his internal disbelief into modern society. And, of course, the reader must agree that Ignatius looks plain silly in his \\"practical\\" outfit.Coming back to the example of Ignatius asking his mother to stop running, it can be seen that this particular situation is funny because a 30-year old man can not keep up with an 80-year old woman. Bergson calls this situation an inversion, where the roles of two objects or people are reversed. Normally, it would be expected for the mother to ask her child to stop running (at least of the ages the reader is presented with in the novel) and to take a break. However, Toole makes the situation funny by reversing Ignatius' and his mother's roles.Another reason for the above-mentioned situation to be comic is Toole's masterful use of exaggeration. The easiest example to give is the Igantius' size. He is gigantic or even ginormous (if such a word actually existed). This alone creates a funny image in the reader's mind. In addition, there is also contrasting exaggeration, which can be defined as making something very important or big when it is not, and underemphasizing something important. A good example of this technique can be found in the scene, where Mr. Levy, the owner of the pants factory, hears the story about the small uprising of the workers. When he asks Ignatius of the event, the latter asks to fire the person who broke his flower pot and attempted to cut his name sign out of cardboard. When Mr. Levy asks the factory workers what happened, they tell him that Ignatius tried to make them attack the manager of the company. It can be seen that what is important to Ignatius is far from what is truly important. Toole uses this technique throughout the whole novel to contrast Igantius' beliefs and principles to the people around him or at least the general stereotype of normal people.This brings on the last discussed technique used by Toole to make his reader laugh - stereotyping. In the \\"Confederacy of Dunces,\\" a couple of stereotypes play a major role: fat people like to eat, cops are stupid, Africans Americans work as cheap labor, just to name a few. Toole draws a parallel with the work of Woody Allen, who likes to use stereotypes in his movies and writing. (That can be seen rather easily in \\"Annie Hall.\\") The example of the first stereotype is easily seen from the text - Ignatius always eats something or thinks about lunch. The most vivid encounter with Ignatius' food habits is experienced by the lieutenant and the doughnut box after Ignatius went through it - few of left over from a dozen jelly doughnuts had all the jelly sucked out of them. The image of a large man sucking jelly out of doughnuts makes hair stand, but shows pretty well the stereotype of an oversized person: doing nothing else but eating food, watching TV, and laying down.The next stereotype explored by Toole - the stupid police - is shown rather well by Lieutenant Mancuso, who tries to arrest Ignatius for no apparent reason (other than a funny looking hat). Mancuso is shown as an incompetent policeman since he can't catch any true criminals. The last stereotype is closely shown by Jones, the floor sweeper of a shady bar, and all of the workers of the pants factory. Toole plays on the stereotypes and creates dialogue closely resembling to the stereotypical conversations, thus creating amusing situations and making the reader laugh.By using the techniques of extreme exaggeration, stereotyping, and mechanical encrusted on the living, Toole provides the driving force for his comic novel \\"Confederacy of Dunces.\\" Toole intertwines many of the above listed tools and uses them creatively to persuade the reader to laugh and sympathize with the poor, huge, out-of-this-world man named Ignatius."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"THE CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is one of the strangest novels I've ever read, but that translates as meaning, also, \\"fabulously original.\\" I had no idea what to expect, and I will admit from the first paragraph until the final moments, I had not idea what was coming next, who would do what, and what the whole point would be. I was grateful for an understanding of classic comedy because putting it into the context of that genre, the characters freeing themselves from their constrictions, and the rejuvenation in the end of one of them, helps to give structure to the mass of this.But this book is STRANGE, even with that window of understanding. The main character, Ignatius J. Reilly is the anti-hero of anti-heros. He is in no way likeable. He is slovenly, selfish, dismissive, judgmental, insulting, egoistic, superior and a blow-hard. Most of the other characters don't seem much better. Though his mother is long-suffering at the hands of Ignatius, she isn't blameless in the way he's turned out or in the way the two of them proceed as a family. Ignatius's ex-girlfriend, who is now his pen-pal of blame and pessimism, is self-righteous about her never-ending causes, but it is clear to see that she is in it for her personal gratification and cares very little for the actual people she is supposed to be helping. After several chapters, I burst out in frustration, \\"Why are we reading this book? These people are vile!\\" But the wildly careening plot, the characterizations and the humor kept me going until the end.The plot seems to move from the point at which Ignatius's mother got in a car accident at the beginning of the book after Ignatius barely eludes capture by the police for being \\"a suspicious character.\\" Due to financial straits, Ignatius must earn money to pay of the bills for the accident. He tries his hand at two separate jobs, each time interpreting the positions in his own Ignatius J. Reilly way, and each time coming up with a bizarre turn of failure.This book is FUNNY. There are some things in here I will continue to refer to, such as Ignatius's sayings: When he is shocked by something, he bellows, \\"Do I believe what I am hearing?\\" and when he is upset with someone's behavior, he hollers, \\"She must be lashed!\\"It's a sloshing whiz-bang (though oxymoronical, I think that fits this book) of a novel.

As a matter of fact, the ending alone is worth the price of the book (Myrna and Ignatius deserve each other).I found myself feeling embarrased for Ignatius throughout this book.

I would have to say that overall I enjoyed the book although I found myself not that found of any of the characters in this book. First and foremost Ignatius J. Reilly the protagonist of this story begins the story as a lazy disgusting excuse for a person and pretty much maintains this persona through the entire story. It seems the Ignatius isn't happy unless his slothful ways are causing problems for other people around him. Rather it is a fight in the streets outside of the Night of Joy, yelling in a movie theater or writing a letter that could potentially cause another man his livelihood Ignatius seems to not care in the least how his actions affect others. Irene Reilly seems in the begging to be the one sane character in the book but I quickly came to realize that she seems to be nothing me than an enabler for Ignatius' wild antics. Myrna Minkoff really starts off as the craziest character in the novel but towards the end of the novel I came to believe that Myrna was the only sane person in this whole crazy book. Despite the fact that Myrna seems to be an over privileged Jewish beatnik that concentrates all of her energy on the sexual revolution she is the only genuine good person in this novel. Even though this book is completely fiction and is set in a wild and crazy setting it feels sometimes like I can relate to these characters because they act like real people. I could see myself in some of the situations in this novel. Overall this was a good read and I would recommend it.

Ignatius was sold to me by the person who recommended the book as a modern Don Quixote, but I found none of Quixote's endearing character traits in Ignatius. There was something noble about Don Quixote's blind devotion to his quest. I can't recall anything noble about Ignatius. Maybe that was Toole's point. Maybe his novel is a commentary on modern man's wretched condition. If so, I was too disgusted with Ignatius to notice."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I was surprised this won a Pulitzer. All of the main characters are repugnant & lame.

If verisimilitude is still a quality to be looked for in fiction, why in the world would I want to have any association with slob extraordinaire Ignatius J. Reilly! Soon enough, the choice wasn't up to me. But it wasn't because of Reilly himself; rather, it was because of all the other characters, each stringently drawn within parameters one would expect of minor characters, but all interacting with Reilly. My empathy with the main character, therefore, resulted not from Ignatius J. Reilly himself, but from the others in the book who gave me reason to appreciate this man. For most of the rest of the story I laughed the same as everyone before me."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"&quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; gives the reader an interesting look into the life of Ignatius J. Reilly, the main character involved in a hilarious chain of events. Most readers will come to absolutely loathe Ignatius' mistreatment of his mother, pompous attitude towards blacks, homosexuals, and most humans for that matter, and his mannerisms toward his ventures in the working world. Set in the late 1950's in the seemingly blas&eacute; city of New Orleans, Louisiana, Ignatius, a disgustingly obese bringer of negativity, has a conflict with any other member of the human race, including Myrna Minkoff, an old beatnik girlfriend of Ignatius from his college days. Throughout the novel the two correspond via mail, describing the changes taking place in the country from their point of view, while hilariously exaggerating the events themselves. Ignatius also butts heads with his mother, who believes her son to be lazy and useless (and right she is indeed. The man is thirty!). Though understated, Ignatius has many insecurities, and though he has a college education, he has a conflict with himself and his correspondence with the social world.The charm and delight you'll find reading this novel is not within the hatred of Ignatius, but the underlying intrigues taking place amongst the antagonists, all of whom have come to know Ignatius in a rather unpleasant way. Patrolman Mancuso is forced to wear tacky costumes and work the dregs and ghettos of New Orleans when he attempts to arrest Ignatius in front of a local department store. The ball goes on rolling from there, creating many subplots that win the attention of the reader.Some people will find that they dislike the protagonist, which may keep them from reading further into the story. The author, John Kennedy Toole, does such a fine job creating memorable characters that you just may want to keep reading to see what lies ahead for the other characters, and how the vile Ignatius affects the paths of their lives. Using the Levy Pants company, Toole symbolizes the underpaid black workforce of America during the late 1950's, and uses New Orleans as a platform on which America is represented at the time. Though hilarious with dialogue, action, and personl musings, &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; won my heart because it is a truly great novel with an ambiguous message of the American culture and its acceptance of unorthodox protocol."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"John Kennedy Toole killed himself because nobody would publish this book. His efforts had gone unnoticed, thought he; he was a failure. History proves him wrong, as we have seen A Confederacy of Dunces go on to win the Pulitzer and has reached and entertained countless readers. The book itself is sheer genius, as was the man behind it.There is not a moment where this book lags. Every sentence keeps popping fresh bubbles. The imagery is hilarious and the word choice and sentence structure is exquisite! Some parts of the book make you laugh outright at the sheer insanity of the writer's humor. The characters seem to come alive as you read.Ignatius Reilly is a 300 lb. lovable goof who lives with his mother. Throughout the book, we see him combatting every thing and every person he encounters. He is a martyr to non-conformity and to his ego. Very set in his ways, he goes from job to job, angering people to the point of insanity! Yet, he simply doesn't care. His poor mother! All you think about during this book is what will Ignatius do next?John Kennedy Toole was a also martyr, not only to his art but, like Ignatius Reilly, also to his own ego. He breathed life into his characters and it was too much for him to bear that nobody could see them alive and performing right before our very eyes, and so the tragedy occured which planted the seed for a generation of readers to harvest his great humor and style. While he is not alive to reap the benefits he so desired, the book is a gift to a multitude of readers. One can only hope that the John Kennedy Toole's of today are not overlooked."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"John Kennedy Toole wrote this one great book and sent it around to publishers and agents, but nobody wanted to publish it or even much liked it, so he committed suicide. After he was dead, it won the Pulitzer Prize. (If the internet had been around, he could have just posted it online, and we all could have enjoyed it--emailed to tell him--then maybe he'd still be writing timeless literature.) The farcical structure of this outrageous novel and its wonderful characters will be a source of joy forever. Lesson: Don't kill yourself too soon. Also: Trust yourself. And: Read &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces!&quot;"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is simply the funniest novel I've ever read. It's BRILLIANT! Ok, I may be a bit biased because I'm from New Orleans. But if you ever have any plans to visit that city, then read this book. You'll learn more of it's quirky people and their colorful lives from this book than any other."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A co-worker recommended this book saying that it was the best he had ever read--and re-read. Intrigued, I looked it up here, and ordered it. I just now finished it and I am still shaking my head in wonder and amazement. Incredibly funny and down right sad at times with a cast of characters and situations that left me wanting a second book. Sadly, that will never be. This book is a gem."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is nothing short of absolute genius. True, it's hilarious. However, it's hard not to notice the ominous parallels between the life of Ignatius and that of the author. John Kennedy Toole saw through his eyes daily, the famed &quot;Great Folly of Man&quot;, and it made him sick. Sadly,he took his own life to save himself from the barrage of corruption and blindness of the Truth. After a second reading, I came to a great realization. Ignatius isn't Toole. He's everybody whether they admit it or not. Deep down we are ALL eccentric, and not that different from the &quot;crazies&quot; we shun. We're all in the same boat, and nobody has ever expressed this in words better than Toole. One thing's for sure: Toole is in a much better place now. It's up to us to see through all the bulls*** we call &quot;normal&quot;. Peace."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I realize I'm in the minority, as everyone seems to LOVE this book, and finds it MOST amusing.

Can't even make myself finish the book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I enjoyed this book and am glad that I read it BUT it was a 3 star book for me for one reason. When it is funny, it is REALLY funny. When it is not funny it is REALLY boring. Still worth the time for the laughs but not a masterpiece in my opinion."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Like its main character, the formidable Ignatius J. Reilly, \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is brilliant, difficult, megalomaniacal, insane, hilarious, offensive, bloated, impossible, and completely entertaining.And above all, huge. Ignatius, an over-educated, delusional lump of a creature, could be seen as a symbol, but he's much more entertaining as a character. He's essentially insane, and unlike most protagonists, he never changes. But he certainly changes the lives of everyone lucky/unlucky enough to interact with him. If he ever finishes his opus, \\"Journal of a Working Boy,\\" I'll be first in line to read it.\\"Dunces\\" is a no-holds-barred literary satire, one which finds targets everywhere. No ethnic or minority group is safe from Toole's pen - particularly the bourgeoisie. But look a little deeper and you'll see that Toole isn't indulging in stereotypes, but turning them upside-down. You can be offended by his depictions of blacks, gays, women - and men, for that matter - but in the anything-goes world that he created, all is fair in love and war, and this is certainly war.At the risk of sounding pretentious, I think \\"Dunces\\" is a comic \\"Moby Dick,\\" a big transcendental THING that proves the power of words. At the risk of sounding superficial, I'll say I laughed out loud a LOT reading \\"Dunces.\\" And at the risk of my sanity, I'll say the world needs more Ignatius J. Reillys. And Mancusos, and Jones, and even Minkoffs.Oh...and does anyone else think Comic Book Guy is based directly on Ignatius?"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I read this last year for a school project. We got to choose a novel of our choice, and I chose this because I had heard about how good it was. Whoever told me that wasn't lying.Those who call the humor sophomoric probably missed a lot of the intelligent humor. Certainly some of the humor dealt with Igantius's bodily functions, but most of the humor had to do with Ignatius philosophy and how it dictated his interactions.I also disagree with people who said that none of the characters were likable, although this is strictly a matter of opinion. I found Ignatius to be initially repugnant, but my understanding of who he was increased as I read, and by the end of the book I liked him very much. I also have a hard time believing anyone could dislike Jones.I recommend this book to anyone, provided they go into it with an open mind."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I regret this novel ever finished. This is because the characters are so vividly and sympathetically drawn, the atmosphere of N'Orleans so effectively captured, and the cadence of speech so real, one is filled with an indefinable love of life itself through having experienced the world of Confederacy of Dunces. There's little plot and what there is I can't relate it. If there's a major theme it might be that even the lowest ragamuffin and connivingest wretch can be possessed of a surpassing wit and humanity that make them interesting and important in the scheme of things. Pride, greed, sloth, vanity, arrogance, venality, selfishness may possess the characters and yet an essential vulnerability and innocence and humanity make them redeemable. A lovely, lovely novel by a writer to be spoken of in the same breath as Twain, Dickens and Goncharov."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"What's the point of writing a review about this book, when there are something like 1200+ other reviews. It's clearly a great book that just keeps on selling-and-selling and is probably heading towards that rarified status of contemporary classic. If you haven't read it, do it now, or at least check it out on the Kindle edition!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Before reading this I was convinced that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Dr. Hunter S.

If you have spent any time there, you will know exactly what I mean."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"When my sister bought me A Confederacy of Dunces, she told me, \`people who are really smart think this book is funny. So if you don't like it, it's not my fault.' I will reserve comment on what my decision to join no confederacy of dunces against John Kennedy Toole means.A Confederacy of Dunces takes place in New Orleans. And it doesn't just take place in New Orleans. It revels in New Orleans, rolls around in it, drinks in the cologne of the French Quarter. It paints a tapestry of a particular place and paints it beautifully.A Confederacy of Dunces follows one of the truly great comic figures in American fiction, Ignatius J. Reilly, an obese momma's boy obsessed with the Middle Ages (I reserve comment as to whether I identify with Mr. Reilly). He's a bit prone to grandiose statements and philosophical musings of questionable merit. He is not prone to actual work of any sort. His preferred dress is a hunting cap, flannel shirt, baggy pants, and scarf.An event as innocuous as a minor car accident leads to the incredible but credulous string of events that comprise the plot. Toole is here a masterful choreographer, spinning the various plot threads back and forth, apart and together with seeming effortlessness. At no point does it ever cease to be hilarious.As an aside, I must say that no one will truly be free until hot dog vendor persecution ends."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I fear, in an alternate universe, I may be Ignatius J. Reilly. Perhaps it is my Irish Catholic upbringing that leads me to believe, in my dark moments, that despite my good intentions, I am worth less than a small pile of flea turds. When it gets bad, I break out this book and give it another read. The laughter it induces is enough to bring me out of my funk, but I also realize -- Damn! -- things could be worse.Here is a man who is obviously smart and well educated, but unable to function normally in human society. It isn't worthwhile to delve into the reasons because we don't WANT him to be anything other than his dysfunctional self. This man's ability to inadvertently cause trouble -- which ricochets through New Orleans, usually to return at an order of magnitude greater -- is prodigious. You want to like him, but he won't let you: you are too modern and probably an offense against any criteria of taste and decency. If you want to get on his good side, be seen carrying a copy of Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius, or, better yet, ask him about his trip to Baton Rouge.This is the only published work by the author, who committed suicide at the age of 31. We are only able to read it because his mother found a carbon copy of the manuscript in the trash. Others lament what we may have lost due do his untimely death. I am not so sure. It's not that I'm glad he's dead, it just presumes that he could have written more. Even so, should he have had a long string of successes, it would have lessened A Confederacy of Dunces, made it but one among many. Can't have that. This book must be a unique treasure."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius is as horrifying as the star of Silence of the Lambs. Sure, he's no psycho murderer. He's just a pompous righteous misguided oaf. Still, he creeped me out as much as Lecter in this masterful portrayal of American hypocrisy. The setting in Sin City New Orleans lent credibility to the racist and arrogant characters who came to life easily in the Toole's narrative. This is a classic and worthy of all the prizes it has garnered. I only wish I'd read it earlier.Ron LealosAuthor of Don't Mean Nuthin'"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I am 80 years old and this book was recommended by a man half my age. I had a small problem getting into the book, but once I did, I couldn't put it down. Ignatius is the devil you love to hate. Toole has created a wonderfully funny and moving story about our society and it's foibles. It is very sad that we will not be treated to this man's genius again."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is probably my favorite book. I think once I got into the crux of it, I laughed out loud on almost every page. Toole takes every opportunity to depict Ignatius as an unbearable oaf, and it is hilarious. I would recommend this to fans of \\"The Office (the UK one at least, maybe the American); Ignatius is more absurd and intolerable than David Brent! Expect a verbose read, but it is easy to fall in love with this story."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Stick with the story to the end, and you will find that it is not only a comic novel, but something else, too."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"One reading just isn't enough to do justice to this, yes, masterpiece.I've lost count as to how many times I've read ACoD, but it's probably around ten now, and every subsequent reading brings the genius of this novel into a little higher relief.A superficial reading will give you a few laughs. Another reading will give you a pretty good feel of New Orleans. Another one will add a dimension of sadness to the more obvious shortcomings of the several flawed or loathesome characters. By the fifth or sixth reading the loathing will have turned to a begrudging affection.By the eighth or ninth reading, you will be so familiar with the work you will begin to understand the genius of the moving parts contributing to something that utterly defies classification -- and you will be astounded by how far above and beyond the sum of its parts is ACoD."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A style of writing and character of which I am not used to. Qwerky character. Stick with it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is an oddly enjoyable book. If the film maker John Waters were to write a literary comic-drama, it would be like this. The dialogue is hilariously self-conscious and over-dramatic; the setting is appropriately tacky. Yet all this is accomplished as a sensitive critique of 1960's southern culture. Ignatius J. Reilly's ravings against modern society are both interesting and humorous. It is not an exciting book, but I greatly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"As much as I hate to divide a novel into neat compartments, this one surely deserves such a treatment. The undeniable core of the famous book - inhabited supremely by Ignatius J. Reilly - represents some of the finest imagination and humanity put to paper in American literature. Nothing like a deliciously insane, absurdly overeducated, overfed main character to pillar a story. Ignatius is elegantly drawn, his every movement and word perfectly, wildly entertaining. The other parts of the book sag and bore by comparison. Jumbled, ugly, dead-end dialogue, an abundance of overly silly misadventures and a story arc that never snaps to life."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I highly, highly recommend this book. You will undoubtably laugh out loud till you cry. This book is for the highly intellegent. If you think you are part of this selective group, read the book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"With so many people raving about this book this is hard for me to say, but somebody has to. This book is not that good. It is frustrating, self indulgent and ridiculous. As I read it I couldn't help but think that I was stuck in the front row watching bad British Theater. You know, the type of theater where the main character is a bumbling buffoon and everyone around him reacts to his antics in a manner designed to only encourage him. Meanwhile you're sitting there screaming in you head, \\"Just stop it! STOP IT! Stop behaving like complete idiots.\\"The reviews of this book use phrases like, \\"comic masterpiece\\", \\"obscenely funny\\", and \\"explosion of comedy.\\" Wow. With praise like that how could this book be anything but hilarious? But it's not hilarious nor is it obscenely funny and I am still waiting for the explosion of comedy. Ignatius is one of those characters who everyone has run into at some time in their life and has made every effort to avoid. He is a train wreck. He is outlandish, misguided, loud, arrogant and overly impressed by his own intellect. I wouldn't want someone like that in my life and while I was reading this book, I couldn't wait to get him out of my head.If you have not read this book, please, by all means, read it. When you are done come back and post your thoughts. Don't be intimidated by all the positive reviews. I have a feeling that there is a huge silent majority that is simply afraid to speak the truth. The emperor is naked and this book is not funny.I would bet that those that give this book such great reviews think that Benny Hill is a comic genius."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I agree with much of the negative criticism on Amazon about this book. The weirdness was not really a large problem as Toole was trying to create an alternate universe of quirkiness so his hero could wade and meander through his misadventures. Ignacious is a stagnant character and as a medievalist, he really couldn't do much else.What troubles me is that this book had the potential to good. Toole is a decent, although not a great writer. Look at all the similarities between Toole and O'Conner. We're talking about characters that bear the same nauseating intellectual thrust and lording it over their inferiors. However, Ms. O'Connor tells her stories with such elegance and simplicity that one cannot help but to hinge on her words. Toole has a huge problem of engaging his readers when he isn't using gimmicks, like a denuding parrot or a trio of nazi butch guards.Certainly, this novel was worthy of being published. It is undeniable a literary effort, but the effort strains the seams of the novel. I just feel that a much better read, if one is looking for a universe of quirky characters and engaging writing, is David Foster Wallace's \\"Infinite Jest\\" or even David Sedaris. David Sedaris' touch of humanism makes him a much better writer for sort of discussion Toole seemed to be interested in."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"As far as I can remember, I don't think I've ever written a review on his site.That being said, I hated this book enough that I actually felt compelled to write one.This book was passed on to me by a co-worker who raved on and on about how great it was. As it sat on my desk for the rest of the day, I had roughly 4 different co-workers walk by and notice it on my desk and tell me how wonderful it was.I also have a good friend who loved the book so much, he named his dog after the main character.I was really, really looking forward to reading this book.I've now had the book for 2 months and I've managed to trudge through 173 pages of it.I literally have to FORCE myself to read this.Not only does the entire storyline clomp along sloppily and without purpose or point, but the characters, Ignacious especially, are so incredibly unlikeable that I find myself getting annoyed and wanting to either toss the book out of a window or reach inside the story and smack them.I suppose those who enjoyed this would say \\"But isn't that the point? To incite emotion? To loathe the character so deeply that you have a physical repulsion to him?\\"No.If I'm going to delve into a story, I want to be pulled in, not shoved out.I feel like all these 5 stars and glowing reviews are the result of too many people wanting to look intellectual and cool by saying they love a story everyone else claimed to like, but no one has the heart to admit that this book is absolutely and unbelievably unlikeable."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I am so depressed now, after reading Confederacy of Dunces, I wish there were ten more novels telling about the life and adventures of Ignatius.

This book is a MUST READ"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The world of Ignatius Reily is very erratic but it is easy to identify with him. You are going to hate him at too many places in the story, yet there is something genuine about him. He does the most awful kind of things, but you never know whether he is doing that intentionally, full mindedly, absent mindedly or it just a part of his highly intellectual mideval, semi-selfish almost unemployed negligent personality.Apart from Ignatius Reily, there are more characters in the novel that are very genuine. I believe that genuinity of the personages gives a lot of vitality to the story.It is amazing to see that this book was written almost 30 years ago, but it is still very modern and the situation of Ignatius is absolutely not unusual to see at the beginning of the 21st century.If you like to read a book in order to think read A Confederacy Of Dunces. If you do like to read a book NOT to think you can also read this because readability and having fun with the story are warranted."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Five stars for the sheer lunacy and skilled wordcraft in this book! On behalf of all the misfits in the world, I would hope that the writers of the few one-star reviews would learn to laugh at themselves and find more understanding in their hearts. The book put me in touch with my inner Ignatius. Ah, the joys of expounding on one's worldview! The Internet is busy breeding a whole population of Ignatiuses (Ignatii)? under our very noses. I notice that many readers have gone on about how &quot;hysterically&quot; funny this book is, and declare that if you aren't rolling and snorting with gut-busting fits of hilarity on every page, there's something wrong with you. Well, I fall somewhere in between the helpless guffaws and the stone-faced indignation. We're brought up not to laugh at unfortunates. This book asks you to do just that, and of course it will make you cringe. (&quot;Seinfeld&quot; built its entire success on making people cringe! And those were not exactly likable characters either). Face the Ignatius in the mirror, America!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I loved it!!!!!! To put it bluntly, this has to be one of my favorite books. All of the characters were beautifully described, and with each scene, the reader felt that they were there.

However, the &quot;9s&quot; and &quot;10s&quot; on this list of customer reviews are, in my own opinion, quite deserved. And while I am touched by the story of Toole's tragic life, I am by no means influenced by it in coming to my opinion of how good the book is (although the story certainly enhances my pre-existent disgust with the publishing industry and almost all the pompous, self-important windbags I've ever met who work in it).Having said that, I must also say this: The people who have given this book a low &quot;rating&quot; scare the life out of me, in much the way that someone who continually quotes David Cassidy songs disturbs me. I am grateful, however, that in both cases, there aren't very many people who do, and most of them live in California, not New York."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I know I'm just adding to the heap, but, as this is one of my favorite books of all time, I have to comment. Toole has mercilessly caricatured nearly everyone and everything in his book, giving thereader an exaggerated, but palpable picture of New Orleans'neighborhoods, with neighbors in residence.Hilarious? You bet! But it is hilarity based on poignancy. Each new episode that the pompous but pitiable Ignatius embarks on brings its varieties of sad sacks. Yet you cannot help but laugh. And laugh.

Rarely, novels come along where the reading of each and every line is a momentous climax unto itself. Every word of A Confederacy Of Dunces counts. There is no filler. There are no lulls in the hilarity and outrageous buffooneries of one Ignatius J. Reilly. Slow, Fat, Awkward, Flatulent, Gastric, Impudent, Boastful. Single words alone don't even begin to describe what can only be understood by experiencing him in his magnificent splendor, as he crusades for causes unknown and victimless injustices. He is at times as simple and uncomplicated as the Big Chief tablets upon which he inscribes his numerous diatribes against the modern world of nearly four hundred years before him. At others, he creates amazingly complex schemes geared expressly toward the purpose of avoiding gainful employment. He is an anti-hero whom we can't help but love and despise in the same instant, surrounded by a cast of equally engrossing simpletons as they try to unsuccessfully reason his motives and actions.

Indeed, Toole's work, in the most general sense, is very much like &quot;Catch-22&quot; in its use of an outsider anti-hero and other eccentric characters wandering through a morally ambiguous and often absurd universe that is our own world reflected in the mirror of irreverent social commentary. There are even brief moments when Toole's prose gives the reader a whiff of Heller. Toole's anti-hero, however, is not imbued with the charm and savvy of a Yossarian. Ignatius Reilly is a tremendous, mad philosopher who suggests the image of Thomas Aquinas reflected in a concave funhouse mirror. His character switches from imperious to childish and from infuriating to pathetic. The reader will also find that Toole almost seamlessly unites the entire novel into a single intricate plot, which is a contrast to &quot;Catch-22&quot;'s interrelated and thematically similar, but largely independant sub-plots. In summation, any reader who has been hungry for Helleresque fiction and doesn't mind a relative lack of philosophical depth will probably enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I first stumbled across this fabulous work on a sale table at the bookstore where I worked.

Knowledge of Toole's suicide and his mother's quest to get the work published was a compelling story worthy of its own book. Unfortunately, the foreword cast a pall over the book that suggested the novel had to be so great that the author's death was more than it really was -- a tragic suicide -- and therefore worthy of a Pulitzer, no less.I wish Toole had developed the Levys more in my opinion. They were more fascinating than Ignatius, his mom, Santa Battaglia, Angelo and Claude put together.Furthermore, is anyone else of the impression that the comic book store owner on the cartoon show The Simpson's was modeled after our friend Ignatius?"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I discover something new each time I read this and it just keeps getting better and funnier.

The first and only book I ever burned. I felt manipulated and let down by the writer's postmodern refusal to give readers any reason to sympathize with characters. Then a couple years later I read it again and finished it. This time it was the funniest thing ever. It was so original. It has the oddest twists and some very deep holes. Comedy and tragedy are closer than we think. I came back because of a newfound love for outside artists and the unpublishable (Jack Saunders). Also, perhaps I like it so much better *in comparison to establishment books*. Sure, it's not the only wacky book, but it's just so accurate and wild. I liked the surprising unevenness, too. Maybe I also finally saw thru what real manipulation is like (the slick pros like Tom Robbins, Heinlein, Harrison, McGuane, Heller). I thought they were all fresh at first, then I realized they were often schticking with formula and cynicism. Toole was too far out for that. Toole hits formula over the head with a bat and I appreciate it. Others do too, but they have NO humility---Toole does pathetic like no one else. (His suicide was a great tragedy of our brown-nosing literary system, but I'm sure it's the same fate as most other attempts at honesty in a logrolling PC elitist cynical world.)"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"...after all, as Ignatious Reilly proves in A Confederacy of Dunces, 10 years of college, a vocabulary that won't quit, and a roomful of Big Chief tablets filled with political treatises doesn't mean you're smart. In Ignatious's case, it just means he's really cynical.And hateful. If this book weren't so damn funny, it would be awfully hard to spend 300+ pages with Ignatious Reilly. One of the most spoiled, self-centered, lazy, and lunatic characters you'll ever meet, Ignatious has an audacity--like a Don Rickles insult--that makes you laugh in spite of whatever good manners you thought you had.Surrounded by a cast of supporting characters, who are equally as repulsive in their own way, Ignatious takes you on a journey through the absurd.

This is the funniest book ever written. John Kennedy Toole killed himself, in part, because this great book was rejected by myopic publishers. Thank God Walker Percy recognized genius, and thank you, Ignatius J."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"From the beginning to the end I could not stop laughing.The characters and situations are hysterical. Especially the main character's rantings and ravings. Priceless."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"You will probably never find a character as unique as Ignatius. He's disgustingly dirty, pompous, and very annoying. At 30, he still lives with his Mom (who caters to his every whim) and can't hold a job. He has no friends, and spends his time writing musings about life in his journals. Of course, he thinks his way of life is superior to everyone else's. Toole's descriptions of Ignatius attempting to join the workforce are hilarious. This book is well-written, and the funniest adult novel I've read in a long, long time. I highly recommend it, especially for anyone who likes off-beat and unique characters!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is a work of genius. At some level Confederacy of Dunces is a comedy, but its so unbelievably creative and so well written that it goes well beyond that. A great book, timeless, in the tradition of Cervantes, clearly something that will be read for a long, long time.The cohesiveness of the work makes it difficult to highlight partcular elements that stood out. There are impassioned explorations of character throughout - the central protaganist is at the same time too absurd to be real, and too completely concieved to be fiction. And there is a clockwork symmetry to the plot that comes together seamlessly and often hilarously at unexpected points. But perhaps the most striking thing I was left with was an affection for Igancious, the central character of the book. He's paranoid, manipulative, self-centered, ugly and unpleasant to all, and at the same time a completely sympathetic character. I'm not sure what magic Toole used to pull this off, but it is without question, beautifully done.There's a lot made of this being a New Orleans book, but the geography of the city seemed entirely secondary to the immediate environments it portrays - the shabby homes, the seedy bars, the dank bus station bathrooms, were much more real to me than the descriptions of the French Quarter.There were a few rough patches in the last few chapters, where the dialogue becomes a little disjointed. It seemed a bit less cleanly edited than the rest of the book. It left the feeling for me that maybe Toole wasn't fully finished with it, that maybe he had a tiny edit or two left undone. But the book comes back into its own full force at the dramatic crescendo, where a series of tiny one-paragraph chapters spell out the unfolding of the intertwined fates of its characters.There is an internal, almost symphonic logic to this work, with themes appearing and reappearing in different scenarios, in different characters throughout. In all ways masterfully done, a classic."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"....sure, that may be overdoing it. But after being given this book by a friend years ago, I couldn't put it down. I laughed at the absurdity of Ignatius J. Reilly, and cried at his apparent despair. To even think about the &quot;Crusade for Moorish Dignity&quot; or the exercise board Mrs. Levy was addicted to brings peals of laughter. I agree with others who have reviewed this book in saying that it really can't be categorized, or even really described - all I can say is that YOU MUST READ IT."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"One note: If you haven't finished reading a book, you should not write a review. It's been about 2 years since i first read this book, and I just recently started reading it again. But in that time, i've read many of the reviews, positive and negative, on this site. I get confused by them. When reviewing a book, especially one with as much hype this one has garnered, bold faced statements of &quot;Oh, my god, it's amazing...Read it!!!&quot;, or, &quot;this book is awful, don't read it&quot; have no place or context.I enjoyed the book because it did make me laugh consistantly and uproariously, while still maintaining a theme about an ego-centric slob with an inability to coexist with society in any sort of rational way. A theme that's quite relevent in today's culture, as well as in the past.I can't really comment on the downsides of this book, as I don't see any. What some of the better negative reviews have to say revolve around the absence of plot and repetitive circumstances. The plot, in simple terms, is this: Ignatius has no job, his mother &quot;forces&quot; him to get one, his reaction against and to the various jobs creates situations in which Ignatius must ultimately vacate the world he lives in or be destroyed.The repetitive circumstances, and I agree they exist, I believe help the novel show the reader what a jerk Ignatius is. he refuses to change, but that doesn't mean the people and world around him don't. Just look at his mother, the police officer, and Jones. They all change throughout the novel, which I believe is why people enjoy them so much over Ignatius.A friend recommended this book to me while browsing in a bookstore. I had never heard of it, and my friend simply said, &quot;You need to read this.&quot; I think people do need to read this novel, whether to like it or hate it, because the one thing I'm certain of, you'll never forget it, or Ignatius."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A book of comedic genius. Too bad the author wasn't recognized in his brief lifetime.

I was in the bathtub reading one night and my husband thought I had gone bonkers because he kept hearing me laughing out loud. I was reading the part where Ignatius came back from yet another day of hot dog vending with no receipts and had to explain about trying to put the stray cat in the bun compartment of his cart. You just have to read it for yourself to get the full flavor of the scene.Ignatius's mother is a literary marvel and their conversations and interactions are out of this world funny. His many comments about her hiding her wine in the oven were hilarious.I fell in love with Jones (Whoa! LOL!), the unfortunate black man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time and ends up working for minimal wage for a 'ho in the French Quarter. Jones almost steals the book from Ignatius....Mr. Toole captured the flavor and essence of New Orleans like no other author I've ever read.

Ignatius Reilly is an overweight, lazy, super-smart 30 year old who still lives with his mother. His adventures in the world of work are what drives this novel along with his philosophies of life (what he refers to as his \\"world view\\") which are nothing short of hilarious! To say that he is one of funniest characters in all of modern literature would be a gross understatement. Part Don Quixote and part Falstaff, the fun never stops as he makes his way through New Orleans low society. This book won the author a posthumous pultizer prize for literature in 1981. Sadly, the author committed suicide in 1969 after failing to get it published during his lifetime. Thankfully, his mother discovered the manuscript and as they say the rest is history.

Certainly Ignatius Riley, the main character, is one of the more memorable and strange characters I can remember. He's an overweight mustached intellectual with years of college training and no interpersonal skills. He's a slob, arrogant, cruel to his mother, eccentric and overly dramatic. Chaos trails him like the wake of an ocean liner. Yet for some reason you find yourself liking him, perhaps because the other characters he deals with all have their own glaring flaws. An unconventional story, with many impossible-to-predict curves.This, amazingly and unfortunately, was Toole's first and only book.

Reilly's interesting adventures (and misadventures) through New Orleans during the 1960s.Ignatius J. Reilly is a thirty-year-old overweight man that lives with his mother in New Orleans. Ignatius is an interesting figure not only because of his stature, but because he enjoy wearing plaid shirts and a large green hunting cap. Because of the way he dresses, he draws much unneeded attention to himself, which gets him in trouble in more than one occasion. He retells all of his \\"traumatic\\" experiences to anyone absurd enough to lend him an ear. His favorite would be the time he rode along in a Greyhound bus that was traveling to fast for his liking.Ignatius believes everyone has lost a \\"sense of decency\\" and are too caught up in the material world. He writes down his anger towards the regular dregs of society in his book \\"A Lengthy Indictment of Our Century.\\" Ignatius never strolls too far from his room where he creates his masterpiece, which leads his mother to demand him to get a job. Ignatius however, believes he is unfit for conventional employment, which would be correct, but he finds a job anyways.Toole exquisitely details Reilly's escapades as a workingman and is nothing short of hilarious. He first finds a job as a file clerk at Levy Pants, a clothing manufacturer. He befriends a elderly woman that has been working there many decades but has not retired because Mrs. Levy believes she would feel not welcome in society. Ignatius's stint at Levy Pants however was cut short when he tried to create an uprising for reforms. Shortly thereafter, he finds a job as a hot dog vendor. However when he his hot dog cart is stolen, he decides that, \\"The human desire for food and sex is relatively equal. If there are armed rapes, why should there not be armed hot dog thefts?\\"Throughout this novel Ignatius meets many interesting characters. Mrs. Lee is a very strict and at times insane owner of the Night of Joy Bar; Police Officer Manusco, whose job was to find suspicious characters by dressing like one himself; Miss Trixie, the old lady who works at Levy Pants that tries to retire but is always stopped; and of course Myrna Minkoff, the closest thing Ignatius has had to a girlfriend. Each character at some point in the novel brings in comic relief.A Confederacy of Dunces is a novel I believe everyone should read. It is a very humorous story in which Toole criticizes society through Ignatius. Toole however was incapable of taking his own characters advice: Boethius's rota fortunae. Wait long enough and the wheel of fortune will turn your way."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book made me laugh.Rather a lot actually. Ignatius Reilly is disgusting in just about every way imaginable, and man is it funny. His extraordinary opinions (about everything), plots, mannerisms, size, hygiene, and friends bring him and the people around him into the most absurd situations imaginable, and it's all you can do to keep from getting a stomach ache laughing at them so hard (the ab exercise this novel offers is truly remarkable). Each of the characters, Jones (my favorite), Ignatius's mother, Trixi (my other favorite), Mr. and Mrs. Levy, Patrolman Mancuso, strikes me as a literary comic marvel. The whirlwind plot ensnaring all of these lives is so brilliant. You can feel the comic tensions building and building until a final explosion hits that is as large as Ignatius himself.The book is also sad. Walker Percy (my favorite author) mentions in the introduction the suicide of the author, and that is part of the sadness. But there's more. The humor in the novel springs from the latent despair in each characters lives and their (for the most part) stuggle to change something. It feels as though the fates are in control of the novel, and they are out to offer a bit of sorrow and a bit of hope.Confederacy of Dunces is a book that can be taken a lot of ways. As entertainment, this is one of the most funny books I've read, but there is a sense of gravity here making this one of the most remarkable novels I've read. It's quite a masterpiece that I'll read again and again."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This novel should get more attention in High School reading programs - it will teach a lot about character developement. Additionally, it will teach kids now a days that reading is fun and can be funny. They are making it into a movie which should increase the popularity of this novel. Who will play the main character? I wonder if Oprah will pick it for her classics reading group. I would love to see that show. Can't wait for the movie - should be wickedly funny - if done right."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is truly an intensive study of sociopathology and cross-cultural elements. In addition, Toole depicts the events and characters so humorously and comically, that it is almost impossible not to laugh out loud while reading the book.Sadly, Toole took his own life, when he was unable to find a publisher. However, his mother persevered, found a publisher, and the book won the National Book Award the year it was published.With astonishing brilliance, Toole describes in fairly graphic detail, the basically non-productive life of the protagonist, and the mess he gets himself into, by creating his own little world, which has little relation to the real world around him.Ultimately, he ends up in a true crisis, and is only extricated, by his college friend from Manhattan. This book is truly a piece of comic relief that is timeless in its amusement. It should not be missed."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"What can one say about this book that would do it justice? It is simply one of the funniest, most well written pieces of comedic literature to date. Words cannot really describe it, you simply MUST purchase and read this book today. It is rare that a book can make you laugh out loud, but this book will do it over and over again.The main character of the book is a slacker who is everything but that to himself. He brings to life the phrase \\"a legend in his own mind\\". Thirty-something years old, living at home with his mother, unable to hold a job longer than a week, he continues to make excuses and get himself into more messes than one could imagine.The only tragedy about the book is the author's own. Not knowing that his work would go on to become critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winning material, he committed suicide before he had a chance to experience his own success. I could not help but laugh as I read the book, but be saddened upon finishing that the world will not be able to experience more works from a true writing genius."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This classic piece of comedy/socail satire ranks as one of my all-time favorite books. John Kennedy Toole has created one of the best characters of modern fiction in Ignatius Reilly, a highly edjucated, but socailly maladjusted buffoon who still lives with his mother at the age of thirty. A comic series of events forces him out of his womb-like existance to seek work in a world that fails to meet his &quot;worldview&quot;. Great characters and outrageous dialog fill this highly readable book with numerous laughs. That the author comitted suicide is a tragedy for the lovers of fiction."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The Confederacy of the DuncesBy Drew YoungThe Confederacy of the Dunces is a book written by John Kennedy Toole. This book is an enjoyable read, and it always keeps you on your toes. The main character, Ignatius J. Reilly is a thirty-year-old man who lives with his mother in New Orleans. He is well educated, but he just sits at home writing on big peaces of paper on what he thinks the world should look like. He goes through a hard time when his mother forces him to get a job to pay off debt. The events that follow are humorous and entertaining to any reader.The things that made this book interesting and good were, the unique characters, the characters personality, and the way the two plots were brought together in the end. The main character Ignatius comes across as a person who thinks he is the smartest person in the world. He is a large person with a unique personality and is often described as a whale with a mustache. He has a green hunting cap with flaps and he puts the flaps up when he listens and puts them down when he talks. His mother, who takes care of Ignatius, is a nice lady who has no friends. As the book progress she finds love, and becomes more social. Dealing with Ignatius's problems drove her to drink. At a point she gets frustrated with her son, and asks him to get a job. No job could fit Ignatius unique personality. The other thing that makes the book interesting is the way they have two plots run at the same time and they make no sense until almost two thirds of the way through the book. The author did a good job of making lose ends come together nicely at the end of the book.The thing I enjoyed most about is book is the way the author incorporated humor into the novel. This is probably the first novel I have ever read where I have laughed out loud while reading. However, Toole jumped into a plot with out warning. In the first chapter the author introduced the characters and the plot, but he did it in a way that I hadn't expected. This book was an enjoyable read, and the author's sense of humor was enjoyable. I suggest you read this book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I loved this book. It's impossible not to laugh at Ignatius character.

I've read probably 50 books since then and I can remember only a handful of them. Most just blend in. A Confederacy of Dunces stands out and I will always remember it. It is an excellent read with a band of quirky characters and bumbling idiots. It's a must read for anyone that appreciates good books and great writing."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A classic story that makes me a bit sad to think about considering that the author died young and by his own hand. Given American culture, that may be part of the appeal of the book to many. By any standard, however, this is a great book, with highly memorable, vividly described characters, none more so than the central figure Ignatius, a likeable, eccentric oaf. His part-time sidekick, Myrna Minkoff, is also a hoot, and I like it when the two of them gang up. Although it's in many ways a timeless story, the manner of speaking of the characters is probably representative of the times (1950s?). Given the short life of the author, the book has a bit of a tragic backdrop that affected my feelings for it, and the New Orleans setting with Katrina occuring a few years ago may now also affect my memories of it.

I read it a few years ago when I was going through a lot of employment crap (\\"My Calvin Seminary Story\\") and it was better than a boat load of anti-depressants.

He has disagreements with his mother, all of his employers, and pretty much every person he meets. He is a person that seems to be very real even including all of his extremes. He is disgusting and pretentious. But, he has been placed in a story filled with numerous conflicts and a New Orleans where he never seems to be the right fit. All of the ongoing struggles that Ignatius and the many other original characters encounter creates a fast and funny book. I had clashing thoughts myself toward the end of the book when I didn't know whether to hope that Ignatius is sent to the asylum or wish for him to escape all of the problems he has caused for himself. Either way, you know that all he will create is more conflict."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Toole's work is nothing short of brilliant.

Very amusing although I didn't really laugh out loud. I can't say parts of the book weren't disgusting, but hey. A quick read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The story has a collection of rich, very authentic characters intertwined in a fantastic plot. The guiding spirit of the cast is Ignatius Reilly, whose most impressive panache is only matched by his size. The absolute belief in his own high minded ways and lack of much regard for lesser souls make him quite a vociferous critic throughout the book. Yet, feisty and spirited are many others from Mr. Reilly's entourage. It is the inimitable Jones, the solitary black figure set off against all-white troupe, who managed to be so cool and defiant from his position of a strip joint janitor. Or the old and somewhat senile Ms. Trixie, who in the rare moments of wakefulness exhibited healthy doses of assertiveness and a strong belief in self worth. Ignatius's sweet mother Irene, hard-as-nails strip join owner Lana, tired factory owner Gus Levy, hapless patrolman Mancuso, the sexual revolutionary Myrna Minkoff and many others swirl around in the whirlwind set about by Ignatius when he is forced to leave his philosophical and historical pursuits and look for a job.Each character speaks beautifully distinct, easily recognizable language, from academic and arcane of Ignatius's to simple and sweet of his mother's to freewheeling Jones's.The story, following little crooked streets of New Orleans, takes most bizarre turns and, coupled with the colorful personalities of the cast, makes for a remarkably hilarious book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"...This book means a great deal to me, and every time I read it, I find something new. Hilarious and raunchy, this is one novel you wouldn't expect to find respectable Southern matrons clasping to their bosoms (of course, respectable Southern matrons can be very surprising). Ignatius pretty much speaks for anybody chained to their birthplace and longing for exotic adventure or bygone days in faraway places (North Africa or elsewhere). The best thing is how Toole manages to bring the world outside into the usually provincial world of Southern literature. For example, when I was eleven I knew what a \\"Mau-Mau\\" was, the identity of Norman Mailer, and the author of \\"The Consolation of Philosophy.\\" This book is not only a howler, it's an EDUCATION, and without question the best book ever written about New Orleans (especially if your family, rather than being of pureblood Cajun or Creole stock, is one of those great Irish-German families that are responsible for New Orleans' \\"reminiscent-of-Hoboken\\" accent)."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Very funny book!

This brings up some of the problems in modern society with the touch of humor and comedy. Very smart!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Add my name to the list of five-star reviewers. Ignatius is not disgusting, as some have written, he is real. His brilliant mind trapped in a capitalist world is what makes the story so hilarious, and so sad. A man whose valve slams shut, whose hands break out in white bumps, who is told to shut up when he plays his music, and who tries to help the downtrodden around him despite continually failing, is a good man indeed. I'm not sure I would like Ignatius if I were to meet him -- not sure that I'd pass the scrutiny of his gimlet eyes -- but I'm glad he exists on paper to point out some of the craziness in our world. I like to think that he and Myrna live happily and hilariously ever after in New York, and that Toole has found peace. The dunces may have been in confederacy against the book's initial publication, but the thinkers have formed a confederacy of support around this shining story."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"When I started to read this book I was suprised to read on and on. Not only did it make me laugh but it made me see so many truths of what is happening around us. Life is not so beautiful as we want it to be and Ignatius is a true seer of reality. He may be stuck in his own world but he takes his readers into fantastic adventures of life. He truly is the New Orleans Don Quixote. All the characters were extremely fascinating as we learned litttle by little about their lives and how they all slowly become connected to one man. The man who is Ignatius Reily and who makes this whole book very funny."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is the funniest book I have ever read and I can say that after reading it 4 times over the last 20 years!

After 3 readings, I find more and more subtle details that enrich reading this wondrous novel.

A great tourguide to New Orleans as well, needless to say."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Surely Ignatius J. Reilly, the struggling intellectual troubled by the worldview of his coworkers, acquaintances and his own mother is one of the most hilarious characters of modern literature? Living his life along the lines of Boethius, Ignatius is out to change the world through his various roles as a low-payed employee at a well known trouser company and hot-dog vendor. Troubled exceedingly by 'that minx' Myrna Minkoff, who is leading a sexual revolution, Ignatius is changing the world one step at a time. I would recommend this book to anyone needing some colour in their life for a taste of a brilliant character in the setting of New Orleans."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"If you can't find the book funny, there is something wrong with you. Eiher you think yourself of too serious and sophisticated a person, or you have no sensibility towards troubled people. Ignatius is a tormented genius full of ego, but Oh God, full of wit. Clearly Toole's life and experience is ignatius, the unreconized genius, but it is tragic that our society of stupid envious people destry these types of rare geniuses, whom all they need is understanding, and to be taught not to depend on people's aceptance. It is a very funny book, but it is sad, for they are heavy characters, but few people if ever in the history of literature have been able to shine so brightly under a ton of garbage. It is a book for those who do not loath and spite society's poor, depressed and unsophisticated, for they too have the capacity of genius that must endure its own hell. No wonder a mother Toole's mother after his suicide, kept 'till her eighties going from publisher to publisher to get the book on print. That my friends was the REAl confederacy of the dunces, and I can't but thank my mother whom introduced me to it! Hail Mama! Hail Toole and her Mama and HA HA HA !!!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Hilarious, witty, and overwhelmingly enjoyable.

As I read on, I felt myself not being able to put the book down. It keeps you reading on and actually laughing out loud. &quot;What degenerate produced this abortion?&quot; (69) This quote seems to sum up the main character, Ignatius.

The way the author writes about the protagonist and storyline is very interesting. He managed to project the images in the story really well.

The main character is a complete freak that loves to make other people lives a complete joke, but he really means it.Really recommend it, gives you an idea of the life on New Orleans around the 60s.Dont doubt it. Buy it!!!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"when i first picked this up and began reading i found that i received more pure pleasure from just reading his words assembled than anything else. his way with words struck a chord in my soul. it was almost like music sometimes does. a pure sensual experience. music sometimes touches my soul. reading this book came very close."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces is the story of a grotesque, anti-social, obese man who lives in New Orleans. He's hilarious, a homer simpson-esque character. He's repulsive, irresponsible, and dellusional, a lot like the widely adored dunce in the Simpsons.The strongest point of this novel is the character development. Toole portrays his characters in so much detail, depicting every nuance of characters like Ignatius, Mancuso, and Jones. Toole depicts all the characters thinking or doing absurd things. It's a story of caricatures.Fans of the great authority on laughter and comedy, Henri Bergson, will easily see why this novel is praised as a brilliant work of comedy. whether he likes this book or not, he can see that it's full of classic comedic tools proven to work. Caricatures, characters with really really exaggerated traits that seem almost mechanical, are funny according to Mr. Bergson. This element of humor is clearly present throughout the book. There are a couple of characters that can't control their bodily functions. There's plenty of subversion of authority throughout, a tool used a lot by the Marx Brothers and touched upon by Bergson. There's LOTS and LOTS of repetition.Personally, I didn't laugh that much while reading the book. Repitition is a good tool for laughter but only when used sparingly. The plot's too predictable. Some might say the plot is negligible since the main attraction of the novel is the comedy. But for me, comedy and plot go hand in hand. For example, the story Watt by Beckett is supposed to be a work of comedic genius despite being plotless. Through repitition and insane combinations and permutations of words, it's supposed to crack up the audience. Didn't really hit me on a gut level unfortunately.Anyways, i only recommend this book to reader's who can appreciate the process of analyzing award winning novels objectively to understand their greatness. Objective score: 5. Subjective score: 3. Average score: 4 stars."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"If you're looking for an easy read that will make you chuckle, A Confederacy of Dunces is the answer to your quest. The story of Ignatius J. Reilly takes place in the colorful city of New Orleans. Along with this, John Kennedy Toole creates a number of corresponding lively characters, from policemen, to mothers, to friends, to employers. The story follows Ignatius through his various attempts to find a job and live his life as much in the manner of a sloth as possible. Physically, Ignatius is enormous, which provides laughs due to the various comments and situations his size encourages.Personally, I don't laugh out loud when I read books, but Toole's tale of the overbearing Ignatius J. Reilly definitely had me smiling and giggling at points throughout the story. Toole has a wonderful ability to develop his entertaining and rich characters in a direct writing style that allows the reader to enjoy the book rather than be bogged down by complicated descriptions and scenarios. The most complicated parts of the book are the writings of Ignatius about his feelings and observations of society, and at this point, the reader is laughing at the lost intellectual and his self inflated view of the world.Don't pick up A Confederacy of Dunces if you're looking for an intellectually stimulating story. This is more of the kind of book that is good for a vacation or a light read before bed at night. Or maybe, it would even be a nice addition to a curriculum needing a more modern book regarding comedy that is skillfully composed.In general, A Confederacy of Dunces is a great read for the light of mind and heart. It is too bad that the creative genius of the author could not be more enjoyed due to his untimely death. For surly, once you finish A Confederacy of Dunces, you will wish that you could see what path Ignatius will continue to plow for himself in the future."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Interesting Book. Tough to digest it if you don't understand the many jokes. I must say, Toole's Confederacy of Dunces was entertaining. It definitely is a Confederacy of Dunces against Reilly in my opinion. No one understands the old soul's ideas in his modern world. He wants to revolutionize the industry, the world, the universe and no one understands him. It is unfortunate that he does not understand the time that he is in."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Whether you end up loving or hating this novel, one thing for sure is that you will be left with the memory of a character you will never forget. John Kennedy Toole creates one of the most massive, childish, grotesque, and filthy characters in all of literature. I myself had a smile on my face throughout the book, laughing at almost every line to come out of Ignatius Reilly's mouth. If anyone has ever watched Mad TV, picture a somewhat intelligent form of Stewart and you have Ignatius. Ignatius is a character we love to hate, find bizarre and absurd, but also feel a bit sorry for at times. While himself a disgusting creature in the eyes of the New Orleans community, Ignatius feels that it is not he, but the rest of society who is out of place. The way Ignatius puts his outrageous thoughts to words is hilarious, both in the meaning of his lines and the way in which he talks. From the opening paragraph any reader will see that this work is particularly strange. You never really can guess what Ignatius is going to do next. Whether it is frightening children at a movie theater or staging a murderous revolt at a clothing factory, Ignatius is completely unpredictable and I think this is why so many readers are attracted to him. This is a quick read, not a lot of plot or suspense, but quite funny and enjoyable to sit down to. If anything, read it to meet Ignatius."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"John Kennedy Toole's novel delighted me, and I found it interesting and intelligent throughout my read. Ignatius, waddling around New Orleans with his green hunting cap (and sometimes with his gold earring and hot dog stand), is a comic character who elicits sympathy and/or disgust, depending on the abuse he receives or his current mission.It seems that the narrator relates to Ignatius but also finds him repulsive. I believe the sarcastic tone also applies to the idea of Ignatius J. Reilly existing as a genius amongst dunces. No doubt that Ignatius is more intelligent than many of his New Orleans contemporaries, but he also keeps himself ignorant to the grief he causes his mother and the disastrous circumstances that follow his weighty shadow. Some may say this is why he is a genius - because he is on an enlightened level where others can never understand his musings. Or rather, he is educated yet misguided in many of his choices. Ignatius finds himself in the wrong time period and longs for the hierarchy of the Dark Ages.A Confederacy of Dunces is filled with amusing scenes - Patrolman Mancuso arresting the massive Ignatius, Jones' pretending to sweep the Night of Joy floor (while wearing his sunglasses), Miss Harla O'Horror's bird dance, the Gypsy Queen addressing the Quarter's \\"elegant\\" - just to name a few. The plot keeps you engaged, and you can't help wondering what crazy situation Ignatius will find himself in next. (I wished that Ignatious and Mrs. Levy could have encountered each other. The dialogue exchanged would have been great.)Toole's work is witty and makes you wonder whether a real-life Ignatius would be treated in the same way. If nothing else, I hope that you find this book humorous and inventive."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Its such a fantastic book that you will on laughing for several weeks after you finished it reading. Its not easy to find such creativity. I just regret that the author is dead so that we can not get any more ot its marvelous works."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Vividly drawn characters of the lower class locals in New Orleans, LA don't stand a chance against the gargantuan size, wit and appetites of Mr.Ignatius J. Reilly. He's a comically tragic man/child who lives life with mother in repulsively breathtaking self-absorbed abandon. His days are spent ralling against ALL offenses to his reason (real or imagined). Results range silly to serious and are every bit as offensive as Mr. Reilly himself. The ending is a cliff-hanging surprise (in tune with the unpredictability of the characters) leaving the reader wanting for more.THIS IS A MUST READ. Rarely does anything come along that so richly deserves the description &quot;unique.&quot;"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I first discovered this book almost ten years ago while in high school. I even managed to choose it for a history book report as the teacher obviously thought the story was about the war. Toole is a greater writer and it is a shame that we will never be able to read any other of his potential works. The main character is a sad, pathetic man who lives at home but looks at the world as if he is the only normal one around. He spares no expense in puting down his poor Mama and her cohorts. Really, this books is full of humor and you have to like Ignatious even though he is a pompous, gas-bloated recluse. Set in New Orleans, we get a glimpse of just some of the odd-balls that run into our narrator. I've read this book many times and each reading brings more laughs."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I think the funniest aspect of this book is how the author portrays someone who thinks he's a lot smarter than he really is. The opportunities to spot and appreciate that disparity are legion. This book didn't just make me laugh out loud, it made me howl. I laughed myself silly to the point of tears. The images conjured up by Kennedy's masterful descriptions are so ridiculous that if you ever saw it in real life, you'd piss yourself. The only author that has ever come close to evoking the same reaction from me is P.G. Wodehouse, and even he just gets hearty chuckles, nothing like the put-the-book-down-tilt-your-head-back-and-squawk reactions that this book delivers. This book capitalizes on the subtle quirks of simple people and the skewed logic with which they view the world around them. And while you laugh at these people, you occasionally have to check yourself for doing and thinking some of the exact things the characters do. That is what drives the humor home. Do yourself a favor and buy this book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I noticed more than one customer review that claimed, in not so many words, that it takes a certain intellect or at least a very refined sense of humor to appreciate or even understand this book. I only partially agree.I've been told my more than a few people over the years that I have a good sense of humor. I'm also a word person. I guess I qualified pretty well to be someone who might like this book.The book was easily the funniest book I've ever read. No less than three times it sent me into an uncontrolable laughing frenzy (other books have made me laugh out loud but this was scary). Ignatius' use of language was so perfectly crafted it made me wonder how many re-writes Toole must have gone through to get it just right.Back to the visualization thing. Whether or not one can fully apprecaite what Toole did isn't the only determinate as to if someone will find it funny (or as funny as some of us had). At the risk of sounding mystic, if the reader can literally plant themselves near or next to Mr. Reilly during any of his proclaimations, misdadvetures or diatribes, they might also be a victim of runaway and painful laughter"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is no lie. Once when I was confronted with a pile of filing at work, I remembered Ignatius. I thought what would he do? Dump it in the trash,of course! So,I dumped the papers and believe me, the world did not come to an end.In addition to getting rid of work-related stress, I have often gained strength from St. Martin de Porres, patron saint of mulattoes and rats.I can understand why John Kennedy Toole killed himself. If I had written this brilliant novel and been rejected by everyone, I would lose my grip too. When books like Message in a Bottle are on the bestseller's list, it's evident things haven't changed all that much in the publishing business.If you're looking for a true original, this book is a must read!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I'm one of the few others on this list who cannot help but pile on. Like someone else who wrote a review, I was reading this on a plane and had to close it due to a fit of laughter more uncontrollable than I have ever experienced. 5-10 minutes later, when I tried with every ounce of strength I could muster to resume reading, it took merely one more sentence to bring the tears of laughter streaming back down my face.Right then I new I was alive.Thanks John."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Characterizations to beat the band.

This is perhaps the most entertaining book I have read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Toole's book is quite simply the best written tragic comedy since Don Quiote. The reader is left not only laughing, but questioning what he is laughing at. Whether one is amused by the escapades of Ignatius Riley, or the absurdity of the society that Ignatius is force to live in, most will agree that Toole has created a literary masterpiece. The real tragedy is not Riley, or society, but the untimely death of Toole himself, which only leaves us to speculate how Ignatius's world view will collide with the madness of New York City."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I just finished teaching this book to a freshman English class (college), and saw many things I never saw before. I've always seen it as hilarious, absurd and have laughed out loud each time I've read it. But this time I began with the quote from Swift in the beginning, about a man of genius appearing and the dunces being in confederation against him, seeing how Ignatius is the genius, and seeing that it's because only he (and Myrna) recognize that their society is a tawdry one based on money and the business world. He chooses to secede, and isn't allowed, so his selfish obnoxiousness actually seems like an heroic act in a world that won't understand his need to be different. Even his mother, an object of sympathy, is to blame, and she become the leader of the forces against him. A great book, one that gives something new on each reading."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It has been about ten years since I read the book and upon my first visit to New Orleans I was thrilled to see the copper statue of Ignatius J.

Having just done both, I have to say I was more in awe of the latter. For years, this book has been the favorite of myself and my brother's. My brother passes it out like the Gideons do the Gospel. We have spent many hours wishing a movie would be made of the book. Many more hours have been spent casting it in our imaginations. Unfortunately, several &quot;Ignatious'(Ignatii?)&quot; have passed on. I had heard at one time Divine, John Belushi, then John Candy... (our choice?----John Goodman-hey, John, you married a local girl...). But, really, all you have to do is visit the phenonenom that is New Orleans and you will encounter many of the characters, living everyday lives! If you didn't like the book-you have not experienced New Orleans. I promise you. I have lived in many regions of the U.S.; but, New Orleans, is unlike any other city I've ever visited. From the accents of the Creole to the 'Back-O-town' jive; from the beignets to the pralines; from the &quot;has-been&quot; stripper playing 'Off Bourbon', to the female impersonator playing 'On Bourbon': every lifestyle, every custom is exhibited in full form and co-exists in this book; as in the city. It hurts me that the author did not get the recognition he deserved. He ranks up there with Somerset Maupin, Dave Barry, Lewis Grizzard, Garrison Keillor; to name a few authors famous for their regional accuity. This author had a pulse on the &quot;heart&quot; of N'Awlins...it's up to us who love this book to make the beat go on...."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I took it to the beach back in the early 80s and laughed out loud twice on the first page.

Everybody in the book is a lunatic in one way or another from Jones who likes to wear sunglasses inside a dimly lit bar at night to the main character Ignatius Reilly, whose method of eating jelly donuts made me squirm (sucking the jelly out and throwing the rest of it back in the box). I don't give this a ten simply because it gave me an uneasy feeling sometimes in the pit of my stomach. Its like I stuck my finger in some muck. From a literary standpoint I do give this a ten."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I had this book recommended to me by a friend and so I was interested in reading this. Also, I had read a great deal of positive reviews on this. So, I started to read this book rather eagerly expecting that I would be greatly entertained. However, as I got through the first 30 pages, I had to force myself to continue reading. I already despised the main character and had little interest in any of the other characters in the book. This book, unlike other great books, became a chore to read.In its defense, the book does get mildly more interesting as it goes along. This was perhaps its only redeeming quality. I found a couple of incidents in the book mildly amusing. However, having just finished reading this book. I can only recommend that you save yourself the time. This book leaves me feeling that I wasted my time.I'm honestly puzzled that so many people liked this book. It sucks. The only reason I gave it two stars is because certain statements that Ignatius made were mildly amusing."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"(This review is for the Kindle version)I wanted to read this again, since I had fond memories of my reading from 20 years ago. Unfortunately the Kindle version's typesetting is distractingly bad. The typeface is not changeable, and changing the size does not really help the problem. It's set in a serif font, and the spaces between the words are all over the place; some of the spaces look like five spaces. The kerning within the words, by contrast, is extremely tight. It just looks bad and does not flow, and it stinks because this book deserves better treatment. I would recommend a print version unless you are very forgiving of bad typesetting.From now on I will always try a sample first, so I can avoid ugly, cheap conversions."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Book Club book.

They also say that the dialog is a perfect characterization of New Orleans speech."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It's generally considered a comic masterpiece, and although I found a good deal of it amusing I also found it somewhat troubling. Underneath the humor author John Kennedy Toole's portrayal of all the characters is kind of cruel, taking all of their negative traits and highlighting them as strongly as he could. The implicit view of the book is also bleak; even if the characters weren't all fools it wouldn't much matter how well they would try to accomplish anything, because they would still be subjected to luck and forces outside of their control. The book's humor is a kind of schadenfreude."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"sure, i feel bad for the people who dont get it...... but i'm not about to associate w/ them"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Who would think a book whose main character is an obnoxious, self deluded mama's boy would be so enthralling? Once you get past the fact that Ignatius is possible the most difficult character to like in literature this is a great book. The cast of characters seems to be unending. From the patrolman who just can't cut a break and his crazy aunt to the cloud headed Jonesy to poor mama Reilly, everyone you meet has their own interesting and strange story to tell.Several plots develop together and all seem to center around our fat green hatted 'hero' who battles to see a King in America and to end indecency by introducing geometry and theology into life.There is never a boring moment in this book, and you don't know who to root for as the antics stretch from 'civilized' New Orleans all the way to Ignatius' revolutionary x-girlfriend in New York who thinks all problems can be solved with sex.This is a great fun book to relax with, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The novel is based upon Jonathan Swift's epigram found in his \\"Thoughts on Various Subjects\\", which reads, \\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that all the dunces are in confederacy against him.\\" The novel simply tells the story of Ignatius, a lazy, slothful, borish, rude, yet attractively humorous man, and his escapades with the common people that surround him.Read the opening few pages, and you will be very impressed not only by Toole's sophisticated diction, but by the magical scenes that he is able to create."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I was annoyed at this book when I first started to read because it reminded me of all the over polished knee-jerk, over educated, liberal type pros that usually gain the Pulitzer Prize. But once I picked the book up again I found myself amazed that the book won that horrible prize.Most of the negative reviews about this book seem to come from people who have personal issues with some of the characters in the book. Well guess what, if you hated Ignatus, if you felt bad for the mother, if you thought the tittle wasn't deserved then the author did his job because this is what he intended. I thought it was brillant and funny. And the only thing this book might have to do with the Simpson is perhaps that Ignitus reminds one of the fat guy who sells comic books in the comic book store. I think it was beautifully written with amazing details. I thought the use of his vocabulary was stellar. I received a vivid portrait of New Orleans and a wonderful glimpse into the relationship between a son and an over protective mother. The only negative comment I can make about this book is that the ending seemed to come too fast, but it ended fine and I did not feel cheated. I wish the author was around to reap the rewards of such hard work. I can't imagine why the editor at Simon and Schuster who stalled the publication of this book did so. Maybe it wouldn't have sold well at the time."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Confederacy of Dunces is brilliantly written and as a book probably deserves more stars than I gave it. But if, like me, you cannot like a book if you detest all the characters, you will not enjoy this one. If that's not a problem for you, go right ahead. Confederacy has biting wit, very in-depth characters, and some wonderful social observation. But don't expect to sympathize with anyone for more than a few pages."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"While the title of the review is borrowed from Miller'sThe Crucible (Penguin Classics), the metaphor works for this brilliant piece of literature as well. Set in New Orleans, _A Confederacy of Dunces_ follows the misadventures of Ignatius J. Reilly, an over-educated young man who lives with his mother and seeks to avoid work at all costs. The variety of situations he finds himself in, and the colorful cast of characters who cross his path (and who cross each-other's paths) make up the bulk of the plot. This, however, does not do this magnificent, laugh-out-loud funny book justice.Ignatius is a modern-day Quixote, a man whose head is full of medieval literature and history, who sees himself as a 20th century Boethius, helplessly spun on the Wheel of Fortune. He is lazy, obnoxious, compulsive and one of the most memorable, unique and truly humorous characters I have read. With each misadventure, he adds to his \\"masterpiece\\", writing on Big Chief tablets the random accounting of his daily travails and rants about the modern world, certain he is a misunderstood genius. Maybe he is. With each job Ignatius finds (and subsequently loses), Toole introduces the reader to a new caste of characters, who in turn spin off on their own misadventures, often times crossing paths unnoticed with others whom we have been previously introduced. The intricacy of the plot is similar to Tolstoy in its complexity. Of course, I never laughed so hard reading Tolstoy as I did with _Confederacy of Dunces_.And this is how the wheel turns, each character's sub-plot in turn influencing the sub-plot of another and so on and so on, \\"wheels within wheels\\" - the writing and organization of the story and its sub-stories is mind-boggling. What marks this as a particular piece of genius is how all the apparently loose ends are eventually tied together with the book's conclusion. I have only one caveat: the book was given as a gift to read on the airplane as I made my first visit to New Orleans. (What a wonderful city!) Had I not been familiar with the location and haunts constantly referenced, I would have liked the book less, I think. Having met some of the residents of New Orleans, I enjoyed the book even more - as more than a few were reminiscent of characters Ignatius meets. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Is it just my perception or is the plot in this book exquisitely crafted? There are no loose ends, no incidents that are not essential to the climax & denouemont (as it were). The first 20 times or so that I read it (no exaggeration), I read for humor, voice, characterization and all those things reviewers have mentioned. Then the crystalline beauty of the plot structure began to reveal itself to me. There's not one extra incident in the book, even Miss Annie's hanging slip strap contributes, no, is essential. Everything is set up like a row of dominoes in the first two-thirds of the book; after that, everything that happens HAS to happen the way it does, yet for all that you don't see it coming."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius Reilly was the original slacker back when this novel was written in the early sixties- before there was a name for it. It isn't that he just avoids work for it's own sake, it is just that he just doesn't have the time or patience for what the modern commercial world considers to be work. He has better things to do with his time. You see, Ignatius is a thoroughly medieval man. His is primarily an internal life grounded and centerered in &quot;theology and geometry.&quot; According to these consistent standards, Ignatius' life, behavior, and appearance are perfectly rational and understandable. Unfortunately, Ignatius lives in mid-twentieth century America, a time and place of mind-numbing conformity, intolerance, and efficiency. He is doomed to perpetual misunderstanding and conflict.That is the tragedy to this most excellent of commedies- being an intelligent misfit in a world of mind-numbing conformity. The author choose to leave it rather than conform, while Ignatius found the inner strength to fight and/or disreguard it.

Reilly is an arrogant, overweight, flatulent bachelor who lives with his mother in New Orleans. Ignatius and the various wacky characters who people these pages spring to life as they wind their way through this delightful adventure. Ignatius is the type of person one usually avoids after making his acquaintance. However, after reading this wonderful book, it's difficult not to have a soft spot in one's heart for him. It's paradoxical, and indicative of the greatness of this work, that it can make such a motley crew of misfits and their antics so compelling.The hallmark of this book, which won a well-deserved Pulitzer Prize, is sparkling dialogue, unrestrained wit, unbridled humor, and engaging characters who come to life. The musings of Ignatius both mortify and amuse, and his antics are at once repellant and hilarious. What a terrible shame that this author committed suicide at the age of 32, and this one book was published after his death. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. Wait, I'm lying. It actually is the best book I have ever read! John Kennedy Toole embraces the culture and atmosphere of the French Quarter of New Orleans in this wonderful novel, enveloping the reader in his lavish and effective description and writing style. Not only does Toole take you there, but he gives you an eccentric guide by the name of Ignatius O'Reilly. Ignatius, while appearing to be socially inept and a babbling, egocentric, morbidly obese mama's boy, grows in front of the reader's eyes into a character that indirectly shares his view of the world, a view that by the end of the book doesn't seem that radical. To enjoy this novel, the reader cannot just sit back and let his or her eyes passively scan page after page; the reader must imagine himself or herself walking beside Ignatius, listening to his every thought. This kind of active reading makes this book fun, and once I got into the hang of it, I picked up on the subtle details that make this novel Pulitzer-prize winning material. It's a shame that this genius-writer never lived to bask in the fame this book received. In short, buy this book and be amazed."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"&quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; was given to me as a gift. I was wary after reading the critical quotes on the cover proclaiming it &quot;the funniest book you'll ever read!&quot; Yeah, right, I thought. Feeling properly skeptical, I sat down to read. And read, and read. And then I started to laugh! By the last chapter, I was both laughing and weeping, and overcome with wonder at the brilliance, the oh-so-carefully plotted genius, of Toole's tale and his colorful characters. Never has critical opinion so UNDERSTATED the marvelous, entertaining quality of a work of fiction! Yes, New Orleans (and the rest of the world) have changed greatly in the thirty-odd years since this book was written, but that will not hold the reader back from stepping into that vanished, eccentric, delicious New Orleans that Toole conjures up so effortlessly. Igantius Reilly, his obstinately wacky anti-hero, well deserves a place among the truly unforgettable characters of Amercian Literature. The true trajedy of this novel is only that Toole, overcome by rejection and despair, killed himself before he could further enrich us with other creations as deeply satisfying and joyous as &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;!."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I've read this masterpiece many times since it was published and, each time, I laugh out loud as if I were reading it for the first time.

Holmes store to its conclusion--every loose end tied into as thick a braid as Ms. Minkoff's hair--this book is a priceless treasure."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I tried explaining to my friends as I read this book how funny it is, but I truly cannot do it justice. The only way for a person to understand how funny John Kennedy Toole's Pulitzer Prize-winning masterpiece is to read it for himself.The story revolves around the bumbling, egocentric, slob-like, wordy but intelligent Ignatius Reilly. The things that Ignatius said made me laugh out loud on countless occassions; I could just picture his lines being spoken in a movie and not being able to contain myself. Perhaps the book can best be summed up in Toole's own words -- &quot;Goodness only knew what Reilly's personal life was like. One crazy incident after another, insanity upon insanity.&quot; Along this insane path that Ignatius constantly follows, the reader meets many other characters that are typical of New Orleans. The description of the French Quarter, Bourbon Street, and other areas is very fitting.The weakness to the story is the end. But Toole delivers some serious underlying messages in his work about 20th century society. Although many of Ignatius' ideas are absurd and satirical, I often found myself thinking that some of his ideas did make clear implications about the society we live in.The bottomline is this book is too funny not to read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"My sister bought this book because it was cheap and she heard it was good. She read the first few pages, and hated Ignatius so much that she refused to read it.

Just thinking about him made me boil with irritation.When I finally made myself read it, I realized the true genius that is Ignatius.I convinced my sister to read it, promising that it would be one of the best books she would ever read, it was, and is.And we all lived happily ever after..."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"For me, the funniest book ever written.

Confederacy of Dunces was a masterpiece when it was penned in the early 1960's, it was a masterpiece when Toole took his own life in 1969. It was a masterpiece when Walker Percy finally got it published by the LSU Press in 1980. And it was a masterpiece after it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1981! And it is a masterpiece today. I ABSOLUTELY love this book. I really don't think you can touch it.On a sidenote, I met this writer in Philadelphia (Thomas Muldoon)who also loved Confederacy. He was an interesting young man and though I didn't believe him at the time, he told me had his own book. Turns out he was telling the truth and Smoking in Bathrooms turned out to be a very funny read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Very happy with this purchase.

He kind of reminds me of myself, although I am not overweight and I do have a job, but I feel the way he does about this world and how most of it is in poor taste. When you can resonate with the main character of a book, it makes it easier to enjoy it. There are some interesting dialects in here, which gives you the feel of New Orleans in the early 1960s. I've never been there, and I probably wouldn't want to go now due to the oil spill, but it seems to capture the city and its environment perfectly. Even though it was written in the 1960s, I still find it to be really funny. I don't like most older novels because they lose me in a time trap. Being born in the mid 1980s, I was surprised at how easy it was to relate to the story. Ignatius pulls all sorts of stunts in this book that are utterly hilarious. Definitely read this book if you are looking for a good laugh. Tragic the author killed himself, but I'm not sure if this book would have ever been published if he didn't."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Confederacy is absurdly funny.

Often described as a comic masterpiece, it chronicles the foibles of one absurd young man in New Orleans during the early 1960s. Often farcical and hysterical, the book seems to capture the essence of New Orleans. All the characters are equally endearing and tragic. Yes, this book is worthy of all the praise heaped upon it. However I will be a humbug and say that after awhile much of the antics got to be a bit repetitious and too slapstick for my taste. And the ending, while certainly not bad, did not measure up to the fine qualities of the rest of the book.Bottom line: New Orleans as it was, and probably still is. A book that will get you smiling."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is a hilarious and embarrassing coming of age tail. The protagonist lives with is mother well beyond his years and drives her to drink with his antics. He is an overweight misfit with very strong opinions and very few marketing stills that must find a job to make some money to keep his mother for going to jail for crashing her car into a house. The set of outrageous characters, the outdated chivalry of the protagonist in contrast to his vulgar, slovenly, and gluttonous appearance and his intense focus on some valve in his stomach make for some hilarious antics as this crazy character is launched into the working world. I laughed out loud the many times. I also drank in the kind of New York/New Orleans connected cultures and characters which abound - most of them quite odd."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is quite simply a comic masterpiece, a novel brimming with original characters, absurd situations, and at its heart a blustery, vulnerable mama's boy named Ignatius J. Reilly. He is one of the most startlingly original characters in modern fiction, and his efforts at hitting the job market after his mother smashes their car will leave you in stitches.A word on the history of the novel is worth mentioning here. The author, John Kennedy Toole, committed suicide in 1969, and his mother found the hand-written manuscript in her son's papers. She brought them to a publisher, who dreaded having to read even a portion of the work and to notify Toole's mother that it stunk. Instead, he was blown away by Toole's draft, and the rest is history. The novel earned him a posthumous Pulitzer Prize, and it is universally hailed by critics.Trying to summarize the plot is impossible - the book cannot really be categorized. Ignatius is an over-educated oaf who stays home filling his writing tablets full of his offbeat musings on ancient history, which he plans to organize and publish some day but which presently reside all over his bedroom floor. Rome wasn't built in a day he reminds himself. He cites in footnotes, as authority for some of his offbeat opinions, papers he had previously written and hand-delivered to the local university library for inclusion into their archives. He watches dreadful tv shows and movies, howling at the screen with a mixture of delight and loathing at the teenybopper drivel, and in the privacy of his room his self-gratification is performed while imagining visions of the old family dog. And wait til you see him out in public, getting a series of odd jobs, including a filing clerk at Levy Pants (with very innovative filing techniques to avoid crowded file space) as well as a costumed hot dog vendor wandering around the French Quarter in a pirate costume. All the while he begins work on his latest opus, The Journal of the Working Boy.There is a latent sadness to the plot, for while you are laughing out loud at Ignatius, his bowling-addicted mother, and the motley crew of skillfully drawn supporting characters, you sense that he will never really belong anywhere, and that he realizes his outcast status with his innate intelligence. Perhaps the author felt the same way in 1969, leading to his own suicide.However, at least Toole did leave us A Confederacy of Dunces, a novel which reveals more with each rereading. Keep it on your shelf, and every now and then pick up the book to any page and marvel at the absurdity of Ignatius's grandiose ramblings, read exerpts of his bizarre historical writings, and revisit his comic efforts to organize a worker's revolt at Levy Pants. The list goes on and on. There is no work of litereature like it I know, and my only regret in reading Toole is the sorrow felt in knowing the tremendous body of work that was lost when he ended his life."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"When I first saw the cover of this paperback in a Georgetown, DC, bookshop a few years ago, I was hesitant to buy it. Simply put, the cover is goofy, and does not do this masterpiece any justice. I am so grateful that I ignored my initial instinct, as I don't remember ever reading a funnier book in the English language than the late John Kennedy Toole's life achievement, nor is there a more memorable character in American literature than I. J. Reilly. The work deserves a 6 star rating! &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; is more than just incredibly funny, however. It is unusually poignant, gut-wrenchingly sad, and an admirable observation piece on a rather decadent and seemingly lost segment of our society sitting at the mouth of the Mississippi River. I have visited New Orleans three times since 1994 for varied reasons, and the city apparently has not changed in the least since Mr. Toole's late 1960s rendition. His characters continue to stroll and struggle along Bourbon Street and Canal Street, and their troubled spirits infuse every alley and cave of the French Quarter. Just like the district surrounding St. Peter's Square in the city of jazz, Ignatius J. Reilly is out of step with the rest of America. In spite of his repulsive and grossly comical physical presence, he believes in aesthetics and real meaning, in what he perceives to be the truth. For this reason, he is a true literary hero, like Don Quixote, Cyrano de Bergerac and the Good Soldier Schweik before him. One final note: before you buy this book, think about cancelling all your appointments and engagements for the two or three days that follow. They, along with eating and sleeping, undoubtedly will be totally neglected until you finish this 400 page tour de farce."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Reading a highly popular, arguably classic, cult favorite with a fresh eye and without preconceptions is not an easy task. I expected Ignatius J. Reilly to leap off the page at me. I wasn't disappointed. On the first page, outside a staid department store in New Orleans, Ignatius in his usual grotesque costume of green hunting camp and too small flannel shirt is awaiting his mother innocently enough until a policeman decides he is a vagrant and tries to arrest him. A crowd is quickly engaged by his steaming objections and loud protestations. Ignatius is at his best when hollering for help. When his weary mother makes an appearance, \\"Mother!\\" he called \\"Not a moment too soon. I've been seized.\\"We quickly meet friends and denizens not quite on the underside of New Orleans, but leaning that way. Ignatius is a force of nature that needs to be fed, nurtured, and kept on course not only by his long-suffering mother, but any citizen who happens to cross his path. If Ignatius is left to his own devices, he is like a loose pinball, except a pinball never screams for help.Ignatius, who is the epitome of pseudo independence and ingratitude, actually is fearful of being left alone. When his mother, for the first time in living memory, decides to have a night out, Ignatius is piteous, \\"I shall probably be misused by some intruder!\\" he screamed.For the first third of the book, I was highly indignant at Ignatius: his selfishness, his arrogance and his ingratitude. Gradually, I became fond of him and then fearful for him. He is underscored with tragedy; he has a vision of a world not of his making and it threatens him. Somehow Mr. Toole gathers up all the threads and the end is not chaos as I feared, but everyone seems to get just what they deserve. I was pleased, and I think you will be too.-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have looked through many of these reviews, and no one has yet explained why many reviewers think it is the best book ever, and many think it is the worst book ever. Here is my attempt.Why some people laugh till they chokeIgnatius is a physical comedian. He follows in the tradition of Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, the Victorian classic \\"Three Men in a Boat, to say nothing of the dog,\\" the Marx brothers, the Pink Panther movies (\\"The Return of the Pink Panther\\" is the best), and Mr. Bean. So if you laughed uncontrollably at Chief Inspector Dreyfus's facial tick because he wanted to kill Clouseau, if you laughed when Chaplin kicked the policeman in the pants and ran, or when Mr. Bean accidentally popped a bag of vomit over a sleeping passanger's face, then you are more likely to enjoy this book. It also helps if you were an obedient student and learned all those vocabulary words in English class, because Ignatius is a very learned, pompous slapstick comedian.What proof do I have of this? Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) once made a documentary about the aspects of physical comedy (made in 1992, the TV series was called \\"Funny Business,\\" the episode was called \\"Laughing Matters\\", the relevant sections on Youtube are parts 4 and 5). In that lecture, he said that the personality traits of the physical comedian are the following.1. He is alienated from the society around him: Ignatius stays in his room in his mother's house.2. He is childish: Ignatius thinks his mother should still support him at age 30.3. He has to fight with ordinary objects: Ignatius cannot even ride in a bus.4. His body can be humorous by itself: Did I mention Ignatius is obese?5. He is uncivilized and cannot or will not conform to social rules: Ignatius's first act in the book is to hit a policeman in the head with a rolled up sheet of music.6. He is a threat to respectable people: On first seeing him, the policeman immediately tries to arrest him. Even a strip-tease club wants to get rid of him.7. He mocks authority and politeness: Ignatius is rude and heaps scorn on everyone.8. He spreads confusion: Ignatius causes the climactic chaos of the book.9. ... I cannot tell you the ninth quality without giving away the ending. But the book conforms to it as well.Why some people hate the bookWhile there has been some smirking and name calling, it is obvious that some who hate the book are quite literate and are not at all dunces. ACoD haters include those who say they like Catch-22, Ground Hog's Day, and other humor classics. Remember, many publishers rejected it, and even Walker Percy didn't realize it was good until about page 50. Most good books sparkle long before that point. Why are its qualities sometimes hard to see?Although Ignatius is a physical comedian, his humor is not lightning fast like Charlie Chaplin or the Marx brothers. It is hard to quote a funny line, because each line in isolation isn't that funny. They are only funny in the total context of the story. Catch-22 is a book that is hundreds of pages of variations of the same joke. If you liked the basic joke, you love the book. If you hated the joke, you hate the book. With ACoD, if you recognize Ignatius as a slow-burning physical comedian early on--and you find his stately slapstick funny--you will love every page of the book. If you either fail to get the character at all or do not find his version of slapstick funny, you will hate the book.The book was the first attempt to publish by the author, and it is bit rough. The repetition of metaphors and phrases can be annoying, especially if you are not already laughing. Ignatius is described by animal metaphors repeatedly. He says the same phrases repeatedly. There are very few one-liners by any of the characters. The complicated multi-story plot unfolds slowly. If you are not already in on the joke while this is going on, it is painful. If you are, it is delicious. That is my explanation for the love/hate reviews.A further theoryI am writing a scholarly article about this book. I have searched the scholarly literature high and low and have not found any other writings on my idea. I have thought about explaining my main concept here, to establish a claim of priority, but I have decided against it. Instead, I will give a brief explanation of a side claim, to demonstrate some of the drift of my thinking. So here it goes.Ignatius complains throughout the book about Fortune's Wheel. In medieval thinking, everyone was attached to a wheel of fortune. Sometimes you were up and had good fortune; other times you were spun down into ill fortune. Good things happen to bad people and vice versa, so luck does not follow worldy ideas of justice. Or to put it plainly: Life ain't fair.But in the book, Ignatius himself acts as fortune's wheel. When he arrives at the Night of Joy the second time, Lana and George are in good fortune, and Burma Jones and Darlene have ill fortune. Through Ignatius, their luck is reversed. When Ignatius appears at Levy Pants, Mrs. Levy is controlling both Mr. Levy and Miss Trixie. Through Ignatius, Mr. Levy gets the upper hand, Mrs. Levy has lost power, and Miss Trixie can finally retire. This spherical man acts as a catalyst, spinning the fortunes of the other characters. When Mancuso first interacts with Ignatius, his luck turns bad, but in the end, Mancuso has triumphed, and Lana is off to prison, where she will need some consolation of philosophy.Boethius wrote in the Consolation of Philosophy that fortune hands out luck that we cannot understand in this world, but which is part of the overall plan of divine justice. Instead of divine justice, Ignatius rolls his circular form through the world, and in his farcical chaos he rights wrongs of this world and brings worldy, poetic justice to the characters. He is fortune's wheel.Note from December 2008: In the article by Richard Simon (1994). \\"John Kennedy Toole and Walker Percy: Fiction and repetition in A Confederacy of Dunces.\\" Texas Studies in Literature & Language, 36(1), page 113, in a footnote, Simon argues that Ignatius represents Fortuna herself. My claim is slightly different: that Ignatius is her wheel."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A friend loaned me a copy of this book over twenty years ago, telling me that this was a novel I simply must not miss reading. Not quite believing his enthusiastic praise, I opened the book and was introduced to the gargantuan, flatulent, self-important, arrogantly pseudo-intellectual person of Ignatius J. Reilly. By the end of the first paragraph, I was intrigued. By the end of the first scene, in which he nearly causes a riot in front of D.H Holmes, I was hopelessly hooked. In the decades that have passed since that first reading, \\"Confederacy\\" has steadily ascended my list of all-time favorite books, becoming more deliciously funny with each reading.Ignatius is an unforgettable character. Ensconced in his ramshackle room, strewn with Big Chief tablets filled with invective toward the twentieth century and his longing for the good old days of the Dark Ages, he brews his indictment of modernity and of anything and everything he considers lacking in \\"theology and geometry\\". Unfortunately for him, his mother's drunken driving brings the threat of legal action when she demolishes part of a building and he is faced with the appalling need to Go To Work. Needless to say, the working world isn't quite prepared for this Don Quixote in a hunting cap.Along the way, there are a number of equally priceless supporting characters, each a gem in its own right. The hopelessly inept Patrolman Mancuso sniffles his way about the seedier parts of New Orleans, in his outrageous \\"undercover\\" costume of the day, sadly hoping to arrest some \\"suspicious character\\". Miss Lana Lee, of the quite inappropriately named Night of Joy bar, provides, um, charity work for the orphans, discreetly wrapped in plain brown paper and collected by a local hoodlum. Then there's Jones, who plots his revenge against Lana's tyranny as an employer from within a cloud of blue cigarette smoke. All of these and others are superbly woven together in this grand comic tale, their stories and fates drawn together by Fortuna's wheel, as Ignatius might say.As others have remarked, Toole's suicide pre-empted what likely would have been a wonderful literary career. An unpublished author at his death, Toole's only other work is a short novel called \\"The Neon Bible\\", written while he was in his teens. That book is sufficiently inferior to \\"Confederacy\\" that I have never bothered to buy my own copy. However, I am now on my fourth copy of this novel, and expect it to continue to be a book I revisit time and again.Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"As if there weren't enough reviews of this book, I'll add mine: In a word, wonderful. The &quot;protagonist&quot; is one Ignatius J. Reilly, a fat, pompus windbag who is over-educated, but refuses to work, preferring to stay home and drive his mother nuts while writing his never-ending treastie on the awfulness of the modern world -- &quot;modern&quot; meaning anything since early Medieval times! Thanks to his mother running into a building while under the influence, Ignacious has to go to work. You can just about imagine the kind of worker he is, versus the kind of worker he really is! You wouldn't want to leave this guy alone with a typewriter, or even a hot-dog cart, for a minute.John Kennedy Toole does not just depict Ignatius's delusions, but brilliantly depicts everyone else's delusions, too. His novel shows us that none of us operate in a concrete reality -- our perceptions are deluded because of our beliefs, worldview, past experiences, etc. This book should be assigned, or at least recommended, reading for any college course dealing with post-Modern thought."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Born in New Orleans in 1937, John Kennedy Toole earned degrees at Tulane and Columbia Universities and was pursuing a teaching career when drafted in 1961. He thereafter returned to New Orleans, where he wrote the novel A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES. Although the novel received initial interest from the publishing industry, it was ultimately rejected--and the failure of the book fueled Toole's depression. Toole committeed suicide in 1969, leaving the unpublished manuscript in his mother's New Orleans home. When she discovered it, Thelma Toole began a campaign on behalf of the novel that resulted in a 1980 publication. Instantly hailed by critics, it won the 1981 Pulitzer Prize, has sold millions of copies, and is generally considered one of the great comic masterpieces of the 20th Century.DUNCES focuses on the life of Ignatius J. Reilly, a paranoid hypocondriac of gargantuan proportions who spends his life in a bedroom of his mother's house, ruminating on his health, the impending collapse of civilization as we know it, and writing notes for what he expects will be the ultimate literary statement on the Middle Ages--a return to which he advocates in no uncertain terms. But a series of comic disasters conspire to force Ignatius out into the world in search of the very thing he most dreads: a job. In the process he tries to impose his worldview upon every one he meets, and the characters that crisscross his path are vibrant, outrageous, and as memorable as Reilly himself.There is, for example, LeRoy Jones, a black man with plenty of attitude, who finds himself blackmailed into working for an extremely dubious night club at below minimum wage--for Lana Lee, a \\"Nazi female\\" who is involved in illegal pornography--who employs Darlene, a wannabe stripper who has trained her pet bird to tear her clothes off while she bumps and grinds. Incompetent police officers, gyrating old ladies, factory workers, elderly men with grave concerns about communist infiltration, and screaming homosexuals dance across the pages, each of them memorable, all of memorable, all of them laugh-out-loud funny.New Orleans itself is a memorable character in the novel, teaming with diverse ethnic communities, social snobbery, and awash in sex and alcohol, as ribald as any of the fictional characters creates. And, I might add, portrayed with remarkable accuracy. Toole not only captures the wild array of accents typical of the city, he captures the soul of the city iself, New Orleans as it existed in the world before Hurricane Katrina altered it forever, a portrait that is now poignant for the fact that what has been may never come again.This is indeed a brilliant novel, one that I tend to break out whenever I'm so blue I think I'll never laugh again. I always do, one page after another, great big belly laughs, small snickers, strangled chortles. It's just an amazing novel, memorable, fascinating, original, and very, very readable. One of my favorites, and strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Personally, I am dumbfounded at some of the claims of the more, shall we say, uptight reviewers found on this page. To hold an opinion which is contrary to most others' is, of course, perfectly fine, but to claim that those who like the book are simply following suit, that we are simply seeing the \\"emperor's new clothes\\" so as not to be thought stupid, is an affront to the intelligence of the thousands and thousands of readers who have enjoyed this book. A few things; this is not a comedy in the way an Elmore Leonard novel, or a Douglas Adamas novel, is a comedy. The comedy is not outright -- that is to say that this is not a novel built around jokes and one-liners -- but that the comedy comes from the characters, the dialogue and the overall outrageousness of its situations. It is also a misconception that a great main character must be indentifiable with the reader. The point of the novel is that Ignatius is NOT identifiable to a normal person, just as he cannot identify with normal society. Were his convictions easy to indentify with, was his position on society easy to swallow and his speech more coloquial he would not be Ignatius J. Reilly. He is, in fact, one of the snidest, most self-deluded characters I have ever read had the pleasure to read. He treats his mother terribly, his medieval philosophies sound like the ramblings of an imbecile, and his excuses and complaints could, if they were realized in life, drive someone insane. It is his good-natured intentions, though, his self-delusions that his shortcomings are in fact blessings and the sheer rediculous nature of his pompousness that makes him such a comic gem of a character. That we who find this to be true are being compared to the peasants in the age old fable of the emperor's new clothing seems to say a wealth about those who make such claims. Is it not enough to state one's opinion? Must one put oneself on a literary pedestal, insulting the intelligence of anyone who disagrees with you? Because you didn't \\"get it\\" does not mean that there was nothing to \\"get.\\" We got it. And we who did are in agreement; those new clothes the emperor's sporting are looking damn good.In summary, there is a reason this book won the Pulitzer Prize and it's not because the judges were too scared to admit they didn't like it. It's clever, well-written, fast-paced, absorbing and absurd.Oh, and it's extremely funny, as well."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"&quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; is not even questionably the greatest novel ever written in the realm of comedy. It's not an attempt at greatness, not a shingle thrown at the moon - it's the kind of thing that you read and have this tremendous pang. This sadness that you never get in a book - you know it has to end at some point and that's by far the worst realization. The only bad thing here is that it ends at all.What JK Toole accomplished here is beyond reason. What's worse is that you read it and know the pain he had in not seeing it heralded in every bookstore in his lifetime. Toole's rash and sad decision to end his own life is the best argument against suicide I know of. This man was a genius beyond anything we have now. He lacked the faith and certainty of that. The result is that we were robbed of such a possible body of work that the world will never know. The only close comparison is that of Keats whose &quot;name writ in water&quot; was a tragedy to a literate generation of his time. As gigantic and lush as &quot;Confederacy..&quot; is you never put that aside.That said, this is a Sheherazade of a tale. I suspect that Toole had no idea what he was planning for Ignatius, but that he wrote it as he found it. And what a formula. From the Big Chief tablets to the hot dog cart this is a book that has no equal. It sits in my bathroom rack of books and I just pick it up and read a page and laugh. It's THAT good. Every page is a mystery of writing skill, Toole's characters are vibrant and fully alive always, none resembling the other and they sing when they get going which is immediately.Reading this means you will never be the same. &quot;The Night of Joy&quot; bar will be a place you want to get a drink, Constantinople a word you actually use. More than anything, you'll be lucky. There's not a thing like this book - nothing even close. Oddly I just read Jon Stewart's &quot;Naked Pictures of Famous People&quot; which was heralded on cover and by friends as &quot;hilarious.&quot; Please. I don't know how he made a career.... Idiocy in the aught years is heralded as funny. Not likely.Read this book and realize how we have since the late 1950's when this was written, devolved into a true &quot;Confederacy of Dunces&quot;. The book means more today than it ever did."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I will dispense with any plot summary and focus primarily on the heart of the book- Ignatius Reilly, a character not without precedent but one without peer.Ignatius's medieval fixations are a valuable clue to understanding this novel. Despite being written in prose, and set in 20th century America, this novel is best read as a Shakespearean comedy. Indeed, many reviewers have already described Ignatius as Falstaffian, and that comparison is not without value. However, that is only a starting point. I feel delving into Ignatius's personality in more depth, rather than settling for a blanket comparison, is the best way to understand the protagonist of the novel.A Confederacy of Dunces is not a happy novel. It is often extremely funny, but there is defintely a melancholy feeling underlying the whole text. This is uncharacteristic of modern comedy, where even in moments of tension the tone is still light. Classical comedies, in contrast, need only a positive ending, and can be dark in tone- I say Shakespearean because I admit that those are the only classical comedies I have read.Why is the novel so sad? That is difficult to define. While Ignatius faces many problems, he is never in real danger of anything more than loss of money or dignity (both of which he has little to lose anyway). The pathos lies in Ignatius himself. Ignatius (and herein lies his uniqueness) is a compedium of the many unpleasant personality traits intelligent people are in danger of developing. Need proof?We can start with the fact that he is overly proud of his education. He displays the smug love of his own knowledge that has led to his feeling superior to the uneducated masses around him. As other people haven't paid him the respect he feels he deserves, he feels like a misunderstood genius. I'm sure we've all encountered someone with an ego so large they attribute all their problems to other people's inability to understand them. This is only a partial list, but Toole does a better job showing then I ever could telling (and show, don't tell, is one of the building blocks of good writing).While we may be annoyed when we meet people like this in real life, Ignatius is portrayed sympathetically. He clearly had great potential, and throughout the book Toole constantly reminds us that Ignatius has his Master's, is an educated man, yet has come to (latest plot development). We mourn Ignatius's wasted potential, at the same time we pity him. He wishes for a life with no challenges, which means he would never grow as a person (pun about his weight gain most definitely intended).Here, at last, we come to the beauty of Toole's characterization. Despite his squandered potential, sad life, and miserable circumstances, these struggles are the only way Ignatius can grow as a person. Indeed, Ignatius does mature throughout the novel, but only slightly. He is too set in his ways, too far gone, to become a new man. It is to Toole's credit that he realizes this. Not only does he draw an absurd man with a true writer's talent, he accomplishes the much more difficult task of making him change over time without losing that realism.Looking beyond the character of Ignatius, Toole's whole novel is exactly that- the absurd, the unlikely, the bizarre, drawn realistically, and with compassion. Although the book has slight flaws (and what book doesn't?), Toole has successfully created an unique character, then skillfully portrayed his life. In the simplest analysis, Toole has something new to say, and he says it well. What more reason could one need to read a book?"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This was a true page-turner in every way. I wanted to the story to just keep going, to continue to be involved in the lives of these interesting, yet deranged, characters. Never have I laughed out loud so much while reading a book. The comic nature of Ignatius, combined with his vast knowledge base and his pitiable mental state, made his character one of the most memorable in modern literature."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The novel's title is taken from a quote from Jonathan Swift who wrote that \\"when a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.\\" The novel's protagonist Ignatius J. Reilly, a thirty-something \\"genius\\" who lives with his mother and finds work of all kinds repulvise, has a passion for philosophy, bombast, and jelly donuts. His quest is to save mankind from its vulgarity by sharing his wisdom with the masses. Unfortunately, the French Quarter and the world at large is not prepared to appreciate this rotund neurotic's widsom, which he flails at people with great supercilious venom. The plotlines are too many to account here. Told from the point of view of Ignatius and other comic characters, the novel is not so much plot-driven as it is a slice of life capturing the folly of the human race.Ignatius is a comic hero worthy of Don Quixote; only he isn't killing imaginary dragons; he is on a quest to kill popular culture's meretricious debauchery. For example, he is hostile toward Doris Day and all forms of sentimentality.Many subsequent novels have tried to imitate the humor in the Confederacy but most have failed.

Oh, Fortuna, the wheel you have spun sends me spiraling down into the depths of apoplexy and discombobulation! I am incomplete without the wisdom imparted by Ignatius, and I morne the loss of John Kennedy Toole. I will make it my life's mission to spread the word of this work. I am so wrecked right now, in distress. And to think, it was written with a cliff-hanger ending. Oh, Fortuna, you wench!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Looking over review after review of this book, I found two camps... and I wasn't the least bit surprised by their distances. First there are those that praise the book for being a literary milestone, an achievement of grand scope and memorable characters. The second group sees the book as wasted paper, a book with no redeeming qualities or characters, and no solid or memorable message.I'm in the former category, but for an entirely different reason. First let me say that this book (which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1981) is NOT for everyone. If you enjoy upbeat, easily readable material with a smattering of bathroom humor, you'll need to look elsewhere. But if you like comedy that goes deep into character follies and Shakespearean-style astuteness, you'll probably love it.The main character is one of the most memorable I've ever read, which is probably why it got the Pulitzer. Ignatius Reilly is an overweight, over-educated, underachieving loser who, late into his adulthood, still lives with his alcoholic mother in the colorful city of New Orleans. Every life that Ignatius touches - or even gets near - spirals out of control. He lies, he won't work (until forced to by his mother after she crashes her car and the threat of foreclosure on their home becomes evident), and has no real friends. A loner, a loser, a person bound for obscurity.But little does Ignatius know that his depressing life will lead all those around him into a brighter place (even maybe himself). Even though Ignatius' \\"world view\\" and his \\"stomach valve\\" try to thwart any attempt at joining a \\"normal\\" facet of society, his errors and misdeeds will eventually lead \\"Fortuna\\" into a positive cycle. This is the message that John Kennedy Toole (the author) was trying to get across to us (for those who missed it). This is also my reason for enjoying the book so very much. The message is imbedded in the story so deeply, so inanely, that you have to take the story as a whole to enjoy it, not just its pieces. That and the fact that Mr. Toole gave us one of the most irritatingly worthless characters, added to the enjoyment of the overall narrative. Even now, I can't get Ignatius out of my head! I absolutely despise him! But then, I was supposed to. The author did a perfect job.And speaking of the author, it is noteworthy to mention that John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969, apparently ending his life of severe depression. Years after his death, his mother (Thelma) discovered the manuscript for \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" and thrust it under the nose of an unwitting agent who soon found out he had a literary gem on his hands. A shame Mr. Toole never lived to see such praise heaped upon his work."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Toole is the finest, perhaps the only, Catholic writer to survive in 20th-c. America. (O'Connor, who shares some of his southern/Irish anti-intellectual self-hatred, is a Calvinist in all but name.) But of course he did not survive for long.Try to imagine the misery of being a fat, shamed genius sweating it out in the deep South just as the hegemonic smiles of the Kennedy era were beginning their march of conquest. There was no place for Toole under that smile. But he survived long enough to write this hilarious, merciless and heartbreaking novel. All the damned are here and speaking through Ignatius: the fat, the gauche, the gay, the South, the Irish, the working poor, the black...and most fatally of all, the prescient. Because Toole somehow saw all that was to come.Sitting in his room in that fetid backwater, he saw the farce and triumph of the sixties all complete. And he wrote it down with mercy toward none (least of all himself)...and some Peace-Corps fool of an editor stamped NO on it. And Toole died--not so much for our sins, as for the safety of our right to be stupid and smug. And America went on to make hacks, talentless strivers like Mailer and Bellow into heroes, while Toole fed the worms. That's sainthood, isn't it? It seems like sainthood to me. To convert all that horror and shame into something so wonderful, try to give it away, and die."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I love this book.

In magnificent revolt against the twentieth century, Ignatius propels his monstrous bulk among the flesh posts of the fallen city, documenting life on his Big Chief tablets as he goes, until his maroon-haired mother decrees that Ignatius must work.First linesA Confederacy of Dunces is a novel written by John Kennedy Toole, but not published during his lifetime. Through the efforts of the writer Walker Percy and Toole's mother, the book was published in 1980; it quickly became a cult classic and won a Pulitzer Prize a year later.The title is a reference to a saying by the classic master of satire, Jonathan Swift: \\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.\\" (Thoughts on Various Subjects, Moral and Diverting)The story is set in New Orleans, Louisiana at the start of the 1960s. The central character is Ignatius J. Reilly, an intelligent but slothful man still living with his mother in Uptown New Orleans who, because of family circumstances, must set out to get a job for the first time in his life at age thirty. In his quest for employment he has various adventures with colorful French Quarter characters.Major charactersIgnatius J. ReillyIgnatius is something of a modern Don Quixote - eccentric and creative, sometimes perhaps to the point of being delusional. He tries to find jobs requiring little or no work which will allow him at the same time to further his plans to somehow achieve greatness.He disdains modern civilization, especially pop culture, but gets a perverse delight in immersing himself in order to mock its vapidity and express his outrage with its lack of philosophy and geometry. He prefers the enlightened philosophy of the Middle Ages, especially that of Boethius.Myrna MinkoffMyrna \\"The Minx\\" is a beatnik Jew from New York City whom Ignatius met while she was in college in New Orleans. Their political, social, religious, and personal orientations could hardly be more different, but Myrna and Ignatius have a fascination with each other. For most of the novel she is seen only in the regular correspondence which the two keep up since her return to New York. Officially, they both deplore everything the other stands for. Though probably neither of them would admit it, their correspondence indicates that, though separated by half a continent, many of their actions are done with hopes to impress the other.Irene ReillyMrs. Reilly is Ignatius's long-widowed mother. She still thinks of Ignatius as an adolescent, encouraging him to think of himself that way.

I've read this book many times and I can guaranty you that you won't be satisfied with just one reading either. Sadly, Toole committed suicide before this book had even been published. In fact, he, himself, never did attempt to do so. After his death, his Mother took a moth-eaten manuscript she found among his effects to an individual . . . and the rest is posthumous Pulitzer Prize history.

Having seen his work constantly rejected, Kennedy Toole fell victim to paranoia and depression, and he committed suicide in 1969. \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" was published in 1980, thanks largely to his mother's persistance - and it went on to win the 1981 Pulitzer Prize.The book's central character - I can't honestly call him a hero - is Ignatius J. Reilly. Although well educated, and certainly creative, he barely has a redeeming quality to his name. Ignatius is a self-absorbed, lazy, obnoxious slob, bordering on the pungent, a royal pain in the ass who melodramatically refuses to see the world as it actually is. His diet is nearly as bad as his dress sense, yet his appetite knows no bounds. (For some reason, he never stops to wonder why he has such trouble with his pyloric valve). Ignatius despises modern society; he's a regular at the local cinema, carefully selecting only those films that will cause him the most offense. (He'll loudly proclaim his disgust from one end of the film to the other...and then stay for a repeat viewing, so he can be offended a second time). He lives with his long-suffering mother in New Orleans and has never been further than Baton Rouge. (That trip was naturally a disaster and, if he manages to corner an unsuspecting ear, he'll bore his victim to tears by telling the story time and again). The book's opening sees Ignatius nearly arrested by Angelo Mancuso - a local cop who's constantly on the lookout for a suspicious character. Poor Mancuso couldn't have known what lay ahead - but, having tossed the stone, the ripples start spreading.Thanks to Ignatius, the book probably won't appeal to everyone. However, despite Ignatius being the most cringeworthy character I've encountered in years, I just couldn't abandon the book - there was a morbid curiosity about what sort of a hornet's nest he'd stir up next.

Although he doesn't work, per se, his time is consumed with writing his opus, disdaining pop culture, and being a cross for his mother to bear.When his poor mother begins to indulge a little more than usual in her drink of choice (currently muscatel), she crashes the car into the side of a building. The financial distress from the accident necessitates Ignatius's getting a job to help support his own expenses for the first time in his life.What follows are a serious of hysterical and unbelievable events starring Ignatius as he goes from job to job (including a stint in the office at Levy Pants and a hotdog salesman (though he mostly just eats his product)) and from one unexpectedly comical situation to the next. Reilly vacillates between being a detestable and a merely pathetic character, but either way his exploits will keep readers wanting more.Author John Kennedy Toole wrote the story of Reilly pulling from experiences in own life, and partially based the character on a professor of his at Tulane University.

Also, unlike other readers, I never start a book expecting to \\"relate\\" to the characters, plot or story, I'm quite comfortable with obnoxious, unpleasant, exaggerated, overtly egocentric, misanthropic, homophobic and mysoginous characters, and I'm quite comfortable also with shallow and trivial plots as long as there is great writing behind and a sense of purpose to the book.And that is exactly my biggest issue with the book, I felt JKT writing to be somewhat amateurish, like the author tries too hard to be ironic or sardonic, or hilarious, or imaginative, or shocking or even purposely disgusting, but in the end it gives you nothing and you are left with nothing from the read.I totally understand the novel is written in a way to match a satire or farse, even absurdist play, perhaps to mimic Ignatius Reilly obsessions with medieval literature; but in the end it leans a lot less towards Shakespeare, Cervantes and Chaucer and a lot more towards South Park and Family Guy (I'm in no way a big fan of purposely-moronic in-your-face situational humor).I really believe this would have been a good start for a promising author and we will never know how he would have evolved, but as far as this book goes, I don't see where all the reverence comes from."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Excellent works by definition...held back from public view for so long, by short-sighted &#34;literary cogs,&#34; in the strange wheel of the publishing industry by their very own &#34;elite&#34; society. Not until a tireless mother of the Author, hammering away for years (long after his tragic suicide) does this masterpiece become available for all to enjoy. I discovered it only by means of hearing this very sad story behind the story. It is hilarious and a great deal more!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A mocking take on the ever relatable \\"me against the world\\" motif, this novel held me in constant anticipation of what might go wrong next for its antihero of all antiheroes, the larger than life, always gassy, condescendingly intellectual Ignatius J. Reilly.I particularly enjoyed Reilly's ongoing writings: his book within the book and his correspondence with Myrna Minkoff, a far away partner in their own brand of civil disobedience. Within these passages, the protagonist seemed most comfortable, most himself.Though often exaggerated, Toole's depiction of the various people within New Orleans' society felt authentic to me, from bartenders and street vendors to factory workers and one factory owner / owner's wife. For the most part, I felt as if every interaction between these ancillary characters could just as easily occur today, giving the book a sense of timelessness within these capitalist times.Such a shame Toole took his own life at such a young age, I would've loved to read whatever he would've written next. Thank goodness his mother managed to find a set of eyeballs willing to give the manuscript a shot, and thank goodness for what's happened since."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book was recommended to me by a professor at a university. I really thought it would get better once I started understanding all the characters. In reality I wanted to meet the main character and punch him in the face. He is not a lovable character or one that learns his lesson in the end. I did enjoy the description of the setting and could actually hear these characters come to life in my head."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I liked it because it was so different. My one friend challenged me to read the book and find one character that I either liked or resonanted with. Well, there is no hero in this book and that's what makes it such a good read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have wanting to read this book for years. When I saw it available in a Kindle version I downloaded it for my Android. I thoroughly enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I viewed a biography on the author on TV the other day, and frankly, his tragic suicide and the fight his mother put up to have this book published fascinated me. It peaked my interest, so I went and bought the digital version. I frankly didn't quite know what to expect, so I really didn't have any expectations except one of the fascination of his personal story.The title fits the characters perfectly. Everyone of them. It was hilarious, entertaining, and kept me reading until I was finished. I'm glad I saw that story on the author's life, or else I would have never known about this book. This book is a must read for anyone, whether you live in New Orleans, or know a group of dunces and can relate. My one wish is that the author could have had this published and gotten the recognition he deserved before he took his life. Maybe it would have prevented his suicide and we could still be reading his works today."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Hysterical, I've never read anything like it.

You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Knowing the history of Toole brings a sense of understanding to his characters. A book for the ages, not because of his death and publishing efforts by LSU, but for the clarity of his perception, your senses will smell, taste, hear and feel life in New Orleans."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Toole's posthumously published novel is one that makes me laugh even thinking about it. His witty writing and larger than life characters are enough to win anyone over.

It's not for everyone but I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to many people."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"During high school there were always people who had their own special version of looking at the world. That Ignatius is 30 doesn't really matter. He is one of those guys who try but fail, who think the whole world is against them and that they are the chosen one to end it. Yet they always get into the wrong situations.This book is great! Hilarious situations and great descriptive writing. Too bad he only wrote two books..."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"When a true genius appears, you can know him by this sign: that all the dunces are in a confederacy against him. Jonathan SwiftSwift's quotation describes Ignatius J. Reilly better than you could possible imagine. The entire world is filled with idiots interfering, cheating, manipulated the misunderstood genius, or so it seems in Ignatius's mind. Ignatius is over-educated, under-motivated, overweight, and socially deformed in his quest to, well, to do nothing. His mother is over-bearing yet sympathetic, but she is running out of patience with her TV-watching son. The story begins with a small car accident in New Orleans, forcing Ignatius to seek employment to pay help pay for the damages. The results are pure comedy.Ignatius hops from a clerk in a failing clothing company to a hot dog vendor to a political organizer in an effort to bring his intelligence to a much lower element of society. Lucky them. The story is filled with flawed characters: a hapless police office, a detached business owner and his condescendingly liberal wife, a busybody neighbor, a stripper with a heart of gold, a flamboyant party organizer, a cruel strip bar owner, an elderly clerk with dementia, and female college activist with a penchant for bad screenplays and petty antics. And, of course, is Jones, a Black janitor for the less-than-reputable Night of Joy strip club. Jones is the least educated yet the sharpest character in the bunch.But the real story is Ignatius himself. His \\"Oh my God!\\" gasps, complaints about his heart valve, and his sophisticated turnings of a phrase make this a funny, funny book. As readers we both love and despise Ignatius. Either way, we watch him with car wreck-like wonder.The story behind the book is interesting: the book was published posthumously after his mother nagged Walker Percy to read it. Toole committed suicide in 1969, and the novel was published in 1980. It won the Pulizer Prize the following year.I've wanted to read this book for years now. Mark read it this year, and his review nudged me to start it. I alternated reading the book with listening to the audio book. I'm glad I listened to it, because this is the best production of any audio book I've ever heard. The performance of Ignatius and Jones is unbelievable."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius, I know you - what a hilarious read. The book had obviously been well read by its condition which in a way added to the whole theme of the story."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"One of my all-time favorite books. Laugh out loud funny, and intriguing at the same time. Wish there were more authors like this one. It's one of the few books I would read again--will have to put it on my Kindle now that it is available."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Every now and again a book comes along - a rarity in its happening - that introduces you to a world of goofy characters and takes you through such absurb situations that you remember them forever. \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is such a book ! If you don't find this book both magnificently written and exceptionally funny then I truly recommend you admit up front (maybe secretly too) that you are just not into wit in its grandest form. J.K. Toole left us a masterpiece, may he forever make the angels of heaven laugh as he did me and will do the majority of readers who are fortunate enough to experience this absolute gem."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"First of all I want to say that it's definitely recommendable.Somehow the knowledge of the premature death of the author (before the book was published) gives this book an eerie dimension. It is a comedy, a very good one at that, but behind this facade lingers the notion that the author couldn't accept society the way it was. Perhaps even the reason he committed suicide.But it could be my imagination, and just be an all out comedy.. Either way, definitely a book worth reading. Superbly written, with a main character you will never forget. Oh, and for those who care about such things (like me): the limited edition is lovely, with some B&W; pictures of the author, and the places described in the book in the middle."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"At first I couldn't decide whether I loved this book or hated it. Now, having quickly turned the pages, finding I couldn't put it down, and finishing it in two weekdays, I think I like it! I don't particularly like the characters (these are not the kind of people I would want to be friends with) but found them fascinating to observe in a reality television fishbowl kind of way. The fact that there is no plot per se, was actually fine with me. I just read the book as a series of misadventures and enjoyed the ride. The characterizations and absurdities brought to mind Catch-22 and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.The dialogue is quite clever and the dialects superb. It's unfortunate Toole didn't live to continue his writing career."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"One of the greatest pleasures I have ever had in literature. I re-read the book almost immeadiately. Talk about a genius who died young? I want this guy back!!

Amazing use of the English language makes this book an absolute joy to read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius J. Reilly is a character not even a mother could love- unless she was severely medicated, or as in the case of his own mother, an alcoholic. He is repulsive in every way from his questionable appearance and hygiene, his vendetta against anything not in existence before the year 1450 to finally his antagonistic and lay-about lifestyle. Ignatius is what society would politely label a misfit, but the rest of us would call a loser.At a point in his life when financial circumstances become dire, Ignatius's mother sends him out to find work. He does, repeatedly, but the desperate people who hire Ignatius find themselves with even more problems than before he started. From teaching, to file clerk, to first mate in charge of boiled weenies, any and all lives Ignatius touches suddenly go to pot with a robust BANG!A Confederacy of Dunces is an excellent book, in spite of the fact that I loathed each and every character save one: it is that good!One of the most impressive aspects of this story is that the characters are so believable. They're all morons to a certain extent, but I know they're out there and that's the disturbing part. The situations are a little dated as this was written in the sixties, and the ethnic language may take a little getting used to, but the themes are still valid: social revolution, the battle of the sexes, the need for a good pair of pants... all vital issues still under discussion in present time.So much has been said about this book previously that there isn't much more to add save this: if you're having a bad day, you're feeling down about yourself or even if you just need to feel superior, read this book. You can only go up from there."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read (multiple times). Once you get the flavor of the New Orleans dialogue, you will laugh through the entire book. I'm just sorry they have not yet made a movie from it. Ignatius is hysterical."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Let's get one thing straight: A Confederacy of Dunces is funny. Mind-bendingly, gut-wrenchingly, heart-palpatatingly hilarious. You know those moments that are so funny, they make you wonder how anyone could have thought them up? This book has about three per page. The comedy comes from everywhere; the plot itself is a twisting, quixotic odessey, while Toole's narration is gleefully sardonic. The dialogue is as realistic as the kind of conversation you overhear taking place between two people who think that nobody can hear them, and as instantly memorable as a good line from Shakespeare (yes, I just compared John Kennedy Toole to William Shakespeare). Every character has his or her own unique voice, a distinctive sound that makes them instantly recognizable and weirdly likeable.And speaking of characters! The people who populate this novel are incredible, a dizzyingly varied assortmrnt of heroes and villains, of high-minded thugs and heroic lowlifes. The star of the show is Ignatius J. Reilly, a bumbling bozo of an anti-anti-hero whose antics redefine the phrase \\"over the top.\\" Reilly defies description, but suffice to say he's a thirty-year-old medievalist who is driven by a bottomless appetite, a gigantic ego, and an all-consuming hatered of anything and everything that happened after the year 1450. He's also a lazy hypochondriac who spends his days writing paragraph after scalding paragraph in denouncement the modern world, watching children's television shows (which he believes are a sign of civilization's decline into absolute decadence), dodging his mother's attempts to make him get a job, and trying to infuriate his old college girlfirend (who is herself an absolute piece of work). His quest for \\"taste and decency\\" (as he puts it) leads him on a series of increasingly unbelievable misadventures in and around his beloved home town of New Oreleans. As he's hurled from one bizarre situation to the next, Ignatius unwittingly spreads chaos to every corner of the city.But don't think of this as a disjointed series of bizarre events. The plot is held together thanks to Toole's own wonderfully twisted writerly skill and sense of narrative logic; the events that befall Ignatius stem from the actions of some of the greatest supporting characters ever concieved. Indeed, Toole has assembled one of the greatest casts of all time, providing Reilly with a motely crew of friends and foes, flinging our hero headlong into a wonderful world of McCarthyist grandfathers, apathetic clothing moguls, down-on-their luck undercover policemen, conniving nightclub owners, shady teenaged entrepeneurs, kitsch-obsessed homosexuals, ambitious strippers, loudmouthed spinsters, senile octognerians, flip-flopping socialites, nervous bartenders, unapologetically ignorant university professors, heroically incompotent filing clerks, long-suffering neighbors, resentful floorsweepers, an endless series of unfortunate taxi drivers, and the like. Most of these characters could have easily won the lead role in just about any other novel, and it's somewhat amazing that Toole managed to find space for each and every one of them without letting any individual's outrageousness overwhelm the proceedings.But this is more than just a funny novel- there is genuine tragedy in the story of Ignatius Reilly, and in the stories of those around him. Even in its most gut-busting moments, A Confederacy of Dunces shows just how pathetic human existance can become, and how low society (rich and poor alike) can sink. In this sense, Toole's novel is also a brilliant satire, a warped and strangely illuminating farce of modern life. It's one of those rare moments when humor and heart go hand in hand, and manage to say something truly poignant about the way we live. It's a masterpiece."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"John Kennedy Toole was a genius, and this book was probably the greatest I've had the pleasure to read, and I've read many. So, I will not repeat the many eloquent praises to him and his work here, though I have greatly enjoyed reading them. I just want to try to bring people's attention to the fact that Ignatius meets the criteria for a diagnosable mental illness, a personality disorder called Narcissistic Personality Disorder, which is a very isolating and very sad disorder, the more so because people afflicted with it never get any sympathy from those around them. Indeed, they are cannot ask for it, because they are not themselves aware that they need it; they are too ill even to see this aspect of their lives.Many people (certainly everyone intelligent enough to have read and appreciated Confederacy and to be reading reviews of it) have heard of Narcissists, of someone being disparagingly referred to as a Narcissist, meaning s/he is self-absorbed, conceited, etc. However, Narcissistic P.D. has been recognized as a set of characteristics so extreme that they cause the person distress and disable them socially and/or professionally. Ignatius was certainly disabled in both ways, and though I began the book angry and disgusted with him as several other reviewers, as I read on I realized that he was not a \\"bad\\" person, he was just ill, and then I began to pity him even while being frustrated with his behavior, as we often are with the manifestations of mental illnesses.I will not try to summarize the criteria here, but you can easily find them and more information about this disorder with an internet search. But let me explain that Ignatius' apparent arrogance and sense of superiority is exactly the opposite; whereas a normal person can handle the sense of mediocrity that we all have to come to terms with in at least some if not all aspects of who we are, a person with NPD, due to some great humiliations by an authority figure in their early childhood, cannot bear to face the pain that that would cause them, because they were made to feel such a tremendous amount of guilt and shame associated with their not being \\"good enough.\\" So, they cordon off any sense of less than greatness to one part of their mind (subconsciously) and they run like h*ll to the other side, and stay there, forever. Ignatius is not really a jerk, he's just out of balance, and he's imbalanced out of a fear, a terror, really, that he doesn't consciously know he has. So, though we despise people who act like he does, who blame everyone else for their shortcomings or mistakes, who seem to look denigrate others and hold themselves higher than everyone else in every way, to the point of it being comical, they are in fact some of the saddest, loneliest people on earth. And the most hopeless; due to the nature of their insanity, they very rarely get help - they cannot tolerate the terror of the thought that they may be less than perfect, because their father used to beat the crap out of them for making mistakes, etc., etc.So, though I agree wholeheartedly that Confederacy of Dunces is a brilliantly original work, beautifully and skillfully written, I hate to inform you that Ignatius is unfortunately not as original as you probably thought. He exists. He is a deadbeat dad who gambled away all his money, blames his problems on his ex-wife and everyone else, and thinks himself too smart to go to college or get therapy. He's lots of people in this world that we write off as \\"jerks,\\" not seeing the pain and terror behind their actions. Toole portrayed Ignatius with incredible humor and a geniune literary talent, but with such a level of insight that I have to wonder if he himself suffered from NPD. It is hard to imagine that someone with NPD could step outside himself enough to write someone with his disorder so well, but equally difficult to fathom that anyone could write Ignatius who had not lived his experience to some degree. We will never know, sadly, very much about this incredibly talented and apparently sad author, but I would hazard to guess that he knew exactly what disorder his protagonist suffered from and would have liked to have the sympathy you felt for Ignatius by the end of the story not end there, but to extend to all those like him in our world."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I found out about this book reading the intro to a Pearls Before Swine comic book, written by Stephen Pastis. Stephen expressed loving the humor in the early Saturday Night live skits, Mr. Bill, John Belushi and other comic books such as Calvin and Hobbs. He greatly admired Toole's novel, as being comic genius. So since I love the comic genius of Pearls, I gave A Confederacy a go. Well happily I found out that its one of the funniest books I have ever read, intelligent, and pure. Thanks Mr. Pastis for the recommendation!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I love this book. I will occasionally get it for a friend. Toole really captured (as I understand it from New Orleans long time residents) much of flavor of New Orleans of the 60's. But that's not the point - it's a real laugh-out-loud mind-bent trip though the mind of Ignatius J. Reilly as it takes the readers along on his adventures introducing them to the characters he meets along the way."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I loved it. The characters are real, yet no one wants to believe such people exist, or that they have these characteristics themselves. Very funny in places."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius J. Reilly is one of the most brilliantly designed characters I've encountered in fiction. Agoraphobic, narcissistic, and hilarious, his adventures in New Orleans kept me laughing out loud. This is truly side-splitting humor. It's distressing to know that John Kennedy Toole never lived to see the fruition of his work, Pulitzer, etc. Initially, I was quite repulsed by Ignatius. His lewd fantasy of oral sex with a dog streaming through his mind while he masturbates early in the book was a shocker. His hypochondriasis (he has a valve problem of sorts...a somatization probably related to his poor dietary habits) is comical to say the least. He is really an unbelievable character. It's really hard to analyze him, e.g. is he schizoid, narcissistic, brilliant, mentally challenged???? He's an intriguing character and full of surprises. Again and again, you'll be in disbelief as his eccentric behaviors, comments and tendencies emanate inexorably throughout the novel, repeatedly catching you off guard.The lower dregs of New Orleans are brilliantly depicted. I currently live in New Orleans, but read the book prior to relocating. Now, as I meander through the city, I constantly think of Ignatius and his shenanigans. Some grow to pity Ignatius as they read through the book. For me, I grew increasingly curious about the inner workings of Toole's person and mind, often thinking back to the synopsis of his life and suicide given in the jacket cover. It's a pity the world never knew John Kennedy Toole. Perhaps he was as pitiful as his cantankerous protagonist?This book, although a brilliant comedy, is very mysterious. It's a very unique work and I've found that it has a massive following. More than once, I've brought up Ignatius J. Reilly in casual conversations with friends and acquaintances, always finding someone in the group that loves the novel as much as I do. I've never met anyone that dislikes it.Beware, it's very sexually explicit and crass, but has left me laughing for years and years."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"So rare is the laugh-out-loud comic novel. Rarer still is one that so vividly renders a real world culture as peculiar as the French Quarter in the early 1960's. This book is required reading for anyone who likes comedy, farce, or New Orleans."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This tops my list of books to recommend to friends because it is such an easy book to enjoy. It's funny, clever, and it never slows down. He's also way ahead of his time (the book was written in the early 60's) in the humor he finds in issues of race relations, homosexuality, onanism, and political correctness."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Toole crafted a train wreck of a book. Ignatius is a character that you love to hate. He is disgusting, rude, and conceded. Thank goodness there are mutliple plotlines and other characters. I say that it is a train wreck because you can not tear your eyes from it regardless of how disgusting Ignatius gets. You just have to sit back and wait for the other shoe to drop and Ignatius to get what is coming to him. Most of the other characters are pretty good, but Ignatius is the protagonits of the book so all plotlines eventually lead back to him. The book has a final twist at the ending that will leave the reader a bit frustrated. This book is definately worth reading, and it did win a pulitzer. It is a fairly quick read and is recommended for college age and above."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The publishing world has been shamelessly promoting this award winning book -- I enjoyed it, but I didn't think it was quite as much of a hoot as many critics must have. Sure, I laughed at Ignatius' over-active sphincter and his total loser personality, but after a few hundred pages of his manic thoughts, I begain to tire of him. yes, I think the book is a classic, but once you're over the main part of the story, I doubt you'll roll in the aisles laughing. Maybe I'm a heathen, but I laughed much more at every Dave Barry book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Here it is:A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCESNow, I bet none of you chirrin ever known a person so useless as my son Ignatius. He's a very smart boy, ya know, but he doesn't do nothin' for his poor mamma, an' he's already thirty years by now!Well, anyway, I'm Irene Reilly, one of them stars in A Confederacy of Dunces. The nice man who written it is John Kennedy Toole. Now, this book is all about poor Ignatius and me, and it starts when we go off to the doctor to check my darn arthuritis elbow. I go in there alone an after buyin' us some food, I see my poor son is bein harrassed by some po-lice man for no good reason! Well after we get outta there an have a couple a brandys at the Night of Joy, I accidently hit a building with that darn car! An we did a thousand twenty dollars of damage! So then I tells Ignatius he gotta get hisself a job because there is NO way we is gonna be able to pay that off. All he does is sit in his ol' bedroom writin' things, so I'm thinkin' he oughta use his time good, ya know?So my baby goes an gets hisself a job as one of them office people at Levi Pants. I like him havin' a real job an' all, but he shoulda gotten a better one, given all the college he been through. He meeted a real nice ol' lady called Miss Trixie there, an' all she wanted is to retire! There's a lil' bit of her story in that book, too.So, Ignatius somehow gets hisself fired from that place, somethin' about gettin' the factory workers to revolt an' writin' a mean letter to a custermer. Then he gets hisself a position sellin' hotdogs! An' for this darn job, he wore hisself a pirate costume! Can you chirrin imagine how embarrasin that was for his poor mamma?Now, bout this time, my friend Santa hooked me up with a nice man called Claude, an' he's way rich enough to get us a thousand twenty real easy. I like him okay, but I jus dunno. Ignatius have a girlfriend once called Myrna, an' them two send letters still. I hoped they get together sometime.Now, this ain't all that happenin' in that book. Poor Ignatius gets in real trouble with Levi Pants, an' they try an' track him down! An' then he gets hisself mixed up with an orphan carryin' mystery packages! There's also parts in that story about them people workin' at that Night of Joy bar, that po-lice officer that tried to arrest my boy, Mr. an' Mrs. Levi, an' o'course, all them other troubles Ignatius gets hisself into! Now, I can' go round tellin' you chirrin the whole story! But I will tell you that near that end, my friend Santa is tryin' to get me to marry Claude an' send my Ignatius to that Charity Hospital. An, my poor boy gets hisself attacked by a canary at the bar! You is gonna have to read that book to find it out about all that excitin stuff!Anyways, I like that book jus' because it seem so funny to people, how Ignatius get hisself in so many troubles. There is a lot a differen' people stories in there, an' that keeps it real interestin'. The real challengin' bit of that book was understandin' poor Ignatius's journal, because he uses all sorts a big words, ya know.Well, anyway, I gonna read ya jus the beginning of that book, an I love that part because it describes my poor Ignatius so well. Here we go... (in book)Anyway, if I got to give that book a ratin' from one to ten, I would give it a nine. I like this one a lot jus because its so funny. I recommend it to all you, but you oughta be warned there are some things in that book that you maybe shouldn't be readin as such young chirrin.This story takes place in New Orleans in a part of the city where not many people have a lot of money. The Reillys are poor, just like the rest of their community. Mrs. Reilly is not very educated, but she saved up all of her money to put Ignatius in college. He is one of the most educated people in his city. Due to the fact that not many of the citizens have gone to school much, there are not very good jobs around. Ignatius cannot find a high paying job, so he has to work with people who do not really know what they are doing.This book is set in the early sixties time period, so there is a lot of racism going on. One of the characters, named Jones, is a victim of this prejudice. He is a black man who keeps getting wrongly accused of crimes by the police. He has a job at a bar, where his pay is below minimum wage. He only keeps the job because his boss threatens to get the police to arrest him. His character represents the black population of New Orleans and shows how badly they were treated.There ain't a real sequel to this here book, since that poor author commited suicide, but I'll read you what I think them liner notes would look like if there was one.This novel, a continuation of A Confederacy of Dunces, is a must read for fans of the huge Ignatius J. Reilly. Ignatius and his girlfriend Myrna Minkoff are on the run from the Charity Hospital officials and trying to make some money. They meet some extremely strange characters throughout their travels and get quite a few people wanting them in jail. Mrs. Reilly is worried sick about Ignatius and busy is making preparations for her wedding. All she wants is to have her boy back for her special day. Her fianc&eacute;, Claude, is being very nice, but she can't help but notice how reluctant he now seems about getting married. This book is just as hilarious as it's prequel. You will be astounded by the wild imagination of the brilliant John Kennedy Toole, and the uproarious antics of Ignatius and Myrna. This book is too to ingeniously funny to pass up.Source Citation:Toole, John Kennedy. A Confederacy of Dunces.

I had high hopes for the book but soon found out that I was duped. I realize this book is meant to be a satire but the characters are so over the top that it is impossible to like any of the characters. When I started reading this book the opening passages described Ignatius as someone that was a little slower than the rest of us. He had no endearing qualities because he is at once complaining about his valve and at the same time eating like a pig.The story arc isn't complete either. I finished this book with a completely unsatisfied and empty feeling. You somewhat know where Ignatius ends up but there is a character introduced in the middle of the book (Dr. Talc) that serves no real purpose other than to take up space. He is introduced and there is some backstory about Ignatius and Myrna but then Dr. Talc is slowly written out of the story with no real ending for the character and no story arc written for him. It felt as if 40 pages or so were just wasted when some backstory could have been explained in just a few pages without introducing a character that is superfluous.I would like to continue writing about how this book could have been better but I would rather just read a book that is more well written that doesn't feel like it needs to use a vocabulary that most of society doesn't use. If I had written that book I don't know if I would want to write any more books after this one for the thought of being \\"lashed about the shoulders\\" as Ignatius likes to write about some of his acquaintances.I am giving this book three stars because there was potential but it is far from being humorous."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I'm sure I will be called stupid for not adoring this book, but I just don't understand the following it has. A professor recommended it to me and I respect his opinion, so I tried to read it. I read 2/3 of it before I was so disgusted and angry at the main character, I could not finish it. There are only three other books I have started and not finished because I had such a strong aversion to them. This one was so bad, I recycled it. Maybe my humor isn't well matched with the humor in this book, because I didn't smile once. Most of the time I found my self dry heaving a little bit at the disgusting description of the main character. I suppose for that, I will give the author kudos for creating a character that was so revolting and colorful, that I literally almost threw up. I guess the fact that his character moved me to anger and disgust means something, but I cannot say it means that the book was good."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is the humor and intellectual equivalent of Jersey Shore. It's nothing but horrible people doing horrible things. Being somewhat OCD, I have difficulty not finishing a book once started. However, the only reaction this book created was hatred for the main character. I couldn't continue to slog through; try as I might."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"For something that's supposed to be a laugh riot, I can only think of a handful of times when I thought something was the least bit funny, and none of those moments had anything to do with the terrible Ignatius. I think that Toole's main problem was making Ignatius so horrible. I couldn't have any sympathy or feeling for a grown man who screeches every time something doesn't go his way, and who treats his mother with such disdain. This is a character who has absolutely no redeemable qualities whatsoever. Even then, you could use a character like Ignatius in a way that would at least bring him some shame that he would refuse to admit, though the audience could share a laugh about him. Unfortunately, there is no point where Ignatius gets his comeuppance, and no, I didn't read the entire book, but 2/3's is certainly too much time to spend with a person like Ignatius and not have any satisfaction. You should know something about me: When I start a book, I finish it. I have never not finished a book, no matter if it takes me two hours, two days, or two years. I've read some pretty terrible books, and yet, I plow ahead, and finish the durn thing. There was nothing I could do for this book. Even with all my willpower (which is not a huge factor), the author has to give me something to latch onto, so that I can want to find out what happens in the end. The only way I could find any peace is if Ignatius had died, and I've read the final pages, that does not happen. The pace is furiously slow, the characters unimaginative, and the protagonist, a terrible human being. I think sometimes people get so wrapped up in the hype surrounding a book, the want to read it and be on the 'in' crowd who 'get' the joke. I've never been one to follow the crowd (unless I wanted to), and am not afraid to say that the emperor has no clothes."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Both camps are right about this book. It is both funny and annoying. The people who think it's funny, love the laughs and ignore the fact that there is virtually no story. The people who hate it, don't. I laughed for about a hundred pages and then the book falls into tiresome repetition- Surface activity with no point. The protagonist is someone none of the reviewers would spend five minutes with. I couldn't make it past page 150 or so. A more interesting story would inviestigate how the publisher used word-of-mouth about the authors suicide as a marketing tool, allowing fans to credit themselves with coolness for finding this &quot;underground&quot; hit."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I found this book unfunny, uniteresting and unbearable. One of only two books that I couldn't force myself to finish reading. Save your time and money...avoid this book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I don't know why I wasted my time finishing this book, given the fact that there are so many finer works out there to read. I give it a half star.The plot is useless, the main character does nothing but pontificate on uninspiring topics, the remaining characters are flat. I enjoy a good laugh and have a mischievous streak in me, but this book never once made me laugh. Why is that?"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Toole's main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, in A Confederacy of Dunces is what makes the book so interesting. Although, Ignatius is unbelievably crude I found him to be very entertaining. He is a thrity-something year old living at home with his mother. He's had a college education, but doesn't have a job when you first meet him. Throughout the story, he took on several different jobs, including a filer at Levy Pants factory and a hot dog vendor for Paradise Vendors. At both of his jobs he caused problems. He also took notes in his Big Chief Tablets about all that he was encountering, some fact and some fiction.The story is set in New Orleans,and involves several characters for example, Myrna Minkoff, Ignatius' ex-girlfriend; Patrolman Mancuso, Mrs.Reilly's friend; and Miss Trixie, secretary at Levy Pants. All of their lives are all very different, however, in the end all of there lives intermingle through one big scence involving Ignatius in the French Quarter.The book will catch your attention, and make you want to see what happens to Ignatius and the rest of the character's in the end."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Very funny book. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Without trying to offend any of the fans, who seem numerous, I was spectacularly disappointed with this book. I bought this book on a whim, before a week off, because I thought the Pulitzer Prize denoted quality, and I had heard the book was good. I thought the writing was of poor quality, although there were a few very clever metaphors (boiling hotdogs as paramecia was my favorite). The plot was thin at best, the characters totally unbelievable and poorly developed, and the humor, if you could call it that, was geared towards the lowest common denominator, a la Carl Hiassen, although Carl has actually made me laugh. No offense to Carl -- he knows what his target audience is and I'm guessing, even as a former newspaperman, he does not feel miffed to have been passed over by the Pulitzer gods with respect to his \\"trashy novels\\". I guess there must be a distinction between humor and wit or something, as the media reviews were glowing and consistent in their recommendation. I only finished it because I was hoping beyond hope that at some point it would get good; it did not. Even the ending was poorly constructed.The setting of New Orleans, one of my favorite towns, was wasted, too.I happened upon some Thurber, and even some Dave Barry books in our vacation house, and I laughed out loud, so before you label me elitist or a stick in the mud, I do enjoy a funny tale. Confederacy is simply not one of them. I left the book in the vacation house to torture some other soul. You could not pay me to read this piece of junk again. In contrast, I reread Bryson's \\"A Short history of Nearly Everything\\" each year and enjoy it each time."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"John Kennedy Toole is a fine sophisticated writer of that there is no doubt. His turn of phrase is descriptive and vivid and his clarity of expression is a pleasure to read. His Pulitzer prize was earned and deserved in my opinion. However, sometimes humour and other charactistics of story telling, which is what this book definitely is, just don't cross borders. While I could appreciate the talent of the writer in an abstract manner, the story did nothing to entertain me. I was basically left unsatisfied and rather replused by much of the story, due, I am sure, to the inability of a non-american to relate to a very colloquial and private joke."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I've heard about this 1967 Pulitzer Prize winning novel for many years. There was a lot of hype about it, how the author committed suicide at age 31 and how his mother then shopped the book around to publishers until it finally got into print. I was never interested though because I heard it was a comedy and comedies are just not my style. But recently a friend who knows I read a lot insisted I read this. \\"Why not\\", I thought, \\"this is a classic\\".The story is about a brilliant misfit - overweight, sloppy and more than a little bit crazy. He lives at home with his mother, cannot hold a job and composes long-winded letters and essays in his squalid room. It's set in the city of New Orleans where he tries his hand at a few different jobs such as working in the office of a pants manufacturer and, latter, selling hot dogs from a wagon. He and all the other characters are caricatures rather than real people I could relate too. And they all seemed absurd and grotesque.I found the book tedious and somewhat sad and, even though I occasionally chuckled to myself a bit, I found it plodding and rather boring. Actually, I had to force myself to finish it. I just can't understand why it was such a roaring success. Well, tastes do vary. And so even though I can appreciate the bright tortured soul of the author, I absolutely cannot recommend it at all."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book, i think, is generally over rated. Don't get me wrong, it is funny and memorable. However it was awarded the Pulitzer posthumously and I feel that it does not rank up there with the best work produced in the last century. It is likely that Toole might have produced such a book had he continued writing though. Perhaps his suicide has granted the book an aura of pathos that has helped it along the path to greatness.The book tends to make caricatures out of the characters, including Ignatius (who is the only real character in the book). Because the book focuses on the personal scale of things, this defect in itself hurts it the most.Would I read it again, probably yes, but I would have enjoyed it more had i not expected so much of it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I could probably ramble for days about the comic brilliance in this book, arguing it may be \\"The Great American Novel.\\" Find out for yourself. If you like to laugh, this will keep you in tears. I don't think I can even recall the number of times I have read it over the years. It is like an old friend to me, although I usually try to avoid the Ignatius J. Riley's of the world."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"this has to be the most humorous book on the face of the earth. john kennedy toole was one of the greatest writers this, or any other country has produced. it is only too bad that he had to kill himself the way that he did, when he did. this book justifies my philosophy that anyhting that can be laughed at should be laughed at."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The Confederacy of the DuncesBy Drew YoungThe Confederacy of the Dunces is a book written by John Kennedy Toole. This book is an enjoyable read, and it always keeps you on your toes. The main character, Ignatius J. Reilly is a thirty-year-old man who lives with his mother in New Orleans. He is well educated, but he just sits at home writing on big peaces of paper on what he thinks the world should look like. He goes through a hard time when his mother forces him to get a job to pay off debt. The events that follow are humorous and entertaining to any reader.The things that made this book interesting and good were, the unique characters, the characters personality, and the way the two plots were brought together in the end. The main character Ignatius comes across as a person who thinks he is the smartest person in the world. He is a large person with a unique personality and is often described as a whale with a mustache. He has a green hunting cap with flaps and he puts the flaps up when he listens and puts them down when he talks. His mother, who takes care of Ignatius, is a nice lady who has no friends. As the book progress she finds love, and becomes more social. Dealing with Ignatius's problems drove her to drink. At a point she gets frustrated with her son, and asks him to get a job. No job could fit Ignatius unique personality. The other thing that makes the book interesting is the way they have two plots run at the same time and they make no sense until almost two thirds of the way through the book. The author did a good job of making lose ends come together nicely at the end of the book.The thing I enjoyed most about is book is the way the author incorporated humor into the novel. This is probably the first novel I have ever read where I have laughed out loud while reading. However, Toole jumped into a plot with out warning. In the first chapter the author introduced the characters and the plot, but he did it in a way that I hadn't expected. This book was an enjoyable read, and the author's sense of humor was enjoyable. I suggest you read this book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"If this book was awarded the pulitzer for generating emotion in the reader then it deserves the award. Unfortunately, for me it was nausea. The lead character embodied everything about modern America that I find repulsive. Grossly fat, completely self indulgent, narrowly educated, blaming all on others, and completely disfunctional. Yuck! This book will appeal to those who enjoy the pratfalls of the Three Stooges. No joy, no hope, no sense. Stupidity and insanity are not funny."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I've been accused of having a sense of humor outside the mainstream. Reading all of the reviews below makes me believe this may be true. I don't know why, but I just didn't get it! I thought the story was stupid and boring. I got about 2/3 the way through and just couldn't bring myself to finish it. Oh well, different strokes, as they say..."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Can't resist adding a note of dissent to the overwhelming chorus of praise this book has received over the years. &quot;Humorous,&quot; I suppose, but in a very broad, Vaudevillian way, where you see the joke coming from so far away that when it lands it causes a groan of impact, not a laugh. If you enjoy slapstick--the verbal equivalent of &quot;Police Academy&quot; movies--this may be the book for you, but I found it tired, strained, banal."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"To paraphrase someone else's comment: an emperor with no clothes - possibly better than one with. I can only think he won the Pulitzer out of the committee's mis-guided sympathy for a seriously disturbed mother."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I can honestly say that I don't understand what the other reviewers who give this high marks see in it, especially when they call those who don't like it \\"humor-impaired\\". Ignatius is pompous, narcissistic, and boorish, but just having those qualities doesn't make him funny - an author has to do something with a character like that, and Toole doesn't (at least through the first half, after which I gave up because it just got too boring). He and his mother are much like the characters on Desperate Housewives: having no redeeming qualities that might inspire even a slight bit of sympathy or relating, yet not evil or noxious enough to generate antipathy and interest to see how they might meet some kind of downfall. Instead you just wish they'd go away and stop bothering you. But then, I guess there are people who like Desperate Housewives too."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I didn't find this book at all interesting or amusing. The characters were unrealistic. There was no plot. There was nothing funny about it. I forced my self to finish this one.

The first few pages were humorous so I thought I was in for a good book, but I quickly became bored. I just don't feel like a book should be work, and I was working to pay attention after those first few pages.It's interesting to me how some books can have such good reviews, and I think, \\"Meh.\\" Oh well, to each his own."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I struggled through this as it was recommended by a friend (and had won a major award). I didn't find it either hysterical or humorous - mostly inane. The only humor being the reality tv sort. If you enjoy watching (or reading about) train wrecks, this might be for you. I know I'm in the minority, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I didn't like this book and I finished it out of determination. Personally, I found the plot slow and ripetitive, the characters more similar to jonsonian humours than real persons. The atmosphere of the whole book reminded me of a famous Italian comic strip &quot;Alan Ford e il Gruppo TNT&quot; (Alan Ford and the TNT Groups). Italian readers know what I'm talking about and will see this is no compliment. I grant the author a deep knowledge of medieval culture, though, and a good hand at mastering his own mother tongue. I wonder whether, had he lived, he would have written something really good."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I would like to know what percentage of the people who gave this book a 5 also said that &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; was the funniest movie they've ever seen.

Also, I could see how someone nostalgic for \\"old\\" New Orleans (pre-Katrina, mostly) might enjoy this book.One thing is for certain.

Should have been made into a movie by now but legal issues abound. Wonderful car entertainment from O'Toole's genius, award winner book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This was a fine book. Fine enough for me to read twice, and most books, even good ones, don't recieve such an honor from me. It is a grand comedy of errors. Its over the top, and yet the characters speak so easily, and in such a human way, that its all believable. You can truly hear the characters peaking as individuals throughout. The characters' flaws and defficiencies lurk around every corner, and make them shine. And at the center of it all sags Ignatius J. Reilly: the flatulent, masturbatory, violent, intollerably rude, self-centered, pseudo-genius who sweats and blusters his way from one misadventure to the next.Its a true shame Toole didn't live to see his work become recognized. But not all things are meant to be. But the tragedy of the author's life, and the despair he must have felt about it, give the comedy in these pages a dark and edgy tinge that give the work its biting wit. I loved it, and I think you will to. Just give it a chance."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"For anyone who is a fan of 20th century literature this is a must read. You can and will be able to put it down but you will not be able to keep yourself from picking it back up."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I highly recommend this book for those who like offbeat, literary books with an absurdist humor. For example, if you like The World According to Garp, you may like A Conspiracy of Dunces. It is one of the funniest books I've ever read, but the humor is unique and may not appeal to everyone.I giggled the entire way through. The main character, Ignatius Riley, is one-of-a-kind and unforgettable. He feels like the anti-hero, in the sense that he encapsulates so much \\"negative\\" traits--he's a mama's boy, lazy, snobby intellectual, fat, a slob. But Toole's writing is brilliant and depicts him in a way where you root for him, sympathize with him, and want to go along with him on his adventures. The other characters are equally memorable, his mom, the bumbling police officer she dates, the bar owner. I also appreciate the diversity of characters in race and sexual orientation. It makes the whole book, which is set in 1960s New Orleans feel more authentic.This is a book for those who've ever felt left out in life (and who hasn't?). It's also for those who can't relate to the values espoused by keeping up with the jones--dressing in the right clothes, having the right job, hitting the adult milestones at the right time."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is the funniest book I have ever read. I suspect that \\"The Simpsons\\"'s Comic Book Guy is based upon Ignatius."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It is a shame that an author of such amazing talents is not with us. Next to &quot;Youth in Revolt&quot;, this is, without a doubt, the funniest book I have read. Be sure to read this and share it with your freiends"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"First of all, it's amazing that a book that won the Pulitzer Prize so many years ago is still generating heated reviews. The good news is that people are still reading. (There's no bad news.) The bottom line, however, is that humor is a very personal thing. My friends and I all read the book pretty much at the same time when it was first published. Most of us found it funny, touching, deep and beautifully written. Others of us found it disturbing and off-putting. It IS disturbing to think that perhaps Toole was writing himself into the Ignatius character. Meanwhile, I now have a 13-year-old son who chose &quot;Dunces&quot; as elective reading in the 8th grade and wrote a very perceptive book report. His experience with the book made me reread it (I'd already read it several times) -- and I still love it, as did he. Mostly, it challenged both of us to think, which is all I ask of any book (except for the occasional &quot;brain candy&quot; mystery or beach book)."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"&quot;Confederacy of Dunces&quot; is a laugh-out-loud book that will flood your eyes with tears of laughter. The main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, is like nobody else all literature. He is the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics come to life. Everything he touches turns to chaos and disorder, all the while he himself remains totally unaware and aloof and superior. The author writes with a pen that speeds even the slowest reader along, as Ignatius is a non-stop whirlwind of disarray. The author's choice of words will keep the reader turning page after page to find out whose life Ignatius has turned upside down. Anyone coming into contact with this &quot;chaosmeister&quot; is forever changed for the humorous worst. Once you begin the book and get into its second and third chapter, you are hooked for the entire 400 pages. The only regret you'll have while you're reading it is that the author will never write a sequel. The book demands a movie, but the character is so definively unique, who could play the role?"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Although I have noticed several bad comments on this novel, I must retort these futile comments. I read this book while I was in a deep depression at one time and it uplifted me more than any words I could write on this commentary. Toole's ability to bring out a character with so much negativity yet establish a sense of pity for Ignatius that the novel relates so much to me and my personality. This man killed himself only to see his finest works published and furthermore win a pulitzer prize. If I everwas to die early, that is a way I would like to go out. great novel and I am thrilled it was praised as it was."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I've giggled along with many a page, but few books have made me laugh out loud like this one did.

For the people who did not find this 4 or more stars: visit New Orleans (because anyone who has ever spent more than 2 days with &quot;locals&quot; totally understands this book. And no, it's not the same if you're a &quot;tourist&quot; and your only experience with Louisiana is via a hotel chain). If you haven't been to New Orleans, will you find this book great/funny/well-written? Yes; open up your mind and let John Kennedy Toole lead you on the most colorful journey of your life!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It is hard to imagine the sensibilities of the reader who dislikes this book. True, Ignatius and most of the other characters are not admirable, but since when is that a legitimate criterion for a first-rate novel? The characters absolutely come to life and inhabit the mind of the reader. One laughs at them but with some misgivings. As for the plot, it is ingenious. The ending is perfect, because it lets the reader decide just how far from New Orleans the Renault went before the explosion occurred. Moreover, the book is universal. It could be set in any country, any city, at any time in history. There have always been characters such as Ignatius, Mancuso, Miss Trixie et al. I can only pity the drab and wretched lives of those who failed to enjoy this book, the best comic novel since Huck Finn and certainly one of the best Ameican novels."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Only as a favor did I read it for the first time...the other three times I read it looking for all the things I missed. A great book and a good summer read, I can't think of any other book to carry along on a road trip."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It is hard to enjoy an entire book of ridiculous ranting and hysteria. Reilly's outbursts grow tiresome and repetitive. He maintains the same one-note level of disgust and anger throughout the book, and any personal growth that he achieves tends to be physical rather than spiritual or philosophical. British readers may find Reilly a mixture of several comic characters from Viz magazine - Spoiled Brat, Mr Brain - but Toole's real skill is in creating the various plot threads and drawing them together and flinging them apart at will. I was truly delighted that Ignatius gets away at the end of the book to wreak further havoc. What a pity that the author didn't."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I read this book on a road trip to New Orleans.

Hurry. . .I feel my valve snapping shut!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is a book that I have reservations about recommending. The pacing was good, the humor was there (although I didn't laugh out loud as much as some people), the characters were interesting (if a bit one-dimensional), and the plot was sufficiently twisted and surprising. I think the main problem I had was with the dialogue. Ignatius's interactions with everyone in the book made me shiver at his horrible interpersonal skills. But then I guess that's the point. The whole thing seemed somewhat implausible to me. I think I'll re-read it in a few months to see what I missed the first time."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"De lo que mas me impresiono de este libro es que empeze a leermelo casi de casualidad y p&aacute;gina a p&aacute;gina, me fui metiendo en el personaje hasta practicamente identificarme con el.Ignacius J. Reilly es el Quijote del siglo XX"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is one of my top three books of all time. If you are from New Orleans, as I am, you will laugh and know every character in this book. The ninth ward dialect lives and breathes in this book. Ignatius like the city he is from is eccentric, hilarious, sad, anachronistic, and totally, wonderfully one of a kind. If you don't like this book you've got no sense of philosophy not to mention theology or geography. Long live Ignatius!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"By far, one of the funniest books I've ever read. Ignatius has a screwed-up viewpoint of the world or so it seems. The things he tried (the worker's rebellion, Sodomites for World Peace, among others) are incredibly and painfully funny. As a friend of mine who borrowed my copy said, &quot;It gets out of control in the first page and gets worse and worse as it goes.&quot; The humor isn't for everyone and it is definitely _not_ politically correct (and was never meant to be). If you don't like irreverent humor, or you require warm-fuzzy's when you read a novel, don't bother. But if you like to read and laugh out loud, go for it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A very funny and humane book. As an evocation of New Orleans it is unsurpassed and it introduces us to one of fiction's great one-offs, Ignatius J. Reilly. Where else in American fiction does a hero proclaim the only true form of government is the devine right of kings?"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"One of my bedside books. If you are in bad moods, just read a few lines...it's better than Prozac ! I read it in spanish (good translation) and in french (awful translation !) but it's always great !"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ingatius is some character! Yes, he would be hard to deal with in real life, but the author really gets inside his head. Toole is Ignatius, of course, and reading this book just might help you understand some of the truly eccentric people in our society. All of the supporting characters are wonderful as well. The author's command of the language is stupendous. Mostly hilarious, there are some touching and even sad moments. I gave this book to two friends, who loved it, and my mom, who didn't. So this book probably isn't for the Grisham-Francis type of reader. If you have ever felt &quot;different&quot; in any way, this book is for you."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"For those who at least once in their lifetime would like to share a wonderful &quot;little known fact&quot; here is your chance. How many have heard of John Kennedy Toole? Yet, once having encountered his merry band of misfits, one feels ignorant having lived without them. One feels uninformed not knowing Ignatius Reilly and certainly one feels a sense of loss once the last page is turned.In reading this you will not only do yourself a great favor, but others as well as no one can keep this madcap adventure a secret from his or her friends.In other words, reading this wonderful story counts as an act of altruism because you won't be able to keep from spreading your good fortune with others."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I read ten pages every time I go to visit my mother and sister. It is so good I do not want it to end. I am one-third through it. I have to stop from laughing out loud and disturbing the tranquility of the house. If I bought my own copy and read it in my own home, I would finish it too soon and the dream/nightmare would be over. Reading the reviews would open that valve wide on Mr. Ignatius. If only there were more like him. Funniest book I ever read. Catch-22 is not on this level of absurdity. And the crudity works."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Jones is my favorite character--Ooo-wee! Jones sees all, and tells it like it is. I found it interesting that our protagonist--the ultra-critical Ignatious-- held such disdain for Mark Twain, whose characterizations I find as insightful and engaging as those in this book. Definitely worthy of the PP."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is such a fabulous and funny book I bought it for all my close friends, wanting to share its specialness with them. Ignatius Reilly has to be one of the most memorable fictional characters ever invented, alternately physically gigantic and buffoonish but somehow strangely sad and pitiable. The supporting characters, from the &quot;minxish Myrna Minkoff&quot; to the watering hole &quot;Night of Joy&quot; are equally finely etched. The wacky series of adventures Ignatius experiences makes me wonder how John Kennedy Toole could think of such extraordinarily funny situations that finally dovetail in a hilarious conclusion. I was sad when the book ended because I wanted to keep sharing the lives of these amazing characters. If you haven't read Confederacy of Dunces, do so at once!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is the one the professor uses to see if we still know how to read. If you were coerced to read it like I was than thank your teacher/librarian/parole officer and read it again... if only for the sodomising superpowers. It's funny.It's also very well written. At first look my one inch thick paperback edition was a little intimidating, not to mention the prices at the college bookstore, but every adventure is a story in itself and I had a whole month to read the book and write a paper so who's counting.This hero's coming of age would have been just another funny trip through the American social landscape if Toole hadn't come through time and time again revealing some shred of justice behind each of Ignatius' blunders. Ignatius' divine rampage is the rare satire that merits this society.Despite a cast of colorful characters playing everything from God to slob, Toole's comedy does not leave the national conscience as clean as his hero's perverted bedsheets, hung to dry on his mother's clothesline one last time. It is a funny but poignant tale of yet another American innocent, impressed with the conscience of a nation, and forced to keep ahead of its current of opinion.I like my teacher and I like the book. I'm no scholar on american literature but I've also read books I didn't like and on a scale of one-to-five, Larry Flynt being the lowest and Ken Kesey one of the best, I'll give this book 4 stars."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Confederacy is set in Toole's native city of New Orleans and revolves around one Ignatius J. Reilly, a character Percy describes as &quot;without progenitor in any literature I know of -- slob extraordinary, a mad Oliver Hardy, a fat Don Quixote, a perverse Thomas Aquinas rolled into one.&quot; A morbidly obese 30-year-old with an M.A. in Medieval Studies, Ignatius is unemployed and lives with his widowed mother, whom he treats bominably. He has a love-hate relationship with the 20th century, spending his days watching junk TV and going to movies, obsessing about his overtaxed digestive system and writing florid denunciations of modern culture: &quot;Were Hroswitha with us today, we would all look to her for counsel and guidance. From the austerity and tranquility of her medieval world, the penetrating gaze of this legendary Sybil of a medieval nun would exorcise the horrors which materialize before our eyes in the name of television.&quot; Ignatius also carries on a long-distance relationship with Myrna Minkoff, an obsessively Freudian social activist from the Bronx he met at Tulane University. &quot;Myrna was decidedly masochistic. She was only happy when a police dog was sinking its fangs into her black leotards or when she was being dragged feet-first down the steps from a Senate hearing.&quot; A drunk-driving charge and fine puts Mrs. Reilly in the unenviable position of convincing her indolent son to get a job to help pay it off. Ignatius, protesting loudly all the while, does find work of sorts; first as a file clerk at Levy Pants, a disreputable garment factory, then as a hot-dog vendor in the French Quarter. He also becomes the epicentre of an increasingly bizarre chain of events that blunders to a surprisingly just conclusion for all concerned. I know this sounds insane, but though it be madness, there's method in it. There are people who might find Ignatius too grotesque and misanthropic to be sympathetic, but discerning readers should see the core of truth in his rantings against the modern world. Ignatius' rationale to his mother for staying unemployed has a seductive logic to it: &quot;Employers sense in me a denial of their values. They fear me. I suspect that they can see that I am forced to function in a century which I loathe. That was true even when I worked for the New Orleans public library.&quot; &quot;All you did was paste them little slips in the books. &quot; &quot;Yes, but I had my own esthetic about pasting those slips. On some days I could only paste three or four and at the same time feel satisfied with the quality of my work. The library authorities resented my integrity about the whole thing. They only wanted another animal who could slop glue on their bestsellers.&quot; His mother, nearing the end of her patience, suggests at one point Ignatius try a &quot;rest&quot; at a public hospital psych ward, over strenuous objections: &quot;Do you suppose that some stupid psychiatrist could even attempt to fathom the workings of my psyche? They would try to make me into a moron who liked television and new cars and frozen food. Psychiatry is worse than communism. I refuse to be a robot!&quot; What really propels A Confederacy of Dunces, though, are Toole's strong characterizations. Working-class Italians, members of the French Quarter's thriving gay subculture, bumbling rookie cops, black factory workers, wannabe strippers, Toole captures them all perfectly. In the end though, I can only echo Walker Percy's lament: &quot;It is a great pity that John Kennedy Toole is not alive and well and writing. But he is not, and there is nothing we can do about it but make sure that this gargantuan tumultuous human tragicomedy is at least made available to a world of readers.&quot;This is one of the funniest and most entertaining novels I have ever read. The entire novel swirls around the character of Ignatius Rielly, surely one of the most inventive creations in literature. When most adults would be out making their way in the world Ignatius still lives with his widowed mother, and spends his days writing on paper tablets copious dissertations of his intellectual views on life. Dissertations that no one will ever see or have the slightest interest in seeing. Ignatius only ventures out into the real world at the insistence of his mother, or to obtain sustenance for his enormous bulk. Yet even these infrequent forays into society invariably result in his madly disrupting the lives of those he meets. Yet all the while Ignatius remains convinced that only he has the true picture of things. The novel is set in New Orleans in the 1960's. I grew up in the Gulf Coast area during that period and can say the Toole did a wonderful job of creating the look, feel, and I would swear even smell of New Orleans at that time. It is unfortunate for all of us that Toole died at an early age (this novel was published posthumously) as he obviously had a real gift for creating outrageously funny, but still believable characters. It's been hailed as a masterpiece and reviled as trash, but A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole has never been lightly dismissed. By creating Ignatius J. Reilly, a bigger-than-life bag of wind stuffed with some of the most comically outrageous and disturbingly insightful opinions ever put to paper, Toole made an indelible mark on the landscape of American literature--a feat recognized with the posthumous publication of this novel, followed by a Pulitzer Prize. Forced to wade the lower depths of New Orleans society, the gargantuan Ignatius, his poor mother in tow, Takes us on a tour de force through the back alleys and juke joints of the French Quarter as he implores the gods, railing against the hypocrisy of contemporary politics and the crushing weight of late capitalism. &quot;The luminous years ... dimmed into dross; Fortuna's wheel had turned... Having once been so high, humanity fell so low. What had once been dedicated to the soul was now Dedicated to the sale.&quot; Toole's suicide at 32 silenced a uniquely promising literary voice, denying his critics and fans alike the opportunity to determine whether his talent was a flash in the pan or a first spark of genius. Read A Confederacy of Dunces and you'll no doubt have formed your own inflexible opinion, which you'll defend tenaciously against all reason."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is truly a work of genius. This book has the remarkable ability to bring tears to your eyes while your belly aches from the guffaws. An undercurrent of sad desperation gently counterbalances the hilarity of Ignatius. A perfect companion read to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Sometimes a Great Notion. Wow!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"When I first picked this up at a used book place in Penn State, I read it, and read it, and read it, and I couldn't put it down. And being 13 (11 at the time I read it), the 405 pages were quite overwhelming to me but now it has become my all-time favorite book and it hasn't changed since I read &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and other 'classic' books these last two years! It follows the mishaps and escapades of Ignatius J. Reilly, an intellectual thirty-year-old man who writes notes and numbers of reports explaining the trials and tribulations of life, constantly aggrivates himself with his pen pal Myrna Minkoff and her absurd attempts at sex education, his antics at finding the perfect job in the New Orleans area (with fate providing loads of misadventures in the Levy Jean racket and hot-dog vending! Ignatius is constantly ending up in great troubles (one with his eccentric mother who insists that he be put in the nut house which is an idea she gets from her friend lively named Santa)and having &quot;stimulating&quot; conversations with street derelicts. With good humor and old-fashioned American know-how, this is the great American novel that this country had been waiting for before Toole wrote it. Sadly, he commited suicide after he had written the book and thus providing no more novels of his satirical humorand cynical kicks."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A true gut-buster. I laughed outloud through most of its pages, called friends on the phone to recite the funniest parts and have read it twice. The second time I broke down and bought it (I read mostly library books). Get it in hardback so it'll keep its shape after so many readings, and so many passing-along to friends and family."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I am really mixed about this book. I read it because people were passing it around at work and they raved about it. It certainly contains unique characters but the main one just annoyed me, although I loved Jones, the floor-sweeping guy. I stopped reading halfway through because I was bored, then pick it up again because I hate not to finish a book. I can't find that there's a real plot here. If you're looking for a mix of laugh out loud and quiet humor with southern dialect I'd recommend the series by TR Pearson: A Short History of a Small Place, Off for the Sweet Hereafter, and The Last of All There Was."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Those with a good imagination and taste for the absurd will enjoy this book very much. Unlike authors that try to make you giggle with their cute prose, Toole paints riotous scenes of social mayhem along with really great colloquial speech that had me laughing like a madman at times (and at least chuckling every page).P.S. Anyone else think Zach Galifianakis would be pretty much perfect as Ignatius?"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I won't waste time retelling the plot of 'Confederacy' - it's been done in hundreds of other reviews posted here.I just want to say that it is the funniest book I've ever had the good fortune to read. The characters are priceless, and the story (I don't think there's a plot, per se) is astonishingly original.I HIGHLY recommend the audio version of this book (read by the masterful Barrett Whitener). Whitener brings the story to life with his rich blend of accents and characterizations. He should have one an audio Pulitzer - if there were such a thing - for his work with this book.Final note: I see a few reviewers gave this book one star, and said it wasn't funny at all. My sympathies to these obviously humor-impaired unfortunates. Life must be pretty drab for them to have missed this humor in this story."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Pulitzer prize winning author, too bad he wasn't alive to receive his prize.

It is one of those rare books I find myself rereading (and rediscovering all over again) every few years. Although the author - John Kennedy Toole - tragically passed away before his time and thus was never able to receive his much-deserved praise, his lone novel serves to prove to each and every one of us that we all have at least one great novel inside of us. After reading (or listening, as it were) A Confederacy of Dunces, I always am left feeling that there were plenty of more masterpieces inside Mr. Toole, but that those stories are sadly lost to us forever.This audio-CD version is excellent and well worth the cost. The narrator, Barrett Whitener provides a rich variety of character voices that serves to enhance the journey into the wacky, slightly off-kilter world of the novel's protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly.This audio-CD is the perfect companion for a long road trip. However, I cannot stress enough that your trip might take a bit longer than planned, due to the many times you'll be pulling over due to uncontrollable fits of laughter! Due to a few \\"F-bombs\\" and some mild sexual content (although it's almost innocent by today's standards), this might not be the best choice for a family vacation road trip... at least until the kids are old enough.After experincing this novel, I'm confident you will join me in saying, \\"Wherever you are Mr. Toole, thank you for giving birth to such amazing characters. And kudos to Mr. Whitener for providing voices worthly of those wonderfully insane characters.\\""},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Humorous, absurd, engaging, impossible yet believable (just barely), this is an amazingly zany and entertaining novel. The immensely egotistical Ignatius J. Reilly of New Orleans, Louisiana, sees himself out of place in the 20th century and lets everyone around him know about it.The cast of characters includes his long-suffering mother Irene Reilly, activist and philosophical counterpoint Myrna Minkoff, bar owner and pornographic photo star Lana Lee and especially the very funny janitor/vagrant Burma Jones, along with many other unique and memorable characters.Ignatius J. Reilly is thrown into the job market by his mother to help pay for damages they inflicted on a building with their automobile while arguing. The lead-up to that event opens the story and is a comedy in itself. As an employee, Ignatius turns every engagement into a wild ride until he gets predictably fired. The situations are zany yet not quite fantastic enough to dismiss.The dialogue is continuous, unpredictable and downright funny. The phrasing, the New Orleans dialect, the hilariously contrasting viewpoints of identical situations by those characters present, all combine to surprise and entertain from cover to cover.A unique aspect of plot development is the way scenes are portrayed and reader's focus is shifted from one to the next simultaneous event. The author paints excellent visual images of places and people that make one feel as though you are witness to a Broadway play or a television sitcom.I tried to rate this a 4-star book, but cannot think of any reason to deduct that fifth star. So 5-star it is."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I've heard about rave reviews of this book for years. I got the audio version because I love to listen to books while commuting to work on bus/subway and also at the gym. The book is peopled by the most unique fully 3-dimensional characters you will ever know. And above all -- Ignatius Reilly is truly one of the most unique characters I have come across in the English language. A highly educated lazy man who is pure ego lives with his mother, can't hold down a job, yet seeks ways to take progressive stands in his own bizarre fashion."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"You simply must read this book. Goddam.While I am perhaps coming on a bit strong, John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces, protagonised by Ignatius Reilly, is not a book that lends itself to qualified (in the syntactic sense) or in any way guarded statements. I thus feel it appropriate to proclaim that the text is a work of genius and ought to be added as the fourth \\"r\\" to the general education method (\\"reading, \`riting, \`rithmetic\\"), and, if four r's are deemed too many, I feel it ought to replace writing. Indeed, all that there is to be learnt of good writing can be learnt in this book.If you thought Napoleon Dyamite was original in that it had virtually no plot, merely inane characters, you will think again once you read this book. If you thought that Snatch, Go or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels displayed a brilliant mastery of the plot twist, you may think again once you finish the book's ultimate chapter. If you thought the first thing you would save in a housefire was your pet, marriage photos, or loved ones, you may think again once you own a copy of A Confederacy of Dunces.I encourage you to get a copy. I encourage you to read it. I further encourage you to adopt the contrived and rather absurd argot of the fat, garish, arrogant and boorish protagonist Ignatius Reilly. In the canon of literature there are many remarkable characters. In my own reading I remember empathising with Goethe's Werther, adventuring with Heller's Yossarian, and trudging alongside Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s Billy Pilgrim. But none of these characters can hold a candle to Ignatius Reilly. I have delved in to Anna Karenina's life, I have laughed at Ford Prefect's absurdities, I have recoiled at Alex's ultra-violence. But none of these characters is as memorable as Ignatius Reilly. Humbert Humbert has charmed and appalled me, Jem Finch has impressed me, and Napoleon the boar has somewhat offended my sense of justice. But none of these characters has had quite the effect of Ignatius Reilly. Indeed, I suspect I will continue to read throughout my life, hopefully eventually polishing off the works of Dickens (who, I understand, is quite the characteriser), and never encounter a character that is as superlative as Ignatius Reilly.Read the goddam book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Nothing quite falls flatter than failed comedy. I've read several critical reviews here that claimed that this book was hideously unfunny. Now I could not disagree more with that sentiment. I found this book to be brilliantly funny, as satire sometimes can be. Not funny in the same way an Adam Sandler movie wants to be, but more like a Twain or Vonnegut adventure, where the human condition is unceremoniously revealed to be comically grandiose in its own self-delusions.Once you get to know Ignatius and his pals, you'll be glad you stayed on for a bit. He remains one of the great characters of fictional literature. Many a writer could learn something from how carefully and completely he is deveolped throughout the book. I found it a joy to read, and I will soon read it again."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is my favorite book! I've read it numerous times and it never fails to make me laugh aloud. The main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, is unforgettable: his &quot;valve&quot;, piety, and visions of a canine while masturbating and various other appalling/hilarious peccadilloes will be forever committed to memory. John Kennedy Toole gives us a penetrative view of the world of the airy intellectual and the natives of downtown New Orleans. The book was published posthumously and my only sense of disappointment is that the author is not around to entertain us with more unique characters and tales.

I would like to add my reccomendation for how to read this book. A good friend of mine handed me &quot;Confederacy of Dunces&quot; while sitting beside me on a plane from Minneapolis to New Orleans. I was transported in more ways than one. If you ever thought about going to New Orleans, do it, and read this book before, during and/or after your trip. I found myself feeling as if I were a part of the story when I walked past the very music store Ignatius J. Reilly waits for his mother in front of in the first chapter of the book. I was able to bring the flavor of New Orleans home with me as I continued to read. We all can't jet off to New Orleans as often as we'd like, but &quot;Confederacy of Dunces&quot; can take us there in a style that hilarious doesn't even begin to describe. I only hope John Toole's spirit knows what a great gift he left us in this book. I look forward to curling up with my dog, &quot;Reilly&quot; and reading it again. If you're yearning for another good book, try &quot;Louisiana Power and Light.&quot; John Dufresne, while not John Toole, has a similar flair for story-telling, and he briefly makes reference to someone who could be Ignatius in the book"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"New Orleanian Ignatius J. Reilly is monstrously fat. The corners of his mouth sink \\"into little folds filled with dasaproval and potato chip crumbs\\". The reader can almost smell his stale odor wafting off the page. He's lazy, unbearably prudish and arrogant, a thirty something agoraphobic who lives at home with his mother and writes hilariously bad prose in the service of a pretend book on medeival and modern civilizations.He is shrill and dishonest, both selfish and self-deluded. And his mother insists that this hypochondriacal, gluttonous blob find himself a job. Most of the rest of the book is the story of Ignatius' trying to fit himself-a roundish amorphous peg-into a series of square occupational holes.The book's ongoing joke is that no one whom he meets in his series of adventures is much more appealing than he is. There is the seventy-ish Miss Trixie desperately trying to retire, Miss Trixie's masochistically inept boss at the decaying Levy Pants Company, We have the hysterically overdrawn Dorian Greene, Queen of the French Quarter and the mercenary Miss Lee, pornographer and tavern keeper.Ignatius' family is similarly creepy: Mom conspires to have him committed as insane and her coterie of friends conspire with her. Their world, and Ignatius' is in a constant state of decay which seems like a good stand-in for their personal and moral decayIt's become orthodox to say that Confederacy of Dunces is a \`comic masterpiece' and perhaps it is. I certainly laughed out loud half-a-dozen times. I suspect that later readings of this book will reveal a more fundamental tone of sad and desperate characters none of whom are in the least capable of love and who are therefore, not loveable themselves. This ain't a book you finish with a smile.The author, John Kennedy Toole committed suicide before the book was published and it's hard to read this novel without that as a subtext. Ignatius is a creature without a future, with nothing to look forward to and everything to be afraid of. There is a creepy sense that the author may have been depicting himself.If Tom Wolfe had decided to depict the pathetic rather than the ambitious or if Charles Dickens had more of an ear for souls destroyed by boredom, we might have a whole literature of Confederacies. As it is, we have Toole's and it remains worth a visit.--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE and the forthcoming novel bang-BANG from Kunati Books. ISBN 9781601640005"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius J. Reilly is a corpulent thirty-year-old who lives with his mother in New Orleans. He deems himself the intellectual master of nearly all those with whom he comes in contact. He has no job as the story commences, but is coerced into finding work by his fed-up mother. The zaniness that follows can only be appreciated first-hand, so further attempt at a depiction of the plot line is neither necessary nor actually possible.John Kennedy Toole demonstrates a touch of genius in this indescribable satire, a genius that never got a chance to flower, as he was already dead when this book was published. His social commentary, although almost always hilarious, carries an undercurrent of despair. The multiple sub-plots and the incredible cast of characters give this novel such a rich and layered texture that a re-reading (or two or three) is almost a must. Truly one of the most unique books I've ever read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Every once in a while, a highly touted book comes along that lives up to it's reputation. All of the praise on the cover and the inside pages, the flattering forward by Walker Percy, even the Pulitzer Prize, do not go far enough in paying homage to this rambling, raucous, comic explosion of a novel.The theme is summed up perfectly by the Jonathan Swift quote from which John Kennedy Toole found his title: &quot;When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.&quot; Ignatius J. Reilly, the fleshy 30 year old anti-hero protagonist is this genius, a giant of a man who helps us to see the absurdity of our times and the foolishness of our pursuits. In his misadventures, the highly educated but slothful Reilly propels himself through New Orleans, leaving a trail of havoc in his wake.This is the only book I've ever read that had me laughing uncontrollably. This is the kind of book that makes you miss your stop on the train. At the same time it is very sad, as all great books are. It is our loss that Toole committed suicide at the age of 32, before this epic tragicomedy was published and before he could add one or two more great novels to the American canon."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Every once in a while you happen upon a book by chance,only to discover later that here, in your hands, is awork worth more than you paid. A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCESis such a work.Through A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES, John Kennedy Toole hascreated one of the greatest tragic anti-heroes of our time.Ignatious J. Reilly is a character among characters, abeomouth of a man, a wit and a fibber beyond all, theoriginal slacker - one whose curious logic and outlook onthe world can only be compared to Don Quiote. Havinggraduated from college, Ignatious' main goal is to live outhis life in his tiny bedroom, away from society, writing passage after passage of brilliant verse for the very audience whose company he rejects. Ignatious despises all things, believing that the American Culture is thoroughly lacking in &quot;theology and geometry&quot; and that nothing short of a good lashing will save many a soul.A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES takes place a short time ago in the outskirts of New Orleans, where the city's true character is hidden from our tourist eyes, and yet the New Orleans of Toole could easily be Brooklyn or Los Angeles or Boston. In fact Toole's world is an utterly American experience, with accents and characters that spring to life and echo in your mind as the words flow beneath your eyes. Here we are presented with a literary &quot;Green Acres.&quot; And though the book introduces you to an assortment of individuals, Toole's mastery of dialogue keeps each one fresh in your mind, without the confusion or blandishment that other authors might show. Each character is just that, and no two could ever be confused. Along with Ignatious J. Reilly, we are presented with- Mrs. Reilly, a souse of a mother whose voice and patter will resonate in your mind- Officer Mancuso, a patrolman who is the embodiment of the Sad-Sackian cop- Jones, a self made victim of sorts whose wit and comebacks kept me laughing out loud- Myrna Minkoff, Ignatious' pseudo-ex-girlfriend and an activist who believes that through sex all problems can be solvedAnd yet with these and many more characters, it is the voice and the soul of Igatious who dominates this work. Reading it is to join him and his cast in one ill-begotten adventure after another.The novel begins with Igatious waiting for the return of his mother, who has set off to buy the very item which he needs the least of - cake. Officer Mancuso happens upon Igatious, and based on Igatious' sloven, beomouth appearance, he decides to question Ignatious, with the possible intent of arresting him, for officer Mancuso has been assigned the very demanding task of arresting any suspicious &quot;characters&quot; he might find. It is with this pretext that we begin a journey into what I can only describe as an immensely enjoyable read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES will make you literally laugh out loud, until your sides hurt. It's one of those books that you can read over and over again, and appreciate it anew all over again. This depth, the capacity for rereading and reinterpretation, makes it a true masterpiece of world literature, comparable only to Don Quixote, Shakespeare's Falstaff, Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel, and Joyce's Ulysses.The main character Ignatius J. Reilly is one of the supreme creations of the human imagination. He is obsessed with medieval culture and literature and interprets everything that happens in terms of Boethius's CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY and famous \\"wheel of fortune,\\" personified as the goddess Fortuna. He rages against Fortuna for taking him on a downward spiral, even when his fate is mostly the result of his own perverse actions. \\"With the breakdown of the Medieval system,\\" he writes in his Big Chief notebook, \\"the gods of Chaos, Lunacy, and Bad Taste gained ascendancy.\\" While he rages against the decadence of the modern world, he watches every new hollywood movie several times (criticizing it out loud in the theater) and stuffs himself with hot dogs, jelly doughnuts, and \\"Dr. Nut\\" soda.Igantius would be a medieval professor (and Toole based the character on an English professor he knew), but for his inability to leave New Orleans and adjust to any kind of normal job. He retells obsessively the story of one journey outside New Orleans on a Greyhound double-decker Scenicruiser as an apocalyptic journey into the \\"heart of darkness,\\" culminating in the nefarious theft of his wool plaid lumber jacket from the bathroom of the college where he was interviewing for a teaching job.His \\"girlfriend\\" is a Jewish liberal from New York, Myrna, who believes that sex is the answer to all problems everywhere, especially for minorities! while Ignatius finds sex repelling, preferring the comfort of his self-love.In the novel, Ignatius comes up against a hilarious selection of characters that could only exist in the New Orleans of the early 60's. Jones, a black man forced to work for below minimum wage at the Night of Joy bar, is really just as funny as Ignatius. Told by his boss to hail customers from the sidewalk, he goes outside and calls, \\"Whoa! Come in, see Mis Harla O'Horror dancin with her pet. Guarantee one hunner percent real plantation dancin. Every mother------- drink got a guarantee knockout drop. Whoa! Everybody guarantee to catch them some clap off they glass. Hey! . . . Night of Joy got genuine color people workin below minimum wage. Whoa! Guarantee plantation atmosphere, got cotton growin right on the stage right in front of your eyeball, got a civil right worker getting his --- beat up between show. Hey!\\"One of the great novels of the 20th century, right up there with Faulkner, Joyce, and Ellison."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"There were 519 other reviews posted before I wrote this one here, and in those you will find all you need to know about the author, the lead character Ignatius, and the setting in 1960s New Orleans. Having just finished reading it, I'll try instead to discuss the reasons why I found this book one of the most enjoyable I've ever read (and I read a lot!).First, it's funny, very very funny. The writing has a sharp sarcastic wit to it, and the author weaves his take on the human condition expertly through the plot scenes, and makes great use of his characters' dialog and actions.Secondly, all of the characters are very well-developed, and it's quite easy to see them, to hear them, and to get a good feel for what their inner motivations are---no small feat since there are several characters sharing the stage with Ignatius throughout the book.Also, the plotline is actually several storylines moving forward simultaneously towards a single converging point at the book's climax. Each of the lesser characters' futures has a stake in the future of Ignatius (the lead) as the book careens to its finish line. The bringing together of all these separate agendas was masterfully done. I disagree with the previous reviewer's opinion that the ending wasn't up to snuff. I was happy to see that the book ended the way I wanted it to, given my 400+ page investment up to that point.A rich delightful book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I just want to say that, as all you can see in this reviewing site, if you look at all the rankings, there are a lot of possibilities you are goning to love this work. I can assure you that all of the people that not liked this work, are the kind of people that didn't like the Quixote or Ulysses.So, they have to hate it because they didn't get it, and have to hate the people that got the point of this book.It is about the Odyssey of a fighter against our absurd world.I think all the people that hate the book because of their mental poverty, are the Dunces still confederating against Toole, like we know the dunces confederated against him through his attempts to publish his book during his final years.

Basically Ignatius J Reilly is a lazy eccentric who is forced to get a job leading to a series of adventures involving many Characters.Thoughts: I was excited to read this because it's one of my dad's favorite books and he's recommended it to me before. While I can appreciate its strong points, I don't think it's one of my favorites. For one thing, I prefer a main character I love and would want to hang out with. Ignatius Reilly had many interesting characteristics but I would never want to meet him. On the one hand, he's obsessed with the Middle Ages and thinks things would be better with an enlightened monarchy (I'm not saying he's wrong what with the way things are...) He is very educated with a graduate degree and he speaks far beyond the comprehension of the people around, which is very funny to read. On the other hand, he lies, he's selfish, and he's cruel to his mama among other offenses. So not someone I'd want to meet but someone who is a Character.My favorite part of the book was how the disparate characters and earlier events tied together-I mean it's perfect. It's not like crazy coincidences as Dickens does but instances that logically follow the previous events. The part I didn't like was how intensely awkward some scenes were for me to read. I could not have read this book all in one go because I had to take breaks and distance myself from what was happening.It's been defined as a picaresque novel which I always associate with Don Quixote. It's been a while since I've read that but I remember some of the occurrences escalating in a similar way so I can see it. For example, Ignatius has a simple office job before he decides that he will organize the workers at a factory which almost leads to a riot. It's amazing.Overall: Intensely awkward at times, very funny at times with the perfect ending.Cover: I found this cover weird at first but it actually makes perfect sense after reading the book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The prototype for a Napoleon Dynamite storyline that goes nowhere with middle-ish characters that will make you laugh out loud at their glimpses of unintentional hilarity.This is a great read, especially if you are a fan of New Orleans as I am!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is more depressing than hilarious, but definitely a worthwhile read.

Coming across recently and downloaded it to my Kindle to read again. I think I enjoyed even more this time not so much for the comedy but for the wonderful absurdity of Toole's characters and his imaginative and descriptive writing. I wonder what else he might have gone on to write if he hadn't tragically chosen to end his own life.P. Sullivan"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole is a hard book to describe. It follows the antics and adventures of one Ignatius J. Reilly. I saw this book described as a \\"tragicomic\\" and I think that label fits well. I found the book to be entertaining with a few laugh out loud moments. However, most of the humor tends to be dark. This novel is also a colorful look into the world of New Orleans.Our hero is an overweight, overbearing, intelligent, lazy, philosopher-slob named Ignatius J. Reilly. He lives with his mother who caters to his every whim. She eventually forces him to get a job and this novel follows him and those he leaves in his wake during his employment escapades.More often than not I found Ignatius to be obnoxious in his endeavors to change the world. He is highly intelligent but has no people skills. In the end, I had changed my opinion a few times as the story came full circle. Most of the characters were cartoonish to me. There are many characters in this book but they all play a part eventually.There is a lot say about this book and there are many layers to it. It's part funny and part vulgar, it's funny and sad, it's about people and life in New Orleans. I'm no expert but I'd say that Toole is a master when it comes to dialogue. I'm sure I didn't get all the themes and undercurrents but it was a great read and a wonderful book for discussion."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"One of the best books to read. It captures the culture, the insanity and pure innocence of a not so tortured soul. It is not heavy reading but it grips you. I have now read it five times. This was a book purchased for my doctor!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Set in early \`60's New Orleans. The protagonist Ignatius Reilly is an educated nut who lives with his imbecile, muscatel addled mother. The story is eccentric. But what's fabulous about the book is the dialog. It's hysterical. Every line is a rich nugget of invective or stupidity. And every character is an idiot in one way or another. Ignatius is a lunatic, but wildly clever in how he expresses his universal misanthropic disdain and contempt. I read some of the insults over and over for laughs.P.S. Shame about the author though..."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This was one of the best novels I've read in a long time. It deserves a place next to Catch-22. I laughed out loud many times reading this book. If someone complains that they don't like the protagonist, they simply don't get it. He's a turd; you're not supposed to like him. That being said, it does take a slightly warped sense of humor to appreciate this book. I just wish the author hadn't killed himself, thus depriving us of a potentially great body of literature. They definitely don't just give away Pulitzers."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I can't help but be a wee bit biased about this strangely delightful read. It's been about 25 years since I first took hold of this novel and recently, I just had to re-read. The results are in: this book is just as much fun as it was for me the first go 'round. As a native New Orleanean, I have an especial fondness for this classic comedy farce. The characters so typify the quirkiness that gives New Orleans its distinctiveness and maybe that's why some people just don't get it. However, I do feel that the comedy here is of a high order--if you don't laugh, truly, there has to be something wrong with you. Comedy reads that are this good are so rare--I rank this as one of my all time faves.Comment | Permalink"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"\\"A Confederacy of Dunces,\\" John Kennedy Toole's masterpiece, takes its title from a quote of Jonathon Swift's: \\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.\\" And so we are introduced to the irrepressible Ignatius J. Reilly, a corpulent behemoth of a man-child living in New Orleans with his long-suffering mother. Ignatius is an oddity of a character: a morbidly obese slob, a lazy intellectual with delusions of grandeur, a hypochondriac constantly worried about the state of his 'valve', an argumentative buffoon in many ways and a damaged genius in others. It's not easy to take to Ignatius for all of these reasons -- which is fair, and I suppose that it is his oddities that make so many reviewers not take him seriously, but I would implore them to look past the facade. There is so much more to Ignatius if you look at the core of his being and try to understand why he is the way he is. Clearly, he is suffering from depression, and his arrogance and laziness are his method of pushing the world away. He wants to be a writer and esteemed intellectual, to bring back the \\"theology and geometry\\" that he thinks the world is sorely lacking, but instead of trying to get published he sends a dirty writing tablet filled with his writings to Tulane University with the expectation that they will file it in their library -- as if goading them into rejecting him as a lunatic. Whenever his mother presses him to get a job and make something of his life he is overcome by panic, and inevitably starts complaining that his precious valve is acting up. He clearly resents his living situation and wants to get out of New Orleans (a city he describes as \\"famous for its gamblers, prostitutes, exhibitionists, anti-Christs, alcoholics, sodomites ...\\" and, well, you get the point), but he blames fate -- specifically the Goddess Fortuna -- for keeping him chained there, as if he had no say in the matter. Ignatius J. Reilly is a man trapped in a vacuum of his own making, and the tragedy of it all is that it's unclear whether or not he will ever escape himself. The fact that the author, John Kennedy Toole, committed suicide before the book was even published makes this even more poignant. Blessed with an equally eccentric cast of supporting characters including Santa Battaglia, Myrna Minkoff (a woman Ignatius ostensiby despises but can't seem to let go of), and Angelo Mancuso, a police officer reduced to wearing ridiculous disguises when he is told to watch for 'suspicious characters' by his sergeant in order to make a big arrest, \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is a novel that seems cartoonish at first glance, but is stunningly brilliant if you just look closer."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I absolutely loved and completely enjoyed this book. If you've heard that this book is funny, it isn't one of those laugh-a-minute books peppered with lame jokes that we've read a dozen times over in other books or heard on televisions' saddest sitcoms. In fact, its a completely different brand of humour. 'This book sure can make me laugh.' For instance, one particular description of our unlikely hero sitting on a stool and looking like a brinjal balanced on a thumbtack made me burst out laughing whilst lining up for the bus. But one cannot attribute all the laughs to Ignatius, but share it amongst every single one of the supporting cast. Not a single word written by John Kennedy Toole was out of place. His juxtaposing of choice words describing the plights in which Ignatius got himself into were works of brilliance. It really is a pity that we will never be able to indulge ourselves in similarly wonderful books again. We have lost a literary genius who managed to convey not just humour, but a deeper meaning concerning human behaviour and thought in his writing. And to think I just picked this book randomly off a shelf."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Hilarious, poignant, sad, descriptive, beautifully written -- a work only a dunce could not find funny or touching. O'Toole's words and gift for characterization lift this marvelous book into the strata of great American novels like Huckleberry Finn and Catch-22. Ignatius J. Reilly is an obese, arrogant shut-in who launches verbal assaults at everyone and everything that offends his &quot;world view.&quot; He finds plenty to criticize, and the scenes of him spewing articulate venom at misguided hot-dog buyers and others are small masterpieces. Another scene, of Ignatius trying to incite pant factory workers to strike (the stained sheet with Ignatius's handwritten strike message is pure genius) is worth the price of admission alone. For those who think that following the saga of a sad, poor, overweight loner is too depressing to be funny, think again. Such is O'Toole's writing prowess and gift for dialect that scene after scene delivers gusto humor entwined with tragic undercurrents. And, unlike O'Toole's own life, Ignatius's seems to turn out okay. The book's ending shows us that O'Toole had great affection for his ornery, chronically dispeptic creation. A great book indeed."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Four years ago, my secretary said to me, &quot;Ignatius and you would have been friends.&quot; I had no idea what he meant. He told me to buy this book. I did, that day. I read it all night long. And when I finished late the next morning, I turned back to the first page and read it again. Today, I started reading it for the third time. And I have to say, I find it even more astonishing than ever. If you've read it once (or twice) I can tell you from my personal experience, you can read it again and still find yourself stunned by the brilliance of this novel. At the end of the book, I am always left with this dark sadness. A sadness that the writer, who attempted to get the book published, never knew that thirty years after his death by his own hand, his &quot;unpublished failure&quot; would be, at this writing, #543 on Amazon, nearly twenty years after winning the Pulitzer prize for literature. He never knew the internet, let alone Amazon. I can't help but wonder what he would think if he could see what happened to those 400 some-odd pages he left in his dresser drawer for his mother to find. There's a message here. A message to people who face rejection at first, and then again and again. And that message is that you never know what is around the next corner. Suicide is a bad choice. No matter how hopeless things look. Certainly, part of the interest in this book is because of this very fact; that the author killed himself before knowing how famous the reason he killed himself ever became. But the true brilliance of this book is in black and white, on the page. Page after page. Certainly there are people who don't like or &quot;get&quot; this book. But personally, I wouldn't want to live next door to them."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"More than a decade ago, I checked out maybe two to three audiobook titles every week from my local library, daring myself to make it through the large metro library's full colllection. I made it through 300 or 400 great and no-so-great works. This title? Easily my favorite among all those audiobooks. I knew \\"Dunces\\" was high on many people's lists of favorite books. But folks, you'll be hard pressed to find a more entertaining listen than hearing Arte Johnson -- sketch comic from the Laugh-In series of the 70s -- personify so many loony characters with such devastating accuracy and admirable restraint. I remember having to pull my car over several times to regain composure from laughing. That never happened since. Get the Arte Johnson abridged audiocassette version -- SO worth the trouble."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The words often found between the torn and tattered pages of waterlogged books are seldom those of pure brilliance, and not pure as in real, but pure as in straight from the depths of the earth spring water pure. In John Kennedy Toole's Confederacy of Dunces, pure brilliance cannot describe the literature present. Artistic views and ideals flow from the pages like a waterfall, sticking in the depths of the readers' brain, forever more, till death do you part.Brilliance is proclaimed in the first paragraph of the first page, with the eloquent and detailed description of the main character.\\" A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indication two directions at once. Full pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs. In the shadow under the green visor of the cap Ignatius J. Reilly's supercilious blue and yellow eyes looked down upon the other people waiting under the clock at the D. H. Holmes department store, studying the crowd of people for signs of bad taste in dress.\\"It is inconceivable that anyone would not want to read this book. A modern day Don Quixote, Ignatius proclaims his fame early in the book, making a scene regardless of his actual actions. He is accused of being a \`vagrant' by an Officer Mancuso, and after an on foot chase scene through the streets of the French Quarter, New Orleans, Ignatius' mother, a blatant alcoholic, hurdles her car into the side of a building after a little too much of grandpa's old cough medicine, and sends Ignatius out onto the street.How a person like Ignatius could ever survive in the world today is by all means, implausible. He appears to have a knack for finding just the wrong place to be at just the right time. He is a failure at alphabetizing anything, and could never sell any kind of food if his life depended on it, because regardless of how bloated he becomes, he seems to never stop eating. He somehow finds his way to a strictly gay party, attempts a speech, is hurled into the street, and becomes the mantle piece of an illegal-deal crack down. How one person, especially someone such as this, could ever get themselves into these kinds of situations is most likely the only unbelievable part of this book.But the brilliance is not in Ignatius, although he pertains to be the smartest character in the book. The driving forces behind this book are the supporting characters. Many books today have main characters that develop throughout the book, also known as a round character. In these books, the supporting characters are the ones that always stay the same, a flat character. Toole had the audacity to flip the system, and play with it. Ignatius J. Reilly on page 394 is the same Ignatius J. Reilly as the one on page 1, aside from a few more bruises, physically and mentally. Mrs. Trixie, Mrs. Reilly, Mr. Levy, Mrs. Levy, Officer Mancuso, and Gonzalez all become different people, because of Ignatius. This talented and artistic style of writing is sure to bring about new and creative styles that no one will be able to resist."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A couple of chapters into Confederacy, I was unsure if the book was pure genius or complete trash. Ignatius Reilly is so incredibly irritating. Imagine George Costanza, only several times more intelligent, political, fatter and self-absorbed. And much less likeable.Even half way through, I wasn't sure if I loved it or hated it - probably both. I'm not sure why I kept reading. Schadenfreude is the most likely reason - it's almost like watching a really bad accident in progress.In the end though, I thought it was brilliant, although I can understand those who hate it - there's a very fine line with this kind of work. It's a biting, dark satire, not funny in a laugh out loud kind of way (though there are a couple of moments,) but in an ironic, wicked way. New Orleans and the characters that inhabit its streets are wonderfully rendered, providing a great backdrop and foil for Ignatius. Pick up this book and keep at it - it's worth it, even if you hate it in the end."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I can't decide whether this is a comedy or a tragedy. The array of characters and human foibles is simply amazing. It is hilarious and appalling, vulgar and sublime - it's simultaneously one of the few books that actually makes me laugh out loud, while there are also parts that are so exasperating I have to stop reading and come back to the book later on.There is no other book out there that is quite like this one, and so I advise: it should be experienced at least once. At least start it, even if you can't finish it - because the spectacular dissolution of Ignatius and his bizarre plots for achieving greatness really do start to wear you down, eventually - which in my opinion is also part of the book's brilliance."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"After hearing about this book for almost half my life, I was excited to find the audio book version at my local library. This is my review of the audio book version.The voice actor does a good job of differentiating the characters, making it fairly easy to follow the story and understand who's talking. The book is populated with a myriad of colorful characters, most of whom are reduced to fairly exagerrated caricatures by the author. While entertaining in the early going, some of them begin to grate on you after a while.The dialogue is as colorful as the characters, with a lot of vernacular that is specific to a certain era in New Orleans. While this grabs your interest and pulls you into the story, I found that the cartoonishness of the characters and their over-the-top dialogue started to lose its appeal by the halfway point. Towards the end, I had grown weary of the entire cast and couldn't wait for the long-awaited (and woefully unsatisfying) end to come.The main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, is a self-centered buffoon who clearly has some emotional and/or mental problems. I imagine that Reilly is the alter-ego of the author (John Kennedy Toole), who had his own emotional/mental problems (and ultimately committed suicide before this book was ever published). There are many parallels between the author and his creation, so the conclusion is easy to draw.While Toole does have a certain way with words and his vivid descriptions are often admirable, he clearly lacks any sense of how to effectively plot a story. Instead, he rambles along in an almost stream-of-consciousness fashion, blissfully unaware that flowery dialogue and off-beat characters do not a story make.What I find most distressing is that this book won a Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Had the book not gotten published through such a dramatic series of circumstances I highly doubt it would have won any literary prize, let alone a Pulitzer. The competition must have been very weak that year indeed.It's particularly telling that when the author originally attempted to get this book published, the publisher ultimately turned it down because \\"it's not really about anything.\\" And frankly, they were right.While I did find the book humorous in several places, even laugh-out-loud funny at times, I must admit that overall I was fairly disappointed. The book simply did not live up to my expectations (and no, my expectations were not unusually high). However, I do tend to enjoy stories with a plot that actually go somewhere and have a point that makes it worth my while. This book is like cotton candy: you may think it's tasty and sweet while you're eating it, but ultimately it never fills you up no matter how much of it you indulge in. In the end, it just leaves you even hungrier than you were when you started. Substantial it is not.If you enjoy extremely offbeat stories full of surreal characters spouting pompous dialogue as they stumble their way aimlessly through farcical circumstances, then this book is right up your alley. Just don't look for a plot, because you won't find one here."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I read this book when it was first released in the late 1970's. It was recommended to me by my father, an avid reader and bibliophile. I was only 18 years old, but this wonderous novel had the same impact as CATCH 22 or RAGTIME did for me. I knew this book would be with me my whole life, and that I would return to it time and again. I have since read it four times, and I just finished it again late this evening. Instead of sleeping I decided to write some slender memories: seeing John Kennedy Toole's mother on THE TOM SNYDER SHOW in the early 1980's had a profound impact on me. When she told of her son's struggles and difficulties getting this work published, prior to taking his own life at a criminally young age, I realized that it is one of life's great mysteries how so many publishers passed on this book. It was only at the urging of Walker Percy that the LSU press first published this masterpiece. Being blind to genius is a universal privilege, after all!On my fifth complete reading I still laughed as Ignatius rolls his hot dog cart down the street with the sign \\"12 Inches of Paradise\\" handwritten on the side. And I was once again felt melancholic when I finished this book, because I will never be able to read another novel by this misunderstood literary genius. Ah Fortuna, what a cruel vixen you are......."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is that rare book that lives up to its cult status on every grotesque page. From the first line to the last, this breathless tour de force weaves an intricate story that never ceases to satisfy and delight. Ignatius, his mother, and the other dozen or more characters at the center of the book are so fully-formed and human that their outrageous behavior and exasperation at life seem so fresh and real that it feels like it's happening to you. Even if you're one of those well-read brainiacs who's grown weary of &quot;must-read&quot; suggestions from us amateurs, do yourself a favor and discover the day that Ignatius emerges from his home to buy a new string for his lute.

Reilly standing in front of the D.H. Holmes on Canal wearing a green cap, plaid shirt, and tweed trousers, some people just insist on being different. If you found this a dull, lifeless novel, you ARE different...and just plain weird! Perhaps a visit to your nearest &quot;sense of humor&quot; outlet store wouldn't be a bad idea.This was probably the funniest novel a have read in my entire life. If I could have, I would have given it an eleven!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius J. Reilly is a memorable character, from the twitching vibrassae of his nostrils when exposed to Paradise Hot Dogs, to his large paws and quirky valve, and don't forget his unusually large sense of entitlement. Oh My God! you won't easily forget him or his green hunting cap wandering around N'Orleans.The problem is exposition: the author rarely moves events quickly, and Ignatius gets caught up in writing pages of \\"A Working Boy\\" that are literally pages as paragraphs, glazing the reader's eyes. His mother is shrewish, his girlfriend absent, and the other people around Ignatius are as dysfunctional as him in various ways.I think the book only garnered a Pulitzer because the author was already dead. I admit to enjoying about 50 pages of truly ridiculous antics, but the rest of this 400 page softcover was a great slog though pseudo-morality and vitriolic diatribes, not to mention the accents on several characters. I'm not sure what purpose the book served other than a study of characters in desolation (a vibe I don't enjoy), but it certainly was not 'hilarious'. Also, I wanted to read about Igatius's wedding with Myrna... it seemed those two deserved each other, but the book ended without it.Ah well, I still smile a little at Igantius demanding another Dr. Nut while bedeviling his drunkard of a mother. I think I'd have enjoyed the story more if the author concentrated on only one ridiculous character instead of writing a confederacy of them. Three stars because I don't believe I'll ever want to slog through this again, and I didn't enjoy the diatribes or accents."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Like Walker Percy at first I wondered what on earth I was reading. This won the Pulitzer?! Then, without warning it seemed, I was swept down the rabbit hole into a foreign land peopled with characters so quirky and at the same time believeable that I felt I knew them. Most of the read I felt incredulous. I had a hard time really laughing as the undertone of saddness and despair was always there for me. I ached for Ignatious, his mother, Jones, and all of the other finely drawn characters. The writing is superb. New Orleans back streets and French Quarter, St. Charles Avenue. I could see them all as they were vividly described. I will read this book again and again - for the language and for the author's ability to take me with him inside his world. Bettie Banks"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is my favorite book. I first read it while travelling by train, and the passengers were so annoyed by my constant giggling that they shooed me out of the coach. I had to finish it on the dining coach.My favorite character is Ignatius; however, I also love Irene, Miss Trixie, Miss Annie, Santa Battaglia,and even the stupid Mancuso. All of them are unbelievable funny in their stubbornness, foolishness, egotism, and absurdity.Ignatius is a hopeless case, but who isn't? Whether people admit it or not, eveybody is somehow a hopeless case. Believing otherwise is delusion. The only purpose of life is to ackowledge that we, as a species, are a tumor, a blob of thick and sticky self-righteousness deserving of somebody as crazy and lucid as Ignatius who manages to prick holes in our blob. That is why he is an inspiring character. He is here to rub salt in our wounds. He teaches us that there is no limits to our delusion. We only have to look around us: everybody lies and cheats in order to accomplish his goals, and at the same time everyone wants to convince himself that he is right, that he is a wonderful human being. That is why motivational speakers are so successful and inspirational literature sells so well. Nonsense! If people were lucid enough, they would recognize that they have only two choices: stop breathing altogether or laugh at themselves and at their shortcomings and stop taking themselves so seriously.My favorite paragraph of the book appears almost at the end of the second chapter: \\"When Fortuna spins you downward, go out to a movie and get more out of life. Ignatius was about to say this to himself; then he remembered that he went to the movies almost every night, no matter which way Fortuna was spinning.\\"That is exactly what humans do, even though they fail to acknowledge it. Nonetheless, Ignatius has something, a kind of candor and idealism that most of people nowadays lack: he believes that the Middle Ages was a better time, and even though deep down inside we know that he is intelligent enough to recognize that this idea is misguided, in his madness he behaves as the champion of that cause. And that is what saves him from vulgarity."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is an incredibly funny and intelligent book. I initially borrowed it from the library, but ended up buying copies for friends. Next, I will have to get one for myself. It is a read you will want to read again and again. A Pulitzer Prize winner."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The story in A Confederacy of Dunces revolves around Ignatius J. Reilly, a hypochondriac former grad student living in New Orleans with an obsession with modern culture and the Middle Ages. The book made its way to press by Toole's mother sending it to Walker Percy (author of The Moviegoer) with a request that he read her late son's work; sadly, Toole committed suicide a couple of years earlier.Most of the book concerns the utterly unemployable Reilly's attempts to join the working world. As you can imagine, hijinks ensue, but everyone is different for having made Reilly's acquaintance. The conclusion of the book is both completely fulfilling and, considering the weirdness of many of the characters, surprisingly hopeful.The bottom line: A Confederacy of Dunces is a great novel; parts of it made me laugh out loud, which is something of a rarity these days. And it's not funny in a conceited, \\"look how smart I am that I get the in-jokes\\" kind of way; it's just a great story about the kind of person every English major in the world is one quirk away from becoming. It's the classic tale of a person over-educated and sent into the world armed and dangerous.A Confederacy of Dunces is readable, funny, and has something to say about the human condition. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces may be the funniest novel I've ever read. The only competition that I can think of (The Sot-Weed Factor by John Barth, Cat's Cradle by Vonnegut, or The Crying of Lot 49 by Pynchon) pale in comparison. At the novel's heart is the grossly overweight, highly opinionated and deliriously deluded Ignatius J. Reilly. You will not find a more unique and hilarious character in all of literature. Thoroughly sickened by the lack of medieval values in the post-Enlightenment world, Ignatius is determined to live out his life in the comforting cloister of his mother's home, spending his days scribbling an elaborate protest against the modern world. That is, until a bizarre series of circumstances forces him out into the world where he must use his Masters-degree education to, gasp, finally get a job!As the story progresses (and the plot becomes more and more wildly improbable), a number of gut-busting hilarious scenes ensue. Stand-outs for me were Ignatius' \\"Crusade for Moorish Dignity\\" complete with an impromptu jazz dance among bewildered factory workers, his disgraceful job as a pirate hot dog vendor (complete with the tantalizing advertisement \\"Twelve (12) inches of Paradise\\"), and his short-lived obsession with a Boethius-reading pornographer. Among Ignatius' more memorable quotes are lines like \\"Everyone has a valve!\\" and \\"Oh Fortuna, you degenerate wanton!\\"What keeps Confederacy from being perfect is the elaborate cast of side characters, some wickedly funny, others dreadfully obnoxious, that interrupt the tale of Ignatius' exile in the outside world. While characters like Patrolman Mancuso and Burma Jones are likable and funny, they are given a few too many pages and not quite enough to do. At times, during the middle section of the novel, it feels like the events aren't really progressing anywhere. But be patient: the incredible payoff of the ending (which neatly ties up just about every random plot string from earlier chapters) is hilarious, heart-warming, and more than worth the journey."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"When I read the words \\"hunting cap,\\" I thought of Holden Caulfield, and that is what Ignatius Riley reminds me of. Ignatius is a keen observer of human life, and spares no words in voicing his literate opinion on everything. Everyone's got to listen, because like Holden, Ignatius is so smart he's got to be right about everything. Perhaps Ignatius is really Holden as a 30-year-old?The star (or shall I say \\"ignored genius\\") of the story is Ignatius Riley; thirty years old, obese, gluttonous, messy, lazy, and with ten years of college under his belt (though it's not clear if he ever graduated). Now he's back at his mother's ramshackle house in New Orleans, lounging in his (filthy) room in his (filthy) nightshirt, writing endless raving on paper tablets. When he's not stinking up his room, he's wandering around 1960's New Orleans in his hunting cap, shouting his opinions on everything and making a nuisance of himself. Ignatius is a mad raving lunatic, but quite and amusing one.What struck me as Ignatius' most marked characteristic is his habit of taking a job and ruining his employer, despite the fact that he's able to do well at work. He persuades his boss to let him come late to work every day, organizes the workers to hold a strike, then messes it all up at the end. He takes a job selling hot dogs, and then nearly ruins the entire business by eating them himself. May I add that by the end of the novel, his weight is ballooning to mega-proportions?Confederacy of Dunces is a good title for the book. Ignatius is the type of person who's so convinced of his abilities that he regards everyone else as a fool. He's a lot like Holden Caulfield in that he's smart, but not practical. But while Holden had rich parents in Manhattan who subsidized his habits, Ignatius Riley has only his mother, living in poverty in New Orleans, with barely enough money to keep herself going. And did I say she spent her mother's life insurance policy sending her son to college for ten years? Did he do anything to repay her? Of course not! But then again, it's not easy for a genius like Ignatius Riley, especially when the people around him are nothing but a \\"Confederacy of Dunces.\\""},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"In light of Hurricane Katrina and its devastating effect on New Orleans, I am going to re-read this exceptional book. I wonder if the tears that will stream down my face from all the laughter will now include tears of sorrow for a beloved city."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"One of the funniest books ever written.The author, unfortunately, committed suicide after failing to sell the book. It was sold by his mother, after his death, and won a Pulitzer. The story behind the book is almost as good as the book itself.In any case, it is a comic masterpiece. It includes some of the most original characters in literature, involved in situations which should (if you posess any sense of humor whatsoever) have you laughing aloud many, many times.I envy you, if you have not read this book yet, but are about to do so. You are about to discover a tremendous joy."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"At some point in his masterpiece \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\", writer John Kennedy Toole quotes Macaulay who says that \\"a great writer is the friend and benefactor of his readers\\". Having that in mind, Toole is such a great writer that he should be the best friend of his readers. It is virtually impossible to write about this novel without talking about its writers sad destiny. Toole never saw his work published, and like Walker Percy says in the famous introduction it is a pitty that its creator is not alive to see the success of his writing.\\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" has one of the most important and memorable characters of North American literature. Flat and flatulent Ignatius J. Reilly in an unforgettable creation. So are his companions --like his mother, Officer Mancuso, Darlene, Santa Bataglia and Jones, to name a few.This book is the kind love-or-hate novel -- there is no in between. Either the reader starts laughing from page one and love it, or he/she finds it bore from the beginning and put it down. Those who embark on Toole's journey will be only pleased to find more laughs until the end of the book.Toole has a special awareness for dialogues. Much of the narrative moves through its characters lips. There are, of course, descriptions, digressions and all devices used in literature, but as a matter of fact, it is the dialogue that keeps the narrative going. And if the writer didn't have a special talent for it, the book would be a mess. The conversations are sharp, funny and witty.On the other pole are Ignatius's text from a book he's been writing. His texts can be at the same time funny, weird and tender. If at one point we think his ideas are far-fetched, we can't deny there is much truth behind many things he says. And he was living in the early sixties. Probably Ignatius wouldn't survive to the end of century, to the vulgarization of culture etc.With \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" we laugh of our own intellectual misery. This was the best advice he could have given us. Ignatius is weird, but there is a little of him inside of everyone, and that's not a bad thing.Toole suffered from the same malady that he uses in his epigraph from a Jonathan Swift's essay that goes like every time a true genius appears, dunces are all in confederacy against him. The prove that this writer was a genius is that he never got his book published -- indeed, dunces were trying to sabotage him."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This has to be the most entertaining book I have ever read. It is a pure comic masterpiece. I could not stop smiling as I read this wonderfully entertaining story. Reading it, I had a visual in my head of our hero - and it is the Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons. Same slothy appearance, and the same speech style. Think about that when you read the book.As far as the story goes - as I said, you will laugh a lot. I have never laughed when reading a novel before. I did then. If you are like me, and are sick of every book being about cops and lawyers and killers, then this is the book for you. The best part of the book is our \\"hero's\\" letters to and from his \\"lost love\\".Do yourself a favor and read this book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Confederacy of Dunces is satire on a highly sophisticated level. Yes it's hilarious at times, mainly due to the contrast between the twisted genius of Ignatius Reilly, a character incredibly well developed, and the rest of the less developed ones in the book. It's possible to look behind the satire to see some important serious messages also.The new biography, Ignatius Rising, gives some insight into Ken Toole's mind and where he got all the stuff for the book. Though the main inspiration for Ignatius seems to be a Medievalist professor Toole knew, a lot more autobiography seeps into the character than perhaps his creator was conscious of. Ignatius's main motivation--to expose the flaws of the 20th century--is too well developed not to have come directly from Ken Toole's worldview, even if cloaked in Fortuna and Boethius references. By the way I happen to agree in general with Ignatius's critique of the 20th century.His war of wits with Myrna makes for some interesting political thoughts of the time....and politics really haven't changed at all since then. The book is not flawless, in particular the 2nd half seems to be somewhat redundant after the 1st half. The characters aside from Ignatius are relatively undeveloped. Was Gottlieb at Simon and Schuster justified in eventually rejecting the book? But this brilliant creation was the product of a brilliant creator. I hope the eventual movie does the book justice."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"To respond to some of the less than enthusiastic responses to this novel, to each his own. But it is very difficult to understand how anyone can read this masterpiece and not laugh out loud. It is that funny. No book before or since has been able to capture the dialogue and situations that Toole did. It is a shame he took his own life, but he left behind some of the best writings in American history. Im very serious. This is a comic masterpiece is every way."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"To read this book is to see the world through the eyes of Ignatius J. Reilly. To see the world through the eyes of Ignatius J. Reilly is to strip nude and plaster yourself with maggots, do cartwheels through the streets, watch as everyone reels in horror, and then declare that they are simply jealous of your refined culture. Seriously, I think Toole expressed a lot of perceptive insight about human nature, and sad as though much of it may be, he expressed it in a very humorous way. Not to mention that after reading this, you will feel much better about yourself, because you will realize that, although they may have been just book characters, there have in history been some individuals with less dignity than you."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The best thing about Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces, is its protagonist and the worse thing about the book is every scene he is not in. Ignatius Reilly is an ingenuous literary creation who is extremely entertaining in his day-to-day bumbling adventures. Part sloth, part eccentric prude, he is all laughs as a 30 year old purveyor of haughty perceptions that form from his particularly close minded \\"worldview\\". The way he interacts with the local denizens is consistently funny and the characters of New Orleans's French Quarter provide a contrasting opinion to Ignatius' perceived reality. We observe Ignatius as he works (and gets fired) from a pants factory, to working as a hot dog vendor (eating more than he sells) meanwhile having to deal with his fed up mother (with whom he still lives) and corresponding with the polar opposite and sexually adventurous Myrna Minkoff (some of the funniest sections in the book.)Unfortunately the rest of the book didn't do it for me. There are various other plot lines and characters that hardly involve Ignatius and they just weren't interesting to me at all. Ignatius steals the book completely and although they might have been necessary for plot reasons, I had to force myself through them, often looking ahead to see how much longer they were. Toole really hit gold with Ignatius and everyone else seemed boring in comparison and it really hurt my overall impression of the book.It's also worth taking a look at the forward and learning a bit about the author and the story of the manuscript. Apparently Toole's mother brought in novel to a publisher after her son's suicide in his early 30's. Also Toole had the same occupations as Ignatius so I wonder how autobiographical his protagonist was.This book has earned a cult following since its publication and rave reviews by many. This book earned Toole posthumous win of the Pulitzer for fiction in 1981. This book is appropriate for older high school kids and up as it does contain explicit sexual innuendoes and some racial themes.Bottom Line: An entertaining book that is plagued by catastrophic unevenness. I actually recommend trying it out to page 100 (1/4 of the book) and going from there."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I came across this book by randomly discovering its author on amiannoying dot com. I read some reviews and saw that the consensus was that it was an outlandishly hilarious book, so I decided I must read it. The premise is, the life and times of this guy named Ignatius Riley, set in and around the French Quarter (N'awlins, that is). I don't know how many pages I read while asking myself the question, \\"so when does it get funny?\\" Obviously, what I think passes for humor and what other reviewers of this book think passes for humor is not the same, and I respect that and am ok with that.Once I got over the shock of him and his antics, and once I gave my own \\"world view\\" a slight adjustment, I started to see and appreciate the humor, and Ignatius became a rather laughable character (in addition to the pathetically sad commentary on the human race he started out to be).As for the quality of writing, I thought this was excellently written. That this author wrote only one book is incredible, \\"what might have been.....\\" My understanding is, it was published post-mortem, after his mother worked hard and eventually persuaded someone to read it. The same story from someone else's pen might never have seen the light of day."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Where do I start - where do I end ...... it's mesmerizing, it's the best book I have read after \\"100 years of solitude\\". The book was lying in my self for six months and I was little intimidated by the number of pages but once I started reading it, there was no stopping. I have asked myself the question.......have I read anything funnier - the answer is probably not. I promise \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" will change your perspective to the world as you view it - at least it did to me.....so much so that I traveled to New Orleans for 4 days to walk in routes of Ignatius , the hot dog vendor, author and self prophesized leader of the proletariat and downtrodden- the central character of this book. In spite of all his failures Ignatius Reilly has a level of confidence which will amaze everybody. I just hope some our world leaders had this level of independence.This book was written almost 4 decades ago still it is so very socially relevant and New Orleans remains to be as it was 40 years ago.Everybody says that it is a real tragedy that John Kennedy Toole only wrote 2 books - one as a kid \\"Neon Bible\\" and \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" before he committed suicide but it really does not matter how much he created - just check out what he created. Sometimes it takes that only one book for an author to create his identity and mark as for example \\"Phillipe Alfau\\" wrote \\"Locos\\" which was published 60 years after it was written and now it is a classic.\\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" evolves around Ignatius Reilly but around him are the characters like Patrolman Mancuso (alias Angelo), Mr. Gonzales, Miss Trixie, Jones (the representative of powerless minority), Myrna (the strangest girlfriend that one can possibly have), Mrs. Levy and Dorian (the fairy who attracts every other bee). They may be dunces but there is something common with all of them - they are all bursting with confidence an has eternal hope in the playfulness of fate or \\"fortuna\\" (as Ignatius puts it.) The whole book covers a period of 2 months or less and you will never realize how time passes by while you are reading. The best part is even all these dunces never make it tragic rather at some point being a \\"bum\\" seems to be the way to go.This is a work of love and effort and you will enjoy every line and pass out laughing. I just hope there were more books like this ......... I am off to New Orleans to meet Dorian."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces is one of my favorite books. In this picaresque novel, John Kennedy Toole creates a vivid and hilarious world, the French Quarter of the 1960s, and populates it with unforgettable characters and fantastic scenes. His protagonist is Ignatius J. Reilly, perhaps the first slacker in American literature. He disdains work and the modern world, longing for the Middle Ages when his genius would be appreciated.I read A Confederacy of Dunces in college and loved it from the very first pages. It's a broad comedy, expertly told by someone who clearly knows every inch of his beloved New Orleans. Moreover, Toole was familiar with the slang and patois of the city's residents. He portrays them as corrupt, flawed, confused - but always well-meaning, in their own way.In the book, Ignatius J. Reilly is forced to leave his cocoon of Big Chief tablets and Dr. Nut, encountering the real world with various levels of misadventure. He stumbles from farce to farce, never really changing, as his overbearing mother grows weary of his inability to lead a normal life.The book is wrapped up with a deus ex machina, like another great book from the 1960s,Catch-22. Both Toole and Joseph Heller created characters (Reilly, Yossarian) that were too big to be contained in a mere novel and essentially leap off the stage at the end."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It is one of my all time favorites!

I guess he doesn't have the right kind of sense of humor."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Although the \\"protagonist\\" of this novel is a uniquely obnoxious guy-you-love-to-hate, I found myself growing quite fond of the pompous, over-educated, under-achiever, Ignatius J.

Make no mistake, you would probably not want to have any of these folks as friends or family, but they are certainly fun to \\"watch\\". Ignatius is totally oblivious to the wave of chaos he creates everywhere he goes. Sometimes I felt it would be more appropriate to cry at the situations Ignatius created, but I always wound up laughing instead. Indeed, I laughed out loud almost the entire time I was reading this book. Love, love, LOVED it! Definitely a \\"read again\\" (and again and again) selection"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"As Ignatius would say, \\"OH. MY.

I'm happy for Mrs. Reilly that Ignatius left, but I want so desperately for Myrna to drop him on the side of the road in Manville. How is it that a person could be so boorish? So full of himself? Such a hypocrite? It boggles the mind.Toole was a gifted writer(please say this was not completely autobiographical) with a gift for true to life characters. My favorites were Ms. Trixie and Jones.

Ignatius J Reilly is an original, head-scratching, mind bending character that brings this turn paging story to life.

The style of writing is reminiscent of a few other writers I've encountered, most probably heavilly influenced by this book, but the story and characters that surround Ignatius are brilliantly interwoven to a conclusion that somehow makes sense. This story easilly could have drifted into nihilistic ramblings, much like a Brett Easton Ellis book, but thankfully this author is much more talented and clever.If you are looking for something that is delightfully fresh, check this novel out."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"What an enjoyable tragicomic story of gargantuan (literally!) proportions.

I've just finished my first reading of Mr. Toole's book and can see only three similarities:1. Both books take place in the South2. Both are full of kooky characters3. The writing style is very lyrically similar.This was an entertaining book but a short one, taking about 3.5 hours to read. I do recommend it but it probably won't be a reread for me; none of the characters engaged my sympathy except Jones, and it's not worth rereading for Jones' part.I do recommend \\"Handling Sin\\" very highly if you haven't read it.

Unfortunately Toole did not live to see his work released or win a Pulitzer Prize. Toole writes a story which takes place in New Orleans during the nineteen sixties; the main character is an incompetent man named Ignatius Reilly. Ignatius is an unemployed man in his thirties who has a college education and due to a severe lack of motivation and extreme laziness he still lives with his mother who collects welfare checks. Eventually Ignatius strings together some small low paying jobs, which includes a janitor at a pants factory and a hot dog vendor. Ignatius never blames himself for his problems; he always looks at other people's problems to feel better about himself. Ignatius ends up in a tailspin of misery, embarrassment, and failure while he angers his mother and worsens his mental condition. Toole's humorous novel is full of laughs and surprises; it tells the on-going story about man's struggle with life."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I think that Confederacy of Dunces was a very interesting book. I had to read this book for one of my classes and I went into reading it thinking that I would not like the book. After a few chapters my mind had not changed- it was simply not a book that I was interested in. The main character, Ignatius, was disgusting and completely vulgar. I think that this is what John Kennedy Toole was trying to portray to the reader. In this case Kennedy did a great job of getting his main character across to the reader. I became less and less interested in Ignatius as the book continued. I fequently became fusterated with his antics. In my personal opinion I think that C of D could have been about 100 pages shorter- the middle dragged and then the ending was extremely rushed. I think that the author should have given up on the book the first time it was rejected- but then again it is a great story for English classes across the US. I almost felt inspired by Kennedy's personal story- but as for his story about Ignatius I was left with questions."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is a very funny book. The author has an extremely adept comic touch. Most of the humors one finds in fiction are based on irony, witticism, one-liner, and similar \\"static play\\", to be able to write a farce, larger-than-life action-oriented comedy is no small feat, and A Confederacy of Dunces does that almost perfectly. The story moves at a nice rythmn, with fresh comical relief just about where one gets a little tired. A page turner for sure.However, to echo another reviewer's comment, I failed to find deep meaning from all the actions. What is the archetype Ignatius represents? What social or whatever profession the author is trying to make and advance? Does it have to do with a over-30 manchild living with his mother? A clock-work society rejecting the eccentric and, in some way, innocent? Some water color of New Orleans? The book can be said to touch on all these, plus several other subjects (the strike, the porno trade, etc), but does not do a deep enough job for the reader to get it.As a Seinfeld sort of comedy, the novel is very accomplished and a model for this genre. However, compared to a similarly funny and riotous Catch 22, Mr. Toole's offering reveals its defect."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Years ago, I listened to a group of people at a local bookstore talk about Confederacy of Dunces in glowing terms. I later picked up a copy at the library expecting much hilarity. It was horrible. I couldn't bring myself to finish it.Roll forward a few years. I thought that maybe my tastes had changed and the book deserved a second chance. No joy. I found nothing funny about the book. It is just one inane situation after another, no ups or downs, just an anemic \\"plot\\" that droned on and on.Is the fondness for this book an elaborate and widespread joke? Maybe it is a story that people pretend to like because others do, sort of an \\"Emperor's New Cloths\\" thing. I don't know but I found NOTHING to like in this book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Front to back terrible. I bought it because I wanted a book that was funny rather than boring old serious and a friend recommended it, but it really just isn't actually funny. To be fair, if you find yourself often saying, \\"Oh that is too much!\\" or \\"Oh that is clever!\\" then you might be exactly the kind of person who will force yourself into finding this stack of toilet paper funny."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I read this book some years ago. In reading reviews here all the five star reviews astounded me. However, having read many of those reviews let me point out a couple recurring themes: \\"If you like the Simpsons you'll love this book.\\" If you like the movie \\"Groundhog Day\\" you'll love this book.\\" What this points out to me is the American public's declining \\"sense of humor\\". What I consider stupidity and childishness is now accepted as funny. If you want hilarious read The Canterbury Tales. This book is, simply,stupid. I rate it zero stars. For those who are impressed by the fact that the book won a Pulitzer prize: I guess you're also impressed by the Nobel prize; that great honor bestowed on Yassir Arafat for his great efforts toward world peace etc. etc."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book was weird but lacked sense. It was like read a story that tried to be fuuny but was just sad."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Shamefully, I'm a newcomer to the genius of this book having only recently heard about it on the movie \\"Sideways\\" (also a 5 star entity). It is masterfully written and just so damn funny. Ignatius is an amazing, horrific creature that despite your best efforts, you can't help but sort of admire."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book met but did not exceed, my expectations. As in other Pulitzer prize winners, I was looking for a similar standard in this book, and it came up short of the hype that surrounded it when it was discovered, published, and circulated years ago.The writing was good - not great - which you would expect from a college professor. The characters were well-developed but soon, you could anticipate their conversations and reactions to virtually every encounter. This familiarity can sometimes be a positive, but here, it demonstrated simple, under-developed people and their accents (well crafted, by the way)masked the lack of depth to the people themselves.There were numerous storylines that meandered, and although the end attempted to tie everything up, instead it seemed as if the writer (who later committed suicide) needed to hurry up and finish a book that was going nowhere.It had its moments and was at times, very perspicuous in looking into the minds of people we have only heard about. I guess these brief glimpses of potential and wit were the reasons it barely made the cut for the Pulitzer. But someone much smarter than me may one day explain how 'Confederacy' can win the Pulitzer, and not 'A Prayer for Owen Meany' by John Irving."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Hmmm. Well. Hmmm. From the hyperbole on the cover, I expected to be clutching my sides and rolling with laughter. Didn't happen. Oh, the story is amusing enough, and the writing is well done. But protagonist Ignatius J. Reilly is a disagreeable character. I was nearly a third of the way through the book before I warmed up to him enough to make the rest of the book worth reading.Ignatius is a 30-year-old man who lives at home in New Orleans with his aging and alcoholic mother. He graduated from college with a Master's degree in some unspecified field, although I suspect it was literature or history. He believes he is brilliant (and might actually be right) and the rest of the world consists of idiots, morons, and other subhumans. He is unemployed and spends most of his time in his room where he writes, sleeps, eats and masturbates. An automobile accident causes a monetary crisis and he is forced to seek employment. Oh, the inhumanity of it all, he must consort with inferior beings, and therein lie the conflict and humor of the story.Once he got out of his room and into the world at large, he became an interesting person. His literary asides (letters, journal entries, etc.) are entertaining and elicited a chuckle or two, and his frequent rants against injustice and malice are inspired, not to mention more than a little delusional and paranoid.Worth reading. Once."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Like another John Kennedy (JFK), Toole has been immortalized for nothing more than dying young. Abusing one's widowed mother, eating everything in site, undermining one's employer just for kicks, yelling at strangers, threatening one's teachers, and dismissing blacks and homosexuals as manipulable minorities; are all not funny. If Toole had written a true farce, I could see the praise for this little book's little humor; but as it stands- with it's awful climax and resolution- this is nothing more than a waste of time and money."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I can't imagine why people are howling about this ponderous droll. My knees remain unslapped.I didn't even crack a decent grin before finally giving up. The phonetics are inaccurate to a fault and the characters sad and pitiable. Hilarious stuff. If you're among the throngs who seem to find hilarity in tragedy, go for it. You ain't alone, as these reviews indicate"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Heresy! This book regarding my important life is full of half-truths! And gives me valve trouble. Burn it. Burn every copy."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I bought this book for a book club I am in. I was a little weary of buying a used book because you never know what the quality is going to be like. But the description said \\"very good\\" so I went for it. The description was no lie. The book was in great shape. No tattered or dog-eared pages and the cover showed little to no wear. I will be buying many more used books from Amazon."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book was ok but I would never read it again. The main character Agnatius was THE MOST infuriating character I have ever had to deal with. I hoped he would learn a lesson at the end of the book but nope didnt happen. At least it tied together well wich is a plus and It was a page turner only because I so desperately wanted the main character to change his arrogant ways which never happened. I highly suggest this authors first book though NEON BIBLE that is a 5/5 for sure and quite different."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book was recommended to me by a good friend, and I trust his literary taste. At least I did until NOW. True, I listened to this book, and the reader was just passable. My biggest complaint about this book is that there are exactly zero characters that I warmed up to (Just thinking about that - UGH!) or wanted to hear from or wanted to know more about. I understand it is supposed to be funny - but trust me, this book is not funny like the early Janet Evanovich/Stephanie Plum books. It is not funny in any way. I admit it, I just don't get the attraction!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces is a pretty funny book. It never made me laugh out loud but i rarely luagh out loud from reading a book. The main character Ignatius J. Reilly is outraegous and absurd. His ridiculous actions make him the funniest character out of any book ive ever read. Ignatius's character is what makes this book work. The author did a great job developing Ignatius's character. When you read this book you want to keep reading to find out what kind of crazy ridiculous things he is going to do next. Ignatius just kind of wanders around in his own little world not really doing much of anything and he ends up in some pretty funny and ridiculous adventures. Ignatius is a very grotesque and disguisting person so the humor in the book is also very grotesque and disguisting. People who do not like grotesque humor may not find this book to be very funny but i enjoyed the type of humor and i thought this book was good."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I can say this much, if you are a lover of the television show \\"The Simpsons\\", I recommend this book highly. If you don't care for the show that much then don't bother. One good thing I can say about this book is that it was a very easy read. Due to Toole's simple language and diction the pages almost turned themselves. Reading the novel didn't seem like much work at all. However, the disgusting grotesque humor, the absurdity of the situations and the repulsive main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, make the novel drag. I found Ignatius to be a lot like Homer Simpson in some ways. At first he may be intriguing but then he just becomes annoying. I found him frustrating because he has his masters degree and yet he has no real reliable job. I felt his arrogance was overwhelming. And although his mom still provides everything for him he remains a jerk to her. The most uneccessary part of the book was the masturbation scene involving the dog. It was quite possibly the most disturbing thing I have ever read. Overall I thought the book was mediocre and boring, again, blah and meh."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I've heard so many things about how funny this book is, and I've even witnessed a person reading the novel burst out into laughter, but I've never been able to experience the same phenomena.In my opinion there are only a few funny parts of this novel. This is most likely do to my very crude sense of humor. The parts, byt the way, include: when ignatius masturbates to the thought of his olg dog, \\"The crusade for moorish dignity,\\" and that is it.Throughtout the novel people may laugh at the rediculousness of Ignatius. Whether its his political ideas or just way of going about things I dont find it funny. His whole \\"valve\\" situation is just stupid in my opinion. When he complains of his injuries (in the Levy pants office, etc.), which he heavily exaggerates, I didnt laugh one bit. A person may even laugh at how he undercuts his own beliefs multiple times (he wants the world to progress, but wants a monarchy), but I did not.To be honest, these sections don't amuse me one bit. I can probably attribute to my hatred of Ignatius, probably stemming from the way he treats his mother. Furthermore, when people laugh at the rediculousness of his ideas (his book, political party, revolt), I just hate him even more for believing in such stupid concepts. The way that Ignatius thinks he is always right continually infuriates me, and I just can't laugh at this book. I always finding myself wishing bad things onto ignatius, and when he is fired from his jobs or mugged, I feel happy.Anyway, If you tend allow hatred of characters to affect the way you view their comedy, you probably shouldn't read this book, but if you can hold off the hatred to laugh at their mistakes, you'll love this book. Personally I didn't like it, but I can see how some people with different types of humor and judgement would."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. Neither the \\"wacky\\" situations nor the \\"quirky\\" characters are funny / compelling. Ignatius's annoying outbursts of \\"Oh my god!\\" got repetitive after the first 50 times he utters it, and it distanced me from the character. Perhaps if the manuscript got some heavy editing and a bit of stylizing, the novel would have turned out better (there was potential, to be sure). It baffled me that people saw me reading this book in public and would interrupt me to tell me how great it is and how much they loved it. Because of this, I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. This book seems to be a literary equivalent of \\"the emperor's new clothes\\"."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Easily one of the finest pieces of non-fiction I have read. This captivating story makes its characters members of the household. Intricately twined, the multi-story-lined text will be one you will want to read again and again."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I completely miss any comedic (or any other) value this book holds. The main character Ignatius seems to be to be suffering from Autism or some other similar affliction, and I find no humor in this. The characters may be original, but all of them uninspiring and just uninteresting."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I found myself not caring about the main character and I didn't find the musings very entertaining."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is the most mean-spirited and and laugh-out-loud funny book I have ever read. If Ignatius were a present day character, he would write endless diatribes on the Internet instead of Chief writing pads. Many of my friends hated this book because Ignatius is such loser and he hates everything, but his scorn and self righteous anger delight me. In one scene early in the book, he goes to the movies to watch a musical (which he hates) so he can eat massive amounts of popcorn and shout his derision at the screen. This is dark humor at its best. If you lovedShe's Come Undoneby Wally Lamb, (another mean-spirited but wildly funny book) it's a good bet that you will appreciate Confederacy of Dunces."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Sometimes, it is not what you read in the novel, but what is written about the novel or novelist that tells you the full story. This is one such book where the \\"rest of the story\\" delivered in the foreward and on the internet help explain the novel.This lumbering New Orleans resident protagonist is a cretin named Ignatius Reilly has problems with his \\"valve\\" and mouth which make the reader laugh and cry on almost every page. His mother-son confrontations are merely verbal jawings, but of tenacity of Mommy Dearest. The barbs between babe and mom are cutting, and Walter Percy's (author ofThe Moviegoer- another New Orleans tale of a sad sack) revelation that the author's mother posthumously tendered the manuscript to him with pride - you knew this could not be autobiographical. And, that God Percy lost out in trying to evade Mother Toole's request that he read the manuscript. \\"Over the years I have become very good at getting out of things I don't want to do. And if there was something I didn't want to do; this was surely it: to deal with the mother of a dead novelist and worst of all, to have to read a manuscript that she said was GREAT, and that, as it turned out, was a badly smeared, scarcely readable carbon.\\" The rest is history.And, the dialogue flows. Ignatius introduces us to black janitors, white liberals, homosexual cross-dresser, high school pornographers, strippers with birds, undercover cops who work the mens rooms, and more. And, that is in the first few pages - or so.New Orleans is seedy, maybe seedier here than in Blanche Dubois's worst days in Tennessee Williams's New Orleans. Being a tourist with jingle in your pocket in that city may be fun. Being broke in New Orleans, we learn, is not a life of fruit and plenty for the locals.And, as Ignatius spirals downward in his plunge to despair and ridicule, we learn that he sees little, if any, light at the end of the tunnel. Ignatius opines about how others think he should be put into the loony bin:\\"They would try to make me into a moron who liked television and new cars and frozen food. Don't you understand? Psychiatry is worse than communism. I refuse to be brainwashed. I won't be a robot!\\" This frustration later leads to passages concerning suicide. And, such depression he knew. Wikipedia states: \\"It was during what is assumed to be a trip back to New Orleans that Toole stopped outside Biloxi, Mississippi, on March 26, 1969, and committed suicide by running a garden hose from the exhaust pipe in through the window of the car in which he was sitting.\\"The oratory of the overeducated underachieving Ignatius reminds me of the gifted lip from Walter Matthau's Willie Gingrich of Billie Wilder'sThe Fortune Cookie. Ignatius is a bumbler like Kingsley Amis'sLucky Jim (Penguin Classics). He is a slob like another Walter Matthau special - Oscar Madison. But, this is not a parallel figure. This complex and unique character, which I believe to be close to the heart of the author, is one of fiction's great gifts."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"So sad that so many readers don't like this book because the main character is obnoxious. He is indeed. He's disgusting and pathetic and at best, a sad case. The term, I believe, is \\"antihero.\\" However, the story is complex. The antihero manages to connect an astonishing number of disparate, unique characters...and they are not all pathetic and \\"bad.\\" In fact, at least two, Gus Levy and Burma Jones, ultimately do some good under difficult circumstances and are rewarded for it.I find this book a delicious immersion in a richly-populated world with brilliantly rendered dialects. And why is it funny? For that clich&eacute;d old reason: ya gotta laugh to keep from crying - because the book is also about poverty and prejudice and ignorance and all sorts of unpleasant things other than a fat guy who masturbates.But if you don't think farts are funny (even Montaigne did, by the way, so don't feel superior about it) and are easily offended by anything \\"icky,\\" don't bother with this book. Farts and other evidence of our animal nature are funny - it's far better to laugh at them than to pretend they don't exist. As do Ignatius J. Reilly \\"types,\\" though usually without the fictional character's excess of eloquence. Perhaps it's precisely the eloquence which makes Ignatius tolerable and even hilarious."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is a modern classic with hilarious dialogue and situations. The characters are original and fully realized, especially the protaganist Ignatius J. Reily. The essence of New Orleans is well captured and the author certainly knows the city well. Ignatius' strange insights into the world make for delightful reading, and many of them will make you burst out laughing. The dynamics between the characters are perfectly done as well.

Highly recomended!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"one of the funniest books ive ever read. you know a book is special when it makes you laugh out load over, and over. although the story tends to drag on at parts, it still is wildly entertaining. some very funny work, i only wish that mr. toole had published more work"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I'm hoping I'll find a funnier book - life can always be a little bit better!

Oh, I know. Amnesia. I could ask for amnesia."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A wonderfully funny novel -- with a protagonist so bizarre and beyond the pale that a reader almost longs for him to go away -- this book is a marvel of nuttiness and despair. Though it feels less weighty and far less politically correct than many other Pulitzer Prize winners, the award does not suprise me in the least. That it was awarded posthumously -- the author a suicide long before publication -- overhangs the book with an air of irredeemable loss which only contributes to the reading. The scene is set in New Orleans where we meet Ignatious, a gluttonous mound of a man, still living with his mother though well into his 30s. His \\"valve\\" is sensitive to the least psycho-social stress, and his rage at the world for its fall from the glory of the middle Roman Empire is unbounded. The valve in question is the pyloric, and its stuckness produces typhoons of belching and gas, caused in large part by the lack of geometry and religion in the world. He plays the lute and the trumpet, is writing the book which will restore classical enlightenment, and is very unpleasant to his mother. Meanwhile, his ex-girlfriend, a socially conscious rabble rouser in New York City, writes frequent letters expressing her certainty that his celibacy is the source of his discontent and stuck valve, and that she could facilitate a cure. In seedy bars in the French Quarter, a failing garment factory, the Paradise foot long hot dog vending garage, as well as at home and in letters, Ignatious tells and retells the saga of his only excursion beyond New Orleans, a Greyhound Scenicruiser journey to Baton Rouge so terrifying, so assaultive of his sensitive valve, that he could not use his round-trip ticket, but took a cab home instead. Other characters are equally wild, the best portrayed being a young black man whose jive slang is artfully written, funny and smart, and who manages to swing from being \\"vagran'. Whoa!\\" to heroism. In the end, Ignatious' mother decides to ... but I guess you should read that for yourself. Great fun!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It takes a genius to write a character like Ignatius J. Reilly THIS well! This is such a brilliantly funny book, I could not put it down when I first read it at the age of 16, and each subsequent time. I've read it in 2 languages and in both cases I couldn't tear myself away! It's hilarious on many different levels! It's psychological comedy! I lent it to a friend who is a clinical Psychologist, and then to my mother, neither one could put it down either!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I read this book again while visiting New Orleans having read it for the first time 4 or 5 years ago.

He is too unique a character not to be thoroughly believed."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I read this book based on the recommendation of both Tucker Max, and one of my friends from college, and I couldn't agree with both of them more. This book is an intriguing look into the mind of John Kennedy Toole. The characters, especially Ignatius, are all intriguing in their own ways. This is always one of the first books that I recommend to someone, and I am looking foward to reading it again."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is a true laugh-out-loud book. One of the funniest and cleverest books I've ever read, and in my top five all-time favorites in general. Ignatius taught me how to become an anarchist at my job, too. I was a secretary when I read this book. For several months after I finished it, I would just throw in the garbage various pieces of mail for my coworkers that I deemed to be worthless. A promotion for tickets to the football game? Organized sports is a racket and bad for society. In the trash it went. I loved living vicariously through Ignatius J. Reilly. He is an inspiration is a really twisted way."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I was unfamiliar with the tragedy surrounding this book and its author, Mr. Toole, and I admit that if I had known the facts, I probably would not have read it (I'm a writer myself, and the worst fate I could imagine is a &quot;mercy Pulitzer&quot; for someone who did himself in because he couldn't sell his work. But I did read it, and I can assure you that the Pulitzer was most deserved: Dunces was one of the most pleasant reads I've had in many, many months.The setting for the book is New Orleans, a place that I love and love reading about. But it's not a novel about New Orleans, it's a story about some very interesting people who're just trying to make it in this world as best they can. But it's no Steinbeck novel -- it's funny, warm, provocative and touching all at the same time. I rarely laugh out loud while reading a book, but this one had me doing so on several occasions. And there were times that I felt an overpowering sadness for the characters as they made their way in life.There were times while I was reading this book that I'd think that Ignatius was me -- clumsy, pompous and just plain wierd at times -- but for all that, people seemed to accept him for just being... Ignatius. I suppose that's all any of can hope for.The only bad part is that Mr. Toole is no longer with us. I'm going to miss Ignatius and his family and friends. Thank you, Mr. Toole, for a most pleasurable experience."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is a genre of it's own! Every single character is millions of miles away from an &quot;average person&quot;. Ignatius J. Reilley, the protagonist, is not an overweight bumbling moron. Rather he is a overweight, bumbling, thirty-year old with a masters degree and a fixation with Medieval philosophy. He is a mogul in his own mind and a persuasive one at that, with a sort of midas touch. Anyone who comes near him somehow gets dragged into this twisted, all-too-believable plot which is his life. John Kennedy Toole deals so frankly with a side of human nature that so many authors seem to neglect. The strength of this book is not only in the plot but how the characters interact with one another and how they all become tied together in a massive web of occurences. I was given this book by my English teacher and I'm glad he shared it with me. This is a must read for everyone who needs a rollicking good laugh now and again."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I mean, absurd the way Three Men In a Boat is absurd. Both are outright parodies, just of a different time and place, and I don't think I've ever read a book quite like the two of them.Ignatius is hysterical and eerily like some of my old high school classmates. Jones is one cool cat, and the only character with any inkling of how freakin' weird their world is. Mrs. Reilly is a riot, and ends up very nearly a figure of female empowerment. Best of all is Mancuso, the pathetic undercover cop whose various costumes are the delight of the French Quarter.Read this book. It's certainly fun, and you probably won't ever forget it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"&quot;Confederacy&quot; is a book about odd people (and thereby begins to point out how &quot;odd&quot; we all really are). Each character has some habit that is different from the &quot;norm&quot; of society and the main character, Ignatius, is in a different universe all together (all the while thining that he is the very definition of what &quot;normal&quot; should be). If you enjoy books that are character studies that reveal exactly how odd this world is then you will enjoy &quot;Confederacy&quot;.

If you have ever been there you can sware that you have been to many of the scenes he so aptly paints. READ THIS BOOK ! !"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book should be considered a &quot;classic!&quot; I have never laughed out loud as hard as I did while reading this book. Everything from the characters to their series of comedic events had me in hysterics. The story focuses on the pathetic &quot;dunce&quot; of a man, Ignatius J. Reilly. This thirty year old (well-educated) man, who is completely dependent upon his mother, is forced to get a job. Every job he has, somehow, seems to interfere with his very busy life of doing nothing. Although he has a master's degree, he finds thoughtless, thankless jobs that he can't hold onto. His on-the-job blunders and his desire to change society as well as his interactions with the other characters make this the funniest book I have ever read. I would definitely recomend it to anyone who wants a good laugh!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Plain and simple, A Confederacy of Dunces is one of the finest works of fiction written in the last century, perhaps ever!

The characters are real, mad, and insanely perfect. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Simply hilarious. One of the most imaginative books I've ever read, obviously written by a genious. It's at the same time original and classic, it follows a path started by other universal masterpieces such as &quot;Don Quixote&quot; or even Nabokov's &quot;Lolita&quot; (another American gem). In my opinion, it's the best Christmas present for sensible readers,and lovers of sharp, surrealistic sense of humour.

But not very GOOD toilet humor. I will watch the South Park kids if I want fart jokes."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The book, A Confederacy of Dunces, which was written by John Kennedy Toole, was far from intriguing. From the first sentence you could tell that it was not going to be an entertaining book. The lack of interest of the book came from the lack of personality of his characters. Toole's writing is descriptive but not enjoyable to the reader. He does not keep the reader wanting to come back to the book each night.Ignatius, who was the main character, was a 30 year old man who still lives with his widowed mother. He is a very lazy nonsocial man who thinks that the world is out to get him. He hardly ever has a job, and when he does it is either as a hot dog vender or at a pant maker, which neither of them pay much money. Since he graduated from college and he received his Masters degree, you would think that he would have done something with his life. Ignatius' mother, Mrs. Reilly, who is an out of work widow, spoils her son to no end. Deep down she hates how her son is so lazy and thinks that he is very annoying. She worries that he will never find anyone to marry. Ignatius hardly ever comes out of his room and when he does it is to go some where with his mother and that is finally starting to bug Mrs. Reilly. She never gets any time alone to hang out with friends until she meets Santa, officer Mancuso's aunt.Even though Toole puts every aspect of an American society in his book, he still is missing something to grab the attention of the reader. I would not recommend reading this book. I think this is just a waste of time and you don't get anything out of the book. There is no enjoyment."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Centinaia di recensioni in inglese, per questo libro scombiccherato ma perfetto (o viceversa), e una media eccellente (4 e mezzo su cinque). Allora e' il caso di rivolgersi agli amici italiani. Cominciate dall'inizio, per favore. Dalla scena in cui Ignatius fa' la fila assieme alla madre. Vi si apre davanti un mondo nuovo, fatto di pensieri lucidissimi ma, come dire, sconvenienti. Non e' un folle, quello che abbiamo di fronte, un imbarazzante grassissimo folle scoreggiante (ahim&egrave;, fa anche di questo!), &egrave; semplicemente un uomo che non fa sconti a nessuno e troneggia su un egoismo perfino commovente...ma tutto ci&ograve; non &egrave; forse ci&ograve; che potremmo osservare in gran parte dei nostri simili? Forse sono meno inclini alle flatulenze, tutto qui... Pertanto, il mondo offerto dal libro &egrave; nuovo solo perche' non l'abbiamo mai visto cos&igrave;, ma &egrave; proprio quello che attraversiamo ogni giorno. Solo, abbiamo - in genere - visioni meno radicali di Ignatius. Il libro tocca punte di comicit&agrave; piacevolissima, pian piano le assurdit&agrave; che propone ci sembrano per&ograve;...meno irragionevoli. Ha ragione, Ignatius, a restare quel che &egrave;? O per farsi amare, accettare, per inserirsi - problema che avvertiamo solo noi, osservandolo all'opera, perch&egrave; lui ha sempre ragione! - dovrebbe rinunciare ad una delle sue mille sgradevolezze? Ora io ricordo una storiella: un uomo guida la sua auto e sente alla radio un allarme &quot;attenzione, si avvisano gli automobilisti che un pazzo sta percorrendo l'autostrada in senso contrario!&quot; l'uomo spegne la radio con aria infastidita e commenta &quot;see, uno, sono migliaia!&quot;. Che dovrebbe fare Ignatius, allora, darla vinta a quella banda di idioti? Epper&ograve; mai avrei pensato che quell'automobilista pericoloso mi avrebbe tanto intenerito...qui a mio avviso emerge la maestria di J.K.Toole: quasi spiamo Ignatius mentre sta da solo (&egrave; sempre solo, dannazione!), sistema le sue cose, i suoi fogli bisunti in cui riscrive la storia del mondo partendo, guarda caso, da ci&ograve; che pi&ugrave; lontano si pone rispetto alla nostra luminossissima modernit&agrave;...l'oscuro Medioevo! ed &egrave; cos&igrave; affettuoso con le proprie cose, con le proprie fissazioni...un bambino, davvero, che si chiude da solo nella stanza dei tesori... Non so se &egrave; solo bravura, quella di Toole, o se c'&egrave; qualcos'altro che gli permetta di farci alla fine commuovere per il suo magnifico e ributtante personaggio...non so, mi viene in mente un'altra madre, quella di Toole stesso, che per anni si presentava a scrittori ed esperti di scrittura per sottoporre il manoscritto del figlio morto suicida, un ammasso di fogli bisunti, appunto...fino a trovare chi sapesse finalmente leggerlo e farlo arrivare a noi. Grazie, signora Toole, ha fatto bene ad essere ostinata come suo figlio Ignatius, anzi Kennedy, ha fatto bene a non arrendersi a quella banda di idioti!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I only got two-thirds of the way through this book because, basically, it just kept spinning its wheels. Also, the title character is 99% unsympathetic. He's such a friggin' ego-centric dolt that I simply stopped caring about anything to do with him. Yes, there are very funny parts...but not that many. I really feel this book has been hyped due to the fact that the book didn't get published until twenty years after the author's death (he committed suicide at least partly due to the novel not being published in his lifetime) and that the persistence of his mother in getting it printed really added to the book's mystique...which, obviously, has NOTHING to do with the actual book itself. I feel that the book would have never even been considered for a Pulitzer (which it won in the early '80s) had it been published in the author's lifetime. I actually would give this book two and a half stars, but that option isn't available."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I think this is a well written book with the potential for greatness, but falls just shy.

I got a headache halfway through chapter 2.I tried and tried to keep reading out of repect for the Pulitzer Prize rating(and my sister who picked this book). Hoping beyond hope that the books characters would redeem themselves. Never happened.I personally like to read books that are interesting.

Ignatius is an over weight, unsanitary, selfish, couch potato, who increasingly clash's with his mother throughout the book.Ignatius went to college and he also has a master's degree. But for some reason he is thirty and still lives with his mother. He either sits at home watching and criticizing the T. V., goes to the movies and criticizes the film out loud, eats, or locks himself in his room writing on scattered pieces of paper. He had been pampered by his mother which contributed to the way he is, but then their financial situation goes south and Ignatius has to get a job. He tries to weasel his way out of it but he ends up at a job at Levy Pant Company as a filer, but he just throws the files away because he is to lazy to actually file. He gets fired when he tries to get the factory workers to have an uprising, and then ends up as a hot dog vendor. As a vendor he just eats hot dogs al day and doesn't really try to sell the hot dogs. As the book caries on more tension grows between Ignatius and his mother because she can't bare how selfish and lazy he is, and she starts to think about having him committed. Ignatius then try's to start a gay political party and it just completely fails. Then his mother finally commits him but he escapes and the book comes to an abrupt ends. Ignatius finally ends leaving his mother but it is do to his lethargy."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The characters are not interesting; they're just stupid people with some eccentricities. I got 7/8 through the book and was never amused, moved, or had any interest in the people, their world, or the plot (what little there is of it.)

To me, it's simply crap."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"While I can appreciate the positive reviews of this book, which sparked me to make the purchase, I was sorely disappointed. At page 75, I was bored silly. What, exactly, is the point of the story? The main character is repulsive with no redeeming qualities. As many reviewers have pointed out, the other characters are interesting, but that is about all I can think to say about them. I suppose this is a great character study, but a plot is severely lacking and the characters are just not strong enough to carry this book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I DONT LIKE THIS BOOK IT IS STUPID AND ITS ABOUT A FAT, FARTING MAN WHO SHOULDNT BE LIVING AT HOME ANYMORE AND WHO TAKES ADVANTAGE OF HIS PITIFUL MOTHER.i see where it is supposed to be funny, but the humor is twisted and weird.BAD BOOOOOOOOK!-unhappy reader"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I bought this thing on the recommendation of a friend (who is one no longer) to read while traveling.

This is another example of things that are popular for no apparent reason."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have read 5 reviews of this book. the first four gave it five stars. The last, one. I cannot understand how anyone could not like this novel. It is past funny. It is delightful. John Kennedy Toole had a gift that was greatly wasted. Ignatius may have been crude and idiotic. That was part of his charm. He was more than entertaining. I had to love this book because it made me laugh harder than I had ever from any previous book I ever read. It is a work of genius and every portion is interwoven. Pure genius at work. I read it for a book club that I am in. Otherwise, I would not have bothered. Now, I am glad that I have. I have recommended it to so many people. I think it is a book that everyone should read. If you have a sense of humor, you WILL like it!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Loved this book. I love it so much I itch. Sure the humor is a little broad. Then again, so was Shakespeare. They still named a line of fishing poles after him."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The first time I read Confederacy, I was very ambivalent about it. I couldn't decide whether I liked it or not. So I read it again. And then again. Each time, of course, I snickered and laughed out loud in a couple of places. (Miss Trixie trying to help &quot;Gloria&quot; off the floor, Ignatius rallying the factory workers and becoming aroused as they lifted him onto the table, the infamous letter to Ableman...well, you get the point.) And yet--there was something immensely pathetic about the book and the characters. I gave it to my daughter to read--she has worn out four paperback copies. I have worn out three. I think this has to be one of my two or three favorite books of all time, for several reasons. First, it is so extremely well-written. Even after the first reading, when I wasn't sure I liked it, I could appreciate that it was so well-written that this in itself could have won it the Pulitzer. Secondly, the characters are real people. I have never been to New Orleans, but trust me, there are people like Jones, and Lana, and Gonzalez, and Mrs. Gonzalez, and Mrs. Reilly and her gentleman friend everywhere. With each reading, I gain new insight into one of the characters. And finally, it perks me up to realize that my life isn't so bad after all, compared to Ignatius and his valve and his complete inability to hold a job or do anything meaningful with his life--or compared to his mother, putting up with Ignatius. The pathos equals the comedy. Actually, that may be its best quality--that it can describe and detail several truly pathetic lives in a way that an outsider looking in can get past the tragedy and the pathos and laugh. And isn't that what comedy is all about?"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"My friend had been badgering me for months to read this book and recommended it to our face-to-face bookgroup. I am an avid reader and love satire, humor, and farce as much as anyone, but this book did not do a thing for me. While there are humorous segments in this book, I never once busted a gut laughing or even laughed out loud. Ignatious was obnoxious, which I guess was what he was supposed to be, but if he was attempting to open our eyes to the superficialities of life, he did not succeed. I never really understood just what he DID stand for. I thought it probably pretty autobiographical and can understand how Toole may have ended his life if he in any way identified with his character. Sad, yes. Some redeeming value--maybe. Funny-not!! If you want a read that combines humor, satire, social commentary and anything else you can think of and really want to laugh may I suggest anything by John Irving."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Arte Johnson gives a wonderful interpretation of the characters' voices and accents. However, the development of Ignatious' personality suffers greatly due to the severity of the abridgement. The plot thread is retained, but many amusing asides and some of the more colorful vocabulary are missing. I would not recommend the audio cassette to anyone who has not read the original version of this exceptional novel."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"You know, usually I wouldn't write a review like this, usually I wouldn't comment on anyone else's statements on a book, but hell, let's be honest: everyone who wrote anything about this book is either a benighted moron, or a cruel, vicious little person who gets off reading about other people's misery. Most of the reviews are great, raving and ranting about the book's excellence. yes, it's a good book. But it is also a very sad book. Most reviews talk about 'laugh out loud funny' and other cliched buzz phrases and it just doesn't apply to this book. Sure, you may laugh at something here or there within, crack a smile, a grin, a hearty, wicked chortle. But the book is about a fat, sick, crazy lunitic who's too smart and too paranoid and convinced that everyone in the world is out to get him. Not the basis for hilarity, is it. Sure, it could be made hilarious, with rampant exaggeration and skillfully making the character tremendously unlikeable, thereby changing the novel into a vicious comedy ripping this loser apart. But Toole clearly felt affection towards his character. He wanted things to turn out all right for him, but, based on his grounding the story in reality, that just didn't seem the way things should go. It is not a comedy. It is a tragedy with few moments of humor to lift the character's (and perhaps the reader's, but what writer really cares while writting a book what a general audience will think?)spirits or to give him a chance at laughing at himself and thereby restore some sense of humanity. As for the people angry and disappointed that they didn't find the book funny--don't listen to what people say about anything, chances are you'll disagree.

After reading several chapters and not finding it engaging at all, I told her so and tried to give it back. She wouldn't take the book back until I had finished it.There are many books in this world that, once you begin them, you can't put them down. With this book, once I put it down, I found it extremely difficult to pick it back up again.This book has absolutely nothing whatsoever to recommend it. It is without a doubt the single worst piece of literature I have ever inflicted upon myself. The characters without exception are unlikable and, not merely bland, but actively unpleasant, with the worst of a bad lot being Ignatius Reilly himself. There is no plot to speak of, just a series of increasingly hostile encounters between Ignatius and everybody else unfortunate enough to meet him. It is utterly incomprehensible to me how this book even got published, let alone won a pulitzer. It is incomparably bad.Do not waste your time."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I wish I knew how a posthumous book should be edited. As a first novel (excluding the one Toole wrote as a child) it shows enormous creativity and imagination, but I schlepped through the second 200 pages hoping for a change of pace. He showed acute powers of observation -- I have known the group of not-so-smart bowling friends in Brooklyn, and I have worked at the long defunct Gloria Gloves in lower Manhattan, with the factory shut off from the office headed by the loyal office manager, the misfit clerk, and the owner impatient to get back to her hobby of show dogs, while the business decays from obsolescence and neglect. Burma Jones, the African-American sweeper working under threat of blackmail, is perhaps only drawn as broadly as the white characters, and he voices truths of life in the 60's, but he borders on a stereotype. Minkoff, the radical bohemian, exists even today on college campuses and in Soho. Ignatius's character can probably be found in the DSM-IV under dependent borderline personality with delusions of grandeur. He is funny until he's not so funny. The factor that keeps Ignatius from being Dickensian is that in Dickens's works the eccentric people who were funny had some basic worth, while the evil people were obviously evil. But Ignatius is too destructive -- he is parasitic on his mother, he writes a slanderous letter over a forged signature, he wants to lead the factory workers to do physical harm to the office manager, he ruins a desperate stripper's opening night, and he always bites the hands that feed him. Yet, I think Toole wants us to like him. Shakespeare shows us that Falstaff is destructive by having the prince reject him in the end. Ignatius's mother rejects him in the end, when he will stand in the way of her last chance for happiness, but the bohemian girlfriend accepts him, even as he is making her his chauffeur. I would want Toole to save some of the many incidents for a next book. I would also want him to have Ignatius show some growth, but he remains clueless all the way through, although the other characters grow. I would say this is a good book to taste, but it's not a good meal."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I'm sure you are the typical John Grisham's fan, or even a nobody's fan.Please stay away of Joyce, Cervantes, Kafka, Proust, Borges (I'm shure you are).And don't stop, commit suicide whenever you want it, but in the place you should go, you are not going to see John Kennedy Toole.Dear Melinda Harrison, you just put it clear.tdaneri@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, (giving a sigh somewhere near the middle), and ultimately finishing it with a smile on my face.This is not \\"literature\\" by any means, and I cannot at all account for the Pulitzer which it won; however, it's one of those works that I call a \\"break book\\" -- in other words, if you've been reading a lot of Dostoevsky and/or Shakespeare and have a need to jump out of heavier stuff for awhile, this one might just work for you.The story is silly and a bit stupid, yet still entertaining. Buy a used copy if you can get a good deal or check it out at the library as you probably won't want it for your permanent inventory of book treasure.EDIT: I'm keeping my review the same but I'm adding on some updated comments. I notice that a lot of folks don't agree with my review, probably for good reasons, so I'll qualify all the above by saying this:The book is a \\"romp\\" and the author wrote a straightforward story -- there's no symbolism or metaphor to search for in here.

I can think of no book more deserving than A Confederacy of Dunces, the most horrible book I have ever had the misfortune to be forced to read.Sitting in a college \\"Dark Humor in American Fiction\\" class, I was told that this novel was going to be the funniest thing I had ever read. I would be sitting there howling with laughter while reading. I was excited, considering myself well-read in terms of humor, eager to pick up another book to add to my collection of awesome reads. Something in the back of my head told me, though, that I was going to be sorely disappointed. I have to admit I was wrong... I was more than disappointed. I was betrayed.I have read every single one of the 394 pages in my copy of the novel, and have re-explored most of them through class discussions. I think that perhaps three times throughout the entire novel did I even crack a smile. Ignatius J. Reilly is without a doubt the most disgusting, grotesque, horrific, lazy, worthless, annoying, insufferable, God-awful character that I have ever had to endure. This book is not worth the ink it took to print it nor the time it takes to read it. My only wish is that I could purge my brain of every element of this novel and never, ever think of it again.If you have even an ounce of good taste, stay far far far away from this novel."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"That little mysterious box that pops up at the wrong time, while you're typing a note for eternity in your journal--well, &quot;what's this&quot;? That happened to my brain, while reading this book. It was purplexing and inescapable. The book is propelled at a frantic pace, with an almost manic urgency, until it ends, winding down, until one hopes that the author can get some sleep. The rapid movement is good, because there is no plot to further puzzle us.I missed this book, when the original hoopla occurred--don't know how; I was reading &quot;Earthly Powers&quot; and Dorothy Sayers and Barbara Pym, so that I could better understand my dislike of Episcopalians. Here, however, the question is where is the satire? I was expecting a modern Swift or Voltaire. Instead, I get a work, where the anger is palpable in every word. Toole can't be poking fun at purple prose, because this may the best in the English language. It''s just too good, but here's the other problem. Toole loses aesthetic distance. One is never sure whether it is Toole, being omnipotent or Ignatius, writing well. I did laugh a couple of times at a well placed witticism or a character foible that would appear from nowhere.Off the top of my head, I think of some other contemporary suicides, Diane Arbus in photography, Jerzy Kosinski, Ernest Hemingway, Sylvia Plath . . . All were commensurate craftspersons, like the composer, Salieri(boring!) They share something else in common, an unfathomable hoplessness and a naive kind of nihilism, which in Hemingway, I admired as teenager, as in &quot;A Clean Well-Lighted Place.&quot; When Ghandi was asked what he thought of Western Civilization? He replied, &quot;I think it would be a good idea.&quot; Civilization may have ended, after we dropped the bomb and really disappear, whenever we do a Hitler, as in Cambodia or Yugoslavia, or Northern Ireland, or Rwanda . . . My own poetry often makes Plath's appear cheerful, but mine is therapy. The problem with these peoples' nihilism is that it will kill you."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Written with style. Toole definitely had talent, but it takes more than vivid descriptions to make a great book. I found the book utterly depressing.

I don't think it's funny at all; I don't think it was intended to be funny. I think the author created a character based on himself and this is how he saw the world. Ignatius seems to have major mental issues and is seriously detached from real life. His behavior isn't comical or quirky, it seems to border on insanity. I don't really understand the appeal of this book filled with unappealing characters."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have to agree with P.J. Otto of St.Louis on this one. What is the author trying to tell us; that fat, eccentric, neurotic personality-disordered individuals are funny? A sociological lession? Political satire?Much of the dialogue is clever but redundant. It becomes predictable after a few pages. Ignitius is never personalized. Throughout the book he remains a character construct. A hyperbolized combination of responses.If there is a great humanizing message here, it is inapprehendable by me. Without a redeeming message, the story is too quirky and uninteresting.A book that is overrated by virtue of too many people propelled by the momentum of a desire to see what has been seen by others."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The greatest American novel of the last half of the twentieth century.

The anti-hero Ignatius Reilly wanders through the New Orleans Quarter in the sixties into and out of various absurd situations that all transpire into a set of hilarious coincidences.

I have read some of the positive, as well as negative reviews of this most unusual, unnerving, and most unfortunately truthful novel.It saddens me to think that those who found Ignatius to be a repulsive and impossible character can't see that Ignatius was/is the author and not some fictional character, but a young man, willing to lay his pain out on each page for the world to witness. Saddest of all perhaps, that there are those who were fortunate enough to have been given this rare and uncensored look into the life of such a very, very, lonely man to have not learned from the magnitude of his gift to us all...a rare chance to experience the pain of a stranger,without obligation and having had this, not to have read the last page with at the very least a readiness to accept others, for whatever, or whoever they might be.I have read perhaps 3,000 novels in my life and am proud to say that I can feel this man's pain in all of his oddities and idiosyncrasies...for he is no different than all of us...he lived, perhaps not in a way that most of us will ever admit to...but in a way that we can all admittedly or not, understand.I recommend this book to anyone who can accept that we are all different, yet all the same...to be different is not always the accepted thing, but is most always better than being just like everyone else.Read this book with an open mind, heart, and room in your soul for forgiveness... for Ignatius is certainly not a very likeable character, but in the end (as in the beginning) he is human no more or less than you or I however, unlike you or I, he chose to bear his soul and asks for no forgiveness just acceptance and verification that yes, he did live."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"\\"A confederacy of Dunces\\" is the funniest book I have ever read. It had me in full belly laughs, almost near tears at times. So why am I so sad after reading it? I guess it largely has to do with the story of the author, John Kennedy Toole. A common attack on this book - indeed the original attack which caused its initial rejection - is that it \\"isn't about anything.\\" But when viewed within the context of Toole's life and death, the book gains enormous meaning.I think that there is more than just a little of John Kenndy Toole in the character of Ignatius J. Reilly. Ignatius ranks up there with the greatest literary characters in history. He is vivid, bright, alive, and unique. His motivations are complex, and he constantly lies to himself, and therefore to the reader. On the surface, he appears incredibly obtuse and dense (and he is!) but yet other times, notably when he needs to save his own rear, he is incredibly cunning and insightful. One my favorite moments in the book is when, after days on end of lazily and aimlessly pushing his cart about, eating more hot dogs then he sells and being rude to just about everybody he meets, he has a pressing need for some money. Suddenly, he knows exactly where to go to find some business, and almost immediately sells all of his hot dogs: \\"Calling, entreating, he guided the wagon into the crowd of men and succeeded in selling all of his hot dogs, courteously and effusively squirting ketchup and mustard on his sold goods with all the energy of a fireman.\\"What many people don't understand is that Ignatius rejects society because society rejects him. An overly intelligent, unattractive, overweight, poor, fatherless boy - was he the most popular kid in high school? More like least popular. So he has taken this rejection and chosen to wear it like a shroud. It is his protection. If a society that he utterly condemns and despises rejects him, so what? But we all know that deep in his heart, there is pain.So there is just one level of your meaning! This book is most certainly not \\"about nothing.\\" But as John Kennedy Toole learned the hard way, not everyone is capable of \\"getting\\" it. And that is what breaks my heart most of all. That this man poured his soul into what truly is a comedic masterpiece, only to have it rejected, like I imagine he had been rejected his entire life. \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" deserves every bit of praise it has received."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is an amazing piece of literature that I recommend to everyone I meet."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is a comic masterpiece, it narrates the adventures and misadventures of Ignatius a not too young, highly educated gentleman who is pushed by his mother to find a job in a hostile New Orleans.Because of his humanistic studies Ignatius has a medieval and poetic perception of the reality surrounding him that results in hilarius misunderstandings when he shares his views with other characters.I truly believe this novel is unique, the author must have had an extraordinary sense of humor!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Reviews of A Confederacy of Dunces almost always fall into one of two polarly opposite categories. We either love Toole's humor or we are repulsed by Ignatius and are entirely immune to the comic aspects of the book. Sure, we can attribute the lack of variety in the reviews as typical of any self-selecting poll. In other words, only people who feel strongly about the book will respond, so all reviewers will have either fanatically positive or negative feelings. But, logical as this sounds, if we look at other reviews we find a much higher rate of reviews of mediocrity, three stars, \\"it was OK\\", and the like, that seems to disprove this idea of apathy among the undecided readers. Why, then, do reviewers feel so passionate about a comedy that promotes nothing?The root of both the comedy of the book and many reviewers' hatred is Ignatius P. Reilly, the corpulent, egotistical anti-hero of the novel. Whether we love or hate Ignatius ultimately determines whether or not we enjoy the novel. This is not to say that there is no comedy outside of Ignatius' actions. On the contrary much of the comedy comes from clever allusions to previous scenes, comic bits that we have to pay close attention to in order to laugh. Take for example nearly any scene involving Patrolman Manusco in costume. In one of his first costumes, Manusco wears a pair of Bermuda shorts and a red beard that he stole to complete his outfit. After we hear of his ridiculous outfit, several unrelated scenes go by until a few pages later when Jones is riding the bus and sees a man in a red beard and Bermuda shorts being beaten by a man with a rolled-up newspaper. This style allows us to remember and laugh at the setup for the joke, enjoy the scene itself, and also to anticipate some comic tie-in with nearly all of the absurd situations that Toole introduces. When Ignatius writes that letter to Abelman's, we know that eventually a response will arrive and so we not only laugh at the letter but also in anticipation of what could happen.Unfortunately, all of this comedy can be easily overlooked by either a reader who is either too hurried or insulted by the conduct of Ignatius. If we hate Ignatius, we will be blind to all of the subtle humor that occurs around him. All of Ignatius' comic power is derived from his utter disregard for everyone around him and his ridiculous ideas that he believes will improve everything. To many people, this egotism makes Ignatius unlikeable past the point of being funny. Or, maybe people don't like him because he is so cruel to his mother, because he is an absolute failure with eight years of college education leaching off his widowed mother and insulting her at every opportunity. Whatever the reason, many readers are so repulsed by Ignatius' character that they hate the entire novel. These people fail to realize one of the inherent truths of comedy, that all or at least almost all comedy is by nature cruel.We can only find Ignatius funny if we can suspend rational judgement of the characters and realize that this is entirely a comedy, with every element present only to maximize the humor of the piece. Sure, none of us would ever like to meet Ignatius in real life and would almost certainly detest him if we did. But, taken out of the context of reality, Ignatius' ideas are utterly ridiculous and hilarious, and perhaps everyone too indignant to enjoy them should stick to the non-offensive comedy of network sitcoms or avoid comedy altogether because they just don't get it. By no means does this mean that only the morally deficient can enjoy the book. I consider myself to have firm morals and strong convictions, but I can put them aside in the spirit of imagination and laugh at Ignatius without being turned off by his faults. Personal values don't preclude admiration of Toole's genius comedy, self-righteousness does. Readers who did not laugh at this novel should first reread the book with a more open mind, and if they still cannot find any humor in the novel must face up to the sad truth that they lack a truly refined sense of humor. We hate to acknowledge our faults, especially something as serious as a admitting that we don't understand what's funny, but by any definition of comedy, A Confederacy of Dunces is a masterpiece packed full of laughs. Even if you're one of these unfortunates without a sense of humor, don't despair. I bet you'll find this week's Marmaduke to be a gut-buster."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I know I'm probably going to be flamed by all the pro-Dunces reviewers, who I am sure will say that I'm just not smart enough to \\"get it\\", but I hated this book. The main character is so completely vile and off-putting that I kept wondering why I was using my precious time to make myself sick. The book could have used a good editor also, as it seemed to meander wherever the author's mind happened to wander that day. I hate to speak ill of the dead, but I got the distinct feeling that this book was hyped just because the author had died."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I read this as a local book club choice - it is fabulous!

I ended up finding the book funny....but that's about it. True, the main character was well-developed and brimming with pathology and the story kept me interested enough, but I was expecting some earth-shattering climax, a heartwrenching denouement....I mean, it did win a Pulitzer after all, no?The bottom line - the characters were funny (though their personal interactions not as satisfying as I had hoped), the plot moderately entertaining and the ending a little bit of a let down.

The army of rabid fans would apparently decry me as not 'getting it' and of being some bland personage unable to appreciate the genius of Toole. On the contrary, I did find it very funny in parts, even laughing out loud. I am certain that some of the characters and situations will stand out vividly in my mind for some time to come. For me, this was not sufficient to make it great literature, nor did I even find it nearly as funny as, say, Catch-22 or White Noise. There is really only one note here, one tone and one basic set of jokes played out again and again. The characters are caricatures given the same types of lines, observations, and actions again and again - Jones' smoke clouds, Miss Trixie's 'snarls' once she gets her new teeth - and the only one I really cared about that much was Jones. The lack of a strong plot didn't help me care any more, either. The book doesn't build to anything. I felt no different upon finishing it than I would at the end of a Seinfeld re-run. And I'd like a little something more out of my time investment..."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I finished this book with mixed emotions; it had me alternately laughing and annoyed. What makes this book brilliant is also its downfall: its nonstop (and sometimes tiresome) literary and cultural allusions. The protagonist's worldview is a mishmash of Roman philosophy, medieval literature, and a passionate contempt for the bourgeoisie. An unsuccessful hot dog vendor with an elite university education, Ignatius J. Reilly bumbles through New Orleans in a series of adventures and mishaps that put him squarely at odds with the authorities and mainstream society. The author asks a lot of the reader, however, by sharing Ignatius's every belch and moment of flatulence. If you are can get past the slow beginning, you'll probably enjoy the rest. It's a clever satire, and sometimes leaves you laughing out loud. Unlike anything else you'll read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have tried to read this book 3 times.

The characters are brilliantly thought out and he combines plots and situations very well. The statements that he makes about society in his own way are amusing and very poignant.That being said, I was expecting funny. Perhaps I have a horrible sense of humor, but I never thought I did. I didn't laugh out loud; I hardly thought the situation were funny. I tried to picture them actually happening visually, and I guess that was kind of funny, but still didn't do much for me. The characters are largely unlikeable and I didn't find myself caring about any of them; thus, I really could not get into this novel.Try it out if you want, but don't pay full price at Borders as I did."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"There is nothing that can be said about this book that has not already been said, except that I laughed until my valve shut.

Any book that says \\"Canned food is a perversion and ultimately detrimental to the soul\\" or \\"my pre-disposition to morbidity\\" is okay with me. The main character's diction was enough to make me chuckle and laugh several times through out the entire book. Not to mention the zany situations he puts himself in and how the rest of the characters interact with him.I felt that all of the cast was fun and connected to the story seamlessly. I was wondering how all of these odd-balls would congeal to create a well-paced story, but the author definitely delivered on that. The supporting cast was equally as crazy and provided a change of pace the complimented the main character Ignatius. Whether it was Jones who never took of his sunglasses or Gloria/Trixie mistress of commerce helping out with the job, this book ways always cracking me upThe characters are crazy.

I read it just because of that, knowing nothing else about the book. It is now my favorite book. I re-read it about every other year. Read it!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I first read John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces not too long after its initial publication and I remember being particularly saddened by the fact that such a talented writer had committed suicide even before his first book had been published. I found it incredibly sad that the world had been deprived of such a talent and wondered what might have been. But, despite the fact that the book has been on my shelves for more than two decades, and all my good intentions, I never got around to revisiting the book until the last couple of weeks. What finally got me off center and back into Ignatius J. Riley's world was finding an audio version of the book at my local library.A Confederacy of Dunces centers on Ignatius J. Riley, a 30-year old, over-educated mama's boy who still lives at home and refuses to work for a living, preferring instead to live off of his mother's tiny income. And those are his good points. He was further described in Library Journal as \\"a fat, flatulent, gluttonous, loud, lying, hypocritical, self-deceiving, self-centered blowhard who masturbates to memories of a dog and pretends to profundity when he is only full of beans.\\" All true enough, but the fun begins when Ignatius is suddenly arrested for vagrancy by a suspicious New Orleans policeman desperate to impress his police department superiors.Ignatius soon finds himself half-heartedly looking for gainful employment in order to help pay the damages caused when Irene, his often-tipsy mother backed into the wall of a downtown New Orleans business. Eventually Ignatius manages to find work at two different businesses desperate enough to hire even someone like him. Levy Pants and Paradise Vendors, Inc. would never be the same after Riley's few weeks as a Levy Pants file clerk and a Paradise Vendors \\"weenie vendor.\\"Along the way, we meet a cast of New Orleans characters who, for one reason or another, forever have their lives changed by coming into contact with Mr. Riley: Patrolman Mancuso who so desperately wants to arrest someone, anyone, in order to get back in uniform; Miss Trixie, near 80-years old and wondering why in the world she's not allowed to retire from Levy Pants; Darlene, the stripper who's highest ambition is to work on stage with her pet bird; Miss Lee, Darlene's employer, who has a nice little dirty picture business going on the side; Dorian Greene, a blatantly gay man who hosts a disastrous party for his friends with Ignatius as the main attraction; Gomez, the pathetic office manager at Levy Pants; Mr. Levy, inheritor and hater of the family business; Myrna, the northerner \\"girlfriend\\" whom Ignatius loves to hate; and Jones the old black man coerced by Miss Lee to work at the strip club at way less than minimum wage and who gained his ultimate revenge.It took me a while to warm up to Ignatius J. Riley because, obviously, the man doesn't have a whole lot going for him. I actively disliked him at first but he was so intriguing a character that I kept turning pages until I came to realize that my disgust for the man had turned into a strange hope that he would somehow manage to prevail in his attempts to remain a \\"free agent\\" in the world, someone above life's everyday troubles. By the end of the novel I even found myself liking the man despite his skills at so selfishly manipulating everyone around him.The audio version of A Confederacy of Dunces is read by Barrett Whitener who adds much to the book's characters by supplying them with the various ethnic accents required to fully bring them to life. In particular, Mr. Whitener made me laugh just about any time that he bellowed \\"Oh my god\\" in Riley's voice because I knew that another Ignatius J. Riley rant was on the way.John Kennedy Toole was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for A Confederacy of Dunces when it was finally published. What a shame that he was gone too soon to see it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book has one of the most memorable characters that you will ever have the opportunity of meeting; all that you really need to know is that its probably the only Pulitzer Prize winning novel that wonderfully glorifies belching and ravenous hot dog (\\"weenies\\"!) consumption.Two of the reasons to read this book are Toole's amazing wordplay and of course, Reilly himself. Toole can spin some truly hilarious imagery and I assure you, there are inspired scenes from this book that will just dance in your head. Images of Reilly will be waddling around in your mind, long after you finish the story. The story becomes almost secondary to Reilly, and its ok in this case, because he's funny, bombastic and mesmerizing enough to carry you all the way to the end. Each page is brimming with his scathing wit. There is not much more to praise that hasn't been said already, so go give this book a shot.I would have given the book 5 stars, but could not because there are moments of tedium, if only because the other characters on which Toole focuses are not nearly as engaging or excellent as Reilly. And it is precisely at these moments, when the story shifts to another character, where the story does lag a bit.However, despite that, Toole's writing crackles and propels you to finish. Reilly is an inspired creation and Toole provides sentences of sheer literary pleasure and hilarity - every insult, diatribe and idea crafted by an extremely talented wordsmith. Go get acquainted with them!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"&quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; has been one of my favotite books since we read it in my AP Literature class in High School.

Prepared to hate it every step of the way, I instead found myself mesmerized by John Kennedy Toole's marvelous writing, and especially the main character of Ignatius. At once loveable and yet heinously repulsive, this Falstaffian oddity is one of a handful of most-memorable characters to ever grace the written pages of American, and more importantly, southern literature. Why this book isn't required reading in school, along with Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; McCrae's &quot;Bark of the Dogwood,&quot; and Steinbeck's &quot;The Grapes of Wrath,&quot; is beyond me. Not only is this book funny, but the construction, the pacing, the tone, the overall effectiveness of the writing, is truly one of a kind. Forget the fact that Toole did himself in by not being able to get this masterwork published. Forget the fact that this novel won the Pulitzer Prize. Forget the reviews, both good and bad, and simply read this novel for what it is: a great, funny, rollicking journey through the land of insanity, mixed up with the great city of New Orleans and the fleeting beauty of life. Just a great read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"John Kennedy Toole's masterpiece of a novelowes its genius tothe protagonist: Ignatius J.

Toole's characters are perfectly filled out and I'm able to see the action taking place as I read. Treat yourself. Read the book."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Toole's Confederacy of Dunces is an amusing read with fascinating characters and witty dialogue. Although I did not find myself laughing as much as I expected, as I progressed further into the novel, I became entertained by my growing sense on disgust towards the main character, Ignatius. Ignatius J. Reilly is not the average bum that cannot succeed in life. In addition to being rude, fat inconsiderate man who lives off of his mother, his interests reside within the middle ages and criticizing everyone and everything around him. He is a pudgy bum with an opinion, and the bulk of the humor from the novel comes from his arguments with various people, or complaints about health problems with his valve. Ignatius' strange enjoyments such as masturbating to thoughts of his dog and extreme comments are hilarious. Ignatius replies to the policeman that complains about his lack of work, \\"Do you realize that he is trying to destroy our home?\\"The central theme of the novel is that people congregate against those with different ideals. Toole begins his novel with a quote from Jonathan Swift, stating, \\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.\\" Swift suggests that idiots outcast a true genius because his ideals are unusual. The novel is full of unique characters that get pushed away because of their differences. The genius is not necessarily a person who is more intelligent than the rest, he is the person that singled out because he thinks differently. Ignatius may not seem like a genius because his ideas are very random. Actually, he seems to be a large, unhygienic buffoon with insane ideas, but he definitely is strong-minded about his opinions. He is unique because his beliefs do not conform to the people that surround him and he is not afraid to voice them. If Ignatius' comedic dialogue does not grab you, the stories of these bizarre characters will keep you captivated."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Interesting Book. Tough to digest it if you don't understand the many jokes. I must say, Toole's Confederacy of Dunces was entertaining. It definitely is a Confederacy of Dunces against Reilly in my opinion. No one understands the old soul's ideas in his modern world. He wants to revolutionize the industry, the world, the universe and no one understands him. It is unfortunate that he does not understand the time that he is in. The novel is definitely an original, and it is unfortunate that Toole was not able to see it published in his life time. Read it in a quiet atmosphere when you have a chance and you will find yourself laughing out loud."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Confederacy Of Dunces kept me laughing the entire novel. Ignatius may be the funniest character I have ever encountered reading a book. He seems to be made for a movie. Too bad John Kennedy Toole couldnt stay alive to capatilize on that opportunity.My favorite characteristic about Ignatius was the constant referal to his troublsome valve. His continual weirdness and stuborness make this novel funny.The plot is slow, but like most comedies it is not important. The characters are what makes this novel interesting. I highly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius J Reilly is fat. Ignatius is lazy. He is slothful, arrogant, condescending, self-obsessed, self-absorbed, incapable of empathy, calculating, ignorant, deluded and did I mention obese? After all but causing a car accident thanks to his tendency to 'aid' people with their driving, his mother demands that the unemployed, thirty-year old get a job. He is horrified, certain that gainful employment will disrupt the sporadic work he does on his masterpiece. And of course there is the problem with his valve.So he finds himself a job. He breezes into the Levy Pants company and demands more pay, later starting time, and then spends his days carefully painting a cross to cheer everyone up. Then he incites a riot. Then he gets fired.This first job sets a lot of events in motion. Characters are introduced and frequently we enter their lives to see what is happening. This has the effect of diluting Ignatius' presence from the story - but only slightly - however the compromise here is that we know it will all tie in together - we just don't know how.There is Jones, the black floor-sweeper at the Night of Joy, quite possibly the worst strip-club in all of New Orleans. Mr Levy, the disillusioned son of the original - and best, if we can believe his wife - Mr Levy. George, the mysterious package deliverer. Mancuso, the down on his luck detective, and more. Excluding Jones, these characters all have sub-par development as character, and serve mostly as caricatures. This goes even more so for the lesser characters I have not mentioned.Events do tie themselves up a little too neatly. There is a sense that every little action, no matter how inconsequential, builds towards a whole, which doesn't really reflect the reality of life, but this is a moot point. Ignatius is an amazing character, so awful, arrogant and just plain mean to every other person imaginable that you will have to fall in love. Who cannot enjoy his Working Boy Journals? Or his love/hate relationship with Myrna? Don't necessarily read this book for plot - which, though strong, plays out like a 1 hour crime special - read it for Ignatius."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces written by John Kennedy Toole won the Pulitzer Prize and sold more than 1.5 million copies through more than 20 languages (Dunce). This book was published eleven years after the author's death by his mother and was the author's first book (Dunce). There is more than a humor in A Confederacy of Dunces. This book is typical American modern literature and contains many elements to be a good literature. Ignatius J. Reilly, a hero of this book, is a fool, but he thinks that other peoples except him are fools. As the title infers, it is the confederacy of dunces. Who's right? There is no answer. It is the way it is; an answer follows the numbers in modern society.Ignatius J. Reilly lives with his mamma even though he's already in his age of thirty. He spends most of the day writing a book locked in his room. Ignatius is a fool in this book. Even though he has doctor's degree and graduated from college, he is a fool. What is the standard of stupid and genius? If one is not fit in the society, he can be regarded as a fool like Ignatius. The people who is unique or fools as people say, are the brave people who start something different before the ordinary men. The man who first asserted that the earth was spinning was called a fool. The man who first walked by two legs was considered to a fool. One who quitted one's business, who left school, who started a new business were all called fools and pointed with scorn. The author titled his book A Confederacy of Dunces not A Dunce of Confederacy. Who are the dunces? What if this book is read few decades later? Is Ignatius going to be still regarded as a fool? The author approaches to the readers with a very deep subject. A Confederacy of Dunces is a great novel. Even though there is not much happenings and exciting in it, it has humor and makes readers keep think.Ignatius is a unique character. He is a hero of this book, but he has too many handicaps to be a hero. He doesn't have any good side in a word. This book is a satire of this world. According to the introduction of this book in the backside, Ignatius is a later-day Don Quixote. My uncle has invited to read the Don Quixote to me, saying whenever he spent hard times and when he failed something, he read the Don Quixote and was encouraged by reading it. That is now understandable."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Funny in parts. Weird in parts. Sometimes I asked myself why I was reading this; other times I felt compelled to read more.

Toole killed himself at the foot of the street I live on in Biloxi, MS. I wish I could have been there when he looped the garden hose from the exhaust pipe through the window into the car. I would have begged him not to give in to the depression. To write, more. Much, much more."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is all 10 on the list of my top ten favorites. There is nothing I can really add to all the adulation it has received - but I do think that the personal attacks on the people who 'don't get it' are uncalled for. This book, besides being very funny, touches the reader very deeply psychologically in a manner that I relate to but that others might find completely foriegn.My real reason for adding my voice is to let readers know that I have recently read another book whose protaganist is very reminicient of Ignatius. The book, Nevermore by Harold Schechter, is a mystery pairing Edgar Allan Poe and Davy Crockett who pool their very different talents to solve a mystery. As implausible as this seems, somehow it works.Poe (the teller of the tale) is a skinny, bibulous Ignatius and some of his conversations with his aunt could have come straight from Comfederacy. Poe could match vocabulary with Ignatius word for word and even possibly come out on top. It is a real challange to see how often you are forced to reach for the dictionary of the obscure. Davy Crockett is quoted as using my very favorite obscure word: absquatulate, which means, as far as I can remember, to leave hurriedly in order to avoid apprehension - literally to go off and squat elsewhere. Not only does the author use the word, which I have never seen ANYWHERE, he has Davy misprounce it as 'absquottleated.' Oh, I think I'm in love.In short, if you love Confederacy I think you will enjoy this book also."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The charector is a little too annoying, and maybe that makes this book so appealing to others. If you enjoyed \\"Catch 22\\" you should find this pleaseing after you get through the first third of the book.

Given the circumstances the book was written under, (a story as interesting as the book) this is a nice book that takes place in an time period of New Orleans that is rarely painted.The charector who lives in a self absorbed world where he could solve any problem if only anyone would listen to him, stumbles in and out of fringe social circles and environs haphazardly leaving a wake of confusion while remaining ignorant of his butterfly effect all the while.This would be a great introduction to dark humor and irony for a younger reader, but this may take a bit of pateince if you already have a firm background in Vonnegut, Heller, and the like."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I'd been curious about this book for the past couple of years or so, mainly on the strength of its breathless cover blurbs, its reviews on this page, and what little I knew about the author's short life.

I don't regret having read this book, but I wouldn't go so far as &quot;brilliant&quot; or &quot;hilarious&quot;; I'd draw the line at clever, well-crafted, and droll. While I never laughed out loud, I often smiled. Toole's command of the English language, his eye for detail, and his ear for dialect are all well-employed. Pity all the characters are so unpleasant! You laugh AT these people, most comfortably from a distance. My main regret is that Toole didn't live to write a sequel; I can... or really, can't... imagine what messes Ignatius would get into in NYC."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Great book!! Takes a certain sense of humor to appreciate, very dry and witty. Will have you rolling with laughter. And this was written 40 yrs ago? Gotta check this one out."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I thought this book was genius, but not everyone will agree. Great characters, quirky story line. My advice - read it and see for yourself. A little background - author committed suicide, mom cleans out room years later, finds book, takes it to local college professor. It is published and author wins PULITZER posthumously. PLEASE OH PLEASE DO NOT LET ADAM SANDLER MAKE THIS INTO A MOVIE AND TOTALLY RUIN IT FOR ME!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It engages that literary proclivity of really long novels without much of a working plot. This makes for a book of collected series of related scenes that are often insightful and funny independent of the whole, but also don't really serve the whole, at least not toward some end. It's a little like a Monty Python movie. You watch it, waiting for something to happen, and when nothing does - again, nothing happens toward some greater arc of storytelling - it seems like a bad movie. But then we remember specific scenes, and maybe watch the movie again, this time not worrying about the plot, resulting in heightened esteem. So goes my thesis about why people like Monty Python.Funny as Dunces often proves to be, it is a joyless book. Riley is a narcissist bordering on sociopathic, and to endure that, without the pull or guiding light of a plot, will make this an unfun book for most readers. The dialogue has a great ring, but the characters are a pinch to mean, or pathetic, or stupid to be real. It also, rather ironically considering the linguistic verisimilitude, makes New Orleans feel like a fictitious place.And so Confederacy of Dunces isn't so much a story as a presentation of Ignatius Riley. It is often hilariously sardonic and clever, but seems to be answering unasked questions about the race of Jabba the Hutt. This book is the quotidian dealings of an average \\"Hutt.\\" If Jabba hadn't gone into loan-sharking, this is what his life might have been."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I love this book and wanted to give my 93 yr young housemate the chance to read it.This large print WAS NOT large at all.I then had to buy her a magnifying glass."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Tiny print, but worth the eye strain. Great conversations in this book, funny, intelligent. Hard to think of a charachter that disgusts as much as Ignatious."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"While this novel was comical and the writing flows, the story never goes anywhere from that point on. It just keeps going and going and things seem to stay the same until the very end. It is essentially a single thought played out with almost no variations until the very end. It was an enjoyable read until maybe one third of the book. The author probably should've ended it there. Three stars."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I read this for our book club- and it has been my least favorite book so far - felt like a complete waste of time - yes the story was at least interesting at parts - but overall felt like a waste of time."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is a masterpiece of literature.

It was a chore reading this book even though I was on a six hour train ride"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"You either &quot;get it&quot;, or you don't. Some people will walk away from this great book shaking their heads with incomprehension, &quot;how is this a great book?&quot;, they'll mutter to themselves.Like parents from 35 years ago who couldn't understand what the attraction was with 4 guys with long hair from Liverpool- those &quot;who don't get it&quot; will be puzzled at joy of those who do.This book is a great way to make friends- those who &quot;get it&quot;, not only share a love at poking fun at the absurdities of life, they are simply more aware of what the true absurdities are.I am tempted to suggest that the like or dislike of this novel is the best indicator of one's intellectual and emotional acumen.

The hero, Ignatius Reilly, is a big, selfish loser with amazing intelligence and a hilarious weltanschaang. This book is about him having to get a job due to a car accident his mother had, while attempting to write a book on the misery of the 20th century. This novel is full of side stories and irony. The characters are all remarkable, Ignatius most of all. I laughed until I cried many times when he expressed his opinions on his New Orleans environment. My favorite line is when he lies to his mother about injuries from a cat he received as a hot dog vendor, &quot;I had a rather apocalyptic battle with a starving prostitute. But for my superior brawn, I would have been overpowered. She fled the scene, her rags askew.&quot; Isn't that a scream? This book is a must read, but for the less well-read, I strongly recommend building up a vocabulary, keeping an open mind, and to try to see past the vulgarity of Ignatius."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Simply the best book I have ever read. An absolute joy from cover to cover."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"In a sentence, this novel BLEW me away! I thought that a Prize winning novel would be stogy and intellectually stimulating or code for a (snooze fest). I love Ignatius and his quirky character. Think of this novel as a George Castanza meets Frankenstein. The characters are quirky and Hilarious. J.KT creates long passages of dialogue between Ignatius (the pigheaded fool) and his neighbors, mother, bosses, co-workers, strippers, police and girlfriend, all with hilarious outcome.Ignatius just has to open his mouth even when you know he should keep quite. He is Fat, Lazy, cheap, arrogant and a genius with Diction. I had to use a dictionary in some instances just to follow his words. But this is a novel where his miserable behavior doesn't go unpunished. For the life of me I can't understand why this was never made into a movie, play and even a musical. The Misadventures of Ignatius Reilly. This is one of my favorite novels I have ever READ PERIOD!!!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Perhaps rivaled in form, substance, and functionality only by Boethius's The Consolation of Philosophy and Heller's Catch-22, John Kennedy Toole's epic masterpiece A Confederacy of Dunces singularly stands atop the literary world, towering ominously, yet benevolently, over the strewn remnants of the offensive literary abortions that preceded it, save the aforementioned works of taste and decency. Toole's tale winds and weaves through the variegated slums and ghettoes of New Orleans from the majestic worldview of its muscularly medieval protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly. Ignatius's Boethian philosophy underpins the majority of Toole's opus and quite easily trumps the mongoloid worldviews of the novel's brilliantly cast, yet sub-human, side characters. Certainly ahead of its (and our) time, Toole's work speaks eloquently and accurately on the degeneration of modern society and its precarious perch on the edge of the abyss of distaste and indecency. The antidote to the crises of today, as manifested in the eructative and spellbindingly brilliant stylings of our seminally transcendent raissoneur, are eminently simple and necessarily functional- theology and geometry. These two life-guides are perhaps the essence of Toole's novel, a masterfully complex and tragicomic meditation on the social and political state of the world."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is the dogs undercarriage, I laughed so hard my pyloric valve snapped shut. Ignatius is a comic masterpiece and probably the funniest character I have ever encountered. His work for Levy Pants will leave you in stitches. Read this book. If you don't like it, you're obviously a mongoloid."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"As Andrei Codrescu points out in his new introduction to the 20th anniversary edition, this book could not be published today. It's simply too offensive to contemporary feelings about sexuality, race, and politics. The same goes for several other beloved comedy classics of the '60's and '70's: Mel Brooks' &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, the albums of Richard Pryor, you name it. And isn't that a sad comment on our paranoid, oversensitive popular culture of the &quot;90's."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I just want to say that, as all you can see in this reviewing site, if you look at all the rankings, there are a lot of possibilities you are goning to love this work. I can assure you that all of the people that not liked this work, are the kind of people that didn't like the Quixote or Ulysses.So, they have to hate it because they didn't get it, and have to hate the people that got the point of this book.It is about the Odyssey of a fighter against our absurd world.I think all the people that hate the book because of their mental poverty, are the Dunces still confederating against Toole, like we know the dunces confederated against him through his attempts to publish his book during his final years. So, thank all of you Dunces, maybe you not only helped him to die, but you helped him to give us this masterpiece.And, like someone below said, cancel your next three days appointments, you won't be available."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"If you love intelligent humor that holds something new at each reading then you MUST NOT PASS UP THIS OPPORTUNITY. Quite possibly the funniest book I have ever read. Brimming with oddball characters of every description and scenarios beyond belief this book is the Mona Lisa of humorous literature. Uproarously hilarious! The tragedy is that Mr. Toole's literary career was cut short by his untimely death."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"In fact, this novel is so good it is now one of my most favorites, even though my first impression of the book was that trying it was a mistake.I had recently been disappointed by another novel, Catch-22. A Confederacy of Dunces had the same light, comical tone as Catch-22, but the subject of it, Ignatius P. Reilly, was a character more grotesque (it seemed to me) than any of the numerous annoying characters in Catch-22. I was expecting the worst.However, as I read on, I gradually and unconsciously began to really enjoy the story. The novel quickly developed an interesting main plot, along with many interesting subplots. I met many characters, and found myself very interested in them and in what would happen to them. The writing style was excellent, and there were some sections where the writing was awesome (such as the section where we first meet Dr. Talc). The novel was also very funny.The best part of this novel was the ending, where all the little subplots fall together into a great conclusion. I think it's one of the best endings ever. (I've seen some reviewers call this a canned Hollywood ending. It isn't, any more than the ending of, say, The Tempest was. The ending was well supported by the story.)In addition to being a highly engaging book with a great ending, there was a kind of indescribable unity to it, that was very delightful. I guess the best way I can put it is that all the characters shared a common &quot;dunceness&quot; that made them all somehow related to each other.Basically, I think this was just a great novel."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Initially, one is tempted to regard the protagonist Ignatius as a vile, offensive slob, but as you continue, you come to admire him for his gall, his meanness, his bloated self-confidence and his overwhelming self-righteousness. The plaisir du texte is of course, enhanced by the wonderful interweaving web of plot and subplots, and by the colourful array of characters. This is one of those rare novels that becomes so addictive that you compulsively read on between the fits of hysterical laughter. Not one word is unnecessary, not once sentence is superfluous. It is in fact, absolutely brilliant and for someone like myself who has no intention of reading Rabelais or Cervantes, it is sufficient. I recommend it also as a very effective cure for depression."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is the greatest book ever. Truly a masterpiece. Sad to know that John Kennedy Toole committed suicide over his depression when he could not get it published, then his mother took on the quest, got it published posthumously, and it won the Pulitzer Prize! I have read most of the Pulitzer books, and this is one that really truly deserves it. Read it, you will certainly be well entertained."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Don't be dissuaded from owning this book and consequently not being able to share it with kindred spirits. Reviewers &quot;egreg1&quot; and &quot;A Reader&quot; don't get it. This Pulitzer Prize winning kind of humor must be too sophisticated for their limited world view. From reading their &quot;thoughts&quot;, I would conjecture they have a problem with the &quot;politically incorrect&quot; nature of many of the sentiments of our protagonist. This book was written in the sixties and is a fiction.And what a gem it is. I have read it twice now, and will I'm sure, read it again and again. There is not a boring page or line in the book. You can open to just about anywhere and crack a smile. The first time I read this classic I was on a plane laughing out loud. People around me demanded to know what I was reading.People who do not genuinely enjoy this master work say more about themselves than about the author."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A brilliant social satire, Confederacy of the Dunces is about a one-man struggle against mediocrity. The novel is intelligent and hilarious. It is intelligently hilarious and hilariously intelligent.Each character is fully established and so vividly described that you can't be indifferent to any of them. YOu will never forget the intellectually arrogant Ignatius Reilly.He may be fat, slob and ugly but his knowledge of philosophy, to me, warrants his superiority complex.The circumstances behind how the novel got published --the admirable persistence of O'Toole's mother and all ---is itself a moving story. Too bad John Kennedy O'Toole is no longer alive to give us more."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius F. Reilly is undoubtedly one of the finest comic creations I have ever encountered. As one reviewer all too accurately points out, the word &quot;valve&quot; will never quite seem the same. I found our anti-hero far from annoying, unlike everybody else it would seem, but I did have trouble sticking to the book. The characters are for the most part colourful, albeit fairly thin (except the rounded kook himself!), however for some reason I just didn't feel the impetus to keep on going. I did persevere but only because I didn't want to miss anything more from Ignatius, for example I skipped through most of his peace party launch - I just couldn't be bothered. I think that where the &quot;plot&quot; is advanced the characterisation has to take the back seat and it is the latter which makes the book. I would still recommend that you read this book, it would be a shame not to have acquainted yourself with the strangest protagonist in literature, you might even find a little piece of yourself in him."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"John Kennedy Toole committed a crime against seriousness. His novel is hilarious, though, I think it becomes less hilarious with time because our society is evolving in the direction he showed as being an extreme margin. It is the story of Ignatius Jacques Reilly, an educated scholar who is completely out of joint and out of work in a society that does not want to recognize his value. He is divided between a terroristic mother and an anarchistic girl friend. And we are in New Orleans. There is no room in our society for those marginal intellectuals who see the world as a big boiling pot of normalization, and yet this world is divided in all kinds of pleasure groups. He is revulsed by those pleasures, so he is homophobic, he is misogynistic, he is anti-anything that may appear under the sun and that does not recognize him as a genius. His mother forces him into the working world and every attempt at doing something financially profitable will turn sour because he will only be guided by his desire to transform the world, to make it what he wants it to be. He is neurotic, for sure, but also psychotic but a strange psychosis that makes him commit a constant and repetitive social suicide in the name of his unrecognized genius and personality. Some other characters around him are a lot more hilarious than he is. The undercover cop is pathetic in his attempt to achieve something valuable though he is only able to follow and suffer the trend that would eventually lead him to destruction. Luckily Ignatius is here and leads him to rings of illegal perverts : child pornography, pire violence, etc. There is also a fabulous bourgeois or industrialist who survives from nothing, except his inheritance, but who is salvaged by Ignatius who causes a great crisis with one of his clients. This crisis will lead to pure injustice, though also pure justice : retiring an old senile secretary who accepts to take one of Ignatius' provocations on her shoulders to be retired. But the Levy of Levy Pants finally finds some energy and invents Levy Shorts that will be a success because of his newly-found entrepreneurial energy. The mother is pathetic in her motherly love and her desire to get rid of the weight that her son represents to her. And all that is caused by a grownup teenager who could not grow over his father's death when he was young, and then his dog's death when he was still in high-school. Then he got in connection with another anarchistic mind, a girl, and fell in love with her but the clash between the two anarchism led her to go back to New York, and yet to retain the relation, and yet to come at the last minute and salvage him from internment in a psychiatric hospital. He escapes this cp&ugrave;^metely destructive environment because and thanks to her. But this book is a deep reflection on society. Our society, in the name of post-modernistic individualism leads to a complete control of individuals provided they stick to their little cubicles and their preformatted attitudes. Then they are aithorized to do all kind of private capers, provided they are completely cut-off from mainstrema diversified normalization. They have to be consciously and willingly schizophrenic to survive in society and have their pleasures in the dark night margins of this society. Such a world is unbearably crazy and this denunciation of post-modernism is an inspiring ray of sunshine in the darkest pit of all. It is this aging and improving of this dramatic analysis of our modern society that makes this book a piece of unforgettable art. But beware ! Do not identify with any character if you do not want to become as crazy as they are, as disruptive as they are and as much of misfits as they are. If you cannot live up to sane schizophrenia, you better leave and go back to your death chamber of an isolating cell.

This book has nothing in common with To Say Nothing of the Dog; and I don't know what makes A Confederacy of Dunces (or any book) win the Pulitzer.The main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, is articulate. That is about the only thing he has going for him. He is rude, obese, condescending, masochistic, disgusting and deluded. Believing himself better than everyone and everything he comes across, Ignatius finds himself in a series of odd situations. He sees every movie that comes out, only to shout at the screen &quot;What is this filmed abortion?!&quot; His &quot;valve&quot; closes and causes bloating every time he is faced with something he doesn't like (which is all the time).Ignatius' long-suffering mother tells him to find a job. Despite his odd Oedipal attachment (he is 30 and still lives with his mom), Ignatius screams that she should be lashed for such a suggestion. His first job is at the failing Levy Pants, to do filing. He spends his time creating signs and crosses from cardboard and &quot;files&quot; papers into the garbage. Ignatius' second job is as a hot-dog vendor; he refuses to sell them and eats them all himself. He writes diatribes about the world around him, and progressively gets more and more crazed. His rude, articulate speeches are hilarious in his delusion of self-importance.&quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; is filled with other crazed characters: Ignatius' mother, a policeman forced to go undercover in silly disguises, the ancient Miss Trixie and a professor who doesn't quite seem to fit in to the story. As someone else noted, several characters rely on out-dated stereotypes (a gay man and a black man). This, unfortunately, detracts from otherwise fascinating charaterization. All the characters are linked by Ignatius -- and the complete havoc he wreaks on their lives. Everything Ignatius leaves in his wake comes crashing together in the end.Was this book well-written? Definitely. Was it fast-paced and interesting? Yes. Was it funny, witty and sarcastic? Yes. My only problem is that it's difficult to separate my feelings toward Ignatius from my feelings toward the book. I couldn't stand Ignatius. John Kennedy Toole did a brilliant job creating Ignatius (someone so preposterous yet so believable). Ignatius made me groan and laugh at the same time. I loved the characterization, but I hated Ignatius."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book was recommended to me by a highly intelligent person who previously had turned me on to &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; and &quot;the Fountainhead.&quot; So when she told me about a novel entitled &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces,&quot; I envisioned the story of a rugged, heroic individualist's trek to find worthy comrades in the world. This thought was reinforced by the Jonathan Swift quote on the opening cover page- &quot;When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign- that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.&quot; Was I ever shocked to discover that this &quot;genius&quot; would be Ignatius J. Reilly, scumbag-at-large- and that the whole book is merely a play on the hero theme and a delve into the psyche of a man who believes himself to be misunderstood, but who is in fact just a loser.Ignatius Reilly is an overeducated, underworked, completely unhygienic slob whose musings about the world and arcane references to the Fortuna-worshipping, Roman chronicler/philosopher Boethius underscore his superiority complex. Graduate school has not prepared Ignatius very well for the job market, and his main purpose in life is to earn just enough money to a) keep his mother off his back (he gets his first job at age 30) and b) pay admission to the movies so that he can jeer the latest Debbie Reynolds flick. Of course, the world of employment will also prove to be a treasure chest of material for Ignatius's treatise on the history of the world (whose thesis is that we were better off as medieval serfs), a work which will finally vanquish his nemesis (or is she?), the hippie Myrna Minkoff. The workplace misadventures are wilder than any I've heard in life and hysterically funny... you may never trust the new employee with your filing again. Also, I always take a second look at the Shea Stadium hotdog vendors before buying one these days.Jones made me crack up, and Miss Trixie is hilarious, especially in that I once worked with a woman who must be her twin sister, separated at birth. Say what you want about the book's candidacy as a literary classic, but it made me laugh (out loud, and in a public place), made me think, and drew me in deeply enough to constantly curse at Mrs. Levy, the woman who thinks that enrolling in (and failing) a correspondence course in psychology qualifies her as an expert on human behavior.Overall, it's a good book which I will read again. I recommend it to anyone with enough intelligence to realize that humor can still be very funny without being highbrow."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This is an amusing social commentary. The main character, Ignatius Jefferson Reilly, is a born loser. He is convinced that humanity was better off during the Middle Ages. Toole could not have chosen a more appropriate sletting for this novel: the seedy and licentious city of New Orleans. Reilly is humorous (I actually laughed out loud) not because he is fat and lazy, but rather he is acutely accurate, albeit morose in his judgement of human nature and personal character. He is also extrordinarily articulate. I hope they never try to make a movie out of this book because the Hollywood establishment would surely spoil it. Besides, Reilly would be furious. Highly recommended as an American classic."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"In a lifetime of reading, there is no book I have ever read that has made me laugh out loud more than this book.

Reilly stumbles through life leaving an unrecognizable trail of folly. A Confederacy of Dunces, by John Kennedy Toole, is the story of Ignatius J. Reilly. His trials and tribulations, as well as comical interactions with individuals provide for an amusing story line. His escapades lead him to obtain different jobs throughout the story, which is the basis for the majority of his predicaments. Despite not being the most favorable employee, he is able to find work at a number of different locations. One job, at a trousers factory, ends up being a monumental mistake in his career.The author's use of language adds immensely to the wittiness of the story. Toole injects an immaculate vocabulary into Ignatius, which can be seen in his ability to make fun of situations that occur in his presence. One experience Ignatius has rather periodically is conversations with a fellow friend, Myrna Minkoff. They confer through a series of letters, debating on opinions about differing social and political beliefs; \\"Do you seriously think that I am interested in your tawdry encounters with such sub-humans as folksingers? In every letter of yours I seem to find some references to the sleaziness of your personal life.\\"Toole adds many characters that add to the effects of Ignatius's absurdity. From his disbelieving mother to an honest hot dog vendor, Ignatius seems to blight everyone's lives he comes in contact with. He habitually relates the capricious wavering of events in his life to Fortuna, a sort of good or bad luck decision maker. This provides many comical encounters within his mind. Whether it be relating this downward spin of Fortuna to getting fired from one of his jobs, or his constantly deteriorating health, Ignatius transmits these episodes to the world around him, and this is usually rather negative; \\"A firm rule must be imposed upon our nation before it destroys itself. The United States needs some theology and geometry, some taste and decency. I suspect that we arte teetering on the edge of abyss.\\" Upon finishing this book, I have a greater appreciation of the simp0le story. Toole uses a mastery of language, comic relief, and interesting philosophies in his characters, and they fuse together to make an entertaining narrative."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces. John Kennedy Toole. New York: Grove Press, 1980. 394 pages.It's unfortunate that John Kennedy Toole took his life before this Pulitzer Prized book was published. His unique perspectives could have been useful to better the mentality of contemporary culture. This fictional novel, valuable to any reader, focuses on the ridiculous tragedies of a hedonist society. Taking place in New Orleans, the focal point of the story is Ignatius J. Reilly, an absurdly irrational man. Throughout the whole book, Toole emphasizes the ironic connection between Ignatius' rash disgruntlement and his lack of productivity. Even though it's arduous to read at times, John Kennedy Toole's book, A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES, is of immense value.Ignatius Reilly is a 33 year-old porcine slob who still lives with his mother. He is educated and has potential, but does little to better his withering life. When forced, Ignatius holds menial jobs, but ruins the continuance of the companies and coworkers. Mrs. Reilly, his mother, explains her son's damaging assessment as, \\"It's a good thing his poor poppas dead. He'd be breaking his poor father's heart with that weenie wagon.\\"(p 202) Throughout the book, Ignatius' legendary presence is even enough to perturb the paltry existence of all the supporting characters: his mother, his employers, and several other random acquaintances. Virtually all of Ignatius' mishaps stem from his dissatisfaction with a society that won't tend to his every desire.A parallel can be drawn with Toole's ultimate frustration with society and Ignatius' actions. The novel encompasses a vast irony that displays a pleasure seeking society that blames everything else, but neglects to mend internally. Ignatius, who is only one example of the bigger whole, lashes out and dissects every imperfection of others but refuses to work on his own varied faults. Ignatius and America are seemingly comparable: massive, manipulative, parochial, and reluctant to take negative responsibility. Toole illustrates this metaphor possibly to provoke some sort of realization, but ultimately it overwhelms him. He was a genius and Jonathan Swift in \`Thoughts on Various Subjects, Moral and Diverting' describes that burden best, \\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.\\"John Kennedy Toole's fictional novel, A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES, is one of merit. The 394 pages seem to drag on at times, but only to completely portray a valuable lesson; the need to focus inwardly, personally and entirely, is urgent. I recommend this book to anyone, for this kind of enlightenment must be spread in order for a revitalization of American way. I'm only sorry that Toole's perspective now only carries on through Ignatius, because it is vivid, original, and practical. A friend of Toole's, David Kubach, describes Toole's noble trouble in an autobiography, \\"He did not suffer fools gladly, and I think he was afraid of becoming one. He couldn't live with that.\\""},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole is a book with a type of humor not found in many other books and it will make you laugh unlike any other type of humor. The book is about the fashionably plump, main character Ignatius who creates problems for others because of his unusual view of the world and his dedication to change it to fit his views. Ignatius still lives with his mother even though he has graduated from college with a master's degree. His mother, Mrs. Reilly, forces him to get a job after an accident involving a building and her car, which both need to be repaired. Given they are a poor family with no father, the mother tells Ignatius to get a job. Ignatius first gets a job filing at a pant manufacturing company called Levy pants. Mr. Levy decides it is not a good idea to hire Ignatius after he forges a letter and sends it to a client of Levy pants who responds with a $500 thousand lawsuit. Once Ignatius is fired, he gets a second job as a hot dog street vendor in New Orleans where the book takes place. He eats most of his merchandise and becomes even heavier. Ignatius is fired from this job when he appears in the newspaper passed out from shock in front of The Night of Joy on Bourbon Street. This is a book that will keep you laughing given the dark humor with which it is written. Additionally, it will make you thankful that you are not as lazy as Ignatius Reilly."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Intelligence doesn't always provide you with a money making job. People have to be willing to work with their colleagues to get things done. John Kennedy Toole creates for us in his book A Confederacy of Dunces a character named Ignatius J. Reilly who has the opportunity to work but doesn't. The reason he doesn't is because he can't seem to get along with the people he works with. People come to dislike him because of his behavior and his physical attributes. As a person he belittles his friends and his colleagues, he will not listen to any one who challenges his word, and he is just down right lazy: a sloth of a sophisticate.Ignatius J. Reilly distinguishes himself as a philosopher, a bourgeoisie, and a genius. He is none of the above. In reality he is just an overweight man who lives with his mother, and gets carried away in his imagination. As a person though, he believes that he is a figure of much importance. When he is let loose on the streets of New Orleans people ignore him and laugh at his ideas. Those who he comes to know, though, hate him because of his overly conservative view on life. He creates trouble for himself when he writes an obnoxious letter of complaint, gets fired for leading a mock strike, tries to create a political party, and upsets his mother.He loves to express his own opinions much like this one, \\"I refuse to \`look up.' Optimism nauseates me. It is perverse. Since man's fall, his proper position in the universe has been one of misery\\" (59). It is because of these opinions he is disliked by people in general. In one passage of the book he compares himself with African Americans. \\"In a sense I have always felt something of a kinship with the colored race because its position is the same as mine: we both exist outside the inner realm of the American society\\" (122). They are both outcasts. African Americans are disliked because of their skin color, and he is disliked because of his radical opinions.There are not many people who like him and want to help him. His mother and a friend from University are the only ones who seem to care for him. His friend from University had this to say to him in a letter she wrote: \\"Realize that life is surging around you. The valve closes because it thinks it is living in a dead organism. Open your heart Ignatius and you will open your valve\\" (215). Ignatius doesn't listen to most advice except for this piece given from an old friend. He decides to accomplish something for himself out in the big bad world, and this is when he tries to create a political party. Countless times Ignatius has tried to succeed at something and has failed miserably. His mother wishes he would seek out psychological help for his faults. Ignatius however, accepts his faults and lives with them, and having somebody try to change him as a person would kill his character. This is why he feels angered by his mother's solution to all his problems. \\"...Striving is ultimately meaningless...we must learn to accept\\" (298). Ignatius wants his mother to accept him as the person he already is. His mother is unwilling to accept the son that she gave birth to.As an early twentieth century book A Confederacy of Dunces illustrates how people acted after the World Wars. People were beginning to criticize each other about their personal lives, religion and political view. African Americans were just starting to be accepted in society. One of the major out-lying themes in the book and the time period for that matter is acceptance. How did people accept each person's problem? John Kennedy Toole shows us with the characters of this book how each person dealt with another person's problem. The book itself may be heavy reading and somewhat confusing but it is well worth reading. It reminds us of how life has changed since the post World War Era, and it covers many themes of today that people in general can relate too."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Ignatius J. Reilly is one of the best characters in a book, ever! The absurdities he deals with are a riot and kept me laughing throughout. Strange people, stranger jobs... the way he deals with it all brings to mind two other book characters, Eddie Delano in John Orozco's \`Delano' and Lenny Castellaneta's factitious self portrait in \`No One's Even Bleeding'. All of these men try to make sense of bizarre situations they encounter in their lives. It's amazing, though, how well \`Dunces' holds up over the years.

The plot revolves around his various attempts to hold jobs while living at home with his increasingly suspicious mother. The book's episodic events explode one after the other like fire works. Every line of dialogue is perfectly hilarious. Indeed, the entire story delights in the reverabations of It's voices. An array of strange charcters, each with his or her own personal agenda regarding Ignatius, parade through the story. Kennedy's greatest creation is the mother of Ignatius, Mrs. Reilly. A woman determined to see her son make good. Kennedy has rendered The banter between mother and son in such a way so as to be both full of pathos and heart breakingly funny.

John Kennedy Toole deserves to be placed among the greatest authors of all time."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Well whats the making of a great novel? Well I laughed out loud many times I got mad many times,and even felt sympathy. In my mind thats the making of a great novel.

I got it ages ago, loaned it to a friend who misplaced it, and made her life so miserable that she bought me another copy.I re-listen every so often, and am currently doing so again -- at the risk of terrifying everyone on the 101 Freeway as I laugh and scream all the way to work! I'm curious about the new audio version and wonder about the movie that's been promised for years, but I never tire of Johnson's vocal characterizations -- from pompous Ignatius to the porter Jones, the gay man in the French Quarter, Mrs. Reilly, Miss Trixie, and the great Santa Battaglia -- they're all fabulous....I just talked myself into buying a used back-up copy.

It was humorous, insightful and greatly entertaining. I recommend this for young adult readers."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I will now add to the long list of praise for this masterpiece of contemporary American literary humor. However, in addition to finding it hilarious, I found it to be a poignant tale of a dreamer locked into an unaccepting world. I thought that Ignatius could represent anyone striving for greatness in a world that does not understand him. I also found the other characters to be quite realistic and well-developed in their own silly ways. This story stereotypes everyone, and it does it well.

I am to A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES what middle-aged, beehived, pointy boobed women are to Elvis! I've read thousands of books in my life, but this one will stay with me forever. It's a tragedy that Toole did not live to receive the acclaim he deserves."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Amazon does not provide enough stars on the scale for this book. A true American literary masterpiece. Goodman or Candy as Reilly does his character no justice. I think Robin Williams (admittedly in a fat suit) could better convey the underlying poignancy associated with the character. I pray they don't King Ralph it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"It's Ignatius J. Reilly versus the French Quarter. It's Ignatius J. Reilly versus the erotic Myrna Minkoff. Ignatius is a severely overweight man with an intolerable problem with his pyloric valve. One wrong emotion and it clasps shut and traps odoriferous gases inside his gigantic body. A wheel of fortune spins to define Ignatius' next move. He is forced, for the first time, to work for his money in lieu of sponging off of his poor mother. The real world is cruel to him, but eventually he finds his calling as a hot dog vendor, pushing a cart with the words \\"Twelve inches to paradise\\" scribbled on it. This is the story of man who cannot be accepted and therefore cannot except. John Kennedy Toole was a genius of the novel. He writes as a contemporary Charles Dickens. His satirical style is serious yet hilarious at the same time. A Confederacy of Dunces is by far the greatest representative of society in the United States of America. One can do nothing but laugh out loud."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"I have just finished reading this book for the second time (back-to-back), and found it even funnier the second time around! I LOVED EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER portrayed in the book, and I only wish Mr. Toole had lived long enough to have written a sequel. Can you just imagine the trouble poor Ignatius would have gotten into while trying to adjust to life in NEW YORK?! BOY! HIS POOR VALVE WOULD HAVE CLOSED UP ON HIM PERMANENTLY! A movie version of this book, with the late John Candy in the starring role as Ignatius would have been GREAT! I recommend this book highly!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"This book is GREAT. But, to fully appreciate the location and the characters go to New Orleans. I would suggest that those who have given low ratings to &quot;Dunces&quot; have not made the travel. Walk the streets where Ignacius prowled. See the statute of him on Canal Street at the site of the D. H. Holmes department store. It doesn't do him justice. And how many times have we read this book and said &quot;I know someone who is just like that guy&quot;. Folks-this is a FUNNY book-very entertaining."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The voice this book is written in, the writers choice of words, the Pulp Fiction-esque intertwining of so many different lives, all make this book a great read.

But read it, you'll love it."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A brilliantly hilarious frolic through the colorful streets of New Orleans.

All the best!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"Arguably one of the funniest books ever written. ACOD is compared to Don Quixote for good reason. Ignatius Reilly's handle on reality is as skewed as Quixote's was. The two characters each believe they have a greater sense of how the world should be aligned, and work toward that vision, each to very humorous effect. One can't help but be somewhat intrigued by the parallels between what we know of author Toole, and his most famous character, Reilly. Toole's mother, who worked hard (thank goodness) to get ACOD published following Toole's death, was able to enjoy the profits of the book's sales, as well as the esteem once the book received the Pulitzer Prize. And so the reader can't help but be struck by these lines at the end, as Reilly is gathering his notebooks before departing for New York, \\"There are all of my notes and jottings. We must never let them fall into the hands of my mother. She may make a fortune from them. It would be too ironic.\\" Too ironic, indeed. In the case of ACOD, we can only be thankful that Toole's writings did fall into his mother's hands. Had they not, we would have missed out on a wonderful read."},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"In New Orleans, a great deal of characters congregate. In this story we meet Darlene, desperate to be a dancer at a bar; Jones, trying to get a job and avoid going to jail as a vagrant; Mancuso, a police officer trying to get recognition for his hard work; and Miss Trixie, confusedly trying to retire from her job.In the middle of this cast of characters and connecting them all is Ignatious J. Reilly. Unlike those trying to get ahead in the world, Ignatious is doing his best to not do anything at all. He lives with his mother and spends his time overflowing the bathtub, demanding soda and baked goods, and ranting and writing about the stupidity of everyone around him. Ignatious thinks himself the tortured genius, downtrodden and unrecognized for his true self. He must be one of the most deplorable and amusing main characters in all of literature.When Ignatious' mother needs money, she finally commands her grown son to find a job. Ignatious tries his best to avoid work, but finds himself falling into a couple of jobs that end up going horribly, ridiculously, wrong.In the end of the story, the lives of all of the various characters are pulled together in an extremely satisfying way. What an excellent book!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"The most amazing thing about this book is the author - who died before the book was published.

There is much that makes \\"Confederacy\\" unique: a wonderfully tight, complex yet \`ripping\` plot; phenomenal characters brilliantly portrayed; an unforgettable protagonist; and, crucially, a tremendous sense of humor. It was a complete surprise to me: I picked it up without knowing anything either about the novel or its (tragic)author. I was left with a memorable read and a sense of loss of a great talent.One additional comment. I highly recommend also avoiding this Evergreen paperback edition. The material of the cover is very pretty and has a nice feel, but its also impossible to read the book without the cover getting completely bent over.

Reilly. from his fantastical perceptions about himself and his fate, his indignation about the offenses made against his senses both welcome and repellent, to his obliviousness on the ripple-effect of his actions (and sometimes mere presence) on the people around him--no one is spared from his sharp tongue and the myriad sonorous digestive reverberations he emits.i enjoyed the verbosity of the...er...protagonist's(?) narrative as he bemoans fickle Fortuna's taunts on his luck. sometimes i found myself incredulous at the things that he spouts and the things that he do in the name of theology and geometry. more often he himself is the one blatantly offensive--especially to his oft-called \\"poor momma\\", but there is a certain understandable vulgarity in his actions when coupled with his delusions. in a sense you are made to think about the various circumstances in society that might have impelled an ordinary boy to suddenly become cynical and even antisocial.though his and the other characters' unintentional escapades were entertaining to read, there were still times when i found some scenes a bit lagging. and sometimes Ignatius' bouts into self-righteousness in one minute and then self-indulgence in the next became tiring. nevertheless, through it all, there is that lure to know what happens next. will our brazen fighter for peace and preserver of moorish dignity account for his actions? will he ever be able hold on to a job for more than a week? and what of the colorful correspondence with the minx Myrna, who seemingly is bent on throwing him on the nearest horizontal fixture to do carnal damage on his not insignificant bulk? how about the luckless Detective Mancuso with his fumbling ghastly contrivances to catch a \\"suspicious\\" character in the Quarter?

The main character Ignatius J.

I found it humorous instead of offensive.The book has many different subplots of very diverse characters that all tie together by the end of the novel; a classic comedy. The book reflects various characterisitcs of \\"The Big Easy\\" through the different scenes and character's \\"habitats\\".Eventually all of the different scenerios tie together at the end through who else, but Ignatuius J.I would recommend reading this book simply for pleasure.

I found Ignatious to be one of those characters that you &quot;love to hate&quot;, but I also just loved to read about what stupid thing he would do next, so although he disgusted me, I almost feel that I didnt hate him in the end.In fact at some points in the end of the story, I even felt sorry for him about the way that he was treated. I didn't give this book 5 stars for one reason: Ignatious and his valve. He constantly is talking about his &quot;valve&quot; which I think is one of the most disgusting things that he does, but is still quite funny at the same time.

You are going to hate him at too many places in the story, yet there is something genuine about him. He does the most awful kind of things, but you never know whether he is doing that intentionally, full mindedly, absent mindedly or it just a part of his highly intellectual mideval, semi-selfish almost unemployed negligent personality.Apart from Ignatius Reily, there are more characters in the novel that are very genuine. I believe that genuinity of the personages gives a lot of vitality to the story.It is amazing to see that this book was written almost 30 years ago, but it is still very modern and the situation of Ignatius is absolutely not unusual to see at the beginning of the 21st century.If you like to read a book in order to think read this.

It is almost like reading Borges.However it seems that many of the reviewers try to judge the book as a book of history, sociology, or whatever, which in turns probe that is superlative, since made them forget that they were reading fiction (which for they information, it doesn't need to be sociologically accurate, politically correct, and so on).If you take time to read many reviews, specially the ones that rated the book quite low, you will see hilarious things like &quot;the portrait of African-American is dated&quot;; the one who wrote that also forgot to say that the portrait of Italians in Romeo and Juliet is dated too, or that the portrait of Greeks is dated in the Illiad, so Shakespeare and Homer were not good! Come on, what do you expect of a book written in the beginning of the 60's? A guy using mobile Internet, and praysing that the new Secretary of State is African-American?Or you can enjoy one review saying that he/she took more than one month in reading the book, and that the book was really bad...What can you expect of somebody who takes more than one month in reading a book of a little more than 400 pages?? (pages smaller than A5 size, and with a quite big font)I do understand that people have different tastes in literature too, but when you read a review, you have to keep in mind what are they talking about: in some part they forgot that they were reading a fictional book and started to blaim the caracters for what they do (or don't do), or the author for using his real life as inspiration (what even if is true or not, who knows, it doesn't matter at all; what matters is the story, and that's all).I still believe that is a really good book, but after reading many reviews I understand why Sydney Sheldon sells so many books!"},{"Title":"A confederacy of dunces","review":"A grand ball of entertainment. It's real flavor comes out if you've been through the Big Easy and the Quarters. I can well imagine how much New Orleans natives would enjoy it. Each character was pathetic enough to catch your attention, and kind of feel sorry for them. The way Toole relates each one to our tragicomic &quot;hero&quot; is the author's forte in this book.

The characters are sketched out externally but as some reviewers mentioned, not in any depth. And that was OK for this story.The key to this story is the referred work by Bathius. Ignatius was the focal point for what seemed to be a series of coincidences, or as he would say, \\"spins of Fortuna's wheel\\". But in the end, you can see that all these seemingly random events all worked out for the best for each character even amongst Ignatius's meddling and bumbling. Referring to Bathius, it truly was man's view vs. God's view. Everyone got what was coming to them, whether the character be good or evil. Except Ignatius. Look at the havoc he reeked in the small LA town - and now he's off to New York! He never saw himself as others saw him - clueless and arrogant - and in spite of his education, without ambition or a 'cause' it was impotent. He was at the mercy of man's \\"fate\\" or God's \\"Design\\".I would have left out the very small chapters on Professor Talc. I think he was trying to show that Prof. Talc had become the very Ignatius he had despised but it just didn't seem to work well into the rest of the story. I thought maybe that the girl may have been one of Mr. levy's daughters or that Mr. Talc might be Mr. Wilson's teacher son but no.

Pocock is brutally honest with seemingly no desire to exaggerate--in no way does this leave the reader wanting.

This book is a fast, easy read. Every once in awhile I go back and re-read certain parts just to keep it all fresh in my mind (or if I start to lose my tolerance).

You probably walked away angry or wondered what you said that made things worse. Guess what: YOU ARE NOT THE PROBLEM! Jay Carter explains why nasty people feel the need to invalidate others, their techniques so you can identify when you are being invalidated, and actions that you can take to counteract invalidation.My only criticism is it would've been nice if Jay Carter would have included more real-life examples on how people have avoided invalidation rather than just listing possible methods.This book only has about 80 pages but the information is very valuable.

Sure other people in my life are mean to me and control me, but I already knew that now didn't I. What this book taught me is that meaness is a circle; and I am in it constantly. I have to be the change I want to see in others. To meet mean with mean is well... just a nasty situation. So thank you Jay for giving me something to consider before making the choice to invalidate others. I can now change the world, because I can recongize and change me and my behavior.I have found this very book to be a good way of dealing with mean people I love.

As I see it after 56 years of living, most of us suffer from varying degrees of 'low self-esteem',but although it can manifest itself in many ways, there are broadly 2 groups of people:Those who feed their ego's by bullying others and keeping them on the run; the other group comprises of those who do not know how to deal with with such a situation and suffer, badly, as a result.We rightfully support 'the judicary' against criminal acts such as burgulary and grievious bodily harm and the like, but where bullying or mental cruelty are concerned, such as Jay Carter discusses in this book, we are left almost entirely to our own defences (unless you learn from books such as this or 'enlightened' people).Perhaps, that is how it should be, because from my experience the courts would be overflowing with cases such as these! Anyway, finding solutions on how to deal with oppressive, rude and nasty people can be looked upon as a necessary part of our development to true maturity.But beware! Jay rightfully points out that although we might be suffering badly at the hands of an Invalidator, we too, just might be doing the same to other, weaker, less able, people than ourselves.My small mongrel dog shows me daily that this is the case. When coming into contact with larger, more confident, dogs she cowers and whimpers; however, when contacting some smaller dogs she quickly susses them out and can even become aggressive. I make no apologies for comparing cannine behaviour with human behaviour. Although, in my opinion, dogs are far more predictable and frequently have nicer personalitiesMy reason for awarding Jay's book only 4 stars was simply that he did not go sufficiently into why people allow themselves to be invalidated.My theory is that much 'blame' can be laid at the door of mainstream religion. My Christian experiences taught me to 'turn the other cheek' or show 'love'and hope that the Invalidator's attitude will change to treating people fairly. This may work in some incidences, but in general terms it often fails. I feel that more often than not this is the road to frustration, exasperation and further loss of confidence. Christianity has a lot to answer for in this respect!No,practice standing-up for yourself and gradually you will increase your own self confidence. As a bonus, you will also be 'helping' the Invalidator to change his or her approach to human relations by thinking twice before acting ignorantly.This is a good book Jay. It is as relevant today as it was when first written.See also, Dr Paul Hauck's book 'how to cope with people who drive you crazy'.

Nasty people behave like this ultimately through their own choice, (&quot;made&quot; not &quot;born&quot;) and thus, they can do something about it and change themselves.An Excellent, ethical, helpful book. at this price, buy several copies!"},{"Title":"Nasty People: How to Stop Being Hurt by Them Without Becoming One of Them (Bestselling Author Jay Carter Helps Reader Break Away from T)","review":"It is interesting to read Mr. Carter's review of his own book. At the risk of seeming a mind reader, he seems a little defensive, almost apologetic, about his work. He need not be. Those of us who have \\"been there\\" will understand this book, and we will also recognize the constant second-guessing of ourselves and our thoughts we all do. We have, after all, been told for years (some of us throughout our lifetimes) that we are just too sensitive -- we just can't take a joke. Even after several best-sellers, perhaps Mr. Carter is still looking over his shoulder, wondering if he has been too hard on the ghosts of his past. That's oddly comforting to me, in only my third real month of \\"recovery.\\" It's a reminder that our experiences are real, even though they \\"never hit me,\\" as I am so often reminded by those who don't understand. Mr. Carter's book lacks the depth and detail of similar books, and I am still in the stage where I'd like a little more eye-poking (Mr. Carter is, if anything, too kind to those who hurt), but the short chapters and quick \\"lessons\\" are a good refresher for those days we witnesses need a postive boost -- those days when our abusers (and that's what they are, let's not pull punches) are scratching at our door begging for more."},{"Title":"Nasty People: How to Stop Being Hurt by Them Without Becoming One of Them (Bestselling Author Jay Carter Helps Reader Break Away from T)","review":"Four years ago I nearly took my life.

First off, the anime and the manga are not really the same thing - the premise is the same, but the plots have several differences (none of the events in this book are in the anime) and even the personalities of some of the characters don't always seem to match up (is it just me, or does Eiri seem sweeter in the manga? &lt;g>). In this book, everything seems right in Shuichi's world - his record hits Platinum and his relationship with Eiri is actually going pretty well. Unfortunately, Shuichi's boss, Tohma Seguchi, ruins it all by telling Shuichi to choose between Eiri or his band. Shuichi becomes convinced that Eiri is in love with Tohma. In this book, Shuichi is also, er, brought to America.I enjoyed Shuichi, even though he seems a little more flighty in the manga than he was in the anime, but I have to say that I'm a big Eiri fan. There are a few absolutely adorable Eiri scenes in this book, my favorites being the ones with the print club stickers - if Eiri could just bring himself tell Shuichi what he's thinking when he looks at the sticker, their relationsip would be a lot less rocky. Then again, Shuichi would also be annoyingly mushy all the time. Anyway, I not only love the story, I love the artwork as well. There are both gorgeous guys and pretty girls, something for everyone! :) I highly recommend this volume, although it would probably be a good idea either to have read earlier volumes or seen the anime, so that you know about Eiri's past and how his relationship with Shuichi usually functions. Also, a quick note, if gay relationships disgust you, this is probably not the manga for you. I've heard others say that even people who don't approve of such relationships would find themselves liking this series, but, after reading some reviews of other manga series with same sex relationships, I'm not so sure."},{"Title":"Gravitation, Vol. 8","review":"Murakami-sensei's art has improoved munches since she started. The translations are funny, but the American references suck! They ruin the humor completely. A great deal of manga readers will already know about the original Japanese references & those who don;t need to get with it. You can't get by on manga without taking in tons of cultural tidbits in a lengthy period of time. Also, this volume's sidestory is Remix Gravitation 8.5, the most confusing of the series (why did K have short hair?)"},{"Title":"Gravitation, Vol. 8","review":"Art is one thing that throws me off a Manga.

It's the only book that Garth Brooks is quoted as \\"having read every word and it brought tears to my eyes.\\" The story about Garth Brooks, Hall of Fame member Robert Metzgar, Booking agent Joe Harris, Sr. and car dealer Bob Farr saving a local Christian family from starvation at Christmas time is one of the most touching, wonderful Christmas stories ever told.Garth's personal commitment to charitable giving and his love of children leap from every page. It makes you fall in love with him as a superstar all over again. This book is a \\"must\\" major motion picture.

Garth Brooks is a complicated man, but instead of doing the research to get inside his head, the author just trifles through the facts of his life. There is no emotion...nothing that draws the reader in and asks them to feel anything. And the writing style suggests that Garth Brooks fans are uneducated and illiterate. I'd give this book 0 stars if it was an option. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"American Thunder : The Garth Brooks Story","review":"Maybe it's because I live in California, but for years I've been looking for a Garth Brooks book, biography, autobiography, anything and never had any luck at all.

And when it arrived, I happily read it in two sittings and am thrilled to know the life and career of one of my biggest idols better.There are a few reviews I read that took shots at the writting itself and I'm not going to tell you that this book doesn't read like a long high school paper, written in a 'speaking voice' but I also wasn't sitting down to read 'Grapes of Wrath' when I picked it up.This book is a lot like the narrative to a Garth Brooks special you would see on the Biography channel, a program to which any one who would enjoy this book would surley tune in to watch.I gave this four stars not for the litterary fireworks but for the joy of finally reading a Garth Brooks book."},{"Title":"American Thunder : The Garth Brooks Story","review":"Have you ever wanted to know more about Garth Brooks, the country legend? If you have, then this is the book for you.The author shows that Garth loves people and loves performing for them. She includes interesting facts and finds justice to many rumors. As a person interested in music, I was pleased this biography told of how Garth started out as a music artist and of the trials and tribulations he had to go through. The author also included stories of ordinary people who have met Garth, and have witnessed what a great and caring person he is. She also wrote about the real life struggles of Garth and his wife, like each having to work two jobs to make ends meet.Although I enjoyed the book, I thought the author could have included more feeling and drama into it. She also could have included less statistics about his albums.After reading this, I have more understanding and admiration of Garth Brooks than I have ever had before."},{"Title":"American Thunder : The Garth Brooks Story","review":"Okay, I'll admit, I am a rabid Garth Brooks fan. So, you should know I had an eye on this book and was ready for any kind of bias either way on this story about one of country music's most revolutionary members.Ms. Sgammato is a woman with connections into the industry, and her research is extensive and thorough. She pulls no punches, and puts the good in with the not so perfect to give a well-rounded picture of the man and the performer. This book goes a long way to dispel or confirm various myths about Garth Brooks. It gives a rare insight into the man who dared not only to follow a dream, but also to fight to maintain control of that dream in the face of fickle critics and those who might be jealous of his success.She speaks of the hardships GB faced as an ordinary Midwestern guy trying to find himself, and his, as well as his wife's, struggle to build a career in a tough to get into industry. Then it outlines their struggle to handle the fame notoriety that came with phenomenal success.Along with GB's story, there are various referrals to those in the history of the country music industry, as well as examples of the generosity of others, that inspire not only Garth Brooks, but many others as well.Overall, this is a great story about a good man, who started out just like anyone else and worked to make his dreams come true.

A pleasure to read."},{"Title":"American Thunder : The Garth Brooks Story","review":"&quot;American Thunder, the Garth Brooks Story,&quot; by New York Times bestselling author Jo Sgammato is an excellent music bio. It traces Garth's career from his early days before his record deals, to the release of his first album on April 12, 1989 up until today. The book is exciting as we go on tour, backstage and into the offices on Music Row in Music City, Nashville. Read the books and close your eyes as you &quot;listen&quot; to Garth's wonderful songs. The author is well versed on the topic having written four other country bios over the past few years. The major difference is that she was there for much of this and not only knows Garth but many of the people involved with him as well. Some years ago before this reviewer was into country music he was given two of Garth's CDs and a video. He was impressed with he video but not owning a CD player had to play them through his computer. He was hooked and still is. Garth is number one. The book is great.

S. Eliot's second play is loosely based on Aeschylus' &quot;Eumenides,&quot; though set in modern times. The integration of classical elements is only partly successful: the Greek chorus of meddlesome relatives is oddly effective, but the several appearances of the Furies are forced and strange (as Eliot himself came to conclude). Furthermore, the play is awfully talky -- lots of setup without much payoff in dramatic action.But what talk it is! &quot;The Family Reunion&quot; was written in the interregnum between the first and second of &quot;Four Quartets,&quot; and the play develops and amplifies many of the same themes as the poems. We return to the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; rose garden of &quot;Burnt Norton&quot; (the first Quartet) -- &quot;I only looked through the little door / When the sun was shining on the rose-garden: / And heard in the distance tiny voices&quot; -- while looking forward to key passages from later poems: &quot;Or the distant waterfall in the forest, / Inaccessible, half-heard. / And I hear your voice as in the silence / Between two storms ....&quot;Though &quot;The Family Reunion&quot; may be justly criticized for its dramatic problems and weak conclusion, the writing is vintage Eliot and will prove both enjoyable and enlightening for devotees of his poetry."},{"Title":"The Family Reunion","review":"T. S. Eliot masters the craft of play-writing, and his verse adds to this powerful and imaginative tragedy. He manages to keep his many characters separate and portray every one of them with acute individuality. Reading this book leaves the reader without any doubts as to why Eliot was awarded the Nobel Prize."},{"Title":"The Family Reunion","review":"Following WWII, Eliot published two plays, The Family Reunion and The Cocktail Party, both of which make for interesting reading and insightful commentary on contemporary culture, though they do not rival his earlier works in my judgment. In The Family Reunion, an aristocratic family gathers to welcome home Harry, Lord Monchensey, rather recently widowed when his wife was mysteriously lost at sea. Harry is expected to follow his mother's wishes and take over management of the family estate. Amy, a manipulative, domineering woman, had restructured heir plans (which had been earlier foiled when Harry married a woman Amy disliked) and hoped the family reunion would consummate them. Harry, however, refuses to fall into his mother's scheme. His experiences have quickened his thirst for something more than the comfort and ease of an aristocratic manor, with its lands and income. So he departs as abruptly as he arrived--to become a missionary! Exactly where he headed and what \\"missionary\\" activity he embraced we don't discover, but it's obvious Harry took a radical turn away from his mother's plan and followed an inner hunger in quest of something more real.The Family Reunion describes the petty, vain world of comfortable people with little to live for. It also reveals an inner spiritual world where those who seek find, those who knock have doors opened for them."},{"Title":"Buccaneer","review":"I really enjoyed this book which I beleive is the first in a series.

Kate Morgenroth did a beautiful job writing Jude in such a way that the reader cant help but be absorbed in his life, starting right from the first short chapters. The story is so immensely touching that your heart just goes out to the naive 15 year old boy, who wants more then anything to matter and to be loved by the adults in his life and he gives up everything trying to get it. I felt completely connected to Jude as I experienced these 7 years of his life, as he is betrayed by all the people who should be looking out for him and as he finds allies in unexpected places. This is just a heart wrenching and tragically gripping story from start to finish.. with just enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat as love, drugs, murder, greed and the thirst for power dramatically effect and forever change, one boys life.My only criticism is, that at some points throughout it felt a bit long and little drawn out, but the payout at he end more makes up for it. A fantastic addition to anyone's reading list."},{"Title":"Jude","review":"My son had to read this book for school AR reading so I decided to read it as well. It was an excellent book.

The cover was pretty and I liked the title. But that aside. This book was amazing absolutly brilliant. The plot twists kept me reading and the charachterization of Jude and all the cast was amazing. I'm 18 and I disagree with the judgement. I think that you have to be at least 15 to understand this. Anyone younger won't understand the drug and social things.When I finished this I loaned it to my mother who was completly swept up in this novel. While some may critisize the charachterization of Jude's mother I feel she (like everyone else) is amazingly written and credible."},{"Title":"Jude","review":"Morgenroth has written a really, really long book that will dull the senses of anyone reading it. Do teens really want to hear the story of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO told all over again? Actually, it is like THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO crossed with FIGHT CLUB, a truly bizarre mix. (The jacket copy suggests it is like 8 MILE, which it is so not.)Poor Jude suffers through one appalling betrayal after another, as his father, his mother, his stepfather, and his best friend all do him wrong in terrible ways. A long section has him fending off sexual predators in an adult prison where he has been interred after a conviction for heroin sales. Talk about grim, and yet, you'd think it would at least be exciting, but it ain't.JUDE is a book in which no one is sympathetic. When we first encounter Anna Grady, the smart, idealistic up and coming attorney from West Hartford, who turns out to be Jude's mother, we warm to her as we did to Sarah, the heroine of Morgenroth's previous adult novel KILL ME FIRST. But then she just gets more and more nasty and self-centered, while Jude heroically goes to hell to help her career. In the last fifty pages or so Morgenroth develops an unrealistic love story for Jude. I guess that's her version of a happy ending but it is just as unconvincing as anything else in this disappointing excursion into YA noir."},{"Title":"Jude","review":"This book is the best book that I have ever read. I was almost instantly caught up in the story, and I never put it down once istarted reading it. The characters were very compelling, and I discovered that by the mid-point of the story I was feeling the main character's emotions without the author even having to describe his emotions. When he feels betrayed, I found myself feeling betrayed as well. The story is masterfully crafted, and it kept me reading until I finished it at about two in the morning. The author actually made me feel the passage of time in the book as well. The main character starts at age 15 and ends at age 22. five of those years he spends in prison. I really felt like I was living those seven years with him. All in all it may not be the most enjoyable book I have ever read, as it can be somewhat depressing at times, It is without a doubt the best written book that I have ever read, and I have read everything from Shakespeare to Steinbeck."},{"Title":"Jude","review":"Finally, a nice, good teenage novel that doesn't require use of love stories, text language and cheerleaders to score with readers.I was a little skeptical of it at first as Drugs aren't really my type of a good read, but Kate drew me in from the first page and from then on, the ride was smooth and captivating. There are rarely books that can lure me into their world. I admitt I can get picky at times, and if a book fails to bring me in in time, I will immediately abandon it. However, Jude managed to do it for me.A good plot, simple but effective expression and overall a recommendation"},{"Title":"Jude","review":"A well planned story with a gripping, many-layered plot, and characters that came alive. I felt I knew Jude very well: an angry, stubborn, yet honorable kid dealing with his issues just like everyone else.

But I think my favorite was Dolores and her terse, simple statements.The dialog was excellent, the pacing was wonderful (I couldn't put it down), and the resolution left me with a smile.

Jude is a fiction, and was about a kid name Jude who had a whole bunch of problems in his life. He isn't such a happy kid and in the beginning of the book his father is murdered.This book as I said is a fictional mystery. Jude the main character's dad was killed for not paying money to certain people. Jude was there and witnessed his dad's death, right in front of his eyes. But the killer of his dad let Jude live, only if Jude wouldn't mention it to anyone, in that case Jude would have a couple more problems. After the death of his father Jude thinks he has no where to live, but he is wrong. He was always told by his dad that his mom left him at birth but that was a lie. He met his mom who had to interrogate him for the first real time in his life at 15 years old. His mom says that his dad kidnapped him when he was only 3 weeks old. She than proved that by showing him newspapers about the incident. So Jude was happy to move in with his mom and have a real life, maybe.I personally really liked this book, but than again I like most mystery's that I read. So I was \\"on the end of my seat\\". I would recommend the book to all people who like the mystery genre and I think you will like it a lot. So, all in all I think that Jude is a very good book to read, I am definitely not a big reader and this book was still very interesting to me. I give it 4 stars for a reason if you give the book a try I'm pretty positive that you will be happy with it."},{"Title":"Jude","review":"This book is amazingly written as stated by my fellow reviewers but also has incredibly feeling and heart.

Jude knew one day a customer would find out his father's scams. Jude was right. While watching television, Jude hears a gun shot from the kitchen. When he goes to see what has happened, he finds his father dead and the killer still there. Jude and the murder talk and Jude agrees to tell no one about what has gone on. When the man leaves, Jude dials 911. Soon after, Jude's life is turned upside down. He is the main suspect in his father's murder. He is shipped away to live with his mother who he has not seen since he was two years old. Jude starts going to a new school where kids know about his rough past. Kids begin to ask for drugs, but Jude says no. He does not want to end up like his father. But eventually, Jude gives in, attempting to fit in. Rumors soon fly about the boy supplying the school with drugs. They begin to ruin his school career and his mother's chances of being elected mayor. Anthony, Jude's mother's boyfriend, devises a plan to end all rumors and save his mother's chances. Jude agrees and ends up being prosecuted for dealing drugs. Anthony says he will get Jude out of jail after the election, but Anthony lies. Jude ends up spending five years in prison. After serving his time Jude is let out and decides to turn his life around. He also wants to reveal the truth about his father's murder and clear his name. Jude, by Kate Morgenroth is a superb book. The characters are easy to connect with, the plot is suspenseful, and the details are amazing. I would recommend everyone read Jude.I found it very easy to connect with the characters in this book. Jude was made to be a character that a reader can relate with. I actually cared what happened to him. A reader could feel the pain Jude went through, the disappointment of his mother, and the betral of Anthony. For instance, when Jude realizes he was lied to and will really be spending five years in prison, the felling of let down and being stabbed in the back was present and real. I believe that being able to relate to characters really adds to a books overall affect.The suspenseful plot of Jude makes a reader want to keep reading. With something always happening, a reader will be anxious to learn the fate of every character. When the book seams to be coming to a conclusion, another thing happens. Jude will defiantly keep a reader turning pages. Personally, I found Jude to be a quick read despite the length because I could not put it down.The details in this book are amazing. I felt as if I was in it. The description brought the book to life. It was easy to picture the setting and characters. The description of the dark, small, disgusting jail cell made me feel as if I was there going thought all Jude was.Jude is an amazingly well written book. A reader can connect with characters and feel as if they are part of the book. Jude is a gripping novel and hard to put down. I recommend everyone add Jude to their reading list."},{"Title":"Lip Service (National Consumer Promotion)","review":"I enjoyed both stories in Lip Service. Despite Lori Foster's Tantalizing being a reissue, I still found it very entertaining. Lori carried off the blind date &quot;surprise&quot; with just enough hints to keep it believable (didn't hurt that Nick Harris was such a hunk)But the real jewel in Lip Service is Julie Elizabeth Leto's My Lips Are Sealed. Lacey Baptiste knows what she wants and makes no excuses when she goes after it--or should I say him! JEL writes wonderful description that takes the reader on a wild sensual ride through Hotlanta! I'm looking forward to reading about Eve in Essence of Midnight this coming July."},{"Title":"Lip Service (National Consumer Promotion)","review":"Books like this one is the reason I look forward to my lazy Saturday afternoons.

Don't get me wrong Lip Service was an okay story just sort of boring and for the most part predictable. If you're cool with that then knock yourself out ordering this book. Ms. Foster's newest books are THE BEST, however!"},{"Title":"Lip Service (National Consumer Promotion)","review":"I love Lori Foster and won't miss one of her titles hence the reason why I picked up this book. I am always surprised by how much an author can grow or in some cases turn stale. This is a perfect example of how Ms. Foster has only grown as an author. If I had not read any of her previous works I would have been blown away by the hot story between Nick and Josie. Blind date, plus switheroo hero made for a very fun romance.Ms. Leto is a new author for me and I really found her short story (short being the key word here) a pleasant read. These were two pleasurable reads from two very talented ladies. If you are new to Ms. Foster and you liked this story you should really pick up some of her newer work, you'll be blown away! I know I'm on my way to look from some other works by Ms. Leto. and eagerly wait for Ms. Foster to release a new title!"},{"Title":"Lip Service (National Consumer Promotion)","review":"This book includes two stories. I mainly read it because of the author of the first story, Tantalizing by Lori Foster. I became a big fan of Foster after reading 'Wild' and 'Say No to Joe?'. That being said, I was a bit disappointed by this story. I don't think that 'Tantalizing' had the humor, smarts, or story line that Foster has in her other books. The characters weren't at all developed and the story itself was pretty weak. Perhaps my standards were too high because I enjoyed her other books so much.A brief overview of Tantalizing:This is the story of a sheltered sister, Josie, who's, you guessed it, parents are no longer alive. Her big sis, Susan, takes care of her, which includes setting her up on blind dates. One man she'd never set her up with is Nick, but when Nick stands in for the Bob, the actual date, Josie falls hard, fast.In the other story, 'My Lips Are Sealed,' Julie Elizabeth Leto doesn't impress me much. Again, there is a lack of a storyline with a very predicatble ending.

But from a subject matter point of view, it is just outstanding. It is written well enough that, as I read each of the episodes you relate, I agonized with you as you strove to deal with each. The book is a remarkable insight into the thoughts and personality, even the mind, of someone who looks at the world through a different set of lenses than most of us do.Cumulatively, the episodes and their outcomes gradually made me realize that something was missing in how you regarded the personnel in each event and how you assessed \\"blame\\" for the contretemps that often resulted. It eventually dawned on me that there was very little, if any, empathy for the views and feelings of others in the way you approached these situations. It seemed difficult for you to understand how the other guy or gal might feel about a particular situation. When I mentioned this to other professionals, they told me that the lack of empathy is a major symptom of Asperger's.However, the overriding feeling I experienced while reading your book was admiration. Time after time, I said to myself, \\"Man, that took a lot of guts to write that!\\" Although perhaps therapeutic, writing the book also must have been quite painful. But beyond whatever therapeutic value writing it had for you, think of how invaluable the insight you provide into what it is like to live with Asperger's and ultimately overcome it will be to others with the condition, to family and care-givers, and to medical and psychological professionals working to treat those with Asperger's. You have done a great service, undoubtedly at no small cost to yourself, to all who are involved in any way with this condition and they should be grateful.Congratulations on a job very well done!"},{"Title":"Overcoming Asperger's: Personal Experience & Insight","review":"This book is a rare gem and a recently discovered treasure. In addition to being well written, one can identify with much of what the author has chosen to share. It provides a much needed window with parted curtains into autism/Asperger's (a/A) perceptions and interpretations.It has been said and evidence appears to support the finding that people on the a/A spectrum learn empathy cognitively as opposed to intuitively. Seeing the view from another person's perspective is challenging for most people, but for those on the a/A spectrum it is all the more so.This book is one that commands respect; being able to disclose the level of information that is found in this book is nothing short of courageous. It is the voice of hope for those with any form of autism; for professionals and for those personally involved with people on the a/A spectrum. This is a book for everybody! Being able to share these insights and observations made me think of the song \\"Climb Every Mountain\\" from \\"The Sound of Music.\\"Hats off to this book!"},{"Title":"Overcoming Asperger's: Personal Experience & Insight","review":"Every now and then you may be lucky enough to come across a work such as this. It's a very honest, sometimes painfully honest account of one man's struggle to live in a world that is almost too alien to bear.

The subsequent movie, Go Tell The Spartans, differs in many ways from the book. I gave it 3 stars. It's worth reading, but the movie was a little better."},{"Title":"Incident at Muc Wa: A Novel of War in Southeast Asia","review":"The author attempts to show both the futilety of the U.S. presence in Vietnam, and the sacrifices that were made by U.S. soldiers there, by alluding to the battle of Thermopylae.There are two important omissions by the author of this book. Firstly the author tries to draw a parallel between the fate of the U.S. troops in his story and the three hundred Spartans that died fighting against the Persians at the battle of Thermopylae. The problem with this idea is that the Spartans battle was preplanned to allow the Greek states sufficient time to put together a successful counterattack against the Persian forces and destroy the Persian kings chances for victory. The sacrifice of the three hundred Spartans and their supporting allies was what led to the Greek victory. In this story the author offers no corresponding reason for what the U.S. soldiers have been asked to do.Secondly, the author traces the order for the soldiers to occupy the abandoned village of Muc Wa to the General. The author forgets that there is such a thing as the chain of command that leads ultimately to the President and the congress of the U.S.It was the people of the United States who, through their elected officials, including the congress and the president, sent the military to Vietnam. Starting after the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, it is a matter of record that those in the military who had the courage to point out the futilety of the Presidents strategy were summarily \\"retired\\" by the administration.In short the authors storytelling makes only half of the intended point."},{"Title":"Incident at Muc Wa: A Novel of War in Southeast Asia","review":"Daniel Ford's novel served as the basis for the excellent Vietnam war film, \\"Go Tell the Spartans\\". The movie was generally faithful to the novel, with just a bit of Hollywood added. The story follows draftee Stephen Courcey through special forces training and finally into the jungle of the Central Highlands of the Republic of South Vietnam. There, the experience of his military advisory team seems to be an allegory to the American involvement in Vietnam. One of the characters, a number crunching junior officer, allows that it will take 50,000 American combat deaths to \\"stabilize\\" the situation in Southeast Asia. This statement in this work of fiction written in 1967 is pretty amazing when you consider that the final American death count in Vietnam was 58,000 and change.The novel moves quickly and flows nicely. The characters are strong. You find yourself somehow inside Corporal Courcey's head and laughing at Captain Olivetti's obsession with his CIB, his combat infantry badge. The role of Major Barker in the book is much less central than it is in the movie. But then, Burt Lancaster played the ... out of Major Barker in the film, so they may have made certain adjustments for the star.There is a sadness and fatalism about the book that may bother some. However, the topic is not exactly uplifting. On the whole, a worthwhile and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Incident at Muc Wa: A Novel of War in Southeast Asia","review":"I read this book in a college course. We started with the Quiet American and went right through. Muc Wa was one of my favorites. It puzzled me why Mr Ford called the Green Berets &quot;Raiders&quot; and the Viet Cong &quot;Charlie Romeo&quot; but I guess that's because the war was still going on when the book was published. If more people had read it in 1967, maybe we wouldn't have gotten into the quagmire we did.The hero is a young draftee who volunteers for Nam. He gets sent to garrison a useless town and then falls in love with the place and the people. (However, it's the sergeant who gets the girl!) Then when the VC attack and the Americans are ordered to leave, he stays behind to lead his gang out.In the movie, Burt Lancaster (the major from headquarters) stays with him. The major is killed, the corporal lives. I thought the book's ending was more real."},{"Title":"Incident at Muc Wa: A Novel of War in Southeast Asia","review":"If you know the Vietnam movies, you're familiar with the Burt Lancaster classic &quot;Go Tell the Spartans&quot;. Well, here's the story it was based on.It's 1964 and a team of U.S. Army &quot;Raiders&quot; (Special Forces) and local mercenaries are sent to put the old French garrison at Muc Wa back in business. Sergeant Ski falls in love with a refugee girl, and Corporal Courcey falls in love with the town he helps build. Not a good idea. The Viet Cong put the screws to Muc Wa and the Americans are ordered to &quot;exfiltrate&quot;. Sounds like a metaphor for the Vietnam war, doesn't it? Sure, except that it was written and published years before the U.S. got out of Vietnam.Dan Ford was a reporter in the Nam, writing for &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine. I like his stuff--it's masculine, gritty and funny. Check this one out. Then if you haven't already, rent or buy &quot;Spartans&quot; and see what Jonathan Goldsmith and Craig Wasson do with the roles, not to mention &quot;Butterfly&quot; and Burt Lancaster as the major from headquarters. -- Paddy O"},{"Title":"Incident at Muc Wa: A Novel of War in Southeast Asia","review":"This is a classic, a story written by a journeyman reporter who was in Vietnam before the war escalated out of control. The story is a metaphor for the conflict: a handful of Americans and a platoon of Vietnamese mercenaries are told to garrison a &quot;town&quot; called Muc Wa. There is no town--just the remains of some French emplacements and a graveyard. (The graveyard becomes a major theme in Go Tell the Spartans, the Burt Lancaster movie made from Ford's novel.) They set up a garrison, the Viet Cong attack, the garrison is reinforced, and onward and upward in a spiral of violence that ends only when the Americans are ordered to &quot;exfiltrate.&quot; For a novel that was published in 1967, that was a darned good prophecy. Read it, and wonder how the United States was so pigheaded as to believe it could ever win a war being fought on those terms."},{"Title":"Incident at Muc Wa: A Novel of War in Southeast Asia","review":"Contrary to popular thought there really was a Muc Wa. Why do I make this bold statement? Because I was one of the gunship fireteams that flew in support of Muc WA many times. We were the last airfield in the Delta and the closest support to Muc Wa. The men of Muc Wa were a special breed of warrior, in that they were in the middle of the VC and NVA infilltration routes. Nights were routinely broken up into mortar rounds and enemy troop probes. Many nights we would arrive to find the VC in the wire and we had to place fire dead close, that is 25 meters. The VC and NVA were determined to take Muc Wa at any costs. And Saigon was determined to not let that happen. Only problem was, Saigon never bothered to supply them when they needed help. Between my fire teams of Viking Gunships, and Spooky, we lite up the night many times. The author described the fight for Muc Wa in chilling detail as the men fought a cat and mouse battle with the VC and NVA regulars. The compound was supported with Yards rangers who fought boldly with their American counterparts. I fly into Muc Wa one mission and was told to land at the CP. Asking where that was I was instructed it was the conex in the clearing! I was warmly welcomed with my load of ammo, food, water, and fuel. Never saw a bunch of guys more happy to see a chopper anytime! Always asked if we had room to take the wounded out and we always tried to help. Even at the best flight time we were still over30 minutes away and I always hoped they would still be there when I arrive on station! The author was able to show the daily lives of the troops at Muc Wa and how it went, day by day, always wondering what Charlie would do at sundown! Muc Wa was easy to find at night because it was the outpost with the flares over it!His details of the history of the area was true as I knew it.This small band of rag tag warriors were able to hold off the enemy battalion surrounding them, that had wiped out a French fighting force that had held the area before them.I highly recommend this book for the history of the area and the battle that was fought there. And yes, there really was a place called MucWa.Brian Reiss,1LT,121 Asslt. Helicopter Co., Viking Gunships."},{"Title":"Incident at Muc Wa: A Novel of War in Southeast Asia","review":"Ok, even though this happens to be a fictional account, and the names and places are completely fake, the description of events is extremely eerie and just plain dead-on for what became Vietnam. The book came out at a time when the war was still believed to be winnable, but Ford gives us an honest look at the unwinnable situation of Muc Wa, and what it did to its ever-loving and overwhelmed young commander. I think we've all heard too many storied of this same sort that happened in Vietnam, and here it is again, but its simply one of the best books if you want to get a feeling of what it might have been like to be a young man with what was basically a nearly impossible mission, one he felt a patriotic and militant duty to fulfill, but, like so many other times the powers that be wouldnt allow it. Another strong point is its brevity, it gets the job done without having to do it over a 300 or 400 page novel, the book and the language within it will flow easily for most any high school student. An excellent read on the subject, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Incident at Muc Wa: A Novel of War in Southeast Asia","review":"I though the book was written and fairly accurate for a work of fiction. The characters were true to form and even some were like soldiers I met in Vietnam in 1969 when I served as an infantry grunt in the 4th division in the Central Highlands. The action was well paced and honest and it was a quick easy read. I didn't particularly like the way it ended as the major character of the book was to smart and well trained for it to end like it did. He was excellent in every situation until the end and then he basically committed suicide by going back to the village alone and unarmed. Other than that it's a very good book and would be on my recommended list."},{"Title":"Incident at Muc Wa: A Novel of War in Southeast Asia","review":"First, I am a veteran. Also, I instructed and advised foreign troops. So, I read this excellent book differently than the other Amazon reviewers . Ford's book is also a metaphor for how we COULD have won the war in SE Asia. Our special ops people (SF & SEALS)had the right idea and the proper operations in place to win. Our guys won every battle, including Tet. The war was lost by careerists vs warriors, i.e.,too many career ambitious remf staff officerswho defeated the special operations mindset whenever they could.Also, the war was lost by nitpick meddling from elected things in DC and by a defeatist media. If you don't believe me, read what the miltary leaders of the NVA wrote in their histories of that war.Ford's book is a metaphor for this interpretation every bit as much as it is for the civilian interpretation. Like all reviewers here I share the same awe for Ford's incredibly accurate , on-target,conclusions of the book/war, considering it was written in themid '60s."},{"Title":"Incident at Muc Wa: A Novel of War in Southeast Asia","review":"I went to South Vietnam the first time in 1958 and was impressed with this novel's version of the early days of our involvement."},{"Title":"Incident at Muc Wa: A Novel of War in Southeast Asia","review":"Incident at Muc Wa is set in Vietnam in 1964.

And the editor doesn't appear to know much about sailing either; for instance, he totally misses the nautical meaning of the line \\"when the long trick's over\\" (Sea Fever). A trick is a turn at the wheel, standing watch, silly rabbit!Serious sailor-readers should find a different book."},{"Title":"Who Killed What's Her Name? (Peaches Dan Mysteries)","review":"Peaches Dann is used to her father's paranoid outbursts, so she only goes out to check the pond to humor him. Much to her dismay, she finds that her father was right this time. Her Aunt Nancy's body is lying face down in the water. But who could have wanted to kill her aunt? Or was Peaches the intended victim, since she and the victim have similar dresses. Then another murder takes place, in a trap most likely meant for Peaches. What does it all mean? Peaches will have to use every memory trick she's learned over the years to figure this one out.With a title like this book has, I went in expecting a cozy mystery and was not disappointed in that regard. The book could have been better overall, however. The plot moves along at a slow pace and I really struggled to get into it. While there are several likeable characters, I also found myself irritated by many of them. The references to Peaches' poor memory (which I didn't think was nearly as bad as it was made out to be) and excerpts from her \\"book\\" on memory techniques were also overdone.Peaches is certainly a pleasant character. I'll probably give the author another try to see if she developed as a mystery writer. Not my favorite book read this year, but I've certainly read worse."},{"Title":"Who Killed What's Her Name?

There is no concept of suspense, realistic events, or realistic characters. The plot moves like molasses and Peaches Dann speaks to us as if she has no faults (besides her cutesy memory problem). There is no emotion in this story whatsoever. Someone killed my aunt, and is trying to kill me? I'm not going to show any emotion or hide out. I'm going to be stupid and hang around investigating!

Their destined-to-be-together union is a roller coaster ride of secrets and lies only Jackie Collins can concoct, and that means a lot of sins, a lot of sex, and whole lot of page turning. She may not be Proust, or even Nora Roberts for that matter, but, boy, can she handle her pen. It is as wicked as any of her villains. Her over-the-top imagination works to the very end.

Her books are sexy and have so many sub stories running through them it enthralls you to find out whos doing who of hollywood. I always have this feeling that I should know which character represents who in real life because I'm sure some of the characters are based on real people ! They really draw you in and make you think about the characters I often say to myself \\"No No don't do that you numbskull argh !\\" Lovers and Gamblers has a surprising ending and the main character really gives everyone something to think about when he handles a bad situation. I also like how Jackie Collins really differentiates between sex and love."},{"Title":"Lovers and Gamblers","review":"For those unfamiliar with the greatness that is Jackie Collins, get your hands on a copy of \\"Lovers and Gamblers,\\" 'cos it's the perfect escape ~and~ introduction to vintage Jackie. Tons of tawdry, complicated plotlines, raw sexuality, and characters spring to life from the pages, and you'll be rah-rah'ing for Dallas and Al the whole way through, giggling your ya-ya's off at Miz Collins' dialogue, her vivisection of the shallow and hopelessy stupid, and the way she cracks the male mind so expertly. \\"Lovers and Gamblers\\" especially works well as classic beach fare - along with some Bobby Womack or Bill Withers, your sunscreen, and frothy rum concoctions."},{"Title":"Lovers and Gamblers","review":"I was undecided for a very long time whether I should rate this 3 stars or 4 stars. The reason is this: Of all the trashy writers out there, Jackie Collins is undoubtedly the reigning queen of them all. I love her writing, I love her ballsy so-unplausible-that-its-plausible characters and story lines. I have read other writers of the genre (Tasmina Perry, Olivia Goldsmith, Candace Bushnell (forget it with this one). The only single comparison I can make is Olivia Goldsmith's First Wives Club. But none of her other writing. Not even Tasmina Perry, who does a smartly written trashy herself, can beat Jackie.My ponderance was do I rate this 4 stars because Jackie is the best and no one else can write like her, or is this actually a good novel enough to rate 4 stars by itself. I ended up going with 3. Although I have almost all her books I have only yet read Hollywood Wives. This set the standard for me for trash. I LOVED that book. The ditzy girls, the arrogant sex maniac men, the incestuous relationships, the promiscuous girls, the inter-relationship scandals, the bitchy glitz and glamour and gossip, the world's hottest destinations, oh, and the background with each character. It was FABULOUS!This one seemed different. Could be because it's written quite some years before Hollywood Wives and Jackie hadn't yet reached her pinacle? I immediately started disliking every character except Linda. Al as the main male character was a complete tosser. His over-the-topness didn't amuse me, I didn't really enjoy reading about him. Dallas's growth throughout was obvious and to be honest I enjoyed reading her side of the story. I enjoyed her growth, her background, her sticky situations. But really there was a lot of back and forth from Al to Dallas where they basically did the same thing over and over again. You could say it was repititious but with Jackie at the helm it was constantly fast paced and didn't seem so obviously repititious at the time. Other characters were bought in throughout the novel, but by the time I got to the end of the book I wondered why they were even introduced. I like to see a full, well rounded story with Jackie Collins, like she did in Hollywood Wives. I feel some characters' stories were abruptly ended and I wasn't sure why they were even introduced, with us getting to know them, if there wasn't quite an 'ending' with their story. Some character's reactions to certain things were either way too OTT or I felt should have been MORE than what it was. There is some disaster to this book thrown throughout, which did its job in surprising me, but it also made me wonder WTF, because I didn't see it's purpose. But maybe that's typical Jackie. I don't know. She writes whatever and we're thrown in for the ride because we NEVER know what we're going to get. I enjoy that about her.The book is set into three or four parts, although I have absolutely no idea why because it didn't make any difference to the story and it's not like each part was different from the last part. The last part was primarily set in South America. Like other reviewers, this seemed strange, a little too random, especially when you read what happens. For quite some time we read about the jungle, where absolutely none of her trademark 'trash' was written into it. It seemed like something of a survival/tragedy story, one that would be later made into a movie, or a documentary on the Discovery channel. It didn't ring of 'Jackie' at all. The ending too seemed a little 'meh'. No lasting impressions at all.In conclusion, I still enjoyed the book, because I enjoy Jackie's writing. I read it in about 5 days. It was extremely easy to read (I love that about Jackie), it was fast paced, stuff happening all the time, characters of all degrees of credibility and badness. But this wasn't her best. I enjoyed Hollywood Wives a lot more, but the averageness of Lovers and Gamblers won't stop me from reading her entire collection. I'm a fan for life."},{"Title":"Lovers and Gamblers","review":"okay so it took me a few chapters (maybe 2) to get fully into it but it happened and i loved it! it would definitely be something i would read again. the characters were interesting and the tension between al and dallas kept me reading and smiling the whole time. the end was very action packed and i couldn't put it down. i loved the character development too. ending up loving al in the end.yay jackie!! keep 'em coming. :)"},{"Title":"Lovers and Gamblers","review":"It seems hard to believe that anyone could find anything worthwhile in this pathetic novel. The characters are cardboard cutouts, the \\"relationships\\" (such as they are) bear no resemblance to normal life of even people as \\"not normal\\" as this cast of characters. Apart from its unending series of sexual couplings, each described in the kind of detail that would have had this volume banned not so many years ago, the adventures and misadventures the characters indulge in simply have no possibility of being believed -- even if one can summon the energy to \\"suspend disbelief\\".If you manage to plow through the first 400 pages or so, you do come to about chapter 60 where there is just a tiny shred of interesting tension that is not just sexual (although it is littered with that too). Unfortunately the unfolding of the adventure that goes forward from there clearly shows Ms. Collins's total lack of any knowledge of airplane crashes, or jungle survival.Unfortunately Amazon does not permit giving zero stars, but if they did, that is what I would give this amateurish offering."},{"Title":"Lovers and Gamblers","review":"I remember when i was 16 which was over 10 years ago, my mum's friend gave me a stash of books as she was clearing out her garage. One of them was Lovers & Gamblers by Mrs. Collins... and the rest is history... after finishing Lovers & Gamblers I wanted to read all her books. To this day this is still one of my favourite books by JC. If you liked her other books then you will love this one. It has it all.... love, sex, drugs, scandal and lots more. I always like her characters some of them good , some not so good but all very interesting and at times complex, she definitely knows them well!"},{"Title":"Lovers and Gamblers","review":"This tells two stories at first. One about Al King--a huge rock'n'roll superstar who uses girls and drugs and feels like he's Gods gift. then there's beautiful Dallas--a gorgeous headstrong woman with a dark past. She'll do ANYTHING to get ahead. Eventually the two meet and instantly fall in passionate love. But can King overcome is ego and Dallas escape from her dark past.One of Jackie Collins' early books (1980) and not one of her best. King and Dallas are incredibly unlikable at first and it takes quite a while before they meet and, by then, I was hating both of them. Also Dallas (for some reason) becomes a raving drug addict halfway through. Even worse the book takes a disaterous turn with Book Three when it ends up with them fighting for survival in an Amazon jungle! I realize this is fiction but come ON! Still Collins is a wonderful writer and you can't stop reading. It may be trash but it's well-written and readable trash. Not her best but worth a read."},{"Title":"Lovers and Gamblers","review":"This is a reissue of the 1977 edition.Al King is a rock singer and selfish stud extraordinaire.

Everyone wants a piece of her and she plays hardball like the best of them.Al and Dallas are destined to get together, but you have to wade through many pages to get there.The other characters are thrown in for good measure.As usual Jackie Collins gives us sex, drugs and rock and roll in the Hollywood/rock scene.

Even when I brought this book from him and had him signed it, he reminded me of some grouchy bear. I supposed to his family and friends, he must have a sense of humor since Mr. Roberts collected many of his quotes into a book.When I read through the book, some of the stuff he have to say were actually pretty funny, witty and somewhat interesting. I also read enough to know that many of the stuff in the book seem to be paraphasing of other sayings which I have read or heard before. Here is a classical example: \\"Government must care for the helpless. Govenment must not make people helpless by the care its provides.\\" [page 99] I have heard this statement so many times by so many people during the past 35 years of my life. The words get twisted but the meaning remains the same.Another thing about Wally Hickel was that as our govenor, he often don't practice what he preaches in this book. I could write a book on it but as an Alaskan, I know that Mr. Hickel's words and his actions often do not match.Still, its not a bad book of quotes. However, most people would have little use for it unless you are a Wally Hickel fan or lives in Alaska since many of the stuff he's quoted on were on Alaska's issues. For folks in the lower 49 states, some of that would be boring. I will end this review with one of his quotes: \\"I don't want to read what the man says, or hear him say it. I want to see him say it.\\" [page 197]"},{"Title":"Heresies Exposed: A Brief Critical Examination in the Light of the Holy Scriptures of Some of the Prevailing Heresies and False Teachings of Today","review":"I would recommend this book highly for a short work on the subject for someone whoneeds an introduction or review of the material."},{"Title":"Hunting The Dead: Methods of Ghost Chasing","review":"This book was great, it showed me the ins-and outs to ghost hunting."},{"Title":"Hunting The Dead: Methods of Ghost Chasing","review":"I enjoyed reading this book because the author never went over the edge about ghosts. I like how some of the punctuation and grammar was deliberately wrong--or too advanced. I ran into Brian Roesch at Majic 102.7 during an on-the-air interview. I asked him why he never used spell check on his manuscript. He said,\\"Well, what fun would that be? At least you know it's not (cut and pasted information) like most ghost hunting books.\\"He just likes to do things his own way I guess. Makes sense to me."},{"Title":"Hunting The Dead: Methods of Ghost Chasing","review":"I read this book from dusk till dawn. I took the book with me to a cemetery the following night. I did exactly what the instructions told me to do such as: Load your camera and walk around the area for 30 min. to an hour. I took exactly 36 shots with 35mm 800 speed B&W; film. It took me about a week to get the film developed and when I did, one photo out of 36 showed a transparent figure of a female standing by a crypt.The book was also right about the skepticism upon the photos. I showed the picture to the film developer and he said it looked like a chemical error. But after he looked at it closely, he got goose bumps.I have the negative in a safe place and plan on making 8x10 copies of it.After capturing the apparition, I feel a little intimidated on returning to the cemetery. Mr. Roesch wrote that the existance of evil spirits are extremely remote, so that offers me some relief of fear. Many doubt that this is true, but I think Mr. Roesch could be right, based upon his theories.The part he wrote about \\"underwater ghost hunting\\" seems a little tough, I will have to wait on that.I am also planning on conducting (EVP) as described in the book. I will follow the strict procedures as stated.\\"The Drive-by Ghost Shootings\\" were helpful as far as equipment goes. I drove around a cemetery shooting pictures at random. Mr. Roesch is right, by doing that, it avoids trouble from currious on-lookers.I never realized the difference between ghost hunters and paranormal investigators. There really is a \\"BIG\\" difference after reading.My personal impression about Mr. Roesch, is the fact that he kept his description publicly stated from a personal view. He never went overboard about the subject of ghosts. Mr. Roesch claims that he really believes ghosts exist, but has still not seen or experienced actual proof of their existence. Whether ghosts exist or not, Mr. Roesch wants to prove it.I do disagree with some of Mr. Roesch's theories such as religion and reincarnation. They were great points, but still just theories.The ghost stories were great, but I feel there should have been more listed in each state.So anyway, that's my review. I recommend Hunting The Dead Methods of Ghost Chasing to \\"ALL\\" amateur ghost hunters."},{"Title":"Hunting The Dead: Methods of Ghost Chasing","review":"Have to agree with the other reviews. In looking at books on ghost hunting, this one comes in at the bottom of the pile. Poor writing, poor editing, and very little useful information. If you are interested in this subject, get Joshua Warren's How To Hunt Ghosts or one of Troy Taylor's books. Most of the others are a waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Hunting The Dead: Methods of Ghost Chasing","review":"This is an extremely poorly written book. The gammar and spelling is atrocious and it does read like a poor highschool report (that would get a D or maybe a C-). As for content, it offers little and with less explanation and is highly redundant. Don't waste your cash, there are MANY better titles to choose from."},{"Title":"Hunting The Dead: Methods of Ghost Chasing","review":"I did not enjoy this book. The author provides no facts to support what he writes about when it comes to ghost hunting. Descriptions of events are extremely limited regarding how he conducted his ghost hunts. Some methods to search and record ghosts I consider completely rude. For example, page 48 he writes that when conducting a daytime investigation or ghost hunt in the cemetary, and a funeral is taking place, by utilizing recommended equipment you can maintain distance and discretion. However, he writes, &quot;If ever approached by someone and they ask what you are doing, tell them 'None of your business!' and leave&quot;. He does cite his own personal experience in this matter several lines further. Roesch's response was, &quot;No, I'm just taking pictures of idiots,smile!&quot; and he snaps a shot. Other methods do not respect privacy of individuals, especially within a hospital setting. He does state that he smuggled a camera into an animal hospital. Leaving me the impression, if he could get away with it at a human hospital he would. Much of what he talks on can be found researching other authors and websites, yet he does not provide full credit to the original author's work. However he does list all referances at the end. It would have been extremely helpful to have said exactly what information he obtained from sources outside his own experience, and who should be credited. For people new to this field, be it hobbyist or aspiring professional, this is not a book to gain 'expert' knowledge from. Keep looking!"},{"Title":"Hunting The Dead: Methods of Ghost Chasing","review":"This book may be OK for a 12-year old who gets excited about ghost hunting for a hobby, but I was very disappointed. This book reads like a rough first draft of a junior high school research paper. The grammar is atrocious; the writing is puerile. \\"Harry took ghost research to the most highest professional level.\\" [p.xxv] Throughout the book, there are innumerable inexplicably (placed) parentheses or quotation \\"marks where\\" there are \\"no\\" quotations; then there are also the repetitious redundancies too. Some of his advice is so obvious as to be ludicrous; e.g., when hunting ghosts around shipwrecks, wear scuba gear (he takes pages 35-37 to say that). The only reason I gave this book two stars is because the author gives the amateur ghost hobbyist some good suggestions about cameras and equipment.If you're a juvenile looking for some fun reading, then, by all means, enjoy the book. But if you're an adult professional with a college education, looking for serious scientific research on parapsychological phenomena, don't waste your time or money on this book. Amazon.com has other, better books available."},{"Title":"Hunting The Dead: Methods of Ghost Chasing","review":"I found this book to be pleasant to read. The format was simple and the typeset easy to follow. I would have given a higher review but found a lot of redundancy throughout it. I have had a long time interest in the paranormal and would never try to compare my knowledge to that of the the author, however found that the technical information a bit scarce and many of the tips to be no more than common sense. I wish Mr. Roesch had gotten into a bit more detail. With that, I have to admit the intention is probably for educating the begginer whom might not have a strong scientific background. All said, a good buy and definitely an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Hunting The Dead: Methods of Ghost Chasing","review":"I enjoyed the personal story this author has written. Great book!

He hated the food. He served in the Pacific near China at some time. But that's about all I know. In searching the net for books about the naval war in the Pacific this one popped up, and it was a revelation. It shatters the myth that serving in the navy meant three hot meals a day and sleeping on clean sheets and a soft mattress every night, not to mention getting any sleep at all. It also shatters the myth that serving in the navy was safe. I just cannot imagine being in a battle where I was literally surrounded by fighter planes, dive bombers, torpedo planes, and kamikazes from above. Then there were the 5 and 6 and even 8 inch guns from land, enemy warships on the sea, and subs under the surface.As as been said, Mr. Fahey is no Hemingway; but the further I got into his narrative the more it seemed that I was hearing my own father's words. I wasn't, unless of course it turns out that, by some miracle, he served on the U.S.S. Montpelier with Mr. Fahey. But in his straightforward prose he reflects the no nonsense approach my dad always took towards whatever came his way.Reading this book has obvously been a very personal experience for me. So I do highly reccommend this book for anyone whose father served in the navy during WWII but refused to talk about it. But I also give it 5 stars for anyone who just wants to know what the day to day life of a seaman was like during that time."},{"Title":"Pacific War Diary, 1942-1945","review":"An excellent example of history as seen through the eyes of an ordinary sailor. Relive the U.S. island hopping campaign with an ordinary seaman, including action in the Solomon Islands, and fighting off suicide attacks from the Japanese (the word Kamikaze was unknown to American sailors at that time).Fahey is no Hemingway but his straight-forward narrative is gripping. His writing is devoid of emotion and characterization, (he talks very little about himself or his mates) but he does record for all time the daily existence of the average seaman. You come to realize that life on a wartime Cruiser was rough even without the Kamikaze attacks. No one got any sleep, there were endless work details between attacks, and 3 squares a day sometimes meant spam, a cookie and more spam.The charm of the author's style is his 'fly on the war' approach. He himself becomes an observer for the various land invasions his task force supports and he relates those details in stunning clarity. As the reader you forget how long this young man has been at sea until he recalls his encounter with the first lady of the United States, Eleanor Roosevelt, &quot;Much better looking in person&quot;, he says. After a year at sea, I'm sure she was!This is an excellent book for the history buff, or the reader interested in personal narratives as an alternative source for historical information. I highly recommend it. The fact that he kept the diary in secret makes it even more candid.Suitable for ages 13 and up. Some gory details of combat."},{"Title":"Pacific War Diary, 1942-1945","review":"I read a great deal about WWII and I lean toward aviation, however, this book intrigued me as it is a first hand recollection based on a diary kept in secret.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and although the quality of the writing may not be that of an accomplished author I found it to be a superior attempt to relate the day to day life of a sailor at war. Fahey was present at a good many famous naval battles and includes a fascinating description of Tokyo Bay and the home islands at the war's end. Another strong feature of this book is its tone. The author in no way attempts to glorify himself or brag about his service. Quite the contrary, he comes off as a typical &quot;blue collar&quot; sailor who did his part for the rest of us.

For three years on Fahey's ship, bed time was \\"hitting the steel\\", or sleeping on the hard steel deck because it was always too hot in the sleeping compartments. A good night's sleep was often not much more than 45 minutes, and even though the Navy tried it's best to provide good food, that was often nearly impossible under battle conditions.

This information would have been valuable to the Japanese, if it had fallen into their hands. Thus, inadvertently, his diary affirms the wisdom of the regulation he ignored.How could he have known that the Code had been broken, in only the second year of the war? (1) from an officer; (2) from his close friend in the radio shack; (3) or by guessing. The first is most likely, as his diary seems replete with information broadcast over his ship's loudspeaker. But (4) maybe information was added to his text after the war. Samuel Eliot Morrison wrote the introduction; did he edit it, too?This diary is unique in that it views the Pacific War from the perspective of an ordinary seaman. Some things come through that aren't mentioned in other biographies or official histories. Swabbies were hungry, most of the time. Vermin infested stores. Sailors got less than two hours sleep per day for long periods. They slept on decks in the tropics: no air conditioning. A match left on the deck would ignite. Firing five-inch guns deafened sailors near them, permanently. Loading stores and thousands of shells was exhausting. Boredom, fatigue, typhoons, accidents assailed them. Fahey's personal phobia was sharks.He documents how sailors suffered. To keep going as they did, they needed assurance that what they were doing was worthwhile, that they were appreciated, and that they had a chance for surviving. His diary shows that he received all three. The proof is that he repeated what his officers told him."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"\\"Behold, Here's Poison\\" by Georgette Heyer is a story that lingers in the mind. I read this book many years ago, but had the wrong author in mind when searching for it to reread. It was a delight to rediscover this clever story with a murder weapon I've never seen used in another story.Her characters dance from the opening page as real people we'd never meet except between the covers of a book. This is the second appearance of Supertindent Hannasyde as he struggles to deal with vivid \\"dingbats\\" and less than helpful relatives who will do their dam-est to protect the family name and foul his investigation.

If you liked Heyer's mysteries, you could also try Mary Stewart, who writes suspense/romance as well."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"Although she cannot be called a great mystery plotter (the murderer is highly unlikely and there is a dire lack of clues), her characters make up for any defects.

Then I have other things I must get done. 'Behold Here's Poison' Just would not let me get other things done! I'd put it down and soon find it calling to me, causing me to drop whatever work I was doing to discover the next delicious clue, the next character reveal, the next fun bit of dialogue and so on.I admit it, I do enjoy a bit of romance with my mystery and this had just enough--but that hero! Or was he the villain? I loved the dry wit of him, but the arrogance, the snootiness...or was it simply his way of seeing through so much family pretentiousness? Oh, well, the characters were all of such disorder and varying degrees of crazy-yet-sane, that following them around made for a fun read, and also made the progression of the clues all the more interesting. And what unusual poison. And the heroine was likable and strong and, given the time period (1930s), feminine and apt to turn around for help. I like that she didn't do stupidly dangerous things. And I liked the determined policeman, too.This was a most enjoyable read, amusing, baffling and hard to put down. And the route of getting to the solution was the best part, so this is a mystery I will relish reading again one day."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"This is a mystery novel set in Britain around 1936 (which is when it was written). The mystery was clever, the pacing was good, and journey (full of the the characters' foibles) to the answer was fun.The author introduces a lot of the characters quite rapidly at the beginning. It's not immediately clear how everyone is related to each other (especially since it's an odd assortment of relationships), but it all gets sorted out fairly quickly.Most of the characters aren't exactly nice people, but they are interesting and idiosyncratic. Initially, I didn't like a single character (except maybe Stella), but I soon found myself enjoying all of them. The author adds a good-natured humor to the book which shows up in the dialogue and in the quirks of the various characters.Though this is a mystery, the trouble with solving the mystery comes from the lack of obvious clues rather than from an abundance of them. I solved every part of the mystery except the who-done-it because the critical piece of information wasn't revealed until the very last moment. (However, the murderer was #3 on my list, so it is technically possible to guess.)There is a small amount of swearing by one character. Many of the characters say derogatory (though usually true) things about the others. There are no sex scenes.

What I discovered - to my surprise and delight - were wonderful English manor mysteries, similar in the Agatha Christie style.These books blend a nice, cozy, old-fashioned mystery with Ms. Heyer's wonderfully snarky and dry wit, which adds up to genuine reading pleasure. I've plowed through nearly all her mysteries and will be sorry when I read the last. I wish she wrote as many myseries as she did Regency romances."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"One of my favorite mysteries by G. Heyer. I'm replacing a very old edition so I can read it again and again."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"Most of you are aware of my love for Georgette Heyer, so it's probably no surprise that I couldn't resist trying out one of her mystery novels. And let me tell you, I was not disappointed! I do believe that this woman could make a grocery list read witty!Behold, Here's Poison is an entertaining little murder mystery with a \\"Clue\\" sort of vibe to it. The characters are a little wacky, but in a delightful and amusing way. There's the outrageously thrifty Miss Matthews, moocher extraordinaire Mrs. Matthews and her spawn...and then there's Mr. Randall Matthews, newly made head of the family. I fell in love with his quick tongue and smart remarks...made me laugh out loud a few times, drawing odd looks from my husband!Thanks to Danielle at Sourcebooks for the opportunity to read such a great book! I truly enjoyed it and I think you will too!"},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"The book itself is already highly enjoyable. Now this audio version by Hugh Dickson is MIGHTY enjoyable master performance if you ask me. I had been listen to it so many times over and love it every time because of the characters, dialogues, and the humors. Georgette Heyer + Hugh Dickson - BEHOLD, this book is a must read must listen and an absolute keeper.p.s. The plot of this book is great in my opinion. I love it."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"I read this book shortly after reading Death in the Stocks and I enjoyed encountering some of the same characters--Giles Carrington, Superintendent Hannasyde, Sergeant Hemingway--in both books. But the star of this book, for me, was Randall Matthews, the \\"amiable snake\\" at the center of the mystery. When Randall is first introduced, the reader is not quite sure what to make of him, but as the story unfolds, Ms. Heyer slowly reveals his character as being quite other than what he seems. I enjoyed watching the relationship between Randall and Stella change and develop, and was pretty sure I knew which way it would turn out, and better yet, was pleased about it. The murder mystery was appropriately difficult to figure out--at least for me--and was resolved satisfactorily. But it's Ms. Heyer's talent for creating memorable characters--including the saintly Mrs. Matthews, and her bitter rival, the waspish Miss Matthews--that elevates her writing above most others."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"Glad to find some old favorites electronically. Heyer's characters base their actions in who they are, as in how they react to the murder here. The clue that helps the case get solved was faithfully depicting a victim's idiosyncrasy. As ever, she throws a romance in among the suspects."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"I haven't read the whole book yet, but I like the style of writing or I guess the era.Kind of 1930's England mystery. The book came in perfect condition and arrive in a shortperiod of time. The seller took great care to package the book to prevent damage. I woulddefinitely buy from them again."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"Uncle Henry has a history of heart trouble and doesn't wake up one morning. No one, even his physician, is surprised. But dear Aunt Gertrude, listening to Intuition, suspects Foul Play and insists on an autopsy. Since Aunt Gertrude is a cross between a battleship and a Victorian bulldog, an autopsy she gets.Surprise! Uncle Henry was, indeed, poisoned. The problem is that all of his relations have a motive. You see, Uncle Henry was not well liked at all; he took positive delight in thwarting his erstwhile relatives. They included two sisters, one sister-in-law, a niece, two nephews, and an attending physician who all had reason to hate him, and all benefited in one way or another from his unlamented passing.Georgette Heyer did a great job with this classic style, village mystery. It is a beautiful microcosm of English society between the wars. And it is very clever - well plotted, well paced, and somewhat intricate; you simply will not figure out whodunit. But where this story really shines is in the characters; they are broad, theatrical, believable, and *very* amusing. They moved the story along nicely with conflicts and idiosyncratic reactions to events. It was just a pleasure to read. The Saturday Review said this story was \\"a marvelous melange of malice, murder, mystery and mirth.\\" I couldn't have put it any better."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"I only read the mysteries of GH if my library has them, but they are all rather unsatisfactory to me. They are full of despicable people, i.e the widowed mother in this one, but you knew she wouldn't end up being the murderer, though I sincerely wished something bad would happen to her. And the real killer, in all of her books, is always someone outside of the circle, even though the inner circle are packed full of motive. I also wished something bad would befell Guy, the selfish, idiotic son of aforementioned widow. Plus she always throws in a romance, which I do not need or like in mysteries. Her characters are cliches. The reason for the crimes end up being rather obscure and then the book comes to an abrupt halt."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"If you haven't read a Georgette Heyer mystery, you're in for a treat. Her deft characterizations, lively dialog and original plotting evident in her regency romances make their appearances in this mystery as well. I laughed aloud several times reading this book. It's worth reading the book alone for the character Randall, chief suspect, who always manages to say what will offend the other characters the most.For example, to his officious aunt who discovers her husband has a mistress, Randall declares he'd have several mistresses if he were his uncle married to his aunt. It's always delicious when Randall comes on the page, emitting his amusing and barbed comments, setting the scene in an uproar. Fortunately for the reader, Randall makes quite a few entrances in this mystery comedy of manners, or in the case of Randall, lack thereof.Georgette Heyer has transported her considerable talents and skills honed in her regency romances to this mystery novel. If you enjoy Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers for their ability to capture the flavor of the stylish Golden Age 1930's era in which they lived, and project it as a backdrop in their mysteries, you'll see Heyer has the same dexterity. The era is like another character in the book with its authentic vintage charm and style. This is a gem of a mystery for Golden Age mystery aficionados to relish and cherish."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"I'm not a fan of Ms Heyer's regency romances, but I have enjoyed her mysteries. In this book, the tyrannical patriarch of a family is discovered dead in his bed. While his sister, sister-in-law, niece and nephew who live with him believe he must have died of a heart attack in his sleep and his doctor declares he died of natural causes, his other sister who comes over, takes one look at him and demands a postmortem, much to the alarm and horror of the rest of the family.The heir is loathed by all in the family for being irreverent and rude. But is he all that he seems? The results of the postmortem indicate that death was the result of poison. But how was it administered and who could have done it. Our Inspector Hannasyde is baffled at the lack of clues. There is no shortage of suspects ... it seems everyone had a reason to want dear old Uncle dead. In building the case, Ms Heyer keeps us guessing right until the last couple of pages."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"This murder mystery was so much fun! I happen to be partial to Heyer's mysteries, and this was the perfect comfort read for me.The Matthews are a dysfunctional family with lots of eccentric characters. The family head is murdered and everyone's worst qualities are brought to light. Secrets are revealed. Attachments are formed and broken. Everything is chaotic, and no one knows who to trust.Inspector Hannasyde is on the case, but he is not the focus of the plot. The scenes are all stolen by members of this crazy family. I loved the piously hypocritical widow, the cheapskate spinster, and the snakelike elder cousin. In typical Heyer fashion, the characters are memorable and amusing.Recommended for those who love old fashioned murder mysteries with great characters."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"I can only wonder what it might have been like reading (eyes) this book; hearing Hugh Dickson perform it was a fine experience. His command of different voices is first rate, he made each character live without any sense of forcing an unreal voice for the opposite sex or different characters within his sexual group. The book, itself, is a family drama of a high order filled with oddity as well as the perfectly normal idiosyncrasies which mark any human group. The plot is admirably obscured save for those who insist on solutions at which a reader can arrive with the clues provided in the text ( as in Ellery Queen's early work). I don't believe the author makes any effort to provide such clues; this suits me since it is the story as story and characters as people which most interest me. If I figure out 'Who Dun It'. it is simply because the logic of the story strongly suggests it. That is not the case here.I was not aware of Georgette Heyer before acquiring this audio book. I see she wrote, as a good professional will, many works in many genres. I note that many of her works have recently been reissued in \\"quality\\" (more expensive) paper bounds. They are also available as text and robotically read works on the kindle (although that is not my source for the product I am reviewing).I can commend this rendition (again, I cannot comment on text edition) to anyone who is not exclusively into the thriller, the courtroom drama or the gritty, out on the dark streets, sub-genres. This is basically the classic British mystery of the Christie or Allingham type, or the American versions of the Ellery Queen type of book."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"Although Georgette Heyer is primarely known for her Regency romances, she was also a writer of my classical English mysteries. This one is certainly her best. Although the plot is not exactly brilliant (hence only 4 stars) the characters are up to her usual standards, esp as the odious hero Randall who you love to hate and hate to love. Very entertaining, not only for Heyer's many fans..."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"Georgette Heyer was a wonderful author. Her characters live, her conversations scintillate, and her plots are tantalizing."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"Even worse than The Unfinished Clue, this one is no fun at all...where's the mirth? Bickering family members nagging each other on the same topics again and again. Almost each one with a plausible motive and opportunity because supposedly the method of administration of the poison was not known. But if you're familiar with the methods of Murder She Wrote and how the camera zooms in on everyday objects because they are major clues, you will also understand how the poison was administered just after the murder because the author \\"zooms in\\" on the clue. Nothing special/clever about the solution. This was my 4th Heyer book and I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"I believe Georgette Heyer was hoping to make the cousin Randall an attractive bad boy a la Johnny Depp; instead, he comes off as simply repugnant, like Philip Seymour Hoffman in the indie film \\"Happiness.\\" Some of the other characters are simply caricatures. As others have mentioned, Heyer is tight-fisted with the clues, although the set-up is a clever one.Detective Inspector Hannasyde is an amiable and clever fellow, but readers would do better to instead read \\"The Unfinished Clue,\\" which is a better mystery with more likable characters."},{"Title":"Artistry on Ice: Figure Skating Skills and Style","review":"Nancy Kerrigan, two-time Olympic medalist, has written a book for skaters full of tips and advice that she has learned and used during her years as a Senior skater.

This one is the story of George Bull, the last of a dying breed of general practice physicians in New England in the 30s. Bull is extremely memorable -- a man living in the present, with few regrets, but coping with the cynicism that comes from watching patients die regardless of the level of care. When a public health crisis splits the town into factions, Bull's fate as a doctor hangs in the balance.

This man wasconsidered to be the premier poet of his day, and whileit is true that fashions in taste change, it is nottrue that deeper insight, once gained, is meant to bebrushed aside. Few people ever achieve deeper insight,so we should listen sometimes to those who do.There are many poems in this complete collectionwhich even modern academics may not be aware of. I wassurprised to learn that a modern academic admitted thathe had no idea of where the idea of \\"poetic inspiration\\"came from [ancient Greece] though he could have probablyspouted quotes from Marx or Derrida line for line. Wehave lost contact with the knowledge and culture, notonly of America's past, but of the world's cultural past.Too much attention has been lost on Longfellow in\\"immortalizing\\" him for the memorized poems. Moreattention needs to be paid to him, especially inthese modern times, for his deeper insights, hisoffering up of the Orphic, Pythagorean, and hermetictraditions as well. As one modern critic has said ofhim: \\"If Longfellow's achievements have been minimizedin our century, that is partly because students ofAmerican literature have been less interested in theconservative aesthetics of restraint than in thecomparatively radical-experimental aesthetics ofvisionary romanticism.\\" -- Lawrence Buell; \\"Introduction\\"to _Selected Poems_ (Penguin Classics). Yet, modernsare cutting themselves off from an even loftiervisionary past...one that extends back to ancienttimes and has richly influenced the thought andwritings of many of the world's more profoundthinkers and poets. Longfellow was also a translatorof the work of other poets -- but we should understandthat we can tell something about a poet and histhinking...and his being shaped by experience...inhis selection of the poems that he wishes to take thetime and effort to translate.Thus, we should look carefully -- and listencarefully - to Longfellow when he chooses to translate\\"Coplas De Manrique\\" (from the Spanish). It is notjust everyone who would translate, or understand,something like this: \\"But O, how false and full of guile/That world, which wore so soft a smile/But to betray!/She, that had been his friend before,/Now from thefated monarch tore/Her charms away.\\"And the explanatory note which was printed withthe poem helps us to see why Longfellow chose it:\\"In the language of his historian, 'Don Jorge Manrique,in [this] elegant Ode, full of poetic beauties, richembellishments of genius, and high moral reflections,mourned the death of his father as with a funeral hymn.This praise is not exaggerated. The poem is a modelof its kind. Its conception is solemn and beautiful;and, in accordance with it, the style moves on, --calm, dignified, and majestic.\\" (p. 27)The poems I would suggest need fresh attention andmodern reading are: Coplas De Manrique; Endymion;The Goblet of Life; Mezzo Cammin; The Occultation ofOrion; Gaspar Becerra; Suspiria; Prometheus; Enceladus;Fata Morgana; The Haunted Chamber; Charles Sumner[the thoughts expressed]; The Herons of Elmwood; HarounAl Raschid; Palingenesis; Hawthorne (May 23, 1864);Three Friends of Mine (5 sonnets); The Descent ofthe Muses; Keramos; Rondel (translation from Froissart);Ovid In Exile (Tristia, Book III, Elegy X); fromthe Seven Sonnets from Michael Angelo (To VittoriaColonna; Dante; Canzone); Jugurtha; Night; HermesTrismegistus; Possibilities; Dedication (beforethe poem Michael Angelo).There is much of wonder, solemnity, and grandeurin Longfellow. As Albert Glover says in theIntroduction to this volume: \\"...Longfellow's workremains noble in its dedication to ideals whichdefy mere fashion. His voice is learned, tolerant,compassionate, and courageous.\\" (--Albert Glover,\\"Introduction.\\")Here are a few lines from \\"Endymion\\":Like Dian's kiss, unasked, unsought,Love gives itself, but is not bought;Nor voice, nor sound betraysIts deep, impassioned gaze.It comes, -- the beautiful, the free,The crown of all humanity, --In silence and aloneTo seek the elected one.--Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.* * * * * * * * *"},{"Title":"Rogue Warrior: Detachment Bravo","review":"Just finished this book. The \\"proof\\" on which the Rogue Warrior bases his decision to seek to punish the \\"bad guys\\" is a little thin, except that in the final momemnts he is proven to be correct. One only hopes that somewhere the goverment actually does have at least one real rogue warrior out there protecting us from the real bad guys. The world does need real SeAls to keep us safe.Having known a number of SeAls, the fact that the fictional Marchinko speaks several languages and can drop literary references is not at all farfetched.

Plus all the swearwords, which are only usually used by people who have nothing worth saying... BUT I salute RM, cos I liked it..lots! Just like the &quot;Sten&quot; books (you'll love em boys), silly things like character development are sacrified for a breathless, headlong dash of a plot that has no mercy for pointless waffle. There's loads of action, blowing things up and male bonding, done with suitable stiff upper lip Britishness by Mick and square jawed Yank machismo by Dick (unfortunate names there, RM, Mick &amp; Dick sounds like a Morcambe and Wise sketch). of course it's the same book the 9th time with a few minor alterations, but it's so well done that it's highly enjoyable, with plenty of humorous asides - it knows not to take itself too seriously. I heard of these through Suzanne Brockmann's Alpha Squad seal romances (sorry, boys to use the r word) and I would not only read another one but I'llkeep it for reference as I'm a writer - if I want to utilize some &quot;gun words&quot; but don't want more than surface details, I can bang in the MP5 HK room broom with confidence! If your male partner won't touch the written word, the RW series is the place to start, as it's Boys Own all the way, and there is no actual depth to it - like Brockmann, RM addresses no real issues like sexual harrassment of female military personnel or persecution of same for their sexuality in the US Armed Forces, it's a straight rollicking adventure swashbuckler! The one part I strongly agree with is their views on authority - I know what it's like when them Above ingore the advice of them that actually does the work, and who has to clean up the mess...? RM and JW deserve every penny they've grafted out of this series, though I'm curious to know what real SEALs think of these and Brockmann et al.. Well done and let's have a few more!"},{"Title":"Rogue Warrior: Detachment Bravo","review":"I have been a big fan of the Rogue Warrior since his first book was released. While much of the books are fiction, there is also a great deal of understanding you can receive on what the military has the capability to do. I read this latest book after the 9.11.01 attack because I appreciate Marcinko's patriotism and desire to create warriors in the military. It seems to be the job of military shoul be to protect and defend, sometimes be being offensive. The two negatives I have towards his more recent books are the increased use of foul language and his use of &quot;insights&quot; of people, places and things during an action sequence in the story.I understand that the language used in the book is authentic but at what point there seems to be more of it just to reach the number of words appropriate for the book, what's the point? He also spends more time telling background on people or past events during an action sequence that should either be more concise or placed before the sequence begins. I find myself skipping over some of the history of his friends to find out what is happening in the present.I will look forward to future books, especially in light of the bombings and the American response and hope that Marcinko will return to a more direct type of story-telling that will encourage us to create and support men of war."},{"Title":"Rogue Warrior: Detachment Bravo","review":"Not quite as good as Echo Platoon, or previous works, but still a decent read.The basic gist is that Dick has been exiled to running a joint counter-terrorist operation in England/N. Ireland with Mick Owen and soldiers from various services. They're hunting the True IRA, a group that in Real Life is laughably incompetent but suddenly has an infusion of funds that they're using to do some really unpleasant stuff. Things go wrong, Dick gets his face in the news, again, and he gets an assignment to hunt down a splinter group, the Green Hand Defenders, and to eventually get their backers, a pair of Irish dot-com billionaires.Several themes stand out. First, the Rogue Warrior (R) is getting really old. He misses stuff he would've picked up on three books ago, stuff that's blindingly obvious to the reader. His network of support is retiring, and his patron, General Crocker, is taking his terminal leave.There's also more of a focus on Dick this time. In past issues, his supporting cast was a lot more involved. This time, though, it seems like they're just...there. Even Mick Owens barely does anything all novel long. Oh, they do stuff, it's just more glossed over than anything else.Finally, the opposition...just doesn't have any caliber to it. The dot-com billionaires are really rather pathetic, and none of the hired hands stand out as worthy opponents. The method the tangos were going to hit Target # 1 with was impressive, to say the least, but that was it. I'd really've liked somebody for Dick to fight who I could be truly worried would win.This is, of course, a good novel. It's entertaining, informative, and downright humorous at times. It's not quite as good as those that have come before, though."},{"Title":"Rogue Warrior: Detachment Bravo","review":"Let's get one thing straight right out of the chute: the \\"Rogue Warrior\\" series of novels aren't going to be winning Pulitzers anytime soon. These are pure, testosterone-driven, profanity-laced, escapes from reality; they have been a collection of books that have been fun to read. However, after reading \\"Rogue Warrior: Detachment Bravo\\", I have come to the conclusion that it may be time for Richard Marcinko to retire to his Rogue Manor.For starters, the most obvious criticism of \\"Detachment Bravo\\" is its utter predictability. It is a trend that started several novels ago and gets worse with each successive book. Heck, even someone who has only read one or two of his books could guess the action and plot. You can ALWAYS guarantee one or more sequences where Mr. Marcinko loses his weapon or runs out of ammo and has to grapple in hand-to-hand combat with a bad guy, will go personally greet and smack around the chief villain in the story, will go meet and smack around his superiors, and - in the climatic battle at the end of the story - will lose his weapon or ammo and kill the villain in a prolonged hand-to-hand combat sequence. Honest to goodness: for a guy who preaches perfection and team support, he is always goofing up, and his teammates - who are there to back him - are never around to shoot the bad guy he's wrestling. Again, I know it's fiction, but it really starts to grate on a reader after a while.The second criticism is that the plot in \\"Detachment Bravo\\" was poor. This series has never been too much about a plot, but he has done better. This one was not well thought-out, seemed disjointed in a lot of places, and was simply poorly developed. Yes, the reader knows who the bad guy(s) are, but it is never fully certain what their ultimate aim is or - more importantly - what they're doing other than trotting the globe on a yacht. What the reader is left with are the usual Rogue Warrior cliches found in every one of his books and the aforementioned predictability.Readers who want to get Richard Marcinko at his very best should read his first two books: the nonfiction \\"Rogue Warrior\\" and the first fiction book \\"Rogue Warrior II: Red Cell\\". They launched him to stardom, but he never really held this high level, slowly tapering off until a precipitous decline in quality of his last couple of novels. I rate the book with two stars; it could have easily been a one-star review, but he still wins points for sheer escapism in his writing.As I indicated at the outset, it may be time for Mr. Marcinko to put the \\"Rogue Warrior\\" series out to stud. If he decides to continue the series, this reader hopes that he will take a year or two off and develop a better story. Otherwise, I'm not wasting my money."},{"Title":"Rogue Warrior: Detachment Bravo","review":"My wife takes it as evidence of something profoundly wrong with me that I've read every one of Dick Marcinko's books. But then ... she can hardly be expected to understand anything about the joys of Rogue Fiction. Yes, sure, this is formula writing at it's most extreme: Marcinko has gotten rich writing the same book nine times. And, worse than that, if you think it's bad, I suspect he delegates all the work to co-author John Weisman, confining his own contribution to probably not much more than his name, Rogue persona, and the ugly mugshot they print on the flyleaves of these books. But Marcinko fans don't care about any of that, and in fact we admire him all the more for his self-interested Rogue cunning. Moreover, we like to think that he has more important things to do with his time - especially now - than sitting around like some kind of wonk in front of a keyboard typing out entertainment for us chair-bound tadpoles. Detachment Bravo has all the classic Marcinko plot motifs. It opens with a fast action scene in which Dick and his squad of oddly-named heroes take down a band of Tangos (terrorists for those unschooled in Rogue lingo), foiling their bloodthirsty plans. But, as always, there's no gratitude for Dickie. By flaunting the rules and showing up the incompetence of pencil-pushing military bureaucrats, he's brings down their vengeance instead. He and his loyal boys are forced out on the lam to unravel the vast Tango conspiracy, of which the opening attack was only a small manifestation. Relying on the limited protection of one True Warrior who has somehow survived in the military high command, and supported by his dwindling and embattled network of old-salt chiefs and other kindred sprits still scattered around in various places, Dick and his team go to work. They head off to various parts of the world and for several chapters engage in global high-tech sleuth work. They soon uncover evidence of a degenerate billionaire somewhere who is funding and masterminding the terrorists. Dick quickly tracks the guy down and, while not having enough evidence yet to take him out, nevertheless initiates an up-front-and-personal confrontation with him (i.e., slaps him around) just to let him know who's on the case. ... There is, of course, at least one detailed and slow-motion account of hand-to-hand combat between Dick himself and one of the unfortunate tangos, who meets his just end inevitably with something gruesome like a crushed skull. To anyone who has read even one of the books in this series, all this should all sound very familiar. Not that Detachment Bravo, like the others, doesn&#65533;t have it's own unique wrinkles. The degenerate billionaire, for example, here is actually two degenerate billionaires, a couple of twenty-something Irish brothers who have made it as (what else!) dot.com entrepreneurs. Who says Dickie can't stay current with the times? The novel also sports all the trademark stylistic devices: half a dozen or so 'f' and 's' words per page, parenthetical lectures on the perils of underestimating Mr. Murphy, goofy asides to the pedantic APE (All-Powerful Editor), sappy prayers of gratitude to the God of War for the privilege of leading brave warriors into battle, panegyrics to the healing powers of Bombay gin, and so forth. I sometimes worry about what would happen if Marcinko ever goes creative or sensitive on us, the way Clancy has tried to do in his more recent novels. However, I can happily report that Detachment Bravo gives strong evidence that we have nothing to fear on that score. I'm afraid I can't recommend this book to most wives or other sensitive souls, but Marcinko enthusiasts will love it.

As a library administrator and ex-Marine I can recommend this book because it is at the top of its genre. Sort of the manly man's version of what women refer to as &quot;light summertime reads&quot;, this novel is full of what action novels should be. I recommend it to all fans of action and suspense."},{"Title":"Rogue Warrior: Detachment Bravo","review":"After reading Marcinko/Weisman's last effort; Echo Platoon, I was glad to see an improvement. I found the same political and military commentary, the same profanity (I'd always like less of that)tactical detail and a generally good story. These books are only about a third, or less, the length of what Tom Clancy does these days but they have a lot of detail that just seems to make sense to me, even the plot line of this story isn't totally out of whack. So many action adventure writers don't seem to know which end of the gun barrel a bullet comes out of, these guys do. If you want something less than Clancy length but entertaining to read get this one."},{"Title":"Rogue Warrior: Detachment Bravo","review":"Eventhough the Rogue Warrior series has become fairly predictable, i have to say i always enjoy reading the latest installment, and this one was no exception.

And once more, the bad guys get theirs from every direction imaginable and a few that are beyond imagination, in spite of the incompentent leadership at the top. Dirty Dick will warp your mind if you don't move fast, stay low and watch your six! As the author of FADED COLORS, knowing personally &quot;Nasty Nick Grundle&quot;, &quot;Indian Jew&quot; and some of the other sorry lot of heroes, brave American warriors each, put nothing past these characters.

I have been reading his stuff since his autobiography and am still enjoying them. As always the book was blunt and expressed good views about politics and the military.

He shows what having a military especially such a highly trained one is for and how it should be used.... not how it should be managed like we see to much these days."},{"Title":"Rogue Warrior: Detachment Bravo","review":"Probably the weakest of the entire Rogue Warrior series, but the Rogue at half-strength is still much better than 90% of the writers out there and still worth reading.

His books, while erudite, passionate, sincere, thoughtful, and intellectually engaging, seem to engage the struggle for salvation only obliquely, with the head and not the heart. It is only because his themes are so weighty that this obliqueness becomes a flaw. Like most philosophical novels, Dreamer uses some cardboard characters to enact a morality play. The play -- and its characters -- are interesting enough to sustain prolonged contemplation. They do not, however, live on after the book is closed. Dreamer is original, compelling, and almost great. But its confidence makes it proud, and it stumbles over its eagerness for a message that is in the end all too true."},{"Title":"DREAMER: \\"A Novel About Martin Luther King, Jr.\\"","review":"While so many are willing to cast aside the struggles of the civil rights era as yesterdays news, Johnson tackles them head on. At its heart Dreamer is a valid book about M.L.King, whose worth comes from its peeling of King like an onion to expose the many layers and come close to the truth that doesn't appear every Feburary. Smith and Bishop are extremely developed characters who only deepen the books probing of King. A worthy read for a fan of fine lit. or American History."},{"Title":"DREAMER: \\"A Novel About Martin Luther King, Jr.\\"","review":"Dreamer by Charles Johnson gives a unique look at the life of Martin Luther King, Jr. By using a fictitious double, who must examine his own life in light of the civil rights era, Johnson allows the reader to see both King and Chaym Smith, the man who would be his stand-in, struggle with issues of nonviolence and its meaning in a violent world. This well-researched novel presents a fresh look at King's life by allowing artistic license to soar while it never clouds the truth. Although some details are the product of the author's imagination, others are well documented among King scholars. The presentation of fact in the environment of creative detail allows a glimpse of King that I have seen nowhere else. The story moves quickly and never digresses into detail that is irrelevant to the narrative, but gives enough pertinent detail to help those unfamiliar with the setting, while convincing those who know more details concerning King's life that the author is also a brilliant scholar. A GOOD READ."},{"Title":"DREAMER: \\"A Novel About Martin Luther King, Jr.\\"","review":"Dreamer is a fictional account that examines Dr. Martin Luther King's life during the civil rights movement. Johnson employs a King look-a-like character who, although has a strikingly similar physical appearance to King, is his antithesis in every other aspect. This allows Johnson to create a complete King like character that has faults and foibles that place him in the realm of humanness that is often times lost in our tendency to elevate King (deservedly so) to godlike status. This is a solid concept for a fictional piece but Johnson falls short in the most basic way - choice and use of language - to deliver on this concept.Johnson's choice of words throughout the first half of the novel created more distance than clarity. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for expanding the vocabulary, but in fictional literature the words chosen must create a rhythm, a flow that maintains the reader's interest and does not distract from the meat of the novel. In Dreamer, the author's choice of \\"big words\\" seems forced and awkward. \\"He felt too tired to move, but his mind, from surface to seabed, kept whirring widdershins.\\" This is only one example of Johnson, poor choice of words. There are plenty more in the novel. Enough to cause me to close the book and move on to a little lighter reading, like the Oxford Unabridged dictionary."},{"Title":"DREAMER: \\"A Novel About Martin Luther King, Jr.\\"","review":"Charles Johnson's Dreamer offers a riveting portrayal of thelast stages of Dr. King's career. By alternating descriptions of&quot;the minister's&quot; personal ruminations with the first-person observations and experiences of the narrator (a somewhat Charles Johnson-like Matthew Bishop), Johnson creates the convincing illusion at least of Dr. King as a complete and real being at that particular time in his life.While the obvious subject matter of his plot is compelling--overwhelming, almost, in its rendition of perhaps the most significant and ramifying social movement in American history--it is worth observing that Johnson continues consciously (and ably) to work in the tradition of &quot;moral fiction&quot; he learned, absorbed, and finally inherited from his own great teacher, John Gardner. That tradition holds as a central tenet Gardner's defintion of a &quot;good book&quot; as &quot;one that, for its time, is wise, sane, and magical, one that clarifies life and tends to improve it.&quot; While Dreamer, like Johnson's other fiction, obviously meets that criterion in general terms, Gardner's more concrete influence is subtly apparent throughout. For example, the scene in which Matthew ponders Dr. King's stitching his speeches and sermons together from various sources so skilfully that it is hard to tell where one voice ends and another begins recalls the strikingly similar techniques Gardner used in his fiction. Johnson doesn't make the explicit comparison, but it's obviously in his mind--as is the fact that both Gardner and Dr. King were accused, more or less, of plagiarism by some who did not understand their methods.Some readers have been puzzled at least by what they have seen as loose ends in Dreamer's conclusion: we never learn what those klutzy FBI men were up to, or what finally &quot;happens&quot; to Chaym. Such complaints, I think, seriously misunderstand what Johnson the novelist is up to at the end of his book. The ending is deliberately and meaningfully ambiguous, intentionally uncertain--although clues enough exist. &quot;What became of Chaym?&quot; is a very important question that Johnson purposefully refuses to answer explicitly, and it is not the only such question."},{"Title":"DREAMER: \\"A Novel About Martin Luther King, Jr.\\"","review":"When you approach a new piece of fiction by Charles Johnson, you should be ready with all your gifts of intellect and insight. You can be assured that Mr. Johnson will typically bring those gifts of his to the event. Dreamer is characteristic of much that readers have come to expect of Mr. Johnson. For example, all of the book's major characters are quite well versed both in the eastern and western philosophic and religious traditions. He characteristically manipulates reality that way, much as one might bend light with a prism-and with the same kind of pleasurable, revealing results.On the other hand, there is much in Dreamer that is new for Charles Johnson, and, thus, for his readers. In Oxherding Tale and Middle Passage, he demonstrated an ability to combine and to jump across genres. It is not surprising, then, that Dreamer tends to defy categorization. Although it is fiction set within a (relatively) recent historical context, and although the figure of Martin Luther King, Jr., is at its thematic center, the book is not merely fictionalized biography. Rather than a book &quot;about&quot; Dr. King, this is a novel suffused by his presence--despite the fact that other characters have more time &quot;on stage.&quot; The image of such a well-known figure looming over the story presents both potential opportunities and pitfalls for the author. Johnson's use of interior monologue to take us into the mind of a monumental figure is absolutely deft. Without a living Dr, King to consult, it would seem nearly impossible for anyone else to report what it was like to be the individual at the center of that whirlwind--but Johnson has done just that for us, and done it brilliantly. Historical figures, particularly martyred ones, tend to become, at best, abstractions or, at worst, icons. Johnson rescues King from either of those types of benign neglect and shows him rather as a human whose accomplishments came at the great expense of personal sacrifice. Before his life is lost he has tragically lost almost all time, not only personal time with his family but also time alone to think, to feel, and to continue his own intellectual and spiritual development.The counterpoint to King is Chaym Smith, a look-alike who resents and admires King, and who trains to become the dreamer's double. As does Lucifer in Paradise Lost, he at times threatens to steal the entire show. Yet Johnson does not take the easy route of making Smith a polar opposite of King. Smith too has gifts, and insights, and aspirations. Instead of being a pole apart, Smith is more like a brother who, by virtue of differing gifts and circumstances, careens along a different path through the universe.Structurally, neither King nor Smith can be the sustained voice that both frames and caries the novel from beginning to end. That voice belongs to Mathew Bishop, a Nick Caraway style narrator and a worker within the Movement who is all too aware of the margin by which he falls short when he compares himself to Dr. King. Yet Bishop himself has gifts and insights. At the end of the story he is close to the realization that all men and women fall short of an idealized vision of themselves, while at the same time they move inexorably in that direction as long as they keep that selfsame dream alive.This is not a perfect book, but it is a fine one from a member of that small circle of writers potentially capable of delivering a 10+. At times Johnson uses the device of sections of exposition, set apart in italics, to provide background and to prepare the story for its next move forward. The device works well enough, although occasionally, perhaps because Johnson obviously enjoys research, it risks the peril of stopping too long to tell us too much. But there is such skill in Charles Johnson's craftsmanship, such daring in his willingness each time out to do work that is difficult and important, and such obvious sincerity and empathy in the homage that is Dreamer, it seems almost off-point to notice slight imperfections. Rather, we appreciate the gift we are given here--fiction that achieves the elusive goal of Greek tragedy, showing others to us in a way that enables us to better understand, and to improve, ourselves."},{"Title":"DREAMER: \\"A Novel About Martin Luther King, Jr.\\"","review":"I truthfully just don't get Charles Johnson. He has the makings of a really first rate novelist, but for whatever reason--vanity about his ability to get away with it?, lack of confidence in the value of his work without it?, skewed perceptions?--he clutters up his work with magic and he strains for a vocabulary and an erudition that sound totally unnatural. His National Book Award winner, Middle Passage (see Orrin's review), could have been a terrific book in the classic American nautical adventure tradition of The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym (see Orrin's review), Moby Dick, Billy Budd (see Orrin's review), Two Years Before the Mast, The Sea Wolf (see Orrin's review), etc.. But in mid-story he added on a storyline involving a mysterious African God and the whole thing went to heck in a handcart. In Dreamer, he's up to the same tricks and it's a shame.Johnson apparently wrote the book because he wanted to try to understand Martin Luther King as a man and a moral philosopher, absent all of the mythos that has grown up around his martyred memory as a civil rights leader. He does an admirable job of recounting what writings and which theologians most influenced him and of presenting King, in his own words, giving sermons and speeches that develop his own philosophy. But there is another entirely unnecessary, even destructive, plotline in the novel. King's evil twin, Chaym Smith, appears and offers to act as his body double. Smith is violent, profane and cynical but also widely read and deeply philosophical. Johnson plays him off against King with Chaym taking the role of Cain and King of Abel. this allows Johnson room for extended meditations on the Cain/Abel tale, the duality of good and evil, and so on. Eventually, after coaching from aides, Chaym is able to pass for King at public events and even close associates can not tell the two men apart, so that on that fateful day in Memphis, we are no longer sure which one died.Now, first of all, I just didn't feel that the Smith character added much to the story, In fact, because he so often takes us away from the true Martin Luther king, he is more of a distraction, often bringing the narrative to a screeching halt. But there's a bigger problem with this device; if you're going to use this kind of allegorical feature, you had better think through what you are saying with it. Johnson does not appear to recognize how the comparison to Abel diminishes King. Abel was after all a figure of virtual slavery. He was the gatherer, living off the fat of the land, who found favor in God's eyes precisely because he lived as God intended Man to live before the Fall. It is Cain who represents freedom and Man after the Fall, struggling to raise his own crops independent of God and being rejected by God for this very reason. To allude to King as an Abel like figure, when he is actually one of the great freedom fighters in Man's history, seems to me to be a nearly unforgivable sin. Moreover, the implication that King was a kind of passive, slave like creature does the man a great disservice.Ultimately, Johnson has produced two books here--one good and one bad. The sections where King is on stage are vibrant and thrilling. They recapture some of the majesty of the man and the movement. The portions featuring Chaym Smith are flashy, particularly as they allow him to use SAT worthy vocabulary words that trip off the tongue like boulders, but they cheapen the rest of the book. He should have stuck to his knitting, dropped the doppelganger and ditched the dictionary.GRADE: C"},{"Title":"DREAMER: \\"A Novel About Martin Luther King, Jr.\\"","review":"DREAMER held a lot of promise and was a very deep read. The story involves Chaym Smith, who offers himself as a decoy/stand-in to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., because he bears too familiar a resemblence to the good Doctor. Told from the perspectives of Dr. King and one of his aides, Matthew Bishop, the novel took us from marches to meetings involving heads of state to the breakdown of Chaym's personality, which was a complete 360 degrees from that of man he was hired to impersonate. The author was able to structure the personalities of the players involved and made the fictional charaters of Matthew and Chaym convincing and compelling. However, the book was so weighed down with thoughts and agendas that were so complex in context, that it was a little hard to get back on track, especially when you have forgotten where you left off, and you are still reading the book. A good read for those wanting something different and four-dimensional."},{"Title":"DREAMER: \\"A Novel About Martin Luther King, Jr.\\"","review":"You know a movie's a hit when the audience remains sitting while the credits roll. A great novel affects me the same way. I'm silently awed by the gift of a powerful story.Charles Johnson has written such a strong tale. His &quot;hero,&quot; Chaym Smith, is an embittered, tattered, unemployed, former mental patient and drunk. He has one gift and one curse. He's brilliant, with a &quot;photographic memory,&quot; and he looks exactly like Martin Luther King. Having thoroughly ruined his own life, he volunteers to serve as a double for King. If he dies substituting for the man he honors, at least his life will have meant something.King reluctantly agrees, and two young workers take Smith to the country to train him in King's body language and speech patterns. Smith is a quick learner, but a frightening debater. He insists equality is impossible. Even in the beginning, God preferred Abel to Cain (a variation of his first name) for unexplained reasons. Still, he'll risk his life for his Abel.Quoting extensively from King's speeches and colleagues' remembrances, Johnson shows how King's thought was moving beyond the narrow goal of racial equality to the basic Christian concept of self-sacrificing love for all. King wants to lead his people further than white suburbia, to the real Promised Land. Like Christ and Gandhi, his heroes, his prophetic message will generate violence.Especially in the passages written from King's point of view, Johnson, a National Book Award winner, shows the incredible pressures on a man whose words can provoke riots but not understanding. No matter how familiar the subject seems before you begin reading, this novel will haunt you.Kathleen T.

Johnson does well both in making Martin seem very real, yet in not &quot;overusing&quot; him--the real protagonists are three &quot;Movement&quot; members who move in his orbit and are themselves complex, interesting characters. Lots of food for thought here, including musings on the (sinful) nature of humanity, repeatedly amplified by the mythic story of Cain and Abel, which Johnson uses on several levels. The best part of this book is Johnson's thoughtful condemnation of extreme (intolerant) ideology, as exhibited by separatists black and white. The one flaw, in my view, was Johnson's failure to follow through on the use of MLK's double, Chaym. As the plot nears its climax Chaym is co-opted by the FBI, which intends to use him to discredit MLK--but then Chaym simply disappears from the story.

There Are No Electrons by Ken Amdahl (to assist the basic book on electricity and magnetism)3.

He attempts to tie all of the information together as best he can, though. He sometimes goes on tangents, but he always explains the tangents and connects them to what he is discussing. The chapter early in the book on Mathematics is useful to someone who isn't interested in grappling with modern physics mathematical workings.I have one complaint about the book, however. I think Krauss is very ignorant of philosophy. I was somewhat offended by one of his comments, though I am sure (in light of the rest of the book) he meant the comment in a light-hearted manner. Something to the effect that philosophy is useless.Nevertheless, Krauss tosses a lot of names into the book and gives the reader some good quotes from those men.

In his first example he shows how when you say 'cow' to a physicist, the physicist thinks 'sphere.' Then after explaining why the Physicist sees the world this way, he maintains that stance all through the book, till the very last line.Along the way he talks about three things - Process, Progress and Principles. i.e what is the process of discovery that Physicists use, what progress have Physicists made and what are the underlying principles of physics.I had several aha moments throughout the book. The equivalence between electricity and magnetism explained in a way through illustrations that struck me as pretty lucid.Why, to a physicist there is equivalence between the behavior of iron and water (a beautiful explanation of phase transitions)And the clearest explanation of relativity I have read so far - not that I still get it - but I feel like I know just a little more. He goes through the famous example of two people on opposing trains. And for the first time I get what the perspective of each person is. Also for the first time I get space-time as a concept. For some reason I was stuck in a cartesian mindset of 3 dimensions of space and then time. But Krauss' explanation of space-time as one thing was really worth the price of the book.Finally he talks about the theory of symmetry by the little celebrated German female mathematician Noether and how that under-girds symmetry in the Universe.Krauss is a physicist worth following, who has taken the time to translate physics in an entertaining way for the masses.He along with Sean Carroll from CalTech are my two favorite Physicists now and both are available plenty on youTube."},{"Title":"Fear Of Physics: A Guide For The Perplexed","review":"I totally loved the book.Its full of insightful points and connections that will put you in a state of awe.

In \\"The Girls,\\" we get to know four women, who have been friends for decades, through the death of one man, Pete Chickery. One of \\"The Girls\\" was married to Pete, but all of them had a relationship of one type or another with him. After he is killed, the story of who Pete was, what he meant to each of them, and their relationships with one another come into focus. While this core group intrigued me, the peripheral characters - children, parents, housekeepers, etc., really gummed up the works for me. The story was simple, but the more characters that I was intoduced to, the more my interest waned.I also didn't particularly care for the structure of the first three \\"chapters,\\" when each character was speaking directly to another person to whom we had not been introduced. Yet, when we finally meet that person, she is simply a part of the story, and not the omniscient presence that I was prepared to meet. Perhaps the reason that the story failed to \\"flow\\" for me, was due to that fact that once I became accustomed to one voice, it changed dramatically into another, then another. It never had the rythym that it needed to keep me turning pages."},{"Title":"Girls","review":"I stumbled across this book at the library and checked it out on a whim. I am so glad I did ...

Kagan does a remarkable job of showing the same person as 4 different personalities as seen through the eyes of these friends who each mourn his death in his own way. After the reader finally decides that he has a clear picture of who this man was and why he his dead, Ms. Kagan suprises us further"},{"Title":"Girls","review":"What a joy to read an author who *knows* about women.

The rainbow system of color-coding each and every verse makes reading and studying the Bible more enjoyable and productive. I can't remember how many times I've flipped through the gospels looking for a particular verse by its color. There is no extraneous information (i.e. devotional sections or in-text explanations), and this helps to make this Bible a great study aid, giving each verse importance in a particular topic area (God, Commandments, Discipleship, Faith, etc.). I would heartily recommend this book to everyone, ESPECIALLY to the Christian who is reading his/her Bible for the first time.

Dozens of specially selected agents waited for the word to begin the assault. Their only guidance from their boss, the US Attorney General, is to bring Juarez in alive so he can be pressured to rat on other cartel members. However, the simple attack turns into a trap and three agents soon lie dead. Juarez is killed as he tries to escape through the woods.Northern California District Attorney Nora Ray investigates the fiasco. She quickly concludes the Feds are hiding and stone walling what happened in Muir County. Nor also believes someone executed Juarez. She asks a reluctant friend, defense attorney Luke Garrison to act as a Special Prosecutor to help her bring the case to justice. Though he believes justice was served with Juarez's death, Luke agrees that no one is ABOVE THE LAW. However, neither Nora nor Luke knows that their investigation will leave both in danger as they surf through the underbelly of society.ABOVE THE LAW is a astonishingly exhilarating police-legal thriller that will excite readers with its non-stop action and strong characterizations. The story line is filled with exciting conflict from start to finish. The cast (&quot;heroes and villains&quot;) is developed so that readers comprehend their motives, connections, and treachery. Additionally, the return of Luke Garrison (see THE DISAPEARANCE and not the Seagal movie) brings back one of J.F. Freedman's best charcaters. The New York Times bestselling author spins a triumphant complex novel that will attain more acclaim for Mr. Freedman.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"This is the second story about Luke Garrison, the former DA from Santa Barbara, who is a again pulled from his tiny law practice to handle a huge case that the whole country is watching.The case centers around a major drug kingpin who is killed while in the custody of the DEA after an attempted drug bust went bad.I think Freedman makes a critical mistake in this book, in that the entire story revolves around a very bad guy who it's really hard to care about. If you can't care about the central cause for the story, then it's also hard to care about who killed him and why.It was an OK read. The characters, as always, are very well developed. There are also some sub plots that creep in and out of the story that are good. There are just too many dead spots in between the parts that interested me.If you like Freedman, it's worthy of reading. If you've never read Freedman, check out &quot;The Disappearance&quot; first.

The federal agents had explicit orders to capture Reynaldo Juarez alive, so how did he escape custody only to end up with a bullet through his brain? Santa Barbara attorney Luke Garrison is brought in as Special Prosecutor by his old law school friend, Nora Ray, now the local D.A.As Luke begins building an airtight case against DEA agent Sterling Jerome for Juarez's murder, troubling questions arise about the local sheriff, sudden wealth on the nearby Indian reservation, the veracity of some of the evidence against Jerome, etc. And there's something about Nora... This is a great novel encompassing elements of mystery, suspense, police procedural, and courtroom drama, with a shocker of an ending."},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"There is a bit of a conundrum here. If you haven't read The Disappearance before reading this one, you will enjoy this one more, because you won't know the true mystery maestro that Freedman can be. BUT, if you haven't read The Disappearance, you won't know the background on Luke and Riva which adds interest and wrinkles to Above the Law.This is a good read. The mystery is well presented, and the author gives readers several believable red herrings to suspect and follow before ultimately revealing who the killer is. It is well paced, and Freedman is a gifted writer, particularly in capturing the aura of places: Santa Barbara, and the small towns of Northern California, among others.Ultimately, though, it doesn't measure up to the riveting, edge-of-the-seat, I've-got-to-stay-up-all-night-to-finish-this-book drama that Freedman offered in The Disappearance.Above The Law is a very good novel, but not the truly great read that Freedman offered mystery lovers with The Disappearance."},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"I picked this up in paperback at an airport. I have not read Freedman before and wasn't familiar with the book - it just caught my eye and I had some time to kill.Freedman's strength is a complex plot line that will likely reveal a few surprises in the final pages. He gives the narrator (former prosecutor Luke Garrison) a great back story - which makes it easier to get absorbed in the book. You won't always agree with the decisions Garrison makes, but you'll probably appreciate the dilemma that forced the decision.The moral angles in the story were sometimes overplayed, but in all I felt that it added a dimension to the story that over novelists frequently omit. There are times when you feel Garrison (the narrator) is looking to the reader for approval; once or twice is OK... but after a half dozen similar pleas, it gets old.Freedman does sacrifice his secondary characters - they are little more than caricatures to move the story along. But in Luke, Nora, Riva, the sherriff, and Louise you get characters who have more at stake than is often apparent.I enjoyed the story, and it certainly passed the time. I'm eager to pick up The Disappearance based on other reviews here... I would certainly recommend Above the Law as an entertaining thriller that will keep you guessing up to the final chapter."},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"The author does a nice job of keeping the story active, and the reader does keep turning the pages, but this book falls flat sometimes. A supposedly first rate detective investigates the DEA for homicide of a scumbag. The plot has some twists, but the twists never come full circle really, and too late in the story a new curve appears that fizzles the ending. With the introduction of the whole Indian tribe deal, I think the author may have blown what could have been a true grit kind of book. Instead, I was left finding the book sort of predictable at that point, and then a little ridiculous. The main character is noble, sincere, and unrealistically honest for his field of work. The ex-team leader turned suspect is formidable as well, and the courtroom drama is very good. The author's style is impressive, this is the first novel I have read by this author, and I found the book easy to read and pleasantly cushioned with understandability. It took me about 4 days to read it, and I rate it average.

While Garrison sympathizes with DA Nora Ray, the old friend whose promising life has badly fizzled, her sexual advances force him to shut her out of the progressing investigation. Gathering evidence from high officials and ruthless gang leaders, uncovering old secrets and new, Garrison puts together an explosive and controversial case and tries to keep any surprises from developing in his orchestrated prosecution. While at times overwritten, the story is absorbing, sparking new interest with a succession of twists and turns. Freedman (&quot;The Disappearance,&quot; &quot;Key Witness&quot;) also explores legal ethics and conflicts between a lawyer's obligation and the truth.

The basic story, as set forth in the other reviews, involves Luke Garrison, the former DA for Santa Barbara, being appointed special prosecutor to assist a law school friend with the investigation of a botched DEA raid.Freedman does a great job with characterization and a little too good a job with foreshadowing. There was not a single plot point &quot;revealed&quot; at the end of the novel that was not completely obvious several pages earlier.The other problem was that the book was about 10-15% too long. First there is the investigation, then there is the trial, complete with the same questions from the investigation. Unneccessary repetition made the book longer than it needed to be.That said, I still liked the book.

The raid had been planned with military precision - scoop a multi-million dollar shipment of drugs as the delivering plane lands on a private runway; whisk the DEA informant safely away under the very noses of the gang members; and arrest Reynaldo Juarez, the shadowy drug czar who has managed to avoid the clutches of the DEA for years. Most important of all is the over-riding mission order that Juarez must, at all costs, be brought in alive.When the gang ambushes the raiding officers with more firepower than a Desert Storm battalion, it is clear that the DEA has been double crossed. Several DEA agents are killed in the ensuing fire fight and, after the dust has settled, Juarez is assassinated under the very eyes of Sterling Jerome, the DEA agent in charge of the stupendously botched raid.But by whom? That's the question that Nora Ray Sherman asks Garrison to determine as she arranges for his appointment by the California Attorney General as the attorney in charge of the investigation into Juarez's murder.\\"Above the Law\\" is a thrilling legal procedural that tells the story of a very believable and very topical high profile drug case and murder from start to finish. A complex plot is revealed in the context of a most satisfying legal procedural that wends its way through basic investigation to indictment by the grand jury and ultimately to a final surprising conclusion during the actual trial. The story is peopled by a strong cast of well-developed characters and entirely credible dialogue that flows easily and convincingly.\\"Above the Law\\" is a thoroughly enjoyable novel that definitely deserves your time. Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"This is the second book I have read of this author. This novel is basically a mystery mixed in with some courtroom scenes. This is a classic mystery in which the reader doesn't know who the killer is until the last chapter.Luke, very successful criminal defense attorney suddenly receives a call from Nora, an old law school friend. Nora happens to be the District Attorney of Muir County in Northern California. She convinces Luke to take on a temporary assignment as a special prosecutor to find out and prosecute the person who has killed Juarez, the drug lord. Juarez was in custody of the Drug Enforcement Administration after the Agency raided Juarez's compound in the Muir County.Luke recruits a team and conducts an independent investigation. All the circumstantial evidence points to Jerome, the agent-in-charge of the raid. Jerome hires a high-profile defense attorney to represent him in court. Most of the book follows Luke's investigation and the subsequent courtroom battle. The ending as usual is a surprising one.* Character Development: Freedman spends a fair amount of time developing Luke's character. In fact, he is practically the only person in the book that receives any serious attention from the author. Luke could be a very likable character. Unfortunately, the author seems unable to make up his mind whether Luke is a super-hero or a once very successful and now very tired attorney who wants no more glory.Freedman spends the first few chapters describing Luke's heroic action where he single-handedly protects all the people trapped in a bar by killing two bank robbers who hold those people hostage. At the same time, Luke is described as a very family-oriented man who doesn't want any more high-profile cases. He has seen it all. Therefore, he started his one-man firm which handles only small but highly-billed cases. I was left with a feeling of not knowing what kind of character Luke really is. Score: 3.* Pacing: For the most part, the pace is rather fast. It starts out a little slow, then the pace picks up and gets quite exciting in the middle. Score: 3.5.* Plot: The plot is the classic whodunit. Unfortunately, Freedman does not develop as good a plot as he could. There are times that the investigators are just chasing phantom leads. I realize that real-life detective works are quite boring. But this is a novel, so I do not expect a lot of details describing routine grunt work. A top-notch writer will certainly know how to allocate space between key events and minor events. Score: 2.5.* Storytelling: The chapter's length is uneven and generally quite long. It certainly shows that this is not a top-notch novel if I feel the chapters are too long. Freedman also has a habit of writing long and complex sentences. This is in sharp contrast to James Patterson, who likes to write in simple sentences and short chapters. I obviously enjoy the latter's writing style.This novel is written in first person with a lot of conversation. Conversation could be very powerful writing if used properly, especially in courtroom scenes. However, the author uses too much conversation in the book and, as a result, it slows down the pace. I just don't think this type of writing style fits well in a fast-paced thriller.In addition, this book would be much better if it were 10 to 20% shorter, especially the beginning part which glorifies Luke's heroic event. Fortunately, the pace is relatively fast, which offsets some of the above mentioned negatives. Score: 2.5.* Reviewer's Lean: When I tallied up the score, it came to only 2.9. I think this book deserves a 3.5 for the simple reason that I want to find out the ending. Therefore, I'm adding half a point and rounding it up to 3.5."},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"My wife got me this book for Christmas so of course I read the entire thing. Freedman is obviously a good writer but this was a pretty bad novel.Luke Garrison is a prosecutor assigned to try a case of a botched DEA raid in remote Muir County, CA. He tries the lead DEA agent for a murder and the plot goes from there.Here are the problems I had with this novel. First, it is about twice as long as it should be. Skip the opening 30 pages. They are like a short story that adds nothing. Second, Garrison and his investigators interview all the witnesses, talk about what they interviewed about, question the witnesses in court, then talk about it some more. All of the facts are repeated several times. Also, Freedman seems to be slightly out of touch with reality. His character names are sometimes silly, (nora, riva, a child named bucky, an Indian nanny named Joan.) Also, who would hire a nanny in the remote Muir county when they didn't have one in busy L.A. Someone who needed to move the plot forward I guess.If you are a fan of this author, then maybe you've learned to live with the lack of quality of some of Freedman's novels. But I'll stop with this one."},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"I listened to the unabridged tape and then checked the hardcover at the library. How come, during the Grand Jury hearing, the DEA bad guy is shown a receipt for bullets he bought and the receipt has HIS NAME ON IT but, when we get to the trial the defense attorney makes the gun shop salesman who remembers the DEA guy buying the bullets look like a dodo and the SUPER PROSECUTING ATTORNEY never introduces as evidence the receipt for the bullets with the DEA guy's name on it? And worse, the whole book is based on a prisoner's miraculous escape from a secure trailer and handcuffs. The DEA is looking for some clue as to how the guy got the cuffs off and escaped but can't find a legitimate explanation. Finally, at the end of the book, the perpetrator admits to having sneaked in through a &quot;secret&quot; door in the trailer. Does the author really think we should believe the DEA wouldn't have gone over that trailer and found that &quot;secret&quot; door when they were desparate for some explanation that would absolve them from blame? Come on, J. F.! That's cheating!"},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"In many novels now J.F.Freedman has demonstrated what a great writer he is. Particularly the Dissappearance, introducing us to Luke Garrisson, was an &quot;edge of the seat&quot; one.The great writing continues in this book. The first thirty odd pages about the hostage situation are captivating and seem to lead into a very good novel again...only it isn't. These pages bear no relation to the further plot other than to establish that Luke is a hero. That could have been done a whole lot quicker and without wetting the appetite with some very interesting characters.Unfortunately, this weakness continues in the rest of the book. A &quot;situation&quot; with a FBI action against drug smugglers ends totally wrong. DA Nora Ray and her sheriff friend invite Luke to come help prosecute the FBI agents involved. This leads to a very different situation for Luke, professionally as well as privately, but he solves it neat ly in the end.The telling of this story is excellent with very good development of the characters and interesting dialogue. What a pity the plot is so flawed..otherwise it would have been a real good read."},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"Above The Law is worth reading -- interesting plot, strong characters and fast-paced. However, unlike most of J.F. Freedman's legal thrillers, his latest effort provides few real surprises, as most of the attempted plot &quot;twists&quot; are apparent and predictable well in advance of when the author reveals them in the story. As other reviewers noted, one of the most exciting parts of the book is its opening sequence, although it has little relationship to the &quot;real&quot; story being told. Above The Law is a book that deserves to be read, but you might want to consider taking it from the library instead of buying it."},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"I have read both &quot;Above the Law&quot; and &quot;The Disappearance&quot; by J.F.

This book was a real disappointment for me. The story line was interesting (not always a feature of books by or about lawyers) but the characterisation (at which lawyers are often better because they meet so many different types of client) was poor. Worst of all was the hero himself: self-righteous, priggish, sanctimonious, self-congratulatory without an ounce of self-criticism, not overly bright... - you begin to catch my drift. I deeply disliked his belief that it was acceptable that it was right that the trial judge should &quot;know which side his bread was buttered&quot; and accordingly support the prosecution view at each stage. I was also unimpressed by the author's decision to use a big name defending counsel who, unsurprisingly, was no match for his hero in or out of court. The plot did not need a near patsy for the defence. It would have benefited from the complete opposite. These may sound like highly subjective responses, but then a reader is entitled to be subjective: he buys the book! I may give the author one more shot because of the very good reviews I have read of his other works and because the story line really wasn't bad. But one more chance is all he gets."},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"This was the first Freedman novel for me. I have since read the Disappearance and have just started Against the Wind. Above the Law was a great story, very suprising, suspensful, couldn't put it down. However, (and I know this is not Mr. Freedman's fault), there were MANY errors throughout the book. I was amazed. I have never read a book with more than one or two errors, but this had at least a dozen, maybe more. It didn't deter me from liking the story or reading another book by this author, but it was extremely frustrating. I didn't notice any in The Disappearance, but I did notice it was by a different publisher."},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"I have read all of Freedmans novels, and they are consistently of a much higher quality than many other more popular authors. For whatever reason he doesn't seem to get the recognition that he deserves. He should be a &quot;top 10&quot; author, but for whatever reason you never really hear much about him.Above the Law is another winner. Freedman creates rich, interesting characters who are also flawed and believeable, rather than the typical one-dimensional and perfect characters that appear in so many other books. He also writes excellent descriptions about people and places, giving lots of detail without bogging down the story. The plot is fast paced and exciting without a dull moment. Above the Law also examinines many legal and moral issues, adding another dimension to an already fantastic book. A well written, absorbing tale that you should not miss."},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"Though there were some problems, I did enjoy the first thirty pages of this novel: Nice dramatic plotting that grabbed me. Before long, the reader encounters developments which make little sense. Also,there are typos and really sloppy syntax which become increasing tiresome. I'm beginning to think we should all chip in for some of these best-seller authors to retake English 101. Simple sentence structure is obviously beyond many of them. The editors must have been on vacation when this one was published. About page 150, I just couldn't stand anymore of this tripe.Oh, it does not help that the protagonist is a jerk. A Muir County D.A. requests attorney Luke Garrison assume the role of special prosecutor. When he eventually decides to accept, he makes absurd demands, such on-demand use of air transport to and from his home (quite far away) and obscenely high fees for a financially depressed area. Were I in the D.A.'s office, I'd have suggested this egotistical SOB go take a flying leap!!"},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"This author has discernible skill, but is unfortunately hobbled by his background. An obvious child of the 60's, his politically-correct philosophy precludes a realistic appraisal of human behavior and hence leads to a leaden portrayal of character traits and motivations. He should limit his activities to the Hollywood scene and forego any attempt at entering the world of honest literary achievement."},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"As one person stated, this book has many flaws. One, it needed a better editor, just like Freedman's last book I read- Key Witness. Two, like someone else mentioned, the first story in this book, had nothing to do with the rest of the plot and it did not add to character development etc. It should not have been included. Three, it was slow going for me to get into the mystery and story. It was nearly 2/3rds into the book that I felt the story was finally moving along and I was finally getting a bit interested.Overall, I think I had a hard time getting into the story because I just didn't care for any of the characters, not even Luke. Especially not Nora or Jerome. At least, after sticking it out I did like the ending, although I predicted it early on and it was a bit far-fetched. I would not recommend JF Freedman, while I enjoyed The Disappearance, I have not liked any of his other books and I don't plan on giving him any more chances."},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"If you like courtroom dramas, you'll love this book.The only irritating thing about reading this novel was all of the glaring typos. It's amazing that it was published in such a state! Nonetheless, I enjoyed the storyline and stayed up late into the night to finish it."},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I will have to read more by this author. In the beginning there is a small story, that, while interesting, wasn't necessary to the main story.The DEA has staked out a compound used by drug dealers in a remote area of the state in an effort to catch the leader of the drug dealers. Information from a snitch within the group has it that a big deal is coming down and the leader, who they have been trying to catch for years, will be present. Something goes wrong and the leader, who they do catch, escapes and then is found dead, shot by an unknown assailant. Luke has been called in by the local DA to investigate and prosecute the culprit. The local DA, Nora, is an old college friend from years ago. The DEA gave the sheriff short notice about what was going on and his nose got bent out of shape as a result of being put on the sidelines. There are numerous twists and turns to the story that will keep you wondering who dunnit until the end. I highly recommend the book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"I just finished reading my second novel by Mr. Freedman, which I hate to say is a huge letdown in quality and plotting from the other work I read, \\"The Disappearance\\". In my opinion Mr. Freedman is making the same mistake Steve Martini made by delving into so-called \\"govenrment conspiracies\\" rather than letting his main character prosecute or defend normal, realistic crimes like he did in \\"The Disappearance.\\" On top of that, Freedman's villians and plot twists are so predictable they leave little for the reader to be surprised or care about. One final note for Mr. Freedman, if you introduce a new character over halfway into the novel, your reader knows that this person is involved in the conspiracy and is there to only tie up the many loose ends left open by your not so careful plotting. One final, final note --- the opening scene of the novel in which the main character goes to buy a motorcycle ( which has absolutely nothing to do with the last 90% of the novel) was much more interesting than the rest of the plot."},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"Overall pretty mediocre. You must believe a lot of nonsense to get through this book without throwing it down: 1) guy is killed and death ruled a suicide in the face of the simplest clue 2) Lady DA is dirty 3) She thinks the DEA will eventually solve a crime through sheer persistence (completely laughable) and so hires a friend who she knows is real smart to pursue the case, etc.Writing is about 2 steps above poor."},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"and didn't want to either! This book pulled me in and just got better and better! I've read two other novels by J. F. Freedman (Against the Wind and Key Witness)...they are all fabulous! His writing is straight-forward, engaging and utterly compelling. In this particular novel, you really start to feel like you know the main character, Luke Garrison, and the plot just thickens and thickens as he investigates a botched DEA raid, as a special prosecuter, brought in by an old law school chum, Nora Ray. Nora may have had ulterior motives for involving him, the reader begins to think, as we witness a very aggressive woman go after what she wants! Luke is very happily married with a young child and does not want to take any risks....he's been burned in the past and has learned his lesson! The story twists and turns but never goes off course......Freedman brings together moral and legal ethics with a good mix of real human spirit. His characters are sensible, likeable people, and his story-telling simply brilliant!

If I had not read this book first, I might not be so interested in going backward into this author's work!I found it to be a page-turner, and was thrilled with the expert team the special DA pulls in to assist in his investigation of the circumstances.There are a lot of plot twists as well as many additional interests from the involvement of a native American tribe, a suspected drug felon, the DEA and other local versus national agencies.The denouement was never as obvious as in the Disappearance so I gave it an A+!"},{"Title":"Above the Law: A Novel","review":"This story starts out with a little bit of promise. Luke Garrison heads out to the dessert where he buys an old motorcycle and ends up in an unexpected circumstance. The opening is more like a short story, having nothing else really to do with the rest of the novel. But it is also the best part of the tomb.From here it devolves into a jarring staccato edited mess. Maybe because I had not read previous novels in this series, this book made a lot less sense to me than someone who has read them. But I don't think this is the case. What Freedman does is introduce periphrial characters with no background or character development. A chapter starts and they are off and running. As you read it, you go \\"what?\\"Sadly, the very worst aspect of this novel is the plot itself. The story is plain out and out stupid. I can't really get into it with out giving away the story and though I hope you take my advice and skip this book, I also dont want to ruin it for someone looking forwards to it. But let me put it this way. The plot that involves Garrison in this mystery and its unfolding are very tediously silly and predictable. And when you are reading this, he sets it up so that you see a fast-switch coming from 200 pages off.SKIP THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"Rayuela Y LA Creatividad Artistica: Estudio Sobre LA Obra De Julio Cortazar (Coleccion Polymita) (Spanish Edition)","review":"ESPANOL Este libro presenta un analisis interesante sobre la interpretacion de Rayuela por Julio Cortazar.

One of the few things I learned reading the New York Review of Books was that praise for comedy of that kind was extremely rare. I had been reading philosophy for most of my life and only considered Nietzsche a master of irony, in the form of \\"many lies tell the poets,\\" and not just the poets lately. Gombrowicz had written a comic novel, FERDYDURKE, in Poland in the 1930s. Most of his novels were written in Argentina after World War II in Polish and were published in Paris.POLISH MEMORIES, published in a Polish language edition, Wspomnienia Polskie, in 2002, translated into English in 2004 by Bill Johnston for Yale University Press, is based on a typescript that has a few gaps. The flap at the front of the book says these sketches were written for Radio Free Europe during his years in Argentina. There is no date at the beginning, but within the text the dates run from July 4, 1960, to August 30, 1961. His DIARY contains many reactions to the literature being produced in the Polish language during his life. POLISH MEMORIES attempts to explain how well he knew many Polish writers and those who invited them to solons or caf&eacute; tables. The section dated February 6, 1961, starts with \\"I cannot recall how I first met Bruno Schulz.\\" (p. 113). When his CINNAMON SHOPS was published, Bruno was still a modest schoolteacher in Drohobycz. \\"He remained such a browbeaten provincial teacher till his tragic death in a German camp.\\" (p. 113). The people in Poland were vulnerable to that kind of influence from outside their borders. The main narrative ends with Witold Gombrowicz reaching Vienna on a train just after Hitler's Anschluss. One of the last characters described was a Nazi spy, which was not obvious until his interaction on the train with Nazi guards was a bit too easy to understand.The book starts with Gombrowicz's boyhood. What could possibly be wrong with being a Polish country bumpkin who hates school, where he only has a knowledge of Polish and French and is uninterested in learning anything else? Mainly he notices that the schools put so much emphasis on things that are Polish that any knowledge of anything beyond the end of their Polish noses gets crowded out. When Witold has the opportunity to study in Paris in 1928, he does not like the museums because people trying to appreciate great art look so stupid. He walks at night and finds people in a caf&eacute; that he can talk to, usually by opposing their manner of speaking, the reasons they like Paris, or whatever.Back in Poland as a young writer, he \`became known as \\"the King of the Jews,\\" since it was enough for me to sit down at a table to be surrounded by hordes of Semites; at the time they were my most gracious listeners' (p. 178) in the Ziemianska Caf&eacute; where he became acquainted with a lively group. Joined there by the Nazi spy, \\"Mr. Brochwicz-Kozlowski, a journalist and author of a volume of short stories, I welcomed him with friendly interest, because he was a groveling coward and a hysterical desire to rise to the top and prey to a sense of his own weakness, arrogant and fainthearted, a slyboots and a ham\\" (p. 186) and \\"I found it rather hard to believe that he might be working for Hitler, since it turned out that his mother was evidently, visibly Jewish.\\" Gombrowicz believed that Polish squires had a coexistence with Jews that had lasted for centuries:One of my cousins, gifted with a sense of humor not infrequently found among the gentry, would converse with his Israelite not on the verandah but from a second-floor balcony, so that he could yell down at the merchantr standing in front of the house: \\"What are you trying to tell me, Moishe?!\\" I imagine that many people would see this as a typical manifestation of the gentry's pompousness; but I think that my cousin, in turning himself into a proud master and the merchant into a poor \\"Moishe,\\" was making a rather profound joke--for he was mocking himself as much as the Jew, and turning the very attitude of the gentry toward the Jews into something grotesque. (p. 177).We live in a very comic society, where legal protections are likely to fail in the case of anyone who might actually benefit from having some rights. Comedy has become a very deep manner of reacting to what modern society confronts, if we could just figure out what it is, besides comic."},{"Title":"Polish Memories","review":"Gombrowitz's memoirs. less obtuuse then the diary. less eccentric and charming also, but truthfull and quiet insightfull in many small quirky ways into phycological depths that are not usually developed in this culture"},{"Title":"Polish Memories","review":"Like many American readers, I was not familiar with Witold Gombrowicz. I was introduced to him about five years ago, when I read his novel \\"Cosmos\\". Since then he has been on my literary radar and I have learned that he is regarded as one of the most important Polish writers of the 20th Century. His works have been translated into more than thirty languages, and he has been praised by the likes of Milan Kundera (\\"one of the greatest novelists of our century\\"), John Updike (\\"one of the profoundest of the late moderns\\"), and Susan Sontag. I personally was not wowed by \\"Cosmos\\", but I was intrigued enough to buy two more of his works, which sit waiting on my shelves.Gombrowicz was in Argentina when Germany invaded Poland, and he never returned. He had nothing but scorn for communism so after WWII he was persona non grata in Poland, with all of his books blacklisted. He wrote these autobiographical pieces in the late Fifties to be delivered as broadcasts over Radio Free Europe. They were gathered together and published in book form in connection with the centenary of Gombrowicz's birth.Who was Witold Gombrowicz as a person? Judging by this memoir of sorts, he was a keenly intelligent Pole of aristocratic/bourgeois background who was uncomfortably suspended between the forms and traditions of yore and the irreverent and bohemian modes of modern life as it existed in the years before WWII. He also was conflicted about what it meant to be Polish in a European literary culture. He was a fierce individualist and by instinct a contrarian. In public he tended to the role of intellectual gadfly, cloaked with a patina of calm and suave indifference, but beneath the faade he was painfully self-conscious and dreadfully insecure. Above all, he was insufferably vain.POLISH MEMORIES is written informally (a propos of material that will be read over the airwaves), and if you can sustain interest in the content, it reads easily enough. That \\"if\\", however, will be a formidable hurdle for many. In the end, I think, the book will appeal only to three groups of (perhaps overlapping) people: 1) those interested in Polish culture and society from between the World Wars; 2) those interested in the vibrant and creative Polish literary scene from the same period (for example, Gombrowicz and Bruno Schulz were friends and mutual supporters, though that does not stop Gombrowicz from making a few catty remarks about Schulz); and 3) those interested in Gombrowicz's literary theories and the biographical sources for some of his themes and approaches to literature.POLISH MEMORIES is studded with notable comments and observations. For example, Gombrowicz explained his apolitical orientation thusly: \\"My maturity manifested itself in the conviction that \`life is life,' as my uncles in the country would say, and that no reforms, campaigns, movements, or struggles could bring my colleagues an ounce more sense, or turn the earth into a paradise. I was a realist through and through; I abhorred illusions, slogans, and paper theories. I loathed enthusiasm.\\" But it is not a particularly enjoyable book, at root because Gombrowicz was not a particularly pleasant person."},{"Title":"Robert Cormier's \\"I Am the Cheese\\": A Study Guide from Gale's \\"Novels for Students\\" (Volume 18, Chapter 3)","review":"The so called study guide is disjointed and gets off on meaningless tangents.

Dorothy Wall wrote a series of books about Blinky and his friends and his irresistible appeal as a likeable, witty and rebellious child hero quickly endeared him to children and adults alike.He has certainly been a perennial favourite for at least three generations in my own family.Blinky Bill is a true Australian larrikin: fiercely independent, eternally mischievous and extraordinarily brave. His capacity to get into (and out of scrapes) is unparalled. Blinky Bill's friends include an assortment of Australian animals: who generally interact as children would like to but usually within some recognisable boundaries of their own species.The Adventures of Blinky Bill have never been out of print, and were adapted for television in the 1980s.I recommend this book to all readers. Those with small children can read the stories with them, older children will enjoy exploring the adventures of Blinky Bill for themselves and adults can discover (or rediscover) a wonderful childhood experience.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"THE COMPLETE ADVENTURES OF BLINKY BILL","review":"The tale of a baby Koala (Blinky Bill) separated from his mother due to his curiosity and naughtiness.

Examining the legacy of civil strife in the lives of a Salvadoran family, it tells the story of the courage and strength of a single mother and her daughter, who have to overcome the trauma of the murder of the eldest daughter and survive in an atmosphere of bitter poverty and repression. The book is filled, however, with magical, lyric moments of love and compassion, strangely illuminated by the figure of a young girl with butterflies in her hair who suddenly appears and adopts the family. This astonishing tour-de-force exemplifies the best in magic realism.The Washington Post called Argueta's A PLACE CALLED MILAGRO DE LA PAZ an &quot;exquisitely crafted novel&quot; and considered it &quot;a veritable hymn to these resilient, uncomplaining women.&quot; Critic Beatriz Terrazas wrote in Dallas Morning News: &quot;It takes a master to turn a story of pain and tragedy into a thing of beauty. But then Manlio Argueta is a proven master of words.&quot; Philip Herter commented in The St. Petersburg Times that A PLACE CALLED MILAGRO DE LA PAZ &quot;charms like a fairytale but has the moral force of an indictment.&quot; Nick Owchar from The Los Angeles Times noted that Argueta's novel &quot;assures us that from the ashes of tragedy, the human spirit will rise like a legendary bird.&quot; Other words of praise appeared in Publishers Weekly, Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education, World Literature Today, and The British Bulletin of Publications."},{"Title":"A Place Called Milagro de la Paz","review":"Salvadoran author Manlio Argueta brings the lives of the common peasants of El Salvador to life in this novel.

I'm not exactly sure what I expected, but my expectations were more along the lines of a real estate or finance book. The title of the book threw me. In reality this is more of a book about building your own house at a low cost, therefore not needing to get a mortgage and a whole lifestyle of low cost living and low impact on the earth. Paul Terhorst's book \\"Cashing in on the American Dream\\" is also about living without a mortgage but from a totally different perspective. Here the author Rob Roy, which by the way is a great name, writes about keeping your house small and simple to reduce the costs. He writes of his own experience of lving in a temporary shelter before you build your own house. In his case this was a 12x16 foot shed. He even tells of using printer's plates as roofing material. Not many wifes and kids are going to want to live in a 12x16 shed. The author is a frugal, and conservative environmentalist and writes of that lifestyle. He lives on $5,000 a year of his savings and does not work at a job per se. The author is frugal, cheap, or what ever you want to call it and apparently it works for him and his family. Will it work for everybody, I think not. His job is building houses and writing about it. I did enjoy the book and it was easy to read. It was a learning experience for me and a few of the ideas in the book might be useful, but I'm not ready to sever the electric grid line just yet. There is a very nice appendix in the book with building schools listed as well as an extensive bibliography. This is the first book that I've read of the author, but I would consider others. \`I'd also recommend the Les Shur book \\"Finding Country Properties\\", the Rlaph Turner book and the Joe Dominquez and Vicki Robin book, \\"Your Money or your life\\". If you liked \\"Mother Earth News\\" and \\"Whole Earth Catalog\\" you'll probably enjoy this book also. On the other hand if you drive a Hummer and live in suburbia with your 2.5 kids, this might not be your cup of tea."},{"Title":"Mortgage-Free!: Radical Strategies for Home Ownership (Real Goods Solar Living Books)","review":"Once in a while, I read a book that makes me question something I always took for granted. For example, it was Ageless Body, Timeless Mind by Deepak Chopra that showed me people don't have to grow old and brittle before they die. It was Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki that taught me what it really means to be rich. And I credit Mortgage-Free!, by Rob Roy, with being the book that proved how people can own a comfortable, beautiful home without taking out a mortgage.I decided to read Mortgage-Free! because the title intrigued me. Little did I know that it would be such a fantastic book, or that it would relate so closely to the theme of my website, SustainableWays.com (for which this review was originally written).I always thought that having a house was synonymous with having a mortgage. But when you really think about it, a mortgage is not much of a good deal. The author shows how most people who take out a mortgage end up paying nearly three times as much as the house they live in is worth. Even worse is the inevitable nature of debt as a work trap:\\"An unholy percentage of American men and women are working largely for their houses, at jobs they would not choose were pay not the overriding consideration. I spent nearly five years at that game, surrounded by co-workers caught in the mortgage trap. My escape was made possible largely by our mortgage-free home.\\" -Rob Roy, Mortgage-Free!It's the author's own experiences in walking the talk that really makes this book and excellent investment. Yes, the ideas may seem outrageous, but Rob Roy makes it undeniable that they are, in fact, do-able. Not only does he describe his own 25-year success in building and owning mortgage-free homes, but he also provides a number of examples of others doing the same thing. On top of that, this book is rich with book recommendations, phone numbers, and other starting points. Basically, he covers every base so well that the only reason you'd have NOT to follow his advice is down-right laziness.This book will best serve people who are independent, open-minded, and logical. But if you're a die-hard conformist that scoffs at anything unconvential, then this book is not for you. Even though the ideas and methods presented in Mortgage-Free! will be most useful to people living or willing to move to rural areas, anyone can benefit from the knowledge provided in this book. Even now, as I'm flipping through it, I'm continually amazed at how helpful and thorough this book really is. It touches on everything from eating well, to helping the environment, going to college, and so on. This is definitely a holistic, integrative piece of work.Ultimately, this is a book I felt I had to buy because of its usefulness as a reference. If you read it more than once, you'll realize that Mortgage-Free! isn't really about owning a home. Even if you don't end up owning or building a house, this book will have served you well in that it'll have made you question something that you normally would've accepted. Avoiding a mortgage is just one of the many aspects of a better way to live: On your own terms."},{"Title":"Mortgage-Free!: Radical Strategies for Home Ownership (Real Goods Solar Living Books)","review":"The author speaks from experience which is comforting to know, if you are going to venture out into the lonely waters of building your house without a mortgage.

A world of infinite possibilities!"},{"Title":"Mortgage-Free!: Radical Strategies for Home Ownership (Real Goods Solar Living Books)","review":"Far from being just another book about ways to buy real estate, Rob Roy's book 'Mortgage-Free' encompasses an entire way of life that can set you free from the oppressive, credit induced, treadmill existence that ever-increasingly dominates &amp; enslaves people to debt &amp; by doing so greatly decreases their quality &amp; enjoyment of life. Rob combines Thoreauvian based economics &amp; plain old down-to-earth common sense with wisdom gained from his many successful years of Mortgage-Free living. He offers hope, inspiration &amp; practical, proven techniques to those who would dare to actually take charge of their own lives &amp; realize that there are alternatives to huge indebtedness. Filled with genuinely useful information &amp; examples, Rob reveals not only his own personal triumphs, but also mistakes he has made along his own Mortgage-Free journey &amp; he does this in a very readable, entertaining, as well as enlightening fashion. Buy a copy or use one of Rob's own money saving techniques if you must &amp; check with your local library- Either way I think you truly owe it to yourself to read this book before you set out on your own personal home-ownership journey. Good Luck to you all!"},{"Title":"Mortgage-Free!: Radical Strategies for Home Ownership (Real Goods Solar Living Books)","review":"One of my pet peeves is related to certain books. So many are mislabeled or mis-titled. If one is trying to find an informative book, a how-to book, or a generic non-fiction book by just looking at titles, chances are you will be disappointed and/or mislead. There are many exceptions of course but it seems especially true with books on making money, or saving money. &quot;Mortgage Free!&quot; falls into this last category. It is really a book on building your own structure, be it an alternative or contemporary one. The major thrust of the book is owning your own home free and clear and is written to that end. This book does not give the reader anything that he couldn't find in other more complete books. There isn't any new earth shattering information here.A wonderful spin-off of building your own home can be your bottom line in home ownership. Maybe the books title should legitimately become a sub title with the main title being something like, &quot;Build Your Own Homes&quot; followed by &quot;And Eventually Become Mortgage Free.&quot; If one, for the first time, has come to the conclusion that there must be a way to build your own house and by so doing greatly reduces the amount owed, then this might be a place to start. As for strictly buying a book on reducing a mortgage and becoming mortgage free in less than 30 years, you certainly can do better. Only the first 25 pages or so address mortgages and principle/interest, living costs, etc. (these are the major costs with American society.) The rest of the book is about finding land (again there are much better books available), and building a home, with the last chapter on people who live in mortgage free houses. With all fairness to the author I don't believe he had any intention of merely reducing ones mortgage in half or whatever. He sees that there is much more value in having a house totally debt free and in as short a time as possible. And I would agree. My main complaint with the book is that there is not much new. Almost everything he talks about has been published earlier and in some instances much better."},{"Title":"Mortgage-Free!: Radical Strategies for Home Ownership (Real Goods Solar Living Books)","review":"Roy start his book with the basics; how to save money in your current situation. Many of these suggestions are simple, yet effective. I especially liked his comment that \\"eating out is entertainment, not sustenance\\". Roy shows us how to reduce our monthly expenses so that we will be able to save enough money to buy property with strategies that are later developed in his book. Another section that was extremely useful to me and my husband was the section where Roy describes all of the things he did wrong when he first purchased land and built on said land. I am sure that learning of his mistakes will prevent us from making those same mistakes when we decide to buy our land and build. As a couple looking toward homesteading in the near future, this book was worth it's weight in gold to us. I am sure we will refer to it often in our quest for our little slice of the American Dream."},{"Title":"Mortgage-Free!: Radical Strategies for Home Ownership (Real Goods Solar Living Books)","review":"Mr. Roy's book is a great primer on thinking about different strategies for owning a home that don't involve the normal process. The book is primarily based on the idea that if one can or wants to live a life outside of the consumerist norm then it is possible to own a home. Primarily, he advocates that the person who wants to own a home and not spend the next thirty years of their lives as an indentured servent to the bank that they should do as much work as they can themselves. Anyone who is interested or willing to do the work in building or renovating a home, has a low income, wants to maintain a simple life but doesn't know where to start will find this book has useful ideas to get you started. Those who desire to live in the best neighborhoods, are uninterested or unwilling to do the work on their own home, or not likely to accept a simple lifestyle will likely scoff at the notions this book presents.The main thrust of this book advocates that people choose not to participate in the suburban \\"keeping up with the Jones's\\" lifestyle. For some this may be a revolutionary idea. This, of course, is not a new idea but is not one that is commonly embraced by Western civilization. For those that are already outside of the consumerist mainstream this book will probably not cover any new ground. He does provide a sensible arguement against the \\"death-pledge\\" (the Old French etymology for \\"mortgage\\"). There are a great many people that believe that the only way they can ever own a house is through the 30 year loan route. Mr. Roy makes a case that if one has the desire, discipline and patience that they can own a home without going to the bank to get a loan.The book provides a general set of strategies that are primarily useful in rural area. The author recommends that one lives a simple lifestyle, builds on land that would not be considered particularly valuable by others, the home is built by the owner using as many salvaged (inexpensive but high quality) materials as possible, and that the builder reduces as many living cost as possible. One example of cost reduction is the use of some sort of temporary structure on the property while the home is being built in order to reduce or eliminate the cost of renting or paying on a mortgage in another home.The book provides a good overview of methods that have been used to achieve home ownership in rural areas. It does address the idea of the same sort of idea in urban areas by saying that it's not bloody likely. This reviewer tends to agree with that but others may have differing opinions."},{"Title":"Mortgage-Free!: Radical Strategies for Home Ownership (Real Goods Solar Living Books)","review":"This is not just another book on buying real estate.

Or has the skills to do most of that work? My father and grandfather and, indeed, one of my nephews, are homebuilders not just for their own families but for others as well. That took years of training. If you are just starting out, perhaps the advice to just keep adding on as you can afford it is good, but most people aren't settled down into an area for the first several years out of school or after marriage. My husband and I got this book hoping it would give us advice to minimumize a mortgage but it is really about building from the ground up and that requires time and skills we don't have. If you have such time, are a bit savings, or even a lot of house building skills (or family who lives near by and will help) then you'll probably find this book far more useful than we did. Ultimately, there are things we don't know how to do and taking the time to learn is more likely to result is damage to the home or our pocketbook later on.

I grew up in a house that my parents built and I saw first hand how it consumes your life. As a six year old I watched my parents race around the footer with rakes and shovels trying to spread out the concrete before it hardened because the trucker didn't want to pour in two different spots. We shoveled snow out of the living room during the first year because winter came before the roof was finished. We had an outhouse the first year and after we had an official bathroom the toilet wouldn't flush when it rained because the vent was at the bottom of the sewer line instead of part way up the stack and the line to the septic tank was sealed with oakum instead of lead. I could go on about the roof, the electricity, insulation, etc., but just make sure you're up to it. It's not for the faint of heart. I lived it. I know how to do it.

I liked the ideas in a general sense, but at the level of the individual, applying the concepts of the author would require skills, discipline and bearing hardships that I wouldn't impose on a loved one.Living outside the mainstream is tough, not easy. Wells and septic systems make for headaches and hardships. This is all fine for the back-to-the-land type but if what you're after is economical self-sufficiency on a shoestring there are methods that are more practical.These methods still require that you think outside the box but just outside the box vice wayyyy outside the box where this author takes you.The typical 30 or 20 year mortgage in the USA today is a real waste of time and money. Wasted time cannot be recovered and wasting money is simply poor stewardship of hard earned resources.It is possible to purchase real estate in such a way as to have the effect of being mortgage-free from day one not five or ten years from now. I live in an upper middle-class neighborhood, have an average income, and pay less than $200 a month towards my mortgage.Actually, a mortgage is not an inherently good or bad thing, it's just a thing. How one uses the tool of a mortgage is where people tend to sink their financial ship.Anyway, good luck if you're looking for alternatives of your own and I welcome e-mail to discuss the issue.

It is the American dream -- having no mortgage and owning the property that you have. The book describes how to live within your means and being happy. Other urban places that people pay millions of dollars for a condo might find their busy lives as something to live for, but an equal amount of unhappy people in urban places are committing suicide because they don't know how to get out of the hole. Buying land cheap, building a cabin, and living in it is the best way to go, especially with cheap wireless Internet these days.Other recommended titles that helped me purchase land cheaply:Investing Without Losing (ISBN: 0978834607 NOT on amazn, on other stores)"},{"Title":"Mortgage-Free!: Radical Strategies for Home Ownership (Real Goods Solar Living Books)","review":"So I was reading today our of \\"Mortgage-free, radical strategies for home ownership.\\" I like the book, the author gives a pretty round view on ways you can get away with doing exactly what the title tells you. Almost all of his ideas start out with you gathering up a grubstake and buying a piece of land - which is okay, but I can't even afford the land I want, so that's a bit of a problem for me. Perhaps I should think more modularly and buy a small piece and acquire more adjacent to it when I have more cash.Anyhow, today he discussed underground homes. That was an interesting subject - basically this is just taking house berming to the maximum and setting your house down so far that once you backfill around the home, the roof is still enough below the original grade that you can plant a living roof - or just cover the damn thing with dirt and let biology ensue, with native plants reclaiming the disturbed environment. Very low environmental footprint - great way to hide from spyplanes and helicopters, but does require some industrial strength digging to get down to to where you need to be, and we've already noted that digging like taht costs money and what's more its not a remote-friendly technology. But, if you had an underground home with a masonry stove you'd be pretty set for whatever the weather could throw at you and I would expect the dwelling to last quite a long time indeed.He also stressed the importance of being fluid, or rather the foolishness of planning what type of home you want before you've acquired your homesite. So much of what type of home, building technique, power source and siting is dependent upon your homesite and its ammenities, topography, harvestable and recyclable resources that really doing any kind of planning before you're onsite is likely to be more of a hindrance then a help when it comes to getting the best house for your situation. This was something I was already thinking (it is how I've been trained to look at gardening and orcharding: live with the land for a year before planting to find where the plants should go) but it was nice to see it written out elegantly by the author.I still think I'm leaning towards a strawbale or cordwood dwelling. Cordwood could actually be reasonably remote-friendly and is easier than building a log cabin by a long site. Really you're just going to have to get your cement in - you can handsaw the cordwood rounds for the walls and move them about easily enough. I think I should start small, and get a small piece of land and build a little living shed on it and see what I can do. Like the book says - its better to use the same technique and screw up on a small dwelling at a cost of $500, than on the main house at a cost of $5000.I'm learning a lot - and I feel the book was definitely worth the purchase price already.Dominic Ebacherebacherdom.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Mortgage-Free!: Radical Strategies for Home Ownership (Real Goods Solar Living Books)","review":"My husband and I purchased the Earth-Sheltered Houses book by Rob Roy and when this popped up, we decided to buy it as well.

But, even those who are complete strangers to her radio work will enjoy the ride through the life and mind of this sometimes ditzy, always insightful writer.The pieces are short, most not more than three pages. You can dip into them, one at a time, to savor each morsel, or, if you're greedy, like me, you'll devour the whole book in one sitting.Jaquith seems to have this knack for telling stories on herself. She sets up her wonderfully wacky solutions for dealing with problems (&quot;I'm a genius.&quot;) and then lets us watch them result in absolute failure (Ah, Jeez!). I loved &quot;Pond Scum&quot;, the tale of her hare-brained scheme to remove algae from her pond with the aid of electric fans and many extension cords. Only Lucy Ricardo comes close. The thing is, she's not afraid to embarrass herself and that makes for entertaining and revealing reading.It's not all a circus, though. Jaquith examines both the big and small moments of her life and, in so doing, weaves a tapestry that really is a &quot;fractured memoir&quot;. She's trying to make sense of it all, just as we all are. The reader alternates between thoughts of &quot;you know, that's exactly how I feel, but I've never been able to put it into words&quot; and &quot;I never knew there were people like that&quot;.She takes the reader from unbearable poignancy (&quot;A Magic Phone&quot;) to laugh-out-loud comedy (the title &quot;Birdseed Cookies&quot;). The thing is, neither the tears nor the laughter is ever cheap. It's all well-earned and well-executed.This is the kind of book that, like Russell Baker's memoir, you want to buy, not only for yourself, but for your parents, your kids, everybody you love, because it's a way of saying that you're not alone."},{"Title":"Birdseed Cookies: A Fractured Memoir","review":"I happened to wander into a bookstore during one of Janis Jaquith's readings at a book festival and was impressed: her delivery is wonderful and she's very funny.

It just isn't like anything else I've ever read.What it is, is a collection of little stories, real ones from her life. And I end up reading certain stories over and over again. I've even xeroxed a few of them to send to family and friends.

The writing is good, funny. It made me laugh out loud and kept me reading. After completing \\"Attention Deficit Disorder-Who Knew?\\" a poignant and honest account of a child's classroom struggles, I felt this was going to be on a par with \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" by David Sedaris. But sadly, in the end I was disappointed. I believe the author is talented and accomplishes her mission of presenting stream-of-consciousness material, but the collection lacked a palpable order and ultimately provided more questions than answers. Take, for example, the piece titled \\"Celebration,\\" about her twin sons' second birthday party coinciding with a call from the pediatrician and the devastating news that cancer has spread to her son's lungs. She predicts he won't make it to his third birthday; however, we don't really learn the outcome. To mix this serious topic with the whimsical subjects of 3-M notepads and doggies in Burberry trenchcoats made me long for a little organization. Take me down a funny road, take me down a serious road-but give me some warning signals, please. Perhaps this is why the subtitle is \\"a fractured memoir.\\" I think I might prefer the novels she mentions in the essays. Will they be published anytime soon?I've read that good writers borrow from great writers and great writers steal the material overtly. In the essay named \\"Quack,\\" I wonder if the author borrowed or stole from Arlo Guthrie. Janis Jaquith has shown moments of greatness in Birdseed Cookies, but overall, I think this was a just a good book."},{"Title":"Birdseed Cookies: A Fractured Memoir","review":"I saw the article about Birdseed Cookies: A Fractured Memoir in the New York Times the other day.

(I can just picture her squeezing into her wedding gown at every wedding anniversary...and how she's worrying that this time, she'll probably have to have someone use a pair of scissors to get her out of it again!)I found Jaquith through the Internet. Someone e-mailed me a link to her site. If you're wondering if you or someone else would like this book, I suggest you visit her website. You can read a lot of these essays there for free.

It's quite funny and sometimes moving, and her life is &quot;ordinary&quot; enough that her appreciation for it makes the reader feel pretty good about her own. I was baffled by one of the reviews below--the &quot;Quack&quot; essay, probably my favorite, had what I thought was an obvious ALLUSION to Arlo Guthrie--hardly the same thing as a swipe. And the heartstopping essay about hearing from a doctor that her toddler son's cancer may have recurred...wow.

In the 66 essays in this book -- reprints of her radio broadcasts on NPR -- Jaquith tackles these and others with aplomb. Whether it's defending a garden against an intelligent rodent (&quot;Guerilla Gopher&quot;), attempting to fight algae in her pond with electric fans and miles of extension cords (&quot;Pond Scum&quot;), or eating some food her children cooked using an unusual recipe (&quot;Birdeed Cookies&quot;) Jaquith evokes a smile while often revealing a deeper level of truth. In one essay, she discusses the seemingly outdated wedding tradition of picking out wedding china -- coming to the conclusion that in our paper-plate, disposable society, the china plates serve as a reminder of just how delicate and fragile love can be. Yet another essay (&quot;Attention Deficit Disorder -- Who Knew?&quot;) brought tears to my eyes as she talked about what it was like growing up with undiagnosed ADD and constantly being told how stupid she was. Each essay is an enjoyable read, although the ones that aired during pledge drives on NPR sound like -- well, essays that aired during pledge drives on NPR. Still, the entire book as a whole is fun, or thought-provoking, or sometimes both at the same time. Since the book is divided into 66 short essays, the book goes down easy, making it a perfect book for summer reading."},{"Title":"Birdseed Cookies: A Fractured Memoir","review":"I heard the author on NPR and jotted down the name of her book which they mentioned after her commentary.

I myself look forward to hearing them so I like reading them too.

Okay, I'm gonna sound cliche', but Janis is &quot;real&quot;. When she wrote, &quot;oh, bite me&quot;, well, I think that's when a fan was born in me. Her insights into everyday life have helped me to know that there's someone else out there that thinks somewhat like me, and she's written it down for the world to see and even broadcasts it on National Public Radio....so the things I think must not be all that bad, eh? Okay, the book was comforting to me. Anyone who's willing to laugh at themselves and their lives will identify with &quot;Birdseed Cookies&quot;.

So after you've read the book, buy one for them, too and put it in a basket with a coffee mug and some of that sinfully sweet flavored coffee, and walk it down the street or put it in the mailbox, and know that you've done a &quot;good thing.&quot; Now, does anyone know where I can buy some birdseed cookies?"},{"Title":"Birdseed Cookies: A Fractured Memoir","review":"If the name Janis Jaquith doesn't mean anything to you now--believe me it will. Ms. Jaquith is a master storyteller who invites you into her life, her heart, and her head through the pages of &quot;Birdseed Cookies.&quot; And what you may ask are &quot;Birdseed Cookies&quot; exactly? Well, like so many of the essays in her book, this is a little gem that you will have to discover for yourself. There are many such delightful tales in this breezy book. An Erma Bombeck for the new millenium, Janis celebrates the human spirit with her own unique take on everyday life. From touching moments of quiet heroism to scenes of side-splitting laughter, this is one roller coaster ride that is well worth the admission."},{"Title":"Birdseed Cookies: A Fractured Memoir","review":"-&quot;Birdseed Cookies&quot; are tasty treats for the soul, soothing food for our individual lives, some of them inspirational, indeed.-&quot;Birdseed Cookies&quot; are actually voices, wonderful to listen to, wonderful to read and wonderful to hold on to....Armin D.

My daughter gave me this book for Mothers day and we have been passing it around in the family for the past few weeks. We love the illustrations, too. It reminds me of James Thurber's &quot;My Life and Hard Times&quot;. (Another Family Favorite)Even our youngest (in fourth grade)has been very much enjoying these lovely little stories. She said she has never read a story before about what it's like to have Attention Deficit Disorder. She has ADD, so that piece has been a source of comfort to her. She reads it again and again.The one about Jaquith stuffing herself with Cheese Doodles when her husband was out of town reminded me of myself.

This book (and I read at least half of it) isn't the fantastic, incredible thing all of these reviews (self-promotions?) claim it to me. It's not horrible, either. It's just, I don't know, trying SO HARD to be charming and cutesy and folksey. Good, honest writing doesn't read like the author is trying so hard. Sorry to be so negative, but my wallet is lighter after buying this book, and I feel a little deceived."},{"Title":"Birdseed Cookies: A Fractured Memoir","review":"This book does for ADD what the book DEPRESSION IS A CHOICE does for Bi-polar.

The announcer mentioned the title after one of Janis' commentaries on NPR so I ordered a copy. It took forever (a few weeks!) for the book to arrive, but it was WELL worth the wait. I'm in the habit of keeping a book with me whenever I leave my house, just to fill time while waiting for my kids, etc. Last week I was in the orthodontist's office waiting for my son and reading my copy of &quot;Birdseed Cookies&quot; and they could hear me laughing all the way back in the examining room!

For those who enjoy writers like Sarah Vowell or Sandra Tsing Loh, this book may do little more than make your teeth hurt."},{"Title":"Birdseed Cookies: A Fractured Memoir","review":"I clicked over to this book when I was looking around for a diet book for my sister. I think its a good idea to have links to other books even if they're unrelated. Does someone think that people who read diet books don't enjoy a good laugh every now and then, or what!? I went back to that diet book when I saw all the controversy on this \\"Birdseed\\" listing and I counted THIRTEEN links to other products (many of them unrelated to dieting) that AMAZON put there. So what's the big deal if a reader or author or publisher puts a link there?Bottom line: I like this book a lot, and I'm glad the link to it was in a diet book listing."},{"Title":"Birdseed Cookies: A Fractured Memoir","review":"I admit it; I fell for the reviews here, and because this book is recommended on other book pages, but it looks like I've been had. This book is boring and, like someone else wrote here, like that of a college student, and not a very good one at that. The humor is insipid. The quality of the book is like that of a vanity press, and, sure enough, that's what it is! Look up Xlibris Corporation on Google and what do you find? A statement that anyone can be published as long as they have the money (or words to that effect). Wish I'd done that research beforehand....

So I was perplexed to read in the New York Times the other day that Jaquith is \\"little known\\"! (On the other hand, maybe that's the NY establishment for you - and their disdain for all things Southern) I don't have her book in front of me at the moment (my mom gave it to me for my birthday last fall) because I keep lending it to people.

In a way I found it funny to hear what each person said. I think the order was perfect because each time you're wondering why the next oldest person is acting a certain way and then in a creative way it is revealed to you and you are able to make your own opinion or conclusion on a certain situation. The author indirectly made you feel pity for different characters in different ways which I thought was a very good touch if it was even on purpose.

It connected three generations, a daughter, mother, and grandmother. I thought it was interesting how the book went backwards in time. For me, as I read about each woman I got a better understanding of her and her reasons for the way she acted. This made me realize that they were good people even if earlier they weren't perceived to be. This book reinforces that you shouldn't judge people until you get to know them, and until you have an understanding of their past experiences."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I'm highly critical of most modern fiction, yet this novel had such an immense impact on my psyche that it is still vivid many years after first reading it.

Poetic, deeply felt writing."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"Dorris was able to not only write from an incredibly acurate view of a women, but of three women; grandmother,mother,daughter.

However, I was most excited by the religious content. Aunt Ida, Christine and Rayona all have priests in their lives and for the most part religion fails them. What seems to break the cycle is the Yellow raft in Blue Water, a place where Rayona finds hope in time spent with the closest thing to a real family. Perhaps her life will improve? Aunt Ida and Christine both find the &quot;end of the world&quot; scenario pivotal in their stories. The importance of religion to the novel as well as the focus on 3 women and the final metaphor the Aunt Ida braiding her hair, incorporating 3 strands, sealed the Trinity theme of the story for me. Furthermore, I can relate Aunt Ida to the Father of the Old Testament, angry and scornful, at times vengeful. CHRISTine is easy! A Christ reference to the New Testament and she suffers and will eventually die for her sins and the redemption, the &quot;saving&quot; of her daughter. Rayona, the Holy Spirit, can we &quot;hope&quot; for her. Is she Ida and Christine and herself - the improved generation? So many layers here to explore. One member of my book club said that they loved the Roshamon style and felt like a fly on the wall with the best view of the truth in those shared experiences between these 3 woman.But another member perhaps said it best when she said that even the fly brings his own experiences to the retelling. Is there ever unadulterated truth?!"},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"It is very well written, but the book is kindof dull.

In addition to strong and interesting characters, he tells the story backwards, so to speak. First, the story is told from the point of view of a 15 year old, then from the point of view of her mother, and finally from the grandmother's viewpoint. Naturally, the same important events in the familiy's history are quite different in each of these three viewpoints.

Pedestrian writing that insults the intelligent reader. Dorris' book rambles on with low-rent symbolism and meandering plot, resulting in nothing but drivel. I get the feeling that the book is so popular because of the large number of liberal pseudo intellectuals in the world who love anything to do with oppressed people and are too unsophisticated for Rushdie or Ellison (to name just two). Makes me wish someone would take up book burning again and start (and end) with this one."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"This book starts out with Rayona, then changes to concentrate on Christina, then changes again and concentrates on Aunt Ida. Each chapter brings you to an abrupt end and leaves you wondering whatever happend to the character. During all of this the author flip-flops from present to past to present again. It was not until I finished the book that I had to stop and put the pieces together to come to a conclusion that made any sense. The reason I rated this book 3 stars is because I thought that the characters were very well described in detail.

It is too much of a coinsidence that Michael Dorris had alegations poised against him of the same nature. Second the book goes no where it brought up all kinds of questions during the entire book that were never answered. This is a disfunctional family portrayed by a disfunctional authour.

I realize that kids are not naive and are exposed to crude language and images every day on school campus, etc., but to put it right in their hands and say 'read this and write a report' where it talks of telling your mother to \\"F--- off!\\" and priests sexually abusing 15 year old girls, and adult content of graphically explaining an intercourse experience in mildly pornographic ways just isn't the education departments responsibility (no, I'm not a religious fanatic, but if the image that this type of reading induces were made on film, these kids wouldn't even be allowed by law to go to the movie to see its rated-R, even X-rating in some parts). I mean, it's fine if someone freely chooses to read this type of book ... but if people aren't allowed to pray in schools, then I just feel that the kids shouldn't be required to inject their ever-developing minds with harsh tidbits of matter, either. There are other really, really great books out there for our schools to use ... don't you think? And if you're a parent or teacher who feels differently, that's perfectly fine. Just please grab the book for your home library and your own kids, and that'd be cool. :) I'd love it if this even had two versions ... the rated PG version would be FANTASTIC and I'd tell everyone positive things about it!!! ;)But no ... I don't recommend it for your teens. It's pretty much like a wonderful chocolate mousse with cockroaches stirred in here and there. The mousse is wonderful, but you'll never forget the images and crunches of those bits of cockroaches. I just feel that we need to start teaching our kids strong values once again.Okay ... I'm done! ;)"},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"My rateing should drop the average down a bit. I thought that the book showed little in the area of creativity, and the only interesting parts were when the story of aunt Ida unfurrled. I thought that the series of events between rayona and the preacher would have led to more of a dramatic conclusion then never hearing of him agian. I don't see why this book got any praise except for the fact that people are suckers for books about the trials and tribulations of minorities. Don't asume that I'm a racist, because really I'm not. I don't have any problem with the main charectures being indian (and rayona being mixed), but it shouldn't be aplied in the rating of the book.-- In my opinion this book would have only made two or three stars at most had it been about some white family. It shouldn't be that way."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I know that many of the people who read this book did it for English, so I don't really want to say that I did too... I read this book, and found that some of the story moves a little slowly, but for the most part there is a path that it takes, and one that is important. It strats with the youngest of the family and shows her life, and all the faults. Then goes to the Mother who shows why her daughter is that way, and how she couldn't help it. After that the Grandmother comes in, and (I really enjoyed this section...amazing) the entire story makes so much sence.

Learning about their life from three different people was a great way to fully understand what was happening throughout the book and how each one viewed their lives as a person.

The book also gives an insite into how life on a reservation effects the three women and how it brings them together as well as pushes them apart. The author also did a nice job using words diligently to procuce images in the reader's mind. Such as. . . &quot;They were the windows of a faraway city.

A Yellow Raft in Blue Water is the story of an Indian mother, daughter, and granddaughter torn by disturbing secrets yet bound by love. The varying perspectives allow us to see each woman's point of view. The voice of Rayona, the mixed-race teenager, is particularly engaging, especially in her nearly epic journey to visit her weirdo mother in the hospital.Once you've gotten your feet wet on this husband/wife writing team, I suspect you'll want to read everything they've written, as I did. And if you have an opportunity to hear Louise Erdrich speak, take advantage of it; she's wise, articulate, and gifted - a real winner with audiences."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"This is my all-time favorite book.

I would read anything he has written!"},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"&quot;A Yellow Raft in Blue Water&quot; is one story, a single epoch, but told three times, each telling by one of the three women who shared it: the grandmother, Ida, the mother, Christine, and the daughter, Rayona. But, this book is not just about a single story seen through three different pairs of eyes. It's really a story of the forces that compel each of us to do the things we do, frequently against our own intuition or better judgement ---- and, all of them ring true. Dorris, the author, had incredible insight into human behavior when he wrote this book. Tragically, I understand that he ended his own life by suicide. Although this is fiction, it's a poignant revelation into the consequences of embracing cultural belief systems that have little basis in reality. Ruined or miserable lives are often the result. The daughter, Rayona, like many teenagers, trashes the moors of her elders and shows promise of breaking out of the cruel cycle that held her mother and grandmother captive to an miserable life. This book is a plea: it asks how we know for sure, what we think we know for sure. Granted, that's a bit heavy, but certainly worthwhile for anyone who wonders where happiness lies."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water is a powerful novel that examines the relationship between a daugher, a mother, and a grandmother. Dorris starts the novel through the perspective of the daughter, Rayona, then to the mother, Christine, and finally to the grandmother, Ida, where it all began.As you read A Yellow Raft In Blue Water you learn and feel the struggles of each woman. Often I found myself thinking, 'that's why' as I progressed through each woman's story and connecting the three. Dorris describes this journey as &quot;...bonding and braiding the three strands of their shared past - and future.&quot;Michael Dorris created a novel far more powerful than the struggle of the three women. He illustrated the need for family and how the connection to kin, no matter the circumstance and time lapse, is of great importance. He displayed that in time of need you always go back to the familiar...home.This was a very moving and thought provoking novel to read. I would highly recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"Yello Raft in Blue Water takes place on a Native American reservation in Montana and explores the lives of three women:Rayona, Christine, and Ida. Ida is the mother of Rayona and the grandmother of Rayona. The book is divided into three sections, one for Rayona's life, one for Christine's life and one for Ida's life. This technique really make the book interesting and more exciting to read because you wonder why characters are acting the way they are or why a situation is the way it is and Michael Dorris journeys back in time and provides the reader with history from the character's prospective. This keeps the reader involved in the story whl the plot moves quickly. The book explores true family love eventhough it isn't always visible to an outsider. Most people would wonder why Christine and Elgin have stayed married for so many years when half of the time they don't life together, but once you see it from their perspective you realize that it's a relationship that they can't live without. Dorris realistically illustrates a love/hate relationship that the couple always has to fall back on. This is important to the story because it gives insight into why Christine has so many problems and why Rayona is exceptionally independant. This book epxresses th generation gap that occurs in today's society. One generation thinks that the other could never understand what they're going through whil the older generation has had a long hard life but sometime decides to keep their stories secret. Ida and Christine had a difficult time understanding each other, which contributed to a strained relationship between Chistine and Rayona. Michael Dorris has writtena wonderful book that really captures your imagination and pulls you into it. I would reccomend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I read this book, &quot;Yellow Raft on Blue Water&quot; by Michael Dorris, for my High School US Literature class. At first I was skeptical, I thought it would just be another one of those 'cultural struggle' books, that I've read enough of. I was wrong, this book is about understanding. The characters each go through life's journey to understand where their mothers and daughters are coming from. The book is uniquely formatted, going backward in time, retelling the same story from each character's point of view. You learn each character's past, the way they lived their lives and the way others saw them live it. &quot;I never grew up, but I got old. I'm a woman who's lived for fifty-seven years and worn resentment like a medicine charm for forty. It hung heavier on my neck after each brief rest I took.&quot; p. 207. The language used in this book is beautiful, the story is touching, and the characters are amazing. I highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"When I first started reading this book and was reading about Rayona's life, I had some very definite thoughts about her Mother. Dorris is a skilled writer - he chose the order he told this story in very specifically. He wanted us to have some pre-conceived notions about each of the characters before he unfolded parts of their story.As the book progressed, I found myself loving it more and more. I became involved with the characters and felt their pain. A Yellow Raft in Blue Water is a well-written book that tells the stories of three generations of women. It is the retelling of the same story from three completely different viewpoints - Rayona, her mother and her grandmother. As the story progresses it becomes much more layered and complex. Nothing is as it first appears to be.I'm looking forward to reading Cloud Chamber!"},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"Just finished this novel after having it given to me [dare I say it?] nearly five years ago! For some reason as other unread books were purged from the shelves, Dorris' novel remained waiting...And I am grateful! This book takes you places you never realized you could go as Dorris skillfully, poetically and [at times] bluntly places you square-center to the actions, thoughts, and feelings of these memorable characters that somehow merge into family members before the novel is through! And if you think you've got a handle on things once you get a hold of yourself near the beginning, welll..hmmm...I thought the same thing. :) One of the best reads I've ever had...a stand-alone achievement depicting the universality of human connection, beginning and ending at the heart, the center of it all.

I found it to be a swift and easy read, but slightly unfulfilling. Towards the end of the book I felt that the author had just given up the story without actually finishing it tidily. However, to give this book it's due merit I must say that it worked quietly on me to like it, as when I first began reading it I really didn't find myself captivated. It took perhaps close to the end of the section about Rayona for me to fully appreciate the story and the story telling style. In my opinion the major flaw in the book is the authors treatment of Ida. This is the 3rd section of the book, what one may imagine to be the highlight of the story, and to a certain extent I suppose it is, but it is short and fails somewhat to deliver. The author seems to have a lack of sympathy for Ida and this results in her failing to see like a fully realised character. Saying that, I have no qualms whatsoever in recommending this book as it is enjoyable and has an interesting and well written story placed in the unusual format of 3 sections of the book written from the perspectives of the 3 main characters. A friend of mine who loved this book said to me that what she liked best about this book, was that after reading each section your opinion changed on each character, and you grew to understand them much more."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"A Yellow Raft In Blue Water by Michael Dorris was an exellent book. It explored many subjects such as teenage life and how hard it is to grow up without a support system, death and regret, it even talked about adultery, and having to deal with other people's mistakes. There were many themes in this book. The main ones were isolation, love, betrayal, and forgiveness. This book moves backwards through time telling the stories of three lives. Rayona narrates the first part of the book. In this section she talks about her loneliness mostly. Christine is Rayona's mother. She shares her regret and her feeling of lonliness in the second part of the book. The last part of the book is narrated by Ida who is Christine's mother. This part talks about betrayal and loneliness again. Throughout the book the reader can see the love that each character has for one another. Without the hardships, none of the characters would be as strong as they are now. They made each other strong. Each character kept on living because of the other ones.

But, this book is not just about a single story seen through three different pairs of eyes.It's really a story of the forces that compel each of us to do the things we do, frequently against our own intuition or better judgement ---- and, all of them ring true. Dorris, the author, had incredible insight into human behavior when he wrote this book. Tragically, I understand that he ended his own life by suicide.Although this is fiction, it's a poignant revelation into the consequences of embracing cultural belief systems that have little basis in reality. Ruined or miserable lives are often the result. The daughter, Rayona, like many teenagers, trashes the moors of her elders and shows promise of breaking out of the cruel cycle that held her mother and grandmother captive to an miserable life.This book is a plea: it asks how we know for sure, what we think we know for sure.

It is written from the viewpoints of three people, Rayona, Christine, and Ida, exchanging viewpoints between different sections of the book. From the very beginning that the protagonists of this story are not your typical picture of the quietly happy and satisfied American Family. Parenting is an On the Job Training (OJT) program, which hopefully a good role model is demonstrated through their parents. No matter how good parents are, they still make mistakes, and for the most part they correct their errors and life goes on. Unfortunately, a good role model for Christine was severely lacking, which promulgated through the raising of Rayona. Christine and Rayona seem to have a definite bonding, yet it is hampered by Christine's neglect Rayona due to drug addiction, alcoholism, and bar hopping in hopes of replacing her negligently straying husband. Christine is definitely absent emotionally from Rayona. As in the song \\"Looking for Love (In all the wrong places)\\" by Johnny Lee, Christine was doing exactly that. Rayona remained optimistic about love even through long periods of inconsideration from both her parents. Christine discovered that mothering Rayona was the true love she had been missing, although this discovery came when she discovered she had six months to live. Ida demonstrated the closest to true Christian Love, although it started through selfish means. The Bible says \\"No one shows greater love than when he lays down his life for his friends\\" (ISV)."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I would strongly advise against anyone reading this book unless they have trouble falling asleep at night. I was forced to read this book in an american literature class and the book became more unbearable as I progressed through it. The 300-some pages crawl at snail's pace.

The story was one of cultural stuggle, and generational understanding. The author delt with the topic in a way that tried to make the reader empathize with the main character, but made the character make so many unintellegent decisions that i found it hard to empathize with anyone in the book. This book also tried to portray the native american culture and show how it has decayed over the last few decades. While this is all well and good, the author made me feel as indifferent as a history book for their cause. Do not read this book."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I read this as an unabridged audio book and it's a good thing too because if I were reading this in its paperback format I do believe I would've put it down unfinished after the first few chapters. Admittedly, I'm easily bored these days but this story was just too slow paced and peopled with characters that are (more often than not) difficult to sympathize with for me to anxiously continue turning its pages with any sort of enthusiasm. However, being trapped as I am in my vehicle for long stretches of time I'm content to listen to most anything if it distracts me from the tedium of driving and thus I finished every CD until I reached the bitter end.The story is told from the point of view of its three main characters starting with fifteen year old Rayona and working backwards through events which are told by her mother Christine and finally by Christine's mother \\"Aunt\\" Ida. This technique makes one sit back and say \\"ahhh, so that somewhat explains why \\"so and so\\" was such an unlikable witch earlier in the book\\" but it also makes for tough reading because it's difficult to sympathize with Christine and \\"Aunt\\" Ida for long stretches of the novel. Once we learn their motivations for certain actions they often turn out to be the ones who made poor choices resulting in their current miserable situations.The novel begins when Rayona is unceremoniously abandoned by her mother Christine at \\"Aunt\\" Ida's home on an Indian reservation who (if this possible) is even less caring and nurturing than selfish Christine. Christine hitches a ride and doesn't look back leaving Rayona to deal with grumpy Ida who takes her in but leaves her to fend for herself. Rayona, friendless, lonely and finding it difficult to fit in becomes a \\"project\\" to the local preacher who hovers over her in a somewhat creepy way (if'n you ask me). This is only a small snapshot of what appears to be a long stretch of instability in Rayona's young life. Rayona tells the story for roughly 1/3 of the book and, in my eyes, was the most sympathetic of the three and showed a lot of guts for a kid on her own.The focus then switches to her mom Christine who shows us a bit of her past. We experience the ups and downs of her wild days as a single gal living on her own after she's escaped the confines of life on the reservation. Her secret heartache is revealed and we relive her love affair with Rayona's faithless father. Still, despite all of her pain she always remained a selfish \\"me, me, me\\" type of person who I couldn't warm up to and a lot of her troubles were of her own making, in my opinion. Next up the story switches to Ida, whose past I found the most interesting. She fills in many gaps and her past answers a lot of questions that cropped up while I was reading Rayona & Christine's point of view. Again, though, in the end Ida is too brusque and difficult to warm up to despite the painful choice thrust upon her as a youngster.Overall this story manages to be both depressing and compassionate but the bleakness left me in a very melancholy mood when I finished. Two of the three characters love deeply but show it in all the wrong ways and I fear the third may follow their footsteps with such guidance. . ."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"Three women, a granddaughter, Rayona, mother, Christine, and grandmother, Ida, tell the story of their lives, and at times refer to the same events quite differently, as their perspectives are influenced by their past, their fears and experiences. I wonder if Dorris ever watched the movie Rashomon, by Akira Kurosawa, in which the death of a man is told from 4 different points of view, resulting in a confusing yet rich picture of what had happened. The same thing happens when the three women in the novel talk about those common events.In summary, awesome, awesome narrative; it is terrible that Dorris will not write again.

She is a girl used to conflict; her father, who is black, is rarely around, and she has seen a multitude of her mother's boyfriends come and go as Christine searches endlessly for someone who can bring peace to her life. Christine is dying, though Rayona doesn't know this yet; and at some point, Christine reaches the conclusion that she would rather die at home, on the reservation, than in Seattle - even though she harbours no really good memories of the reservation either. She escapes from the hospital, bundles Rayona and whatever else she owns in an ancient Volare, and heads home.On the reservation, Christine - for reasons that are made clear further along - abandons her daughter to the care of her mother - a formidable, large woman whom everyone calls Aunt Ida - and Christine hightails it to the home of a childhood friend. Rayona, friendless, ostracized by her reservation schoolmates for being an outsider - and not full Indian - takes the offer from the reservation priest to go to a retreat just to get away from the tension in her new surroundings, and because of an incident along the way, opts to fend for herself.This story is told backwards - starting with Rayona's story, segueing into Christine's story, and ending at the beginning, with Aunt Ida. At the start, none of the adults present a sympathetic aspect; it's clear from the beginning that Christine is, and always has been, an angry, hungry person, looking for happiness. Her abandonment of her daughter seems heartless, and abandoning her to Aunt Ida seems particularly cruel; Ida has no apparent softness to her anywhere. As the book evolves, however, you gain a respect for all three generations, and you realize that though Christine is clearly on her way out, she's facing it squarely and without fear, and that the choices she made are the right ones for all three of them.Aunt Ida was particularly interesting, and her segment of the story was my favourite. At the end, hers is the most poignant tale; a woman without resources, making a sacrifice no one should ever be asked to make, and coming out of it finally with her dignity intact.\\"A Yellow Raft In Blue Water\\" was one of those books that worked on me after I had finished it, and I felt a sense of loss upon coming to the final word.

What a shame. Please don't mistake my intention here; one should come to this novel in a wholly voluntary way, with an open heart toward the telling of a good story. Dorris is, certainly, one of America's finest storytellers. This novel is rich with imagery and infused with the colors of Native American life. But it is essentially a novel about people and relationships undefined by race or color. It is a story of heartbreak and redemption, told by a man who knew personally of these things. As a feminist writer, I came to this book with a bias; I resented his presumption that he could tell a woman's story--several women's stories--from a woman's point of view. It taught me a lesson about my own prejudice, and brought me to a place of greater tolerance.

The thing you will notice is that its quite a long read and the book, broke into 3 sections, will most likely scare you away when you find tedium in some of the passages. I stuck with it (out of respect for Erdrich's choice of husband) and found that the last two sections really sold my interest into the story, as all the loopholes are backfilled and twists in plot are revealed.

The picture on the cover and the title might not leave you at the edge of your seat, dying to read the book, but it is the amazing and captivating story about three generations of women who are all struggling in life to find a reason that counts the most. This realistic fiction novel is intense and heart-wrenching, and lets you see that what happens in the past isn't always forgotten.The book is told from the point of view of three women who all grew up in different times with different aspects on life. It shows how each choice they made throughout their lives affected each other in more ways then they will ever know, and tore apart their relationships with each other, when they really need each other the most. Rayona, a half black and half Indian girl who is around 15 years old, is suffering from her mother's poor choices in life when all she really wants is to find her place and reason in life. Christine, the mother of Rayona, is an excessive partier who never took life seriously, and who strived to be noticed and admired like her older brother Lee. Her motto was that you can never get to old to be a kid, and living by that left her unstable with many regrets from her foolish choices. Last but not least is Ida, the mother of Christine who has deep secrets of betrayal, and who never had the chance to live life. They are all in search of their selves, but need each other more than ever.The book starts out in the present with Rayona and then gradually fades back to her mother Christine's life, told by Christine's point of view. After that, it even goes farther back into the life of Ida, which is told by her. Each of the woman have problems that keep them apart from each other, and as the book travels back in time, you see how each decision and action affected their futures and how their relationship turned out.This book is touching, a very realistic story that can be related to in many ways. Will Rayona, Christine, and Ida ever set their differences aside so they can all be a family? Or will they all be lost forever without each other?

The book A Yellow raft in Blue Water, by Micheal Dorris, is that of a story that shows how the dividers between generations form and what is done to knock them down.The story is told from the point of view of three women. All grew up in different eras, were raised different ways, and trying to find their way through life with or without the help of each other. Rayona, a 15 year old girl, half Indian half black, trapped in the life her mother's poor choices have created. Christine, Rayona's mother and full Indian, having been hurt in the past, is torn between love and resentment towards those closest to her. And Aunt Ida, mother to Christine, grandmother to Rayona, is extremely bitter, due to the fact she was forced to grow up all to fast.The book begins with the story told from the point of Rayona. She explains how she is always changing schools and really has no friends, aside from her mother who she doesn't understand. Her mother decides to leave Seattle where they live and go back to the reservation in Montana. However once they arrive, Christine abandons Rayona with Aunt Ida, without an explanation. Rayona is forced to try and fit in on the reservation, but finds it hard because of the fact she isn't full Indian. So she leaves the reservation to try and find meaning in her life.In the second part, the book goes back in time about 20 years to when Christine was a teenager, and tells her life all the way to Rayona's period. She tells her story of how she always felt her brother Lee was liked more than her and how she never really felt loved by anyone, aside from Rayona. She also explains how all the poor choices she had made throughout her life changed it forever and not for the better.Finally the story goes back even further in time to when Aunt Ida was young. She explains the pressures put on her by her family that forced her to grow up all to fast. Also she explains why she is so bitter towards the people she loves the most.Though the dividers between all three generations of the women exist, detours are found to get around them.

As they reflect and ponder about the past or the future, these three women begin to notice what they should've done and what they have to do. For example, as Ida remembers her past, she states &quot;If I were to live differently, I would start with the word no.&quot; This novel explains the feelings of regret and resentment in positive and negative aspects. Dorris carefully uses a metaphorical braid to intertwine three very different stories, which beautifully portray love, life and perseverance."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I had to read this book for a Human Behavior class in a Master of Social Work program. I found it intruiging and moving. The main thrust of the story seems to be be the impending death of Christine and how she, Rayona, and Ida reflect on life in light of that. Each looks back at secrets and hurts to face the regret that lies in unfulfilled desires."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I read this book for my AP senior English class and I must admit, it's a wonderful read.

I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I was required to read this book for my high school AP English class as well, yet I still enjoyed it.

Intertwining three strands, one for each character, into a braid is a great metaphor. The fact that the same events were told in different views was incredible. I liked the fact that it was written backwards. Good book!"},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"Story, yes. Literary merit: not so good. I found myself reading paragraph after paragraph of typical sophomoric vocabularay, and, suddenly, there's this deep thought, as if Dorris intended it to be really secretive. Sorry! Yes, I did read this for a class in High School, but I also have a significant literary background. Sure, characterization was execellent, but it doesn't even compare to a Joseph Heller in his Catch-22. Therefore, I consider this a novel in cohesion with The Boxcar Children. It's a great read if you don't want to think."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I chose this book for my bookclub and we meet this coming Wednesday to review it. I was surprised to see all the reviews on here from students who HAD to read the book for English. I thought the book was well written, it was confusing at the end, to have Aunt Ida on the roof with the priest and not know what happened to her, Christine and Rayona. However, I read that Michael Dorris wrote somewhat of a sequel to this book. Maybe if you aren't made to read this book you would have enjoyed it more, I thought the characters were wonderful, that Mr Dorris captured the female pysche in each woman.

We had to read it at school in my English class and first I thought that no way, I will never read all those 300 pages. But then I did and I'm happy I did because I got so much new things to think."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"Dorris does a great job enabling the reader to identify w/ the 3 characters. THis family reminds me so much of a 'real' family-not a family so often found in literature. It is obvious that Dorris truly understands human behavior and that this story has evolved from an experience that perhaps Dorris himself went through. Dorris reveals the mistakes thta each character makes and shows the dire consequences and how they can deteriorate even the most potent and powerful of relationships, maybe just as powerful as his own marriage. THe depth of his understanding could only result from a first-hand experience, not something simply created in one's mind.I did not like watching the charcters mess up their lives-the mistakes were too obvious. I think that miscommmunication and a lack of communication lies at the root of this family's problems. To me, Ida's strengths were also her weaknesses- her stubborn nature and holding in her own feelings. Also, I think the omniscient view, although very enlightening, lacked the depth usually found in getting one person's full point of view. Although the viwe was vaqried and widespread, it was not as deep-not as personal. Perhaps this helped to understand the problems and conflicts usually lack understanding anyway. Eventhough this story focuses on the cultural problems faced by minorities, I found myself not empathizing with the characters, due to thier self-pity and failure to act on their intuition and better judgement. Although I cannot connect with the problems, I cannot connnect w/ the reasoning behind Christine and Ida's decisions-except their past is the only indicator. Not the most riveting and moving novel I have ever read, it does hold a profound meaning and teaches a lesson that is both helpful in literature and life- the lesson to love and be loved, no matter what the barriers. Ida exeplifies this when she says \\" If I were to live my life differently, I would start with the word No: [...]\\", (297). She shows that she regrets hiding her true feelings and revealing her true deciaions. She yields to what evil allows her to do. Read this book to gain perspective and wisdom on life, but not to feel moved."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"Michael Dorris weaves a tale of how three women have chosen their paths which affects their present and future going back into the past lives of Christina and Ida. The two women have secrets of their own that have affected each of them and how they treat their offspring.I read this book in my senior year of high school thinking that it would be another boring read. Instead, I found myself immersed into the book wondering how each female has led her own life. Rayona doesn't know why she is going back home and Christina doesn't know what she has done to make her mother Ida feel inferior to her. We don't know why Ida dotes on her late son Lee. The reader has to be fully absorbed into the book to understand each woman's story.We can't undue what has happened in our past but we can learn from it to make it a better future."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"A Yellow Raft in Blue water starts in the present and moves back in time telling us the story of three women connected by blood and resentment.

After breaking out of the hospital she was in Christine is about to commit suicide when Rayona stops her and than Christine decides to take a roadtrip with her daughter. To where she grew up on an Indian reservation.When they arrive there she leaves Rayona and the story unfolds.From there we follow Rayona's adventure and than we meet Christine who fought with her mother over almost everything. She never understood her mother at all for making her and her brother call her Aunt Ida and left the reservation and made mistakes of her own.Finally we meet &quot;Aunt Ida&quot; not only do we see why she has become so strong and hard but we come to understand her. A strong woman who became strong because of her own mothers bad decisions and the inability to say No.I love books that deal with mother-daughter relationships and this one is a treat. The story is wonderful and by the time you get to Ida you feel as though these characters have become your friends.

The first time I read it was when I was in the ninth grade, just for pleasure. This second time around I had to read it for my Modern Literature class. The second time I read it I was able to understand the three parts of the book much more clearly. The book is split into three parts, one for each character. I can honestly say that, to me, only two of the three were interesting. The first part of the book is Rayona, the second Christine (Rayona's mother), and the third Ida (Christine's mother). To me, Christine and Ida's were interesting because they explained, in different ways, the reason why Rayona had so many problems. The first time I read the book I honestly thought Ida did not love Christine, but now that I have read it again I am able to understand the coldness Ida gave Christine. The form this book is writen in is very unique. It is jdivided into three parts and it tells the story going from the youngest to the eldest. The book had an odd ending that left me in a &quot;What, this is it?&quot; Eventhough it had an odd ending it was a interesting book and I recomend it to anybody mature enough to read it."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I read this book in my Mult-Literature Class.

It was by far the best novel we read that year. I couldn't put it down. I enjoy how Michael Dorris wrote almost the same story from 3 different points of view. I can't wait to read it again!"},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"This is a story told through three generations of women from the same family, only instead of beginning with the grandmother, it begins with the granddaughter and works backwards. This may sound like an unusual and unfriendly way to tell the history of a family but it actually helps you to feel the emotions of the characters and understand their actions so much more. What starts out as unbelievable behavior ends up being explained in the end and you realize just how much love the family has for each other, even if it doesn't seem to be that they show it at all. It's often said that we are made up of our own experiences, but this is a book that proves that part of us is made up of the things others before us have experienced.I found it interesting that for each section of the book the writing was slightly different. This makes sense, as the story is told from each character's point of view, but the attention to detail in wording and language really hit home throughout, especially at the end of the book, when Ida tells her story. She doesn't speak English, but her native \\"Indian\\", which is a more eloquent and descriptive language than English and the writing demonstrates this beautifully.There wasn't much of a conclusion to the book, or even a real conclusion to each person's story, but I'm not certain that there really needed to be. Readers are taken to a point where their part of the character's story has been wrapped up and packaged in a set of chapters and bringing each section to an actual conclusion, either by the death of the character or some other event would only prolong the story, rather than bring it to a stopping point. I hadn't realized this at the time that I was reading and found the lack of a definite finish line somewhat unsettling, but as the story eased into me completely, I found myself quite satisfied.Yellow Raft in Blue Water is a heartwarming journey, written very well, and almost certainly guaranteed to pull the reader in as it reminds them how important family can truly be, even when the traditional idea of family is far from what you have to work with."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I purchased the audio CDs for my classroom.

I loved the voice of Rayona, and I thought there was a very interesting plot twist in the end.My favorite character was Lee, and I was sad he wasn't a bigger character.I also didn't like the underdeveloped idea of Dayton and jail.Other than that, it was definitely one of the best books I've read this summer.

Unlike most Indian novels especially by Indian writers, it didn't sink into instant obscurity and go out of print. Dorris tells the story from 3 viewpoints: Grandma (the reservation traditionalist), mother (the city woman who married and was deserted by a black man) and daughter (mixed-blood offspring). All women are real individuals not abstract types. Returning to the reservation, Raymona faces racism there as well, for her dark skin, nappy hair, and city ways. Reservation life, chronicled by weaving back and forth in time from about the 1930's to the present (without casinos) will be readily recognizable as any reservation of the Plains, though it is fictionalized it is neither generic nor abstractly presented. Though it's an adult book, and long for classroom use, it held the attention of Native juniors and seniors, especially young women. Most students were upset at its ending, which leaves problems of the main characters unresolved. The book ends literally up in the air, with Ida (grandma, back in time to mother Christine's very young teenage days) sitting on the roof with the reservation priest. Students were asked to write continuation stories as resolutions to those parts of the novel that had caught their interest, and did so working in small groups and discussing parts of the book at great length.There is a connected life story over 3 generations -- with several mysteries one of which doesn't come clear at the end -- told from the viewpoints of the 3 women. The teenaged girl, mixed blood Black and Indian -- whose return to the reservation is the main focus of the story. A mixed blood, she must find her identity if she can."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"A yellow raft in blue water by Michael Doris is without a doubt one of the most unique books I have ever read. The novel was magnificently separated into three parts, Rayona an American Indian teen, Christina Rayona's mother, and Ida Christina's mother, with each of the three characters telling a little about their lives. I think this makes this book exciting because each character leaves readers with their nose in the books while the plot slowly unveils itself. A yellow raft in blue water realistically illustrates the love and hate between the broken down relationship of three women, and it captures your imagination and your heart. I strongly recommend this book to everyone and anyone who can read."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"This is a story that is told backwards in time. The story starts with Rayona, a mature 15 year old girl who seems to be trying to raise her irresponsible mother. Christine, Rayona's mother, speaks next, and the reader learns of her struggles growing up rebelling against her unaffectionate mother. Finally, Ida, the grandmother is allowed to defend her self, and tell of the secrets and betrayals that shaped her life. After finishing the novel, I was seized with the urge to reread it (which I have), because each irrational action of the mother viewed by the younger generation, is later explained. And in the end, I was amazed by the masterful tapestry Michael Dorris has created, and I was deeply moved by the integrity and strength of all three women.I wrote my senior thesis on the unrealistic depictions of Native Americans in popular media, and I was floored by the realism and the matter of fact presentation of the lives of the three women here."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"Michael Dorris had my attention from page one. He writes the remarkable story of 3 women whose lives are entwined through generations.Mr. Dorris has written three separate stories that join together through the lives of the three special women he writes about. Rayona begins the journey in the present as she tries to find her identity as a child of mixed blood, Native American and African American. There were times I could feel her confusion and anger as she struggles for her own identity. Christine is Rayona's mother and follows in the second part of our story. She also deals with the need for acceptance which she tries to find through liquor and men. Sadness and personal tragedy appear to be as much a part of Christine's life as breathing is to most of us. Ida is the matriarch of the family and also the third woman who ties our characters together. At times I felt Ida was the strongest of the three women and possibly just a little hard hearted. Needless to say I was proven wrong before the end of the story.Three generations of women, all struggling with the same need for acceptance and love in their lives culminates in a truly moving story of courage. I have often asked myself &quot;What took you so long?&quot; as this book was recommended to me some time ago and I put off reading it time and again."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I read this book for my psych class on development of a person through the lifespan and was expecting to get through it. What I was not expecting was to get so engrossed in it that I would finish the book gladly almost a week before the paper was due. The author is truly a gifted storywriter, we feel all of the emotions of the characters as they are expressed. We realize along with Rayona that Christine is really sick and that Aunt Ida really cares. We feel Christine's love for a man that could never give her the love she needed and the love she gives to their daughter. We mourn the loss of her brother and realize how painful it was to lose him after being the one encouraging him to enlist in the military. And then when we get to Ida's story, we feel her love, though it is quietly expressed or misinterpreted, for both of her children, admiring their differences and truly not taking a favorite. We also feel Rayona's anger at Christine, and then realize why Christine is the way she is. We see Christine's frustration with Ida and then see Ida's side of the story.By the end of the book, all three characters had my sympathy for the hard hand that they were dealt in life. It's hard to stay mad at any of the three main characters. But when people hurt Rayona, Christine, or Ida, we are angry at the people that hurt them, betray them, or decieve them. Overall, a book ripe with emotions and constant lightbulbs, \\"oh so that's why....\\", but definitely worth reading.

Everything from heavy-handed symbolism to a near soap-opera storyline brings this down. This is like one of those young adult books. You know, the books where the author can't really write, so he makes it &quot;mature&quot; (swears alot and fills it with adult situations) to make up for it. This is one of the most overrated books since Catcher in the Rye (both books make the fatal mistake of confusing a depressed, lonely, and abandonded character with a deep character. Neither author realizes that a character with only one or two emotions, no matter what they are, is a boring character). Still, it is an easy read, so feel free to try it out......"},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water is a novel I won't soon forget. Set in Seattle and Montana, it tells the tale of three Native American women--Rayona, Christine and Ida--each in her own voice. They are related, a family, and their worlds intersect and tear apart, span out and braid back together, but it is not until the ending that the reader fully understands how the events which start the novel have come to pass.It is told in reverse, starting with the youngest, Rayona or Ray for short. At first, her strength lies in the unconditional love she has for her mother but after her mother deserts her and she is forced to fend for herself (and is molested by a priest), she shows that her strength does not come from others. She is a warrior and by the end of her story, she comes to embody the spirit of all those missing who came before her--all those we don't truly know about until the end of the book.Christine seems weak, diseased and tormented with feelings that her mother did not love her. These lifelong feelings led her down a path of promiscuity and jealousy goaded her into pressuring her beloved brother to enlist. And when he does and dies in Vietnam, it is as if he is reborn in her daughter. The same feelings of unworthiness consume her until her health fails and she returns home to find love again--love in an old friend, love in her daughter and love in the woman who raised her.Aunt Ida is the true enigma and the undying and unexpected source of strength. She has martyred herself and because of this, the lives of others have turned sour. But her goal was an honorable one. She wanted love and to be loved. She wanted safety. She wanted to weave together disparate parts and form a whole. As shown at the end of the book when Ida takes the one man who never hurt her to the roof of her house, she wanted to braid her loved ones together and have them be stronger for it."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"This book is in 3 parts -- each told from a view point of a a different generation from the same family. This story is very poignant, for teenagers, mothers and grandmothers who often are too wound up in the present to appreciate the past. Each person's narrative gives a new perspective on why the character acts the way she does. It lends an uncommon depth to the story. I never thought that Ida's harshness could be justified but after hearing her version of the story, I understand her view. It is a melancholy story with illness, death and despair. But it is worth the time."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"In A Yellow Raft in Blue Water, Michael Dorris tells the story of three generations of women in an American-Indian family. Rayona, only fifteen years old, is left by her mother (on the Indian Reservation) to live with her distant grandmother, \\"Aunt\\" Ida. Rayona has to deal with her grandmother and try to learn to fit in. Christine, Rayona's mother, finds out that she has cancer and has to come to grips with her own mortality, as well as the death of her beloved brother, Lee, many years ago that she has never gotten over. Aunt Ida reflects on her life raising Christine and Lee, and the secrets that she has been keeping all her life.Dorris gives us each of these three characters' viewpoints separately. Because he does this, we end up making assumptions about a character, then find out the reasons for that character's actions later. Structuring the book this way, giving us all three viewpoints instead of just one, allows us to understand each character and also see how incorrect assumptions can be.A Yellow Raft in Blue Water is touching and well-written. Dorris keeps us interested in the story, and leaves us wanting more. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I really liked this book because it exemplifies the women being able to face the misconception and challenges of being an individual. The three characters of the book; Ida, Christine and Rayona symbolizes independence and bravery in facing trials brought about by hidden family secrets and mistakes from the past, and they used this vices to improve their individuality and their relationship with each other. The book also gives us a taste of Indian history that flows through three generations, which divides the book into three stories, based on each perspective. I liked how the author present the facts and mysteries of their lives because it all started from the present and back tracks to Ida's point of view. The story is also amusing because it is straightforward and the language used is colloquial. Over all, the book casts a spell on the reader making it a part of the story itself."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I loved this book. And to have it told by a man maybe even makes it all the more remarkable.At first look, the main characters do not seem to be that likeable, particulariy Christine and Inez. But as you go through the lives of these three women, you will fall in love with them.Christine was particulariy unlikeable. But she captured me and turned me around by the end. If everyone had the capacity of love that this woman had, the world would be a much better place. Her reasons for holding back are highly apparent, and you will not learn to admire her, but will be drawn into her, and she may possibly break your heart. I wish I had more Christines in my life.Inez comes across like a crabbly old lady, which she is. But again, her reasons for her distance become very valid and heartbreaking. You will develop an understanding of her, and you will share her pain.I forget the daughter's name (I feel terrible), but she is the catalyst that draws everyone together. She is no weakling. All of our daughters should be tough in this way.Finally, Michael Dorris is certainly a master. He's poetic without being boring. He brings characters to life gently, but thoroughly. His descriptions make you feel as though you are actually on an Indian resevation, in the dark city, or, on a yellow raft in blue water. His passion in his writing is obvious.It's been awhile since I've read this book for the second or third time (you may notice I've had several reviews all with the same date. I recently lost my job and now have LOTS of time on my hands...I'm playing catch up). But just by writing this, I believe I think I need to read it again. I'm getting the chills just remembering, very clearly, the stories of these three amazing women."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"Yellow Raft in Blue Water is a novel written by Michael Dorris. He does not just tell a story of a young girl and her family. He emphasizes the need for strong family relationships. He also emphasizes the love that children need from their parents and other relatives. This story is interesting, touching and exciting.Michael Dorris' Yellow Raft in Blue Water is a heart-warming tale of a young girl, her mother and grandmother and the problems each one of them has faced. The story begins with a focus on Rayona, a fifteen-year-old girl who is abandoned by all of the people she loves and has to live for herself. After her mother leaves her Rayona lives with her grandmother known as \\"Aunt Ida\\". Rayona feels very alone and confides in the one person who shows any sympathy for her. Father Tom in the only person who she is close to. Father Tom eventually leaves Rayona on her own thinking she is going back to her hometown of Seattle. He only does this because he knows that Rayona feels like she is alone on the reservation. \\"And you won't feel so alone, so out of place...\\"(63). Father Tom believes that Rayona will make it one her own just as her mother did when she was younger.A third of the way through the story changes focus to Rayona's mother, Christine. In this part of the story we get to see how Christine became the person she is. Christine is a party girl. She always went out in the middle of the night to party with friends. Because of this she was in the hospital a lot. Rayona was always there to support her mother but Christine could not support her. The end of the story finishes with focus on the grandmother, who is known as Aunt Ida. In this part of the story we learn that Christine is not Ida's real child. That Ida only took her in to cover up the fact that her husband had gotten another woman pregnant. This part of the story ties the three women together because it shows that everyone has problems and that is why people are the way they are.Some of the main points of this story are race, age, gender and class. Dorris does and excellent job of describing each of these points in his story. Each section has a little bit of each main point but they all work together to show a common ground. Being half Indian himself Dorris can relate to the struggles that his characters face. Like when other characters judge Rayona because of the color of her skin instead of what she is really like. It may be hard for the reader to understand what the characters are feeling but they can better understand it because Dorris describes the emotion in such detail.Dorris gets his main points through to the reader very well. All the major ideas are laid out clearly. The book talks about all of the ideas it intends to like racial differences and age differences. It emphasizes on each point in different parts of the story so that the reader can fully understand and absorb what is being said before moving on. Dorris also uses many different literary elements to support his points. Like imagery, diction (word choices), and tone.Michael Dorris does and excellent job telling this story. It is very creative and captures the reader. It is a story for all ages and genders and should be read by everyone. This book talks about very important issues that everyone should know a little about. By reading Yellow Raft in Blue Water the reader can better understand major social issues and can have a great time reading a really great story."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"This was an exelent book.

I read this book with my back on my and my parents' bed, a lamp illuminating me, my book, and my space. I met three amazing women, women who, once again, proved to me that we are who we are and that we can count on us. It was simply but effectively written by Michael Dorris, an author who has an exquisite talent whenever it comes to stepping in his characters' shoes then walking, his feet in them, to produce very compelling points of view. I strongly recommend this book to those who are not parochial with what they read. I've met a lot of readers and most of them are very provincial: &quot;I only read books by...&quot; Whatever!

This story was written in a unique style, I've never read a book so good like this. There were many themes in this book. Like love and loneliness, and in another way the themes sort of tied the stories together as well as the ending. Rayona narrates the first part of the book, and she talks about her loneliness mostly in this section. In the second section Christine is Rayona's mother, who shares her regret and her feelings of loneliness. In this book they even use profanity very similar language that we use today, I think that when you read this bookit really makes you think what's going on in your life and who you really are.

I'm a well-read adult who anticipated a powerful story (because of glowing reviews). I enjoyed the book up until Part III, when I thought Ida was going to tie everything together. She did no such thing. Her \\"voice\\" bore no resemblance to the character we met in parts I and II. Her story was a soap opera and completely unbelievable.

However, after reading Morning Girl, also by Dorris, in a college Children's Lit course and learning a bit about his personal life, it leads me to belive that there is a direct connection between the author and his text. This should not play a part in how one appreciates the language, but rather how one reflects on the content. It provides a different view of what is happening in the text and I think it is important to concider that view. Overall, my advice is to read the book, resurch the author and then read the book again! :)"},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"My co worker gave me at work said it was something i would enjoy so i read. i liked it somthings disburbed me some things i really admired respect but im curious to if she ever finds out the whole story...."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I recently finished reading A Yellow Raft in Blue Water. I felt like a trusted confidant the whole time, as if each woman were telling me her innermost thoughts. I was flattered. Contrary to one review, I did not feel that these were miserable lives at all. Admittedly, normally I would think of \\"this type of person\\" as miserable, but having seen their worlds through their eyes, receiving an opportunity to live another's life vicariously, there was something precious about each life that made their respective walks ... worthy. A most captivating read."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I had a hard time at first getting into \\"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water\\". I was put off by the \\"low life\\" antics of the native American mother Christine as she tries to manipulate her African American husband Elgin into getting back together and then escapes from the public Indian Service hospital ostensibly to crash her car and commit suicide. She seems utterly oblivious to her 15-year old daughter, Rayona's, material and emotional needs, and utterly caught up in her own dead-end drama -- a sorry example of the alcoholism and moral degeneracy afflicting too many present day Indians. Michael Dorris, however, is a consumate story-teller and gives voice to Rayona's story with such acute awareness, courage, and humor that I couldn't put her story down. Soon I caught hold of my judgments, self-rightiousness, and ethnic prejudice and was taken in by the raw humanity of all three women -- Rayona, Christine, and finally Aunt Ida -- each of whom narrates her third of the novel -- covering some of the same ground but each from her own unique point of view. Rayona's first third ends with a hair-rasing rodeo adventure that left me gasping with excitement. Christine's voice comes through more humanely in her section. Her story of growing up on a poor Indian reservation in Montana during the 50's and 60's drew me in and evoked empathy for her struggles and amazement at her courage and strength. Even though her city-life of low-paying jobs and frequent bar-hopping seemed vapid and empty at first, it soon became clear that she was in fact a quite present and loving mother. The last third -- Aunt Ida's story -- had me in frequent tears by the end. Again, I started off with a lot of judgments about this hardened old woman who wouldn't even allow her two kids to call her \\"mother\\". But as her tale unfolds, the reasons for this and her other apparent hardheadedness becomes blatantly clear. In the last chapters, Ida describes her life as a single mother raising Christine and her brother, Lee, the apple of her eye, who dies tragically in Vietnam. The tender, loving descriptions of preparing meals, giving baths, attending to her children's real emotional and spiritual needs in the nitty-gritty of everyday life was very moving to me. From her ostensible poverty, Ida create a life of much inner and outer richness. It's not surprising that the local priest wants to visit her every week -- she is a lively and vibrant presence and a person who lived her difficult life to the fullest. I really loved this book and felt like it made me happy to be a member of the human race -- despite all our warts, inconsistencies, wayward tendencies, and cruelties."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I just finished reading this book in one day.

Sadly, Michael Dorris, the author, took his life several years ago.The novel is about the inter-relationships of three American Indian women - - a mother, daughter and grandmother. The story is told from their different points of view. It is poignant, insightful and tragic. Each of the women misunderstands the others and misinterprets motives and emotions. Despite each of them believing that they are unloved and unappreciated, they still sling to their need for each other. What is especially tragic is how they are unable to really relate to each other and show how deeply they feel.While each one's story lends more insight to the other's lives, it also shows how things are misconstrued and misunderstood - - how secrets are kept and lives separated by misunderstanding."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I listened to this book on audio and was enthralled with the reader, Barbara Rosenblat. She gave life to this story and I lived each woman's saga through her voice. The style of the novel was a little confusing at first but everything wove together at the end like a tight braid. There is an underlying message about judging people without knowing what sculpted their lives. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"Three women connected as mothers and daughters but each with tremendous burdens to bear and pass along. Although the stories are not beautiful, the writing in this book is exceptionally beautiful -- simple, direct, vivid, and tender. The author definitely knows how to bring the reader into the shoes of the characters. At times as I was reading, I could simply forget where I was and was astonished when I looked up to find myself in my own living room.If you are at all interested in family relationships, this is a book to explore. It is a testament of how the slightest things can become so forceful in our own lives and then silently creep into the lives of our children."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"There were times in this book when I had to force myself to keep reading because it slowed down. But for the most part, it was astonishing. As a reader, just when you think you've made good judgements of the characters, light shines on the passed leading up to the moments of judgement, and a whole new perspective is found, over and over again. Of all the books I've read this book has left the deepest impression on me. Fantastic!"},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"\\"I sit on the bed at a crooked angle, one foot on the floor, my hip against the tent of Mom's legs, my elbows on the hospital table.\\"So starts \\"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water,\\" one story told in turns by mother, daughter, and granddaughter. When I first heard about this, I was looking for a book for school. It looked intriguing, so I chose it. By page 50, I was having difficulty putting the book down. The first part of the book is told by Rayona, a 15 year old girl with a Native American mother and an African American father, and the basic plot and the outcome is revealed. Then the story switches to Christine, the mother of Rayona, and the story is embellished and added to, until finally Ida takes over. Ida is Christine's mother and Rayona's grandmother, and she finally supplies the last piece of a story spanning three generations. The only pieces that are not so great are the ending, which seemed a little clunky and unresolved, and the end of each of the sections, especially Rayona's. This is overall a very good book, and I recommend it."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"Dorris's \\"Yellow Raft on Blue Water\\" is less about American Indian life than about the dangers of growing up in this strange, rich, loosely-jointed society that we've built in America. Particularly when you have no help from your family. Rayona, at 15, is an outsider in the white world of Seattle because her mother is Indian and her father black. She's equally an outsider on the reservation, to which her mother returns her, because of her father and her years on the Coast. The first eight chapters, told by Rayona, are splendid. The next eight, told by her wildly irresponsible and conflicted mother, are a bit less so. The final four, in the voice of her grandmother, supply the answers to the puzzles but remain mechanical. Not a great novel but a good one with some fine passages."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I had heard so many great things about this book, and had thoroughly enjoyed Michael Dorris's non-fiction work, &quot;The Broken Cord,&quot; but I couldn't finish this. It just felt like an aimless walk through a trailer park. I couldn't believe a single thing any of the characters did, and the capper was Rayona's rodeo ride."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I was not at all impressed by this book as I read it during my 9th grade English class. I did not feel any attachment to any of the characters at all. At times the ordeals of the characters seemed like over-dramatized cliches. I found myself getting frustrated with the characters and bored by their stale attempts to grapple with their personal situations. The symbolism and the frequent metaphors were too obvious and uninteresting. And as a 9th grader, this book was at times much too explicit, a sentiment similarily expressed by my English teacher- it is definitely NOT for younger audiences. I overall did not enjoy this book. If you are looking for a book that captures the essence of the female psyche, I would recommend Margaret Atwood's Cat's Eye instead. Sometime I may want to re-read this book, as it has been four years now, but I rather would spend my time on a classic. I would recommend against reading this one- it leaves a lasting unpleasant feeling without offering an insightful new perspective or idea. It certainly lacks the brilliance and impact of a true classic read."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I originally read this book years ago in high school. Now nearly complete with my education, I've read my fair share of books over the years. I can confidently say that this is easily one of, if not the best that I have read. It has had a major influence on my own writing, so that may make me a bit biased, but then again, isn't that the point of a review?Anyway, I'd like to offer a rebuttal of a few other reviews posted here. The single star review laments over the scene where Rayona and her mother have a spat while packing with garbage bags is rich for interpretation. Also, Christines reasoning is given from her perspective as to why she leaves Rayona at her grandmothers, making sense to her. She is correct in saying that there is no closure, at least in the usual sense. Each section is opened ended, but when read together, each story fills in the voids that the others had. The complaint is ludicrous.Further, I believe that this novel is fine for a teenage audience, as its no worse from anything on \\"One Tree Hill\\" or any other typical teen show on television. In fact, I'd say it portrays 'adult' situations (sex, language, ect ect) in a real perspective, shows the consequences of the actions and how they affect those who come after you in life. There is a scene a uncomfortable scene with Rayona and a priest, but when looked at in context with past events with her mother and grandmother, the reader can see a pattern, and should ask themselves \\"what is the meaning of this pattern\\" rather than shrug them off. To print a 'PG' version would be a disservice to the story and to the memory of Michael Dorris.With that off my chest, let me tell you why this is an amazing book. First off, the structure of the book is fantastic. We learn about Rayona, her life and her relationships with her mother and grandmother, totally from her perspective. Little nuances are left out, and are filled in my her mother, when the reader learns her life story, her relationship with her daughter and mother, Ida, all from her perspective. Finally, all the little holes are filled by Ida, who reveals the most about the family, but has the most concise story to tell.Second, the characters are engrossing. You scream at them when they do something wrong, you really feel their pain, as clich&eacute; as that may sound, but its true. Each woman has a very distinct and strong voice.Lastly, its original. It has a bit of everything to keep everyone entertained. Its a genuine examination of self. Its easy to see someone you know in at least one character in the book in some form or another. Its dramatic, but not overwrought or pulls at your heart. You are not manipulated into your emotions as you feel what the characters go through.It is a astonishing book, and I hope I have sufficiently helped you the reader in considering to read this book. You will not be let down."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"We read this novel as part of the pastoral care course at seminary. Partly it was to introduce characters of backgrounds differing from essentially anyone else in the course, to introduce situations and people to whom one might eventually be called upon to minister.The book begins with the tale of Rayona, a middle-teenage girl who is having problems adjusting to life (of course, which middle-teenage girl is not having problems? one might ask). Her problems are magnified by her alcoholic mother, her distant grandmother, her mixed-race parentage, and her general feeling of being caught between two (or more) worlds.The book continues in its second part with a backward look at Rayona's mother, Christine, who came of age on a reservation (being an American Indian -- when she was being raised, the term 'native American' had not yet become standard). She was also distant from her mother, we learn, who was known as 'aunt Ida' (exemplifying the distance in the relationship even at the outset).The third part is yet again a backward progression to Ida's life, so that as we get to know more and more about the background of the person, we begin to see how the child and grandchild turned out as they did.Each of the three parts bring us further back into the past, and provide us with a different perspective on what is happening in the present. We see, for instance, the encounter of Christine and Rayona returning to the reservation and encountering Aunt Ida on the riding lawn mower, from the perspective in turn of each of the participants: Rayona, who feels abandoned by her mother; Christine, who feels abandoned by her mother Aunt Ida; Ida, who has so much baggage that she is both accepting and rejecting simultaneously, afraid to show the concern that truly beats within her heart. A fascinating trinity of perspectives which interpermeate to give a full picture, but only for the patient.In pastoral care settings, one will not normally get this kind of insight and detail, but it is a wonderful novel in which to see a unique set of characters who, if one were to encounter them on the street or, say, in a bus station, one might easily overlook as uninteresting.This is a thoughtful account, full of 'touchy/feely' details, and will appeal to those who are looking for that. There is little action in the book, and no real mystery (beyond the basic 'who are these people?' question). These are, in fiction, what I generally prefer. And yet, I found it engrossing and entertaining, and hard to put down."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"\\"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water\\" was written in 1987 by the late Michael Dorris, and it's separated into three viewpoints (future, present, and past). The main story revolves around three Native-American women (Rayona, her mother Christine, & Christine's mother Aunt Ida) and it shows us how the past has affected the present, and how the future is currently being affected by the present. This is a fairly unique structure that I have never seen in other books. However, as we go from the future to the past, it goes from great to worse. Rayona's story (the first one-third of the book) is revealed as a promising start to the rest of the story, but when Christine's story (the next one-third) is told, the writing, as well as the flow and atmosphere of the plot, starts to feel dry and mechanical. It's not until we get to Aunt Ida's story (the last one-third) that the book fails almost entirely as the writing falls flat and the climax feels forced.\\"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water\\" is basically a bit of a letdown. It's not too bad, but it's still not enough for me to recommend it. I credit Michael Dorris, however, for giving us at least a compelling first half, where the characters are interesting and the writing is fairly crisp. Too bad the novel isn't able to redeem itself with the second half.Grade: C-"},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"This was the best book I have read during my 9th grade year.

It doesn't try to hide anything, but presents its characters in harsh, unflattering daylight for all to see. There are no flimsy characters in here either, no simpering, fainting women who are afraid of the sight of their own blood. The story may not be ordinary, but it is certainly true to life. Michael Dorris allows the reader to get inside the heads of these three women, and experience firsthand their every thought, which is definitely not an everyday experience. The voice is appropriate to the characters and setting, and seeing as these women are far from being snobs, it is appropriate that the language be somewhat unsophisticated. All in all, this is truly a down-to-earth, amazing book."},{"Title":"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"I couldn't believe while reading this book that the author was a male!

The number 3 had such great significance. The book was separated into three sections: Rayona, Christine, and Ida. It started on page 3. Also, it takes 3 strands of hair to braid it. Braiding has been a trait among the three generations. The three viewpoints of each woman emphasizes the different viewpoints of a story like the phrase &quot;There's always to sides to a story.&quot; Because of the different viewpoints, you can have different opinions. Some may think that each woman was courageous and strong enough to climb over their suffering. Others may think that each woman deserved their suffering and that it is just another chick book.

In life when an individual goes through tough times they my feel alone like the three Native American women in the novel The Yellow Raft in Blue Water, by Michael Dorris. All three of the women had dilemmas they dealt with, some due to their past lives or their mothers past lives. Every incident in the story is written so realistically that it seems to be a true story.This takes place in Seattle Washington and on a reservation in Montana with Rayona, a 14 year old Native American/ African American girl, who goes through difficult situations, while at the same time is trying to find where she falls in life. Her mother Christine, a single parent, is having health issues and is having problems with being a mother for Rayona. Then there's Aunt Ida, Christine's mother, who reveals many secrets of her life.Rayona is by herself on a reservation in Montana, while her mom is somewhere unknown. She is Staying with Aunt Ida, who she hasn't seen sense she was a baby. Rayona is required to go to school in the missionary but she doesn't seem to fit in because she is African American and Native American. People on the reservation insult her and treat her badly. She then gets tired of it and decides to head back to Seattle without informing anyone that she was leaving. That is when she learns to take care of herself and becomes more independent.People who should read this book are people who enjoy reading realistic fictions and women who are looking to overcome their weaknesses in life. The age group in which should read this is around 14 or older because the writing and language in the novel was wrote more mature individuals. The novel was written in an unusual way.

She is a horrible, unstable, alcoholic mother. The farther I got into the book, the more irritated I became. For instance, when Rayona and Christine are packing their belongings to move, Christine has many more garbage bags (yes, garbage bags) full of her own possessions. If I were Rayona, I would've ran away. To further prove my point, when Christine and Rayona reach their destination (Christine's mom's house), Christine runs away and leaves Rayona with a grandmother she's never really known. How selfish can one be?! Rayona tries running after her with her garbage bag, but the bag rips open and for most of the story she has no idea where her mother is. Great parenting skills, indeed.I don't understand how Rayona can put up with this lady's bull. I'd resent her so much for putting me through that, and by the way, Rayona's probably worried sick about her because her health continuously is deteriorating throughout the book.The only semi-interesting aspect of this book is that it's told from Rayona's perspective, Christine's, and Ida (Christine's mother).

He includes both the criminal underworld and the poor. Well researched as he was secretary of the Howard Association, which was involved with the the London underworld. He was compassionate and caring and worked to improve the lives of the poor people as well as the criminal class. He writes well and organized the material well. He proposed steps to improve the lot of the underworld and criminals that he believed would be better for all. Unfortunately, some of what he proposed was very draconian and would force people to do as directed.Worth reading to understand the affect of grinding poverty upon people in London in the early 20th century.

He was \\"embedded\\" alright, right up to his shoulders."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I bought this book wanting to learn something of the 101st's drive to Baghdad.

The author has disguised a left-wing political hatchet job against President Bush, the government and the U.S. Armed Forces as a military campaign book.On p.20 he states that America \\"goaded\\" the UN into a tougher resolution against Iraq (gee, poor stupid me thought that Saddam's defiance of other UN resolutions had something to do with it). On p.29 he insults our allies as insignificant world players (I guess he's upset that we didn't get an okay from France, Germany and the other \\"players\\" at the UN). On p.39 he states: \\"politically liberal sensibilities are rare in the army.\\" Well, duh! Self-styled elitist \\"intellectuals\\" (like the author), the \\"politically correct\\" crowd and those who find patriotism embarrassing never serve in the military! They believe the freedoms they enjoy are an entitlement and that the majority of military men/women are of lower intelligence than themselves and easily \\"deluded\\" by our government's true \\"evil\\" intentions...such as the war in Iraq. This book is insulting and I did not finish...it ended up in the trash can with the other garbage"},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"An incredibly readable and fluid account of the Screaming Eagles' trek to war. Atkinson put you there on the ground, describing the action, moods, tactics, and drama in vivid and poetic detail.Without dumbing down his writing, Atkinson deftly introduces the military to lay people in a &quot;The Army for Dummies&quot; format, without overusing the particular jargon, slang and lingo only soldiers would understand.This is a keen view from the top, with MG Petraeus playing the starring role in a decidely un-general officer-like manner, undistilled and full of candor. From the perspective of the division commander, we get an atypical view of war: from the middle managers who must put our men in the path of harm.It is this particular aspect which is somewhat unpredicted given the title. The title suggests a &quot;troop level&quot; perspective while Atkinson stays primarily with the division commander, his deputies, and the brigade commanders which provides a limited, albeit rare, view of light infantry combat. Instead it gives us a glimpse of the challenges and highlights of putting a 10,000 man division to war.The only other distraction is the author's political views which appear sporadically. Maybe we shouldn't be surprised given his place of employment, but Atkinson's criticism of the Bush administration are typically without a bigger context and these snipings don't seem to serve any purpose than to let us know which side of the voting line he lies.Regardless, an accomplished work that will impress the soldier and citizen alike."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"On the spur of the moment, I recently purchased, In the Company of Soldiers, shortly before boarding a plane. I had heard a great deal of praise for Atkinson's, An Army at Dawn, and I was eager to read his treatment of the Iraq war as an embedded journalist with the 101st Airborne Division. Unfortunately, I found Atkinson's account to be mildly disappointing.The book does have a nice flow to it, for the most part, and I was able to finish it over the course of a few days. Atkinson's writing is generally breezy and light although he definitely needs to give his thesaurus a break at times. I'd like to think that I have a fairly extensive vocabulary but far too often, I found myself wishing that I had a dictionary handy as I read through the narrative.My biggest complaint with, In the Company of Soldiers, is perhaps its rather misleading title. I was expecting a detailed account of combat from the perspective of those grunts in the thick of things on the front line. Unfortunately, Atkinson's chronicle focuses primarily on the challenges faced by Major General David Petraeus, the commander of the 101st. An inordinate amount of time is spent discussing both logistical dilemmas and a myriad of difficulties inherent to the chain of command; subjects which I did not find particularly interesting. Upon completing the book, I felt as though I had a decent grasp of the overall strategies implemented by the 101st but lacked any kind of feel for the tactics employed to achieve those strategic objectives. In Atkinson's defense, the 101st did not really see a great deal of intense combat during the few months that Atkinson spent with the unit so there wasn't exactly a wealth of material for him to work with. Of course, that naturally leads one to question why Atkinson felt the need to write his account in the first place.A lot has been made of Atkinson's numerous left-of-center political remarks interspersed throughout the book and I happen to feel as though much of the criticism directed at Atkinson is this regard is warranted. Atkinson is apparently no fan of either the Bush Administration or Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and while he's certainly entitled to his opinions, the deluge of snide comments directed at the Bush White House ultimately detracted from Atkinson's narrative. A little less time spent critiquing the reasons why the United States went to war and a little more time spent alongside the men and women actually fighting the war would have made for a far more interesting book."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"With the recent announcement of General Petraeus as the next commander of troops in Iraq, I took special interst in reading about the way that General Petraeus feels about his mission and how he handles his troops. My son was deployed twice to Iraq, and two grandsons will be entering military service in two short years.Rick Atkinson's account of his time embedded with Petraeus is written in great detail, worrying with the general over the details of combat, and considering the pros and cons of one choice or another, or the timing of an assualt. The reader gets an up-close view of the complexity of the problem and the pressure on the General.I'm left with the impression that no one else would be able to do a better job than Petraeus in this most difficult of all assignments coming up. It will take the wisdom of Solomon to make the right choices that will bring this war to a good conclusion."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"The book In the Company of Soldiers by Rick Atkinson is a decent book that deserves four out of five stars. This book is a first hand account of the war in Iraq, primarily offering great insight into the lives of the Generals of the 101st Airborne Division. The book focuses on all the day to day problems and successes of the high command. Planning and carrying out a war is a big deal. One organizational problem faced before the conflict actually began was the misplacement of the barcode scanner that was supposed to direct shipments leaving the supply ships. The scanner was placed on the third ship causing difficulty unloading the first two ships. In the Company of Soldiers lets you see the constant mental/emotional and physical stress the generals feel. When a helicopter crashes or a battle is not going as planned and troops are killed, General David H. Petraeus admits feeling spikes in his blood pressure. The guerrilla warfare the soldiers encounter is demoralizing and unexpected and leads the generals to question whether or not their battle decisions are correct.This book could have been better if there had been more coverage of the lower ranking soldiers. The author's personal details, such as misplacing his gasmask or being irritated by the dust, could have been left out. Details about how chemical warfare or the effects of the desert climate affected the soldiers would have been more interesting.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to see what is like to be a high commanding officer in the military, but would not read it a second time."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I am a real fan of Rick Atkinson and have read his two books on World War II with great enjoyment. This book, however, was a major disappointment.Atkinson's hatred of the Bush administation and conservative news sources comes through in many places. This is so strong that it colors his view of the events he is narrating. He never seems to understand, nor does he have much contact with the common soldier. This is simply his views of his own experience in the conflict. Most of the time he was in well-protected HQ compounds. He has a jest made in poor taste about having found the \\"weapons of mass destruction\\"; a box of box-cutters.The most interesting and significant part of the book is his positive description of Genral Petreus."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Rick Atkinson was assigned as an embedded reporter with the command element of the 101st airborne division for the 2003 Iraqi war. He spent most of his time with the division commander, general Patraeus and his staff. This is not a chronicle of heavy combat, but an interesting look at what it takes to deploy, supply, and direct a division into combat. There were many problems to be overcome. Sand wrecked equipment, sometimes food and water were in short supply, and the Iraqi soldiers continually changed their methods of attack forcing the US forces to adjust their tactics. The command also had to take advantage of opportunities as they were presented, but be cautious due to the nature of the 101st; light infantry without heavy weapons or armor. Though not on a par with &quot;An Army at Dawn&quot;, it is an insightful look at the responsibilities and decision making processes at the top."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"As with An Army At Dawn, once can see that Atkinson's advanced vocabulary is giving some readers a problem. For those up to the challenge, Atkinson is able to provide vivid descriptions with a minimum of words - though some of those words may make you scramble for the Funk and Wagnall's.Other comments are all valid; this is a very close look at the divisional command staff, with one or two lower level portraits, including a touching one of a sergeant killed in action. It is also a very personal story of Atkinson's own experiences as an imbedded journalist, so there are a couple of different perspectives at play here.Good clear picture of what the 101st was doing in Iraq - viewed from the top."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"As an embedded journalist with the 101st Airborne (\\"Band of Brothers\\" fame), Pulitzer Prize winning correspondent and military historian Richard Atkinson provides a deep look at the Iraq War from the perspective of the American troops. Though the concentration is more on the field grade officers, no one seems to have been left out of this effort. Readers learn how the soldier sees things whether it is equipment and supply shortages or overages (sounds contradictory, but is a big concern) or the individual and group safety in a hostile environs. Mr. Atkinson furbishes insight from the moment the division is called up to leave Fort Campbell to deploy to the desert until the capture of Baghdad when the author returns to the states.Military history buffs will realize that the author salutes the army for their superb efforts to win a war while fighting nature and preventing civilian casualties though not all went well. IN THE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS: A CHRONICLE OF COMBAT is clearly anti this war yet fully supportive of the soldiers that the books raves about as courageous, sincere, and capable. Mr. Atkinson condemns the administration for lack of logistical planning and for its rationale for armed combat (being revised by the winners to we did right removing an abusive dictator; if that was the cause then the administration should have taken that thesis to the American people). Rumsfeld bashing aside, Mr. Atkinson clearly congratulates the deserving 101st with a twenty-one gun salute.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"A huge disappointment. Atkinson is one of the few reporters who actually understand the US military and in this book he totally blows a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.The book is essentially the trials and tribulations of Atkinson as he &quot;embraces the suck&quot; of life in the field while ferociously sucking up to MG David Petraeus whose tolerance for Atkinson's sycophancy results in beatification.During OIF the 101st Airborne moves incredible distances and fights three substantial brigade-level fights. On numerous instances the division receives multiple mission changes in a single day. The war, however, rates only passing commentary that serves as little more than linkage between extensive tete-a-tete conversations Atkinson has with Petraeus, who, in my opinion, doesn't come off as either an unusually gifted or loyal division commander. On several occasions Petraeus predicts dire consequences and at least twice alludes to &quot;eight divisions and eight years&quot; as the solution... the solution the Army Staff forecast for winning the Vietnam War.In short, we learn nothing of the the overall war despite several interviews with LTG Wallace, commander of V Corps, we learn little of the combat operations of the 101st. But we do learn that Atkinson is so cool that he becomes a trusted member of the command group, or in the words he puts in the mouth of then BG Benjamin Freakley, the ADC (O), &quot;You're probably closer to him than anyone in the division.&quot;With a lot more editing and a lot less ego this book could rise to mediocre"},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"It's well written and engrossing at times, but poorly focused. It's strictly a senior level view of the 101st Division's action in the war, the grunt level view is totally absent. In fact, a recently returned veteran who served with the Division during the invasion told me that Atkinson's book was referred to as the \\"Ode to Petraeus\\" by many in the 101st. Atkinson also wastes half the book writing about the deployment preparations in the US and the pre-invasion activities in Kuwait - not very interesting except for the details surrounding the killing of fellow soldiers by a disgruntled Muslim member of the unit. Atkinson further ruins the book by occasionally making shallow and crass comments against the administration and it's rational for war. However, once you get past the negatives, and accept the high level view/analysis contained in the book, it can be informative as you read the comments and military judgements of senior officers. Atkinson also provides some interesting, although limited, observations of Iraqi culture as the 101st plows its way to Baghdad.The problem is that Atkinson fails to capture the soldier level view of the conflict, but can't fully articulate the strategic level. I felt he could have better honored such a renowned fighting unit. Nonetheless, if you're a current or former Screaming Eagle you might find it enjoying."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"As opposed to earlier selections from Atkinson's works, In The Company of Soldiers falls far short as a work of serious historical perspective. Like much of what passes as journalism today, Atkinson's effort seems more preoccupied with conveying his opinion than with informing the reader with an accurate account of the events. With the exception of an overreliance on military parlance, the book is well written and engaging. Regrettably, Atkinson ruins the experience by continually interjecting a few themes that have no place in the book. The first and most annoying is his opinion on the veracity of our current politcal leadership. If Atkinson wants to wax on about the veracity of the President, fine. But do it on Crossfire, not in a chronicle about the 101st Airborne. Second, the reader is apparently supposed to appreciate just how witty he remained throughout the saga. He quotes himself incessantly, often to record the wittiness of his quips for the ages. Finally, the reader cannot escape the clumsy intent of the author to convince us that the soldiers liked him, accepted him, and respected him. Atkinson clearly has multiple agendas, and providing an undistracted, straightforward chronicling of the events is not the primary one. For a noted historian and Pulitzer Prize winner (he reminds us) it is all unbecoming, but unfortunately, among journalism of today, not at all uncommon."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I really liked \\"An Army at Dawn\\" and thought this would be similar but I was WRONG. Of course, buying it for $.01 used should have given me a clue but \\"An Army at Dawn\\" was so good. I really wish that the author had focused on the soliders, their lives, and their experiences since he was right there with them instead of spending 2-3 pages every chapter discussing how the Bush administration lied. Lies or no lies the soliders are in Iraq doing a job we sent them to do and theirs is a compelling story to be told but the author decided to give us his story where these soldiers are nothing more than game pieces in a grand political shell game both his and the administration's. It is amazing to me how the author spent this time with these young man in extremely stressful situations and all he saw was some grand political scheme. I wasted my time so you don't have to waste yours because even at $.01 used, it's not worth it."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Please, Please, PLEASE don't let any more reporters publish books! In the Company of Soldiers, a recent entry by Rick Atkinson is another half-assed, book-length diary by a celebrity wannabe in the role of war correspondent. It has been flogged on NPR and in the liberal press, many examples of which are cited by Atkinson as sources. With Michael Moore's film crockumentary, Fahrenheit 911 forming part of the celluloid leg of this left-wing stool, and NPR the broadcast appendage, continuous doubt-casting has become a subtle tool of the political left, particularly noteworthy in the current pre-election climate. Full of intended irony, In the Company of Soldiers follows a general in the 101st Airborne through the brief and highly decried Iraq war, leaving off with ominous portents of a difficult occupation, in just enough time to miss it and leave the \\"We told you so\\" implicit in the fertile minds of media-steeped readers. Though Atkinson styles himself an historian, In the Company arrives too soon and is too full of self-reference to be taken seriously as history. It may some day be an historic artifact, but none of the neutrality that is a prerequisite of serious history can be found. Instead, the book is an oversized Sunday Magazine piece, long on unnecessary detail and accusation, and short on the dangerous endeavor of deep analysis.Atkinson's writing, breezy in its own way, is overly fond of inapt simile: \\"[Iraqi] women in their billowing black [robes] resembled walking rain clouds,\\" while seemingly nave in its apprehension of the military style, repeatedly mistaking sarcasm in the graffiti he finds at the latrines as a \`cry for help' of the kind so often sought by dew-eyed liberals. In one passage, the author translates FUBAR for the uninitiated, crediting Mogadishu veterans for its coinage, seemingly unaware of it as a commonplace at least in the 60's, one of whose witnesses he appears to have been. Similarly, he steps in to helpfully translate \\"NFS\\" written in the dust on vehicles from a battalion whose official motto was \\"No Slack.\\" In contrast, he later uses a rather oblique expression, comparing the general visiting his men in a school building with a \`ward heeler,' at best a political organizer's insider term for someone who knocks door to door, and at worst, a misspelling (there are enough of these, other malapropisms and editorial mistakes in this hastily published tome) of ward healer, who might be a doctor making rounds. He offers no explanation. In other cases, Atkinson pretends to be down with pop culture, and refers to an Iraqi amusement park locomotive made from a tractor as \\"tricked up [out]\\" in the sense that a set of dope 20\\" rims on a Humvee might turn it hip-hop, also nearly quotes Led Zeppelin lyrics correctly, but fails to notice the close cognation of the town of Iskandariyah and the famed 60's hot-rod cam manufacturer, Ed Iskendarian, who was to cams what Dewey Weber was to surfboards. Withal, the author does give the impression that he spent more \`60's time on Peter, Paul and Mary and Pete Seeger than on Don Garlits and Sox and Martin.True to reporting culture, Atkinson accepts the goodwill of his military hosts throughout his \\"embedment,\\" then snaps like a leashed chihuahua at the Defense Department in his closing chapters, arising John Kerry-like in his war diary as a prescient mind, declaring weapons of mass-destruction \\" [proven] nonexistent,\\" even though purporting to have scribed this work of evenhanded reporting in January, 2004, before any one else had \`proven' the negative. Throughout, Atkinson dwells on the numerous errors that appear continuously in the military execution of this (and any) war, as if to suggest that Futility by Design is either a Bush Administration or at least an institutional mandate of the military. He seems constantly seeking a whiff of conflict between his general and the next higher (or lower) level, as if he is playing a role in a \\"reality TV\\" show, when the fact of his input might likely cause deadly results.Atkinson's personal agenda is eventually fulfilled symbolically by his assigned general's offhanded gift of divisional and combat decorations as mementos of his journalistic adventure. The ghost of Ernie Pyle and others invoked in one scene by the self-absorbed Atkinson should stir uneasily upon his magic mirror fantasy. Those famed war correspondents sought the story of the war, rather than the story of themselves in it and their ideas about it, in a time when it was as much rumor as it was war. In today's diplomatically precarious-instant-gratification-media-infused war-making, the surfeit of witless commentary serves to obscure, rather than illuminate meaning. I shall place my copy of In the Company of Soldiers alongside the abominable The Greatest Generation by the pedantic Tom Brokaw, both cheap attempts at steering the reading public towards dubious social agendae through pseudo-professionalism. One should do better to read the works of Winston Churchill (The World Crisis and The Second World War) and get authentic cant from an actual player rather than drivel from an onlooker with a political agenda."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I picked up this book at the library and glad I didn't pay good money for it. I expected to get an unbiased view of the front lines from the perspective of the normal foot soldier. Instead I got only the perspective from the commanding general, boring. The real combat was miles away. I also got the impression that the author of this book was more than happy to stick his nose up the general's behind and make the impression that the general highly respected him. Maybe so, but I doubt it.Rick makes several factually incorrect statements in this book at the expense of the Bush administration. Rick misses no opportunity to get his digs on the Bush administration. This is ok as long as the information is factual but it isn't.The bottom line is if you want a 10,000 foot view of the war, like to hear someone repeatedly pat himself on the back and hate Bush you'll love this book.

As a military professional, I appreciated his conspicuous respect for the soldiers, officers and enlisted alike, with whom he lived and travelled. Embedding with the 101st Division HQ allowed unique access to the Division's General Officers, which yields an interesting perspective on their leadership styles and concerns sometimes at the expense of what might have been a more comprehensive account. I would give this particular effort 2.5 stars with the main downside being the author's clear and present disdain for the national command authority's decision to go to war in Iraq. I do not argue that the decisions made should not be scrutinized closely, but Mr. Atkinson addresses them only with matter of fact (and mostly contemptuous) comments. I enjoyed his writing enough to find An Army At Dawn in the library and am glad I did."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Atkinson, son of an Army officer, Pulitzer-prize winning military historian, and longtime reporter and editor for the Washington Post, spent two months in early 2003 embedded with the 101st Airborne Division during its deployment to Iraq and the drive to Baghdad. This resulting book is more or less his reporter's diary of that experience (although not, as the title implies, from the perspective of the average grunt). Those expecting the historical breadth and depth of his award-winning An Army At Dawn will have to wait a few decades for the dust to settle and perspective to emerge. Those expecting to be placed in the middle of firefights and intense combat action will be disappointed (they should check out Evan Wright's excellent, though poorly titled work Generation Kill). What Atkinson provides is a workmanlike portrait of a divisional command apparatus, based on his shadowing of Major General David Petraeus and his subordinates in the 101st as they move from Kuwait to Baghdad, with battles at Najaf, Karbala, and Hilla.The book is being widely critiqued on two fronts. One is the limitation of its scope, or rather Atkinson's focus on the divisional leadership. The other is for Atkinson's \\"political bias\\". The first criticism is more or less on target. While it is interesting to see how the command structure works, how field officers have to deal with the layers above them, and how they grapple with the logistical complexities they are presented with, it doesn't make for very exciting reading. In many cases, the officers come across more like mid-level managers of some large corporation, with Petraeus as the COO. Most of the action the unit encounters comes to the reader through the filter of command post radios, or after-action reports. It also doesn't help that none of the officers emerge as individuals with personalities, other than Patraeus, who we are told over and over is ultra-competitive. For much of the book, Atkinson appears to be so flattered to be privy to high-command confidences that he repeats everything verbatim.Still, there are plenty of nuggets of interesting information. For example, Atkinson details the logistics of moving an entire division from its base in Kentucky to Kuwait and highlights the importance of this being a smooth operation. This was especially critical as the civilians at the Defense Dept. forced the Army to jettison it's carefully modeled \\"deployment matrix.\\" Similarly, for anyone interested in Apache helicopters, there's plenty to learn about their limitations in desert and urban environments. There's a section about how the rotors need to be taped or spray painted every few days which is unbelievable! For those interested in modern warfare, he explains how devastating \\"combined arms\\" tactics are and shows how complex they are to employ well. For those interested in intelligence, he shows how despite massive pre-war preparation, and a decade of close satellite surveillance, the Army still didn't have accurate maps showing urban sprawl.The second main critique revolves around Atkinson's personal politics and \\"bias\\" as it appears in the book. Many people seem to want to read about the Gulf War in a vacuum--that is to say, they want to read about what the troops on the ground are doing without any mention of why they are there in the first place. Atkinson dares to try and give some context for why the 101st Airborne is doing in Iraq, but many readers seem not to want to be reminded that (A) why we go to war as a nation is the most important question, and (B) the whys for going to Iraq changed a few times along the way. For the most part Atkinson's \\"leftist political remarks\\" (as one reviewer put it) consist of quoting statements by the president, vice-President, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, et al, and pointing out that they proved not to be true.The whole point of a free press in a democracy is to empower the public through the flow of information, which most definitely includes pointing out when the statements of our leaders bear no relation to reality--especially when it involves going to war, with all the attendant sacrifice that means! I will agree that at times Atkinson gets a little snippy, but he's on the ground with the troops running for his gas mask, while we are sitting safely at home, so I can cut him a little slack. The most hilarious reviewer comment has to be \\"Everyone has a right to their political opinion, but Atkinson should have kept it to himself.\\" In other words, \\"Just tell me what I want to hear, don't tell me anything that might challenge the way I think about the world.\\" It's kind of amazing that people seem to think Atkinson is some hyperventilating peacenik--the guy is enamored of the military! In the end, it's perhaps making a mountain out of molehill, 'cause this book isn't particularly essential reading about the Gulf War anyway. It's worth it if you're really into the 101st, or Apache helicopters, but for the most part, it reads like a stitched-together series of dispatches lacking the perspective of time."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"It's well written and engrossing at times, but poorly focused.

The result is a disappointment but not a total loss.Readers of his previous work will be shocked at the utter lack of depth here. Discussions of tactics and strategy are strictly superficial, and the enlisted soldiers doing the actual shooting are ignored completely. He describes listening to radio communications while companies of men manoeuver under fire , but somehow never finds the time to ask them about the experience.Atkinson repeatedly allows his dislike of the Bush administration to get the best of him, which results in a few really awful cheap shots. At one point he flatly refers to Saddam's WMD as nonexistent. Not unproven, or as-yet undiscovered, or even doubtful, but nonexistent. If, as UN inspectors believe, Saddam did move chemical weapons to Syria before the war, Atkinson has seriously compromised his integrity here. He also recycles the false claim that Bush painted Iraq as &quot;an imminent, existential danger...&quot;. Actually, the President urged action against Iraq BEFORE the threat became imminent. Where's a fact checker when you need one? Atkinson catalogues the losses suffered by American forces during the occupation of Iraq, carefully sending the message that these deaths constitute an indictment of Bush policy. He neglects to mention that many of the terrorists are non-Iraqis fighting to prevent Iraq from becoming a successful democracy. Mr. Atkinson evidently prefers to leave the reader with the impression that the general population of Iraq has rejected the American presence there. This is in keeping with the view of many in the media, but is sharply at odds with the firsthand reports of many American soldiers serving in Iraq.Atkinson's writing skills are quite good, and he paints an interesting portrait of the talented, driven Major General David Petraeus. There is also a fairly good &quot;you are there&quot; quality as he describes his own experiences and reactions.Don't pay full price for this book. If you can borrow one or find a cheap used copy it's a decent light read. Just hold your nose when he goes into BBC mode."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I listened to this audio book.I agree that most of this book is with the Generals and not the ones doing the fighting.

This book lets us know what our service men and women have to go through to provide our protection."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Told in the familiar Rick Atkinson style which we appreciated in \\"An Army at Dawn,\\" but this time with the sharpened insight of the author's first hand involvement, \\"In the Company of Soldiers\\" brings the Iraq campaign of the 101st Airborne to life. The author's ability to draw apt comparisons to similar situations and conditions faced by our fathers in North Africa during WWII brings a rich sense of history and perspective. We see that the familiar black humor of our warriors is something in the American genes which will never fade.Strange how long ago this initial round of \\"major combat\\" seems. \\"Unexpected\\" consequences cast a long shadow. The understated and dignified Afterword reminds us that military planners had predicted U.S troop levels would drop to 30,000 by September 2003. Hopefully the old adage that what does not break us only makes us stronger will apply to today's Armed Forces. More than a few of us cringe at the phrase \\"broken force\\" which occasionally comes up these days.The descriptions of both Lieutenant General Wallace and Major General Petraeus are nothing short of inspirational, and bring to mind the strength of character and blunt-spoken manners of General Grant.To me at least, General Eric Shinseki has emerged as the most exemplary general of the entire story. His warning, \\"Beware the twelve-division strategy for a ten-division Army,\\" reminds us of his professional insight and personal courage. If General Shinseki were heading off to the State Department or the World Bank today, we would be sending a message to the world that we learn from history. Instead, we await more of the unexpected while we ponder new strategies to recruit more brave young men. Atkinson's quote of Machiavelli hits home -- \\"Wars begin where you will, but they do not end where you please.\\""},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"This is a superior piece of embed reportage from the second Iraq war. Atkinson has been connected with things military since childhood, so thankfully there is no arrogant media ignorance on display, as in some books by other reporters I've read recently. There are no \\"on location from under the Humvee\\" dispatches, as mocked by warbloggers at the time.He keeps his own firmly inside-the-beltway liberal opinions mostly to himself throughout. Here and there he does imply that the U.S. is to blame for the suffering of the Iraqi people under the fraudulent UN Oil-For-Food program; he baldly labels the pretexts for the war a \\"delusion\\"; and he hints that the war is all just about oil. Of course, if that were the case, we could have imitated the French and just cut similarly lucrative and shameful deals with Saddam, instead of going to war for it. But as I said, his professionalism is foremost in these pages. It's a work of solid reportage, not polemic.Atkinson focuses on the top command of the division. This is not as thrilling as a troopers-eye-view account might be, but it is actually more illuminating. Like good commanders, the leaders of the 101st Airborne Division plan their logistics carefully, so we get a lot of background information on the battle. Thus, the narrative lingers over the mini-quagmire of that spring, whereas the onrushing offensive operations seem to come to us from a distance. The whole division itself is seldom present in this book, except in a couple of panorama scenes, viewed from the air or the side of the road.The central figure, Major General David Petraeus is drawn as a squared-away natural leader who thinks out loud a lot, solicitous of the welfare of the troops, nudging his officers along with an even but no-nonsense manner, and driving himself unsparingly. Atkinson at times comes across as Petraeus's amanuensis. His staff is expertly portrayed, from the bluff General Sinclair to the go-getter Col. Joseph Anderson.Special Forces soldiers make cameo appearances throughout the book. With their beards and bill caps, they project a grungy, Joe Cool nonchalance. Whenever Atkinson encounters them, they are lounging in intersections with their Toyota technicals, their secret work unseen.Atkinson relays a few of his own pratfalls, portraying himself as the FNG tenderfoot in the camp. In one instance he can't find his gas mask until a soldier finds it at Atkinson's feet, whereupon the all clear sounds.At the end, Baghdad falls with a whimper, the 101st goes into occupation mode, and many of the principals rotate out. Atkinson confesses to the emotional attachment that has grown up between him and the Screaming Eagles. He feels capable of writing about the men and their experiences objectively, but knows that he will be heartbroken whenever he hears of fatalities from the 101st. His objectivity is admirable; his reportage is enriching; and his esteem for these men is infectious. Mission accomplished."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Although I haven't read any other books by Rick Atkinson, I have no doubt that he is an excellent writer, but in this case, he let his personal feelings of disdain for the Bush administration overshadow his professionalism. In some cases, for instance the latrine grattiti, he purposely distorts the attitudes of our military troops to make his point \\"that President Bush deceived the American public.\\" He had a unique opportunity to really show what it is like to be an American soldier in combat, but he fell short. I say this because I've spent over 20 years in the US Military and have been very heavily involved for the past three years with Operation Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. The troops out here have been and still are very excited about helping the Iraqis to share the same freedoms we have in America. Many of the troops I deal with daily volunteer to extend because they feel they're making a difference and they enjoy the challenges of the combat environment."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Having read Atkinson's brilliant book on the war in North Africa in WW II I was very much looking forward to this book. Sadly, this effort is a great disappointment.The book reflects Atkinson's time as an embedded Washing Post reporter with the 101t Airborne Division in Iraq during the early phases of the war there. Although the title would have one believe that this is a book about the ordinary soldier, that's a bit deceiving. In actuality, most of Atkinson's time was spent with Divisional Command. There is much more on the command aspects of the war than there is on the actual experiences of the foot soldiers. Atkinson certainly couldn't help where he was imbedded, but what develop such a misleading title when it doesn't fit the content.Having said all that, the actual reporting (and that's what this tract amounts to-first party reporting) is very good. The insights into the command structures, process and procedures of a combat unit on the move are fascinating. To the extent that Atkinson actually does report on the experiences of the men in the field, he does his usual excellent job ob bringing the experience to life in a most visceral way. From big picture issues to the irritating hassles that make up life on the move as a combat soldier, Atkinson has a unique ability to render them so as to genuinely reflect the nature of those experiences.Unfortunately, Atkinson also injects a lot of his own political philosophy and opinion into the text. Surely he's entitled to his opinion. In point of fact, a introduction that clearly states his positions and attitudes would have been fine-it would have satisfied his apparent nee to vent as well as providing the reader of a \\"head's up\\" to his bias so we could be ready for it insofar as it colored his reporting. As it is, his political meanderings are intrusive and detract from the book in general. Some have found Atkinson's opinions offensive. While I don't necessarily agree with him I'm not offended. It's just that all this ranting is immaterial vis-&agrave;-vis the object of the undertaking.Another problem is that the book lacks substantive overview. I see no reason why Atkinson couldn't have interjected some indications of how the actions of the 101st related to the wider war in general. Granted, the intent was to focus on the 101st but having insight as to how the experiences of other units impacted the 101st and how the actions of the 101st impacted the ward in general would have been a significant addition to the text.Atkinson's An Army at Dawn was one of the-if not the-best war books I ever read. This falls way, way short of that effort."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I think what most people here are having difficulty with is Rick Atkinson's change from a historian to a journalist. As someone who frequently finds it difficult to make it through a history book, I found this first hand account much more accessible and enrapturing than a third hand account would have been. While I admire the loyalty of Mr. Atkinson's readers who purchased this book expecting a repeat performance of An Army at Dawn, I think that they did not realize that Mr. Atkinson's writings as a reporter naturally vary from his writings as a historian. He purposely used a different writing style due to the fact that he was located directly in the battle rather than researching it. As to people's objections to his personal commentary and opinions on the matter, I feel that once again, they expected a third hand historical account. Obviously if he is speaking to his audience in the first person, which I believe he does very well, he is going to offer his opinion. The book is a personal account-not a history book. I was extremely captivated with Mr. Atkinson's recount of his experiences and admire how multifaceted his writing talents are. I would highly recommend this book, especially to readers who are interested in the war in Iraq and want a personal account of what it was like to be in the middle of the action. While I found some of Mr. Atkinson's previous books somewhat daunting due to his voracious appetite for difficult vocabulary words I was very pleased with the accessibility of this book and his ability to describe the action in eloquent yet informative language."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Atkinson's book was a disapointment. The obligatory Bush bashing at the start, seeming to be an apology to other journalists for daring write something positive about the miltary. It's just so very forced and obvious. Additionally Atkinson seems to center on those officers in the command that open up with him on matters frankly they should, in keeping with military discipline not comment on. Why should an X.O. give a journalist, one who is against the very mission itself, their opinion on the commanding officer? That's just not done.Beyond a Bob Woodward's style of rewarding those who cooperate with him, Atikinson heaps praise on those who agree with him. Of the commanding officer of the 101, he basically says, that he is smarter than most military types in that he is of a liberal bent.Atkinson rarely seems to go beyond his own conditions to actually discuss the war itself. Everything he reports on has a self centered focus that is so very boring when compared to the events he is in the middle of.Atkinson plays defense lawyer for the soldier accused of throwing genades into a tent of sleeping officers. The time he spends on the alledged reasons why the soldier did what he did stands in contrast to the almost whispered in passing comment on the capture of Saddam.In all I found this to be a biased and even of greater offense, a very boring book."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"In The Company of Soldiers is a look at the life of soldiers just before and during the onset of the Iraq War. His viewpoint is that of a civilian journalist embedded with the US Army. A very readable book, it takes the reader along for the bumpy ride. The writer has a good sense of humor, noting the differences in uniform, food, etc. among the member nations of the coalition armies. One of those members is supposed to be Micronesia; the author never did see their army... If you want to ride along with the army as it enters Iraq for the first time, learn what it looked, smelled and tasted like to be out in a sandstorm, and live in a large tent with no privacy, this book is a good introduction. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I support our troops and our military leaders in their efforts and was hoping for an unbiased and insightful reflection of the events leading up to (and the military tactics -- good and bad -- of) the second war in Iraq. What worked and what didn't. What we might do better next time. Instead what I got was the gushing wide-eyed public relations blather of a \\"journalist\\" who is totally in thrall of whatever he is told by his handlers, who praises the capabilities of military hardware: \\"The FEARSOME Apache helicopter, that can strike with PINPOINT accuracy at targets that are more than FIVE MILES AWAY,\\" and a book that is surprisingly inaccurate far more often than such a book has a right to be.For example, in an off-handed comment made almost in passing, the author mentions the shoot-down of a Patriot missile that \\"misfired\\" and shot down an RAF Tornado jet. This is totally incorrect and a shameful comment on what actually happened. The Patriot missiles did not \\"misfire.\\" Anyone who followed the Iraq War (or who knows how to use Google or even Wikipedia to do a simple news search about a historical event) would know that Patriot missiles at that time were regularly identifying phantom targets where there were none and frequently locking-on to friendly coalition aircraft. This was a *known* error of the system -- which the author glosses over quickly so he can get back to praising the \\"shock and awe\\" tactics he rhapsodizes over in his grandiose prose.There are dozens of errors but this one is totally inexcusable, especially since a Patriot launch killed a U.S. F-18 pilot (30-year-old U.S. Navy Lt. Nathan White of Abilene, TX) just ten days after the friendly fire RAF Tornado shoot-down on April 2, 2003. There's no way Rick Atkinson could have NOT known about this trend except for the author's selective reporting and shoddy fact-checking that is emblematic throughout this book.We should support our soldiers and our military leaders who did as best they could under the circumstances with so many limitations they had imposed on them: (a lack of body armor, few up-armored Humvees, not enough troops, rifles that jammed, and on and on). But \\"In The Company of Soldiers\\" lacks a single sober page of reflection about the conflict and what lessons might be learned for the benefit of future soldiers and tacticians, let alone those who shape foreign policy. For a better history of this era, its decision-makers, and the topic overall, check out Sebastian Junger's deserving best-seller \\"WAR.\\" Even with your 2004 publication date there's no excuse, Rick."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Award winning author Rick Atkinson has produced an impressive story of the many considerations a modern commander must endure in order to lead a successful campaign.If nothing else, many readers should be interested in this account due to the close personal account of then Major General David Patraeus. Atkinson was an embedded journalist with the 101st Airborne Division, which Patraeus commanded at the beginning of the war. Patraeus deals effectively with issues ranging from changing leadership directives to logistical delays i9n moving his unit from FT Campbell, KY, to Kuwait for the initial invasion.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"A gifted journalist and military historian of the first order, Atkinson provides a stellar narrative account of the March 2003 invasion of Iraq. Division and brigade-level operations are illuminated in this book as the author is embedded with the division headquarters and is thus able to gain virtually unrestricted access to 101st Airborne (Air Assault) decision-makers at the tip of the spear.Focusing most of his attention on General David H. Petraeus, the Screaming Eagles' charismatic and highly respected commander during the invasion, Atkinson offers a rare glimpse into the many and varied challenges of contemporary battle command at the operational and tactical levels of war. For this alone the book is an immensely fascinating read.But what makes In the Company of Soldiers so interesting is it offers an insider's view into the early thinking of an outstanding general officer who history will likely regard as one of the greatest battlefield leaders of his generation. To his considerable intellect and unparalleled grasp of counterinsurgency warfare, Petraeus adds his empathy for the Iraqi people. At one point the author quotes Petraeus saying [upon gaining control of Al Hilla], \\"We want to be a benevolent and humble presence.\\"We realize then that Petraeus understood even during the initial invasion the importance of \\"the soft knock\\" in winning Iraqi hearts and minds and ultimately in defeating the insurgency. Securing the Iraqi people eventually provides the foundation for the current surge strategy which has proven particularly effective in the fractious, sectarian neighborhoods of Baghdad.It is becoming increasingly evident that Petraeus will be remembered for his leadership of Coalition Forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom as General Matthew B. Ridgeway is remembered for his leadership of UN forces during the Korean War. Like Ridgeway, Petraeus recognized upon assuming command of Multi-National Forces-Iraq that he had to restore soldiers' confidence in themselves. He also determined that the only way to break the back of the insurgency was to reorient ground forces to true counterinsurgency warfare. His superior leadership has clearly meant the difference in the Iraq War.Petraeus has quite effectively employed the right combination of offensive operations targeting Al Qaeda and other radical elements with stability and reconstruction operations.In the Company of Soldiers also documents the 101st's struggles in the invasion to include the war's most serious fragging incident to date. Perhaps most noteworthy, Atkinson's writing puts readers directly in the middle of the action. Along with the key players we experience the challenges of waging modern war in the harsh, unforgiving desert conditions of Iraq. We readers quickly realize that there are limitations to the high tech tools of war (e.g., Apache helicopters) in America's mighty arsenal.We also learn that combat units of the 101st seem to be at their best on the battlefield when they return to the basic elements of tactical fire and maneuver.Atkinson does come in for criticism for his second-guessing of the Bush Administration. The author is at the top of his game when he captures the essence of the distinguished military leaders who figure most prominently in his historical accounts. Petty, meaningless digressions that second-guess our country's political leaders detract from Atkinson's artful depiction of modern warfare and are better left for the editorial pages.Nevertheless, In the Company of Soldiers offers a great account of contemporary battle command!"},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Atkinson was a stafsf writer and senior editor at The Washington Post for 20 years. He has written several other books. This one recounts his experience as an embedded journalist with the 101st Airborne Division in Iraq.In particular, Atkinson follows Major General David Petraeus, commanding general of the 101st. His subject is perhaps his misfortune. Atkinson's view is both from the top down and the peripherary, since the 101st was employed primarily in a supporting role.The overall result is a portrait of a commanding general with a broader overview of the entire Iraq campaign grafted to it. The book is well-written, interesting but ultimately unsatisfying in some ways. There is little feeling of the struggle inherent to any military campaign and essentially no connection with the individual soldiers fighting the war. This definitely is not Ernie Pyle.Atkinson, unfortunately, mars this pedestrian account with the seemingly mandatory &quot;told you so&quot; about the aftermath of the campaign. His critique seems a bit strained and out of place in a book that is ostensibly about the campaign itself.That said, reading &quot;In The Company Of Soldiers&quot; left me eager to read &quot;An Army At Dawn,&quot; Atkinson's history of the campaign in North Africa. I think, frankly, that may be a better canvas for his skills.Jerry"},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"It is a shame that such a reverred and accomplished outfit as the 101st had the misfortune of getting Atkinson as an embed. I bought the book expecting to read about their experience in battle. Instead, the story is mostly a behind-the-scenes accounting.But worst of all, Atkinson uses the book to espouse his negative views of the Bush administration, inserting little pot-shots here and there. Perhaps he needed to do this to maintain his employment with the Post. It certainly improved his chances of an interview with NPR--which he got. But it's a smear on the legacy of the 101st to be associated with such vitriol.In the future, Atkinson should partner with the likes of Howard Dean or Michael Moore, not the courageous patriots of the 101st."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"My expectations of this book was to read about a journalist following a military unit and documenting the soldiers daily lives during the war. I actually have the audio book version, but I could not even finish the first cd.About 10 minutes in, I hear the author say something negative about Bush and the War. It was a little out of place, but kept on listening. I said to myself, if he does that again I will have to stop listening. I just want to hear facts about the military and their efforts, not subjective opinions from the author.Another 10 minutes in, the author says something like, - then the US military planes cornered and \\"butchered\\" the Iraqi soldiers. I was done! I hit eject and that was that.Again, my expectations were different so others may like the book and his views, but it was not what I was expecting."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I was looking for front line accounts of the American foot soldier engaging the enemy on battle but this book is not it. This guy is hanging around on the Iraq campaign with generals, having a global picture of the battle field but out of touch with details of what is happening in the front lines, arriving to cities after the battle is over.I guess it's a good book to understand part of the making decision process of some generals as the war is being executed, with information on what is happening on the front lines equivalent to the one reported by CNN at the time."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Absolutely the worse book on war I have ever read. The author goes on incessantly about himself, how smart he is, his education, his experience, how smart he is to get in on the embedded program, how smart he is to get assigned to a general, etc, etc, etc. Nothing about the character of soldiers, their experience, the Iraqi people, zip, nada. How the general was always seeking him to talk to out of all the reporters. Jibe after jibs at the \\"Bush administration\\", let's you know the man has a bit of a bias against the administration and doesn't believe in the reasons outlined for why we went in. Not one mention of fighting Al Queda in Iraq, which most of the other books I've read talked about extensively. Many snide comments about our combat soldiers.Bottom line, nothing constructive to say here, move along."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"This book is more about Mr. Atkinson's political feelings about the war then how the war was fought and executed by the soldiers on the ground. There is very little description of combat. Rather, a great deal of time is spent describing the poor living conditions and political commentary. From the description of graffiti on the latrine wall, to box cutters found in an Iraqi warehouse the author never misses an opportunity to make a political statement."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"As usual, Atkinson writes a riveting story. His style is the type that keeps me up late into the night. This is a very readable and informative account of Operation Iraqi Freedom from the vantage point of the 101st Division Staff. Good coverage of the progress of the war, if a bit brief. I would recommend this book. My concern is, it appeared to me, as a reader of all of Atkinson's books, that he was trying to attain some level of credibility with the &quot;Liberal Establishment&quot; by tossing out random pot shots at President Bush. My concern was validated, when, a few days after I finished reading the book, NPR News gave him a prime time interview (a plug) as an expression of approval. In any case, good book and I look forward to his next."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"The title of the book fooled me, instead of the grunts on the ground and in the tanks, this book follows the commander of the 101st airborne, General Petraeus. Of course, generals are &quot;soldiers&quot; too, but the title is deceiving. The few comments from the common soldier are overheard in the chow hall or in the toilet line.Atkinson is a great writer and was given unprecedented access to key leaders. He's in the command tent, flying around in the command helicopter, and sleeping in tents with other generals on the staff. The access did not taint Atkinson's coverage, as he doesn't pull any punches in his critique of the generals.The book has 3 basic phases:1. The build-up. The 101st airborne had to move from base to an airbase and across to Kuwait, and then had the agonizing wait for their equipment to arrive by sea. At times, despite Atkinson's great storytelling ability, this section drags, as he likely had lots of time to write but little of interest to write about. In every chapter, Atkinson weaves in his political perspective, which can get annoying.2. The early drive/fly in. The 101st moves quickly to its bases deep inside Iraq, and everything goes well for a while. Unfortunately, at least for the story, the 101st is left out of most of the action, due to weather/wind and a setback by another helicopter unit that gets badly shot-up. However, the book picks up the pace, as Atkinson drops the political commentary and tells it like it was, with no hindsight. The generals are concerned that the war could last for months and question the usefulness of attack helicopters.3. The attack towards Baghdad. The action picks up as the 101st is involved in clearing some towns, and there are interesting accounts of combined arms to clear streets without damaging historic monuments or injuring civilians. However, there is little explanation of how the general moved from &quot;this could last for months&quot; to being over in weeks. As in the first section, the political commentary appears again.Overall, the book provides a fresh perspective from a few key generals without hindsight. However, the book is not up to Atkinson's lofty standard set by &quot;An Army at Dawn&quot;. There are plenty of cliches, such as what the soldiers carried into battle. Even more annoying than the political commentary is the listing of the daily challenge/password, he must have mentioned at least 15. In the end, Atkinson's storytelling and access make the book worthwhile, but other books like &quot;The March Up&quot; provides a better feel for combat with the &quot;soldiers&quot; on the ground."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"No matter what your feelings are about the Iraq war, there's no doubt that the men who were on the ground (and still are, for the most part) conducted themselves with great elan. Rick Atkinson, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of AN ARMY AT DAWN, took a break from writing the second book of the series to spend time with the 101st Airborne Division in Iraq, embedded for the Washington Post. His new book, IN THE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS, chronicles his time with the division. While I found it an interesting book, I feel that it doesn't give what is promised. Along with that, Atkinson periodically throws out some personal opinions in the middle of his reporting that I thought didn't go with the aim of the book (the story of a division in combat).Atkinson has shown that he is a great writer who can really put the reader at the center of the action. He doesn't pull any punches in this book either, vividly describing the dust and the blowing sand that literally covers everything. You can almost feel your own voice get raspy along with the soldiers as if you also suffer from the &quot;Kuwait crud.&quot; Atkinson spent most of his time with General Patraeus, commander of the division, which allows him to show us all of the briefings and strategy sessions each day. He gives us a great picture of Patraeus, who is facing his first combat command, showing us his uncertainty and determination. When the first problems hit (mainly the weather, but also unforeseen Iraqi resistance, he begins to wonder at the estimate that this will be a quick war. We also see his exhilaration when Iraqi resistance collapses after a couple of weeks of hard fighting.As good a job as Atkinson does in his portrait of Patraeus, it brings up the main problem with IN THE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS. It spends too much time with the higher-ups and not enough time with the men in the field. I understand that Atkinson had no real choice who he was embedded with, and that if he had been placed with the front-line troops, this book would have been about them. However, the title (IN THE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS) and the description of the book makes it out to be much more &quot;on the ground&quot; then it ends up being. Most of the time the war is told through a series of reports. It's interesting to see the agonizing in the control tent, but we don't get much of a feel for the men themselves. During the lead-up to the battle, we do get a bit more of this, but even then the book is lacking input from the men &quot;down in the trenches.&quot; We hear of the logistical problems faced by trying to get the division ready for battle at much too short notice, but we feel removed even from those as we hear how they affected Atkinson and the commanders more than how they affected the men. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it isn't what I was sold when I saw it at the bookstore.The value of the book is hearing some of the internal military opinions of what is going on, especially some of their thought processes as they are told some monumentally stupid things (like the fact that they'll be out of Iraq within 6 months). While much of the action in the book simply seems like a retread of newspaper articles during the war itself, it's this behind the scenes stuff that was neat. We hear about the logistics of helicopter rotor-blades and (potentially deadly) discussion of whether to use paint or tape to cover the ends in order to protect from the gritty sand. This is the kind of detail I loved about the book, and Atkinson does a good job of covering it all. We hear the soldiers' views on the whole thing, which is the usual cynical outlook that allows men to handle this sort of situation. No matter what they're feelings are about their circumstances, they are all determined to do their jobs to the best of their abilities.This brings up my other small problem with the book. It is very easy to see that Atkinson was against this war. Every once in a while, he inserts his opinion into the narrative, either with a side remark or a few paragraphs of lecture. His Afterword is more of the same, written in January 2004 with a lot of hindsight. Some of his feeling in this section is understandable, because while only two 101st men died in the war itself, a great number of men who he had come to know (at least to have spoken to once or twice) have died since he left Iraq. He thinks it has all been for nothing. While the Afterword is acceptable to me, I felt that his editorial comments in the middle of the book were uncalled for. He is writing the story of this division in the battle for Iraq. He is not writing a history of the war itself. He is not writing a treatise about whether or not this war was a good thing. He's writing about men in battle. It's fine if he's reporting the feelings of the soldiers, but I felt that his comments again went against the spirit of the book that I was led to believe this was. I have nothing against what he said (whether or not I agree with them), but I don't think he chose the proper venue. Many books have been (and will be) written on the subject of whether or not this war was a good one. This was not such a book.Overall, I did enjoy reading IN THE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS. I enjoyed reading the background to the war, something that I hadn't read before. I just wish that it had been what it advertised.David Roy"},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"If you are a military history buff, you will love this book. If not, it might be the right time to take a plunge into the subject. This account of military history is about Operation Iraqi Freedom. While justifications for the recent war between the American-British coalition forces and Saddam Hussein's Iraqi regime are still being debated among politicos and the general public, the facts are that it did occur, American and British soldiers died and were wounded, a brutal dictator was toppled, and we watched the whole event play itself out on live television. Now the Iraqi people have been given the opportunity to rebuild a country in their own image and likeness.Rick Atkinson, a former staff writer and senior editor at The Washington Post and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author, has written a journal of his experiences in the Iraqi conflict, beginning on the morning of February 26, 2003 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, home of the famous &quot;Screaming Eagles,&quot; the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army. After a couple of days of orientation, Atkinson and dozens of other journalists were flown to the Middle East. Thereafter, he lived with the 101st Airborne Division from their preparations in Kuwait to the occupation of Baghdad -- a period of almost two months -- and was granted complete access to the commanders and troops.&quot;In the Company of Soldiers&quot; is Atkinson's very up-close and personal story of the war, in which he details every aspect of the conflict from planning and debriefings with the commanders, to his accounts of the battles the soldiers fought, to his sometimes intimate stories about the soldiers involved. It is an eyewitness account, occasionally laced with sadness and disappointment, occasionally with joy and pride. But more than that, it is also the story of one man, Major General David H. Petraeus, commander of the 101st Airborne Division, a modern warrior who was described once by a colleague as &quot;the most competitive man on the planet.&quot;The author spent much of his time in Iraq alongside Petraeus, who finished near the top of his 1974 class at West Point, and was known then as a &quot;striver to the max.&quot; No ordinary soldier by any means, Petraeus had received a doctorate in international relations from Princeton University and for twenty-five years had been through various command and staff assignments, including tours in Haiti and Bosnia. Now he was commanding the &quot;Screaming Eagles,&quot; a force of 17,000 troops, in a war in a forlorn and desolate desert environment, testing both his physical and mental skills. Atkinson, sitting in on the daily briefings as the division's attacks were planned, watches as Petraeus wrestles with numerous tactical enigmas and observes as the general instructs, motivates, and leads his soldiers and subordinate commanders in several intense engagements.While describing this stressful and anxious journey into and during war, Atkinson introduces the reader to many other heroes of the combat, from Lt. General William Wallace, commander of V Corps, to Brig. Generals Ben Freakley and Edward Sinclair, assistant division commanders respectively for operations and support, Col. Mike Linnington of the 3rd Brigade, a number of CWOs who pilot the helicopters used in the battles, and, of course, that ordinary brave soldier on the ground whose job it is to do the job and often be irreverent when speaking about it. Our nation should be proud of them.Even though I was on a deadline to complete another project, I read the entire book in two days because I had difficulty putting it aside. This is a firsthand account of war. It is a vivid picture of a remarkable group of soldiers and commanders. It reads more like a suspense novel than a nonfiction work narrating actual events. Atkinson's writing-style is what I call &quot;facile and friendly,&quot; that is, easy on the eye and the mind, so much so that the story stays in the forefront rather than the sentence structure. And yet the details he provides are worthy of a scholarly work. In fact, the writing is so well done it's like a &quot;motion picture in the mind,&quot; something I don't say about many books.There are other things I really like about the book besides the writing style. One is the presentation of two maps at the front of the book (The Iraqi Battleground and Route of the 101st Airborne Division) which allows the reader to follow the movements of the 101st Airborne Division in Iraq; the maps are particularly helpful for those of us unfamiliar with the geography of that part of the world. I found myself constantly referring to them as the story unfolded, in fact so much so that I finally put a paper clip on the page so I could access them faster. Also valuable are the schematic which helps to identify the command structure of V Corps and the glossary of military jargon. Without the latter, I wouldn't have known an OGA from a DCU from an ASR. Still another plus is that the index of topics is very detailed.I highly recommend this book to you whether you are interested in military history or not. You will not be disappointed. This is still ongoing history and a knowledge of how we got to this point in the situation seems to me to be important. Many of us watched this story unfold on television. Now we have the chance to read the book. True, this is the reverse of the usual situation -- read the book, then see the movie -- but television coverage, in retrospect, did not really provide us with the up-close and personal experience that Rick Atkinson provides us in this superbly written account of a most significant contemporary military conflict."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Atkinson's book is far more about his experience as an embedded reporter than a work of military history. There is virtually no discussion of tactics, and his contact was limited mostly to the division commander and his staff, with little input from the soldiers on the point of the spear. This book does not approach the standard of An Army At Dawn.By contrast, The March Up explains how the Marines actually fought the Iraqis, and is more about the Marine infantrymen than about the author or the brass."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I gave this book only two stars. Don't get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with the book per se. Atkinson is an excellent journalist and a competent Military Historian, with impressive credentials. I was disappointed because I bought the book thinking I was going to read the equivalent of Mark Bowden's BLack Hawk Down, taking place this time on an Iraqi scenario. After all, the sub-title of In The Company of Soldiers is: A Chronicle of Combat. And that it is, except at a strategical level. The book devotes many pages to describe generals' personalities and military operations at large. I found very little devoted to the grunts' EXPERIENCE of actual combat. The book does not smell like gun-powder, but of desert sand and of the uncomfortable life and maddening frustrations (I loved that quote \\"Embrace the suck\\") of the 101's camp life and logistics.In conclusion, I wish the book would have devoted the same amount of pages to the tactical aspect of combat (patrols, convoys, fire fights) than it did to a larger than life figure, General Petraeus, the awesome Commander of the 101st."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said this is more aptly titled, \\"In the Company of Generals,\\" though I would add \\"and Colonels.\\" Unlike Thunder Run or The March Up, few battles are narrated from the perspective of the soldier actually doing the fighting. This is not a criticism of the book, just a notice to the prospective reader. What Atkinson does well is write about the Commanders of the 101st Airborne, and their travels, travels, and accomplishments from preparing for war through the Gulf War itself.The sheer logistical nightmare of preparing for a war thousands of miles from one's base is captured in the big picture and through anecdotes, such as the vigorous disagreement about whether to tape or paint helicopter blades to protect them from the sand. After heated discussion and much agonizing, it was discovered there was no tape. Paint would have to suffice. By spending time with the Commanding General of the 101, as well as his logistics and other officers, Atkinson does an excellent job of conveying the size of the logistical challenge faced by the 101st (and, no doubt, other U.S. divisions) and the magnitude of the accomplishment in meeting it.As the war itself unfolds, Atkinson does a decent job of helping us understand how the 101st' mission changes to meet the realities of combat. The reader may be (as I was) distracted by continuous petty attacks on President Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld, and even Fox News. They are so ancillary to his point that they serve no purpose other to offend, or at the very least distract. Though Atkinson may try to place them in a bigger context, it's pretty transparent he is searching for his own voice among the facts at his disposal (like when he singles out a negative comment written in a bathroom stall about President Bush as somehow representative of troop morale and opinions on the war).Overall, an excellent discussion about preparing for war, a good discussion of the 101st' role in that war as seen from its Commanders, but distracting and petty political potshots taken throughout."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I've read other books by Atkinson, which were great. This one though well written from an English literature point of view, is BORING. Sorry. I read the whole thing waiting to get really interested, but it never happened. Following the Divisional HQ around isn't much different than reading about corporate america. Not why I read military oriented books. Look at others. Too many other great books out there to read. Pick wisely; not this."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Rick Atkinson has two Pulitzers on his desk, and three bestselling books of military history (prior to this one) on his desk, so it was interesting to see what he would do and who he would write about in this book. Given that the author is currently writing a book on World War II, it shouldn't come as a surprise to many readers that his book on the Iraq War, this time, would concentrate on a division commander and his immediate subordinates. The author's obviously using this experience to learn something about how the subjects of his World War II book dealt with the issues involved in combatting the Germans.Atkinson wound up with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), a storied formation that fought in Normandy, Holland, and most famously the Battle of the Bulge, where it was surrounded and the temporary division commander famously replied to a German surrender demand by saying \\"Nuts.\\" The current commander is a fitness fanatic named David Petraeus, who has a degree in international relations, a razor-sharp intellect, and zero tolerance for mistakes by subordinates. Atkinson follows him around during the first several weeks of the war, observing how he runs his division, how they fight, and what they're intending to do at any particular time.The result is a mishmash of interesting and mundane things, with a great deal of personal experience thrown in. Atkinson repeatedly loses personal items (he seems to particularly have difficulties with his gasmask and kit, important in a war in which it's assumed the enemy will use chemicals), spends a lot of time talking with various soldiers, and describes the living conditions they endured during the campaign. This leads to a number of priceless anecdotes: the soldiers unloading a truck while singing \\"Take this job and shove it\\"; the National Guardsman who has a rather humorous and critical view of the advertising slogan of the organization he belongs to; one of Petraeus' brigade commanders telling Atkinson that he's had enough of the division commander's jogging, and he'll see him on the basketball court, instead; everyone at one point covered in mud during a sandstorm into which rain falls. This is the best part of the book, and it illuminates the campaign and the setbacks the army suffered during the early stages.The politics are what you'd expect from a Washington Post reporter, but they're not central to the narrative, and are presented almost as asides, apart from the main plot. Bush of course lied to the public, and tricked everyone into going to war (as Jay Leno pointed out the other night, if Bush is so stupid, and he tricked the Democrats into voting for the war, what does that say about *their* intelligence?) and Rumsfeld compounded things by trying to fight the war \\"on the cheap\\" without committing the proper forces to win it quickly (though they did anyway). Atkinson gives credit to the men on the ground for pulling out the situation when the forces were spread pretty thin, but it reality things were never that close anyway: the Iraqi army melted into oblivion without much of a fight.This paperback edition has a brief afterword covering the period since the publication of the hardback. The author continues his trend of disparaging those who committed the troops to war, while honoring those who serve.This is an interesting book for its view of the role of a division commander, his duties, the difficulties involved in his job, and of course the character of the particular leader examined here. You do have to discount the politics involved, but since they're peripheral to the main subject of the book it shouldn't be too hard to ignore them."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"This book is really a very well written diary of the author'sexperience with the 101st Airborne Division in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The book focuses on the commanders of the Division with not as much written about the common soldier. It certainly gives an insight to what modern warfare is like from a general's point of view in a horrible environment. The author has a very annoying habit of periodically using uncommon words. Its nice to know that his vocabulary rivals that of William F. Buckley, but these oddball nouns and adjectives often slows the flow of the story. This book is not as good as \\"An Army at Dawn\\" and I would not give it as a gift, but it is worth the time to read it."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"While many people expect a book written about a war topic to be an academic tome that discusses dry things like tactics, or to be a post-war propaganda piece, this book is neither. Where this book is strong is in its human side--we see the people in the war, not the war with people in it.The writing is strong, and the book maintains a fast pace. It's entertaining, because it looks at the situation and the people involved. At times, you can almost feel the desert sand in your teeth.Atkinson adds wit to observation, and provides us with an insider's view of the 101st Airborne Division of the US Army during its mission in Iraq. While Major General (two-star) Petraeus is de facto the star of the book (and he's pretty much a force of nature in his own right), Atkinson skillfully gives others--both above and below Petraeus in command--a voice. There are no cardboard caricatures and no bit players. It's not a book about a general or handful of officers commanding legions of storm troopers or faceless soldiers. Everyone is important. Atkinson shows this with distinctly personal quotes--sometimes hilarious ones--from people at all levels in the 101st.We get into the spirit of the 101st, pick up the lingo, and learn a significant amount about the military very early--and very easily--in the book. I like that.This book doesn't begin with tanks clanking across the terrain or with pilots heading off toward the enemy strongpoints. It begins in a Shoney's parking lot in Hopkinsville, KY. From there, it goes to Fort Campbell, KY. The real saga of any military campaign begins in such places, and this is something Atkins shows in a clear and entertaining way. And it is here we begin to see the staggering importance of logistics. We later see how mistake in logistics created problems for Petraeus and others in the 101st, and how they made tough choices because of those problems.This book held two surprises for me.First, anyone who grew up in the Vietnam Era and/or watched episodes of Air Wolf (Ernest Borgnine, Jan Michael Vincent) or Tour of Duty has this idea that the helicopter is an awesome weapon of war and the symbol of American power on the battlefield. This is apparently what American planners at the highest level thought at the beginning of the the Iraqi War. The reality is quite different. But, Atkinson doesn't spout an armchair general opinion as though he's some kind of expert. He lets us see this through the eyes of General Petraeus, the pilots, Lieutenant General (three star) Wallace, and others. These are people who assessed the first--and ill-fated--Apache assault mission (not flown by the 101st, but by a different company) and developed a very different way of deploying helicopters. A way that proved to work very well. It's this kind of inside view that makes this book so fascinating.I got my second surprise when I came upon the many captioned photos at the center of the book. These put faces with the names and added depth to an already enjoyable book.Unfortunately, there's a fly in the ointment. Atkinson included leftist political remarks that simply fell short of the caliber of the rest of the book, and I found this jarring. It's as if Atkinson wants the reader to know he's a product of the liberal left and oblivious to the mainstream point of view. I hope a future edition has this editorializing edited out. Yet, I still enjoyed the book. I would have enjoyed it more if the author had focused on telling the story. It was a good story. In fact, it was an excellent story. I would sum it up in two words: &quot;Air Assault!&quot; Read the book and you'll know what that means."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Atkinson has written some terrific books on military history in the Vietnam (The Long Gray Line) and World War II (An Army at Dawn) eras. This book is more journalism than history, as it concerns Atkinson's embedding with the 102nd Airborne Division in the most recent Iraq war. He chose to shadow the Division Commander, General Petraeus, who became famous in 2008-09 for his advocacy of a new \\"surge\\" strategy in Afghanistan.Petraeus is rumored to have political ambitions, and this book will be an asset given its very favorable portrayal of his skills as a commander. He does have some irritating hot dog tendencies, such as the need to challenge men half his age to push up and running contests. But his ego does not appear to be totally out of control, and he's extraordinarily bright and diligent.The most interesting observation of Petraeus and Atkinson is that logistics are everything. Tactics are interesting but secondary. Logistics are what makes the army work -- and the logistical problems are daunting and well described in this book. The U.S. Army consumes an extraordinary amount of fuel. One wonders if this should be revisited in future campaigns and whether this fuel consumption will be successfully war-gamed by our opponents as a source of extreme vulnerability. In addition, the performance of the Apache helicoptors was disappointing. This equipment was supposted to be the star of the war, but it proved to be very vulnerable to low tech small arms fire. On the bright side, the ability of the modern American army to project power deep into enemy territory in an instant, and the coordination of air support, artillery, and ground troops, makes the current army an extraordinarily capable force.Petraeus is skilled at cutting to the heart of issues, monitoring the information flow, encouraging debate, making decisions, and getting along with his higher ups. These are all skills that would stand him in good stead should he choose a political career.Because Atkinson spends so much time with the brass, he does not have a good feel as to what is going on in the front lines. So, the narrative is not as vivid as it is in his works on World War II. Also, it would be impossible not to be biased as a result of shadowing and living with the commander in a time of war.On the whole, this is well written, interesting, and a contribution to the scholarship on the Iraq war."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"From the perspective of six years after the events in the book, General David Petraeus's repeated comment of \\"tell me how this ends\\" to Rick Atkinson jumps out (sadly). Well, now we know what happened after the initial war, and you can see hints of that at points in the book. In fact, there may be three reasons to read (or listen to, in my case) this book, which otherwise probably has little appeal to a disaffected populace.First is traditional interest in military accounts, second is to read about General Petraeus, who is the dominant figure in the book, and third is to look back and try to figure out what went wrong.As an account of the run-up to the war and the war itself through the 101st, Atkinson had exceptional access and a sharp eye from deep experience in military matters well beyond what a fresh journalist might have done, and outstanding natural ability, of course. Even for a short engagement, the \\"play by play\\" at times might not have much appeal for some. Atkinson was a real trouper himself, in often miserable conditions, with an edgy sense of humor that might be considered sardonic. Two little items from late in the action come to mind: soldiers find a collection of box cutters, and Atkinson wonders whether they had at last found a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda, and his observation about how quickly \\"liberation\\" turned to looting was mournfully funny.Atkinson seemed to play it straight on the struggles helicopters had in Iraqi conditions. No cover-up and certainly a willingness to remind us that when an Apache crashed in the dust, there went another $20M. On a more positive note, he credited the multi-force action where totally outclassed defenses could be wiped out by coordinated air, ground and artillery engagement, even if we didn't need GPS coordinates down to a couple of feet.Atkinson was fortunate to have hooked up with someone whose career took off, General Petraeus, while also being an interesting subject. A senior officer in Petraeus's staff suggests that Atkinson had a closer relationship with Petraeus than any of the officers, and that very well could be true. Some reviewers have complained that the focus on the staff instead of the front-line soldiers was a flaw, whereas for me it was a highlight. The behind the scenes planning and execution, with its fits and starts and highs and lows and dependence on logistics fit better with Iraq than life in the heat and dust for the soldiers.The third reason to pick up the book now is to remember how far off American leaders were in their thinking and what that perspective was at the time of the original action. Gas as a weapon was considered probable and the Americans were to be recognized as liberators, not occupiers. How hard could it be? Many times the cultural dissonance between American expectations and reality were apparent, with the military engaging a country where few Americans, even those with high intelligence and good intentions, really knew the people."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Company Of SoldiersThe book Company Of Hero's By Rick Atkinson is an inspiring book about a reporter imbedded with the 101st airborne infantry division. It is an emotion struggle of a report just trying to survive. The book shows the repetitiveness, the ironies and the loss. He faces many struggles through losing he's best friend to being shot and and almost losing his own life. No matter what this aw inspiring book will leave jessing again and again."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I ordered this book expecting to receive a detailed account of a combat soldier's experience in Iraq. What it offers instead is a hyper-detailed rendering of the author's experience tagging around with a general during the invasion of Iraq, sprinkled liberally with backhanded criticisms of President Bush and his administration's policies. Frankly, I expected more, a lot more, from a former Pulitzer prize winner. A little balance and broader historical perspective perhaps?The book is well written but poorly conceived. The author professes great admiration and respect for the troops who protected him each day. No doubt he is sincere. But when he writes that these same soldiers have gone to war &quot;under a delusion&quot; (pg 44), he undercuts his message. To read Mr. Atkins is to believe that those who have fought and died for us in Iraq have done so in vain, on little more than a political fool's errand.Criticism of our nation's foreign policy, when it is up front and intelligently argued, is to be desired. Sniping half-truths launched from within the guise of a definitive military chronicle, on the other hand, do us all a disservice."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"This was my first Atkinson book, and I didn't find him to live up to the hype others have created for him. This was what I expected to read, which was material you'd expect from a journalist travelling with a military unit. He does a good job trying not to promote or condemn the war and lays out the facts; good reporting. This is what journalism should be about, especially with the decline in professional journalism in the past decade. Don't expect to get an uncensored account from the grunt, Rick spends his time with the top brass and covers the operational, not tactical, aspects of the war's beginnings.Atkinson reveals what those in the military already know, and that is as much as the United States Army is glamourized, it is still vulnerable. This is shown through the fact that the 101st, an Air Assault Divison, was rendered combat incapable not by just nature, but by human carelessness shown in off placed shipping times. To move a division by air successfully is a gigantic logistical challenge with many moving parts. Atkinson shows some of the ways how the world's premier military faces challenges civilians don't think about. The Iraqi Army wasn't really much of an army at all, but rather a very loose and disgruntled rabble with very low morale. Yes, we did push into Baghdad very quickly, but then again we are the superpower invading a 3rd world country. The book ends with a feeling of uncertainty, this was felt by Petraeus himself along with everyone else in the world.All in all, an insightful account of operational command of an Air Assault division, but the literature is nothing spectacular."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"A highly readable, somewhat enjoyable but superficial and all-too-often political commentary on the very short \\"major combat\\" required destroying one of the most lethal (to his own people, country and enemies) yet hollow dictatorships of history. Atkinson did fine work with \\"An army at dawn\\" yet this time it is hard to tell if he wants to be known as a journalist, a humorist, and historian, a simply a liberal Washington Post reporter.Atkinson is observant but self-centered. His details include hygiene, passwords, idiosyncrasies and a lot of his own personal thoughts and feelings. While in the company of soldiers, he really does not tap the minds or souls of these warriors. He spends most of his time in the company of officers. He is worried more about his cell phone hook ups and the way his words play back in the States then he appears to be concerned with the men who are literally fighting, serving and protecting him.For an historian, the story lacks nuance and context. The Iraqi regime and the build up to the war earn no real mention. Nothing is said of the terror produced by an Iraqi peace or the double-dealing nature of the UN food-for-bribes program and the German and French complicity in the hesitancy to fight. He belittles the coalition.At times I have to wonder as to the value of the embedded reporter strategy. Does their presence change the behavior of soldiers and officers? Do the reporters really understand what they are seeing? Who is keeping an eye on them? Perhaps we should embed a few Rakkasans with the Post."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Review: \\"In the Company of Soldiers - A Chronicle of Combat\\" by Rick AtkinsonI can tell when an author has reached out and grabbed me by the throat when I become so engrossed in reading a book that I miss my stop on the subway! Last evening, while poring over the last few pages of \\"In the Company of Soldiers,\\" I just barely noticed that the doors of the Orange Line car were about to close at Downtown Crossing - my stop to transfer to the Red Line heading to my home in Quincy. Charles Dickens has the ability to pull me into his stories with that kind of rapt attention; so does Pulitzer Prize winning author Rick Atkinson.My friend, Kevin Kalkwarf, a West Point grad and Black Hawk pilot, suggested that I read \\"In the Company of Soldiers.\\" Thanks, Kevin, for the recommendation. In 2003, as the U.S. prepared for the invasion of Iraq, Washington Post journalist, Rick Atkinson, was embedded with the Army's 101st Airborne Division. Atkinson was personally assigned to shadow the 101st Commanding General, David Petraeus. The resulting book paints for the reader one of the most vivid and insightful pictures yet of the early days of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The writer not only was able to look over the shoulder of Petraeus as the 101st traveled from Ft. Campbell Kentucky to Kuwait and then on to Baghdad, he was also able to peer into the general's soul. As a result, I found that this book had a dual impact on me. At one level, Atkinson allowed me to grasp some sense of the hardship that our soldiers have endured in fighting in some of the harshest conditions imaginable. In reading some of the passages in this book, I could almost smell the pungent odors of Najaf and Karbala and almost choke on the ubiquitous sand and dust that insinuates itself into every crevice and orifice. At another level, I was glad for the intimate portrait of Petraeus, the man that many of us are counting on to lead us somehow out of the labyrinth that Iraq has become.Atkinson's writing is so good that I feel compelled to let him speak in his own words. Here he describes the scene at Camp New Jersey, a way station in Kuwait that the 101st called home while awaiting orders to invade Iraq.\\"Yet a desolate, edge-of-the-empire beauty obtained. As Dwyer and I walked, dawn spread over the eastern horizon in a molten brew of orange and indigo, silhouetting the wooden guard towers. Platoons ran wind sprints across the desert or jumped about in calisthenic exuberance. The cuffs of the troops' desert boots were indelibly inked with their blood types, a legion of Os and As and A-positives. A soldier ambled past with a grenade launcher on his shoulder, singing in a sweet falsetto: \`Sha-na-na-na, good-bye!' I fancied that in its remote, martial spirit this encampment was of a piece with the Roman outposts, perhaps ancient Timgad in North Africa, built by the Third Legion in A.D. 100, where a traveler described the scuffing cadence of Trajan's soldiers helmed in bronze, and \`barbarians from the outer desert in paint and feathers flitting along the narrow byways.'\\" (Pages 79-80)One of the aspects of this book that I found most compelling was Atkinson artistry in connecting the Iraq of the 21st century to the Mesopotamia of biblical times and of ancient glories. The following passage is an excellent example of his giftedness in bridging these disparate worlds:\\"Chickens scattered into the brush as Warlord 457 [Petraeus' helicopter] and our two Kiowa bodyguards carefully threaded the telephone wires and touched down on a two-lane blacktop a few hundred yards from where the car bomb had detonated this morning. Objective Jenkins, as the Army called this place, occupied the western bank of the Euphrates, fourteen miles north of Najaf. The road continued another eight hundred yards, the crossed the last bridge spanning the river before a great south-flowing fork in the Euphrates. Beyond the bridge lay the town of Kifl. In this place the Old Testament prophet Ezekiel, humorless and God-besotted, had preached to the Jews during their Babylonian captivity in the sixth century B.C., foretelling the restoration of Israel. The 3rd ID [Infantry Division] recently had battled through Jenkins and into Kifl, and I spotted a couple dozen dead Iraqis in body bags stacked under the palms. Here, at least, the corpse traffic still thrived. . . . At 1:35 P.M., a convoy of five Humvees came down the road, trailed by a Bradley. [Lt. General William Scott] Wallace climbed out with Major General Buford C. Blount III, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division. For half an hour they stood on the road with Petraeus and studied their maps. Blount was keen to plunge on toward Baghdad, but Wallace insisted that he wait until all three of the 3rd ID infantry brigades were gathered above Najaf; only today was the 82nd Airborne supplanting Blount's 3rd Brigade at Samawah, where Army intelligence estimated that five hundred entrenched diehards were coercing another fifteen hundred Iraqis to fight through executions and extortion.I heard the dull crump of a mortar round detonate on our side of the Euphrates. A minute later Army 105mm howitzers barked in reply, dumping fifteen or twenty counterbattery rounds across the river.Wallace drove off with his entourage. We reboarded the Blackhawk and angled east before swinging south. The lovely green ribbon of the Euphrates scrolled past Kifl, which lay badly smashed on the far bank. Ezekiel's tomb stood somewhere in that desolation. 'There was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to bone.' The prophet had written. \`And the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceeding great army.'\\" (Pages 197-199)Atkinson shares a poignant litany that became an almost predictable exit line whenever Gen. Petraeus would end a conversation with the journalist. The commanding general would wonder out loud: \\"How does this end?\\" His thoughtful query becomes even more significant in light of his promotion and the fact that he now holds in his hands the reins for determining how the U.S. military on the ground in Iraq will extricate itself from the quagmire. He is a significant player in determining how it will end.Atkinson saw the soldiers of the 101st in all kinds of conditions and under the most extreme of circumstances. He eavesdropped on their decision-making, their laughter, their frustrations and their fears. On the day he flew back to Kuwait to return to the U.S., part of him felt as if he were abandoning comrades in arms. His respect for the leadership of Petraeus is heart-felt and well-earned. \\"His pragmatism and broad peacekeeping experience in Haiti and Bosnia had prepared him for the thankless work of a proconsul in the American imperium.\\" (Page 294)The writer's admiration for all the soldiers he had come to know comes through loud and clear in this valedictory: \\"The division's soldiers had done well, demonstrating competence and professionalism. Capably led - the division's brigade commanders and two assistant division commanders were uncommonly excellent - they took hardship in stride and refused to let bloodlust, cynicism, or other despoilers of good army cheat them of their battle honors. They were better than the cause they served, which would soon be tarnished by revelations that the casus belli - that Iraq posed an immanent, existential danger to America and its allies - was inflated and perhaps fraudulent. If the war's predicate was phony, it cheapened the sacrifices of the dead and living alike. Yet such strategic nuances were beyond the province of soldiering, and I believed it vital not to conflate the warriors with the war.\\" (Page 294)This fine book brings the non-combatant reader as close as possible to the rigors of the modern battlefield, and leaves one with a renewed sense of admiration for those who fight and serve. Atkinson has handled well the trust that was placed in him, and we are all enriched by his thoughtful response to the time he spent in the company of soldiers.Al"},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Rick Atkinson (Pulitzer prize winner for Army at Dawn) was an embedded reporter in the 101 airborne during our most recent Iraqi war. He spends his time with General Petraeus and the story is from the perspective of someone following around the general. The result of this is a very readable account of this general's personality, command issues and combat encounters at the general's level. What is missing is a more complete view and account of this division's war experience. I found myself looking for a clearer overall picture and a better idea of the unit tactics.While I am a fan of Rick Atkinson's books, this point of view account of the war left a bad taste for reading any others. I don't care to piece together a conflict by reading a dozen point of view books from various embedded reporters."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Rick Atkinson captures the high level leadership of our Army prior to and during Desert Storm.

Atkinson portrays MG Petrause (sp) as a very intellegent, complex, and capable leader."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"This author doesn't miss a chance to take a shot at Bush and Rumsfeld. He goes out of his way to do so.He also seems to like to hear himself talk. There is a lot of unneccessary detail about mundane things. I was hoping for an account of an embed in combat. What I got was an embed who hung around with the division commander and constantly editorialized.I started to read this right after I read \\"The March Up : Taking Baghdad with the 1st Marine Division\\" by Ray L. Smith and Bing West, a book I highly recommend. After reading that book I couldn't get past page 100 in this one. Every 5 pages or so the author throws in a dig, sometimes sarcastic, or otherwise makes known his opinions.I recommend even more \\"Thunder Run: The Armored Strike to Capture Baghdad\\" by David Zucchino. If you liked \\"Black Hawk Down\\" you'll like \\"Thunder Run\\". It's written in the same style. Zuchinno is also a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, but he doesn't succumb to a need to lecture and editorialize the way Atkinson does."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I don't believe a better account could have been made of the ground war in Iraq. Atkinson focuses on the actual job of fighting the war, and like the soldiers, leaves the why questions and the politics for others. This book is an excellent look into how modern warfare is conducted, often \\"punching with one fist.\\" He does the enlisted men and officers of the 101st proud, professing admiration while maintaining objectivity. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"As a campaign overview this is a useful book, written by someone who was in Iraq during the 2003 invasion and had access to the command echelon of the 101st Airborne Division. I decided to read this book mainly because I wanted to have a more complete picture of General David Petreaus who was the CG of the 101st in 2003. Mr Atckinson does not fail in this aspect and, although he refers many times to himself and his problems following the division in battle, he gives a nice account of the campaign, more on the brigade and division levels than to the company and battalion ones. The impression someone has after reading this book, is that the victory the US armed forces achieved against an \\"army of half a million with 11,000 generals and 15,000 colonels\\" was not exaclty a masterpiece of military triumph. In 2003 there were also the first signs of the failure that followed regarding the insurgency and the mounting US and Coalition casualties. The book contains some very good maps which help a lot to follow the action and some black and white photos. Overall, a nice effort of first hand account of a modern campaign with all the pros and cons that this entails."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I picked up this book expecting to get an account of the stories of the individual stories of soldiers who, for whatever reason, fought in the sands of Iraq...the stories of dads and sons and brothers and even sisters. What I got instead was a thinly-veiled criticism of those who led our nation into this battle. There were very few details of individual soldiers, and the little bit of information provided was decidedly negative...grunts were portrayed either as &quot;We're gonna blow Saddam to Hell&quot; types or those who scrawl &quot;This places sucks&quot; on the walls of the privys.Actually, I didn't finish this book. I was shocked the first time I came across criticism of Bush, criticism that obviously was interjected into the account in the months following the war. What finally did it for me was the following quote from page 216: &quot;To be sure, much fighting remained before Baghdad hove into view. Soldiers would still kill, and soldiers would still die. Civilians would die, too, like the ten slaughtered on Monday when a family van barreling down Highway 9 was riddled with 25mm cannon fire by skittish Marine soldiers.&quot; Are you kidding me! Atkinson has gone to length to talk about the suicide bombings already facing the military at this point...none of which he actually saw...I'll get to that later...and then he describes American soldiers as skittish slaughterers? I'd be willing to wager that if Mr. Atkinson had been manning that 25mm gun at a checkpoint, and a van was &quot;barreling&quot; toward his position...that he wouldn't have been thinking, &quot;wow, I wonder if there are innocent civilians in there.&quot; I bet he'd been thinking, &quot;holy crap, that thing's probably loaded down and gonna blow us away,&quot; right before HE opened up on it.A high school student with a subscription to Newsweek, USA Today, and CNN could have written this book. Philosophical disagreements aside, I didn't like the book because the majority of it was filled with general stories and accounts of the war not personally witnessed by the author. He routinely included information about other theater actions...mostly to further criticize the military and administration.This book seeks to portray the leaders of our military and nation and incompetent and inept and our most valuable weapon systems as impotent. This book is dishonest about it's aims. I know where to turn if I want read about the mistakes of the current administration, and I know where to turn if I want to read books by those who whole-heartedly support Bush. I guess I don't know where to turn to place myself in the company of soldiers."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"After reading &quot;The March Up&quot; and &quot;Boots on the Ground&quot; I found Rick Atkinson's, &quot;In the Company of Soldiers&quot; a profound disappointment.

If readers desire a solid story, I am inclined to direct you to \\"Blinded by the Sunlight\\" and \\"A Fist in the Hornet's Nest.\\""},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"In the Company of Soldiers is an excellent book; very gripping. It shows that Gen. Petraeus is one of the best military leaders in American history."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"As these reviews are reflecting the wider debate on Iraq, I write this review to join the conversation.As for the book itself, it is quite readable and reasonably informative, though not the home run I was anticipating when I opened it.One striking passage describes the fighting for Najaf in the spring of '03. Could there be clearer evidence of the flaws in the administration's plans than the fact of the recently concluded \\"reconquest\\" of Najaf in August of '04? What army in history has conquered a city, abandoned it without being forced to do so, and then had to conquer it again? And who is to say that we won't have to conquer Najaf yet again? Clearly we and especially our troops in Iraq are paying dearly for invading \\"on the cheap\\", not to mention biting off more than we can chew.In general, as an opponent of the war, I found Atkinson's criticisms of the Bush administration, some implicit and some explicit, to be well grounded in the facts that he encountered. While he evidently failed to meet the jingoistic standards of some other reviewers, no one could have exhibited greater admiration for the soldiers and their leaders in the field."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I should have remembered the old truism \\"consider the source\\" before spending money on this book. Forced to respect our military by seeing how they operate up close and first hand, Atkinson ruins this book with his personal leftist elitist perspective and his obvious hatred of George Bush. Is he entitled to paint the broad picture of the war as he describes the on-the-ground stuff? Sure, but the problem with the book is that he is a reporter, not a commentator, and he takes too many liberties with opinionated commentaries on the political context of the war when he has no more valuable insight on that issue than you or me - he was embedded in Iraq, not the Oval office.I wonder how deep his respect for our military really runs. He gives the impression that most of the grunts resent their involvement with the Military, when in fact we know they are dedicated to their mission and they overwhelmingly support the GOP politically. Finally, what's with this term \\"desperadoes,\\" used twice to describe the Special Forces soldiers he encounters? Websters defines this term as an outlaw. How disdainful is that? Special Forces soldiers will make or break this war on Islamic terror, and they are the finest military professionals America has to offer. Atkinson should apologize for using this term."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"The author spared no punches at constantly giving his personal disapproving opinion on the politics of this war. It almost reads as a Democratic Campaign leaflet against the Bush Administration's war in Iraq. It is horribly biased against the reasons for going to war. Atkinson makes it a point in almost every chapter to show how wrong and inept the Bush Administration's policies are. In the author's impressions of casual conversations, the attitude of the young men and women in the 101'st appear to also be very negative as to the reasons they are in Iraq and fighting the war. I would not recommend this book if you supported the war in Iraq.I highly recommend:\\"The March Up: Taking Baghdad with the 1st Marine Division\\"\\"None Braver: U.S. Air Force Pararescuemen in the War on Terrorism\\""},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"An excellent book. Rick Atkinson really knows how to research a subject. To read his books is like being there"},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Everyone has a right to their political opinion, but Atkinson should have kept it to himself. His book serves the cause of those against the war FROM THE BEGINNING, and not that of the historians (or journalists) fair, objective, and, if their good, thoughtful search for the truth. By all accounts, a majority of Americans supported the war, you won't get that from this book. The only \\"unease\\" felt by most Americans, was not at going to war, but at realizing how politics can blind some people to what has to be done. There are so many comments made by Atkinson that I could flag as bent, if not comically unfair, but I don't have enough space. The only really good thing I can say, is that the book is written well. But there are a lot of people who write well.I would not recommend this book. While Atkinson's \\"An Army at Dawn\\" is exceptional, this book is a tremendous let down and leaves a lingering bad taste after spending $25.00 on it."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"This was a great book and came in a reasonable amount of time and in good condition as described."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I purchased this book because I cajoled a young man into the Army prior to 9/11. He ended up in the 101st Airborne, the famous Screaming Eagles, who are the subject of this book. Instead of a chronicle of the heroics of this Division in Iraq (after their service in Afghanistan), this author confirms the liberal leanings of the media. The author cannot help himself, criticizing the Bush admininstration throughout the book, instead of building on the accomplishments of the officers and soldiers of the 101st and the US Army in their victory in Iraq."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Rick Atkinson's Army at Dawn--for which he was awarded a Pulitzer, while embedded in Iraq--is a terrific first volume in a projected trilogy on the American infantry in WWII and he's already written one of the better volumes on the initial Iraq War in 1991, Crusade. So, it's easy to see why he'd have jumped at the chance to cover the desert warfare of the second Iraq War up close and personal.Many will already be familiar with the dispatches he filed for the Washington Post during the conflict and he brings the immediacy of such reportage to this memoir of being embedded with the 101st Airborne, but that's both a strength and its weakness. It's a strength in so far as he provides us a gifted reporter's ground-eye-view of the challenges and confusions soldiers and commanders face in the midst of combat and in the build-up to and aftermath of war. But it's a weakness in that the intentional lack of perspective makes people--not least himself--seem silly and petulant at times. For instance, the most controversial story he contributed to while in theater was War Could Last Months, Officers Say (Thomas E. Ricks, March 27, 2003, Washington Post):Despite the rapid advance of Army and Marine forces across Iraq over the past week, some senior U.S. military officers are now convinced that the war is likely to last months and will require considerably more combat power than is now on hand there and in Kuwait, senior defense officials said yesterday.The combination of wretched weather, long and insecure supply lines, and an enemy that has refused to be supine in the face of American military might has led to a broad reassessment by some top generals of U.S. military expectations and timelines. Some of them see even the potential threat of a drawn-out fight that sucks in more and more U.S. forces. Both on the battlefield in Iraq and in Pentagon conference rooms, military commanders were talking yesterday about a longer, harder war than had been expected just a week ago, the officials said.&quot;Tell me how this ends,&quot; one senior officer said yesterday.Read with the knowledge that the regime fell 21 days after the start of the war this can't help but seem even more hysterical now than it did then. Moreover, it seems likely that the Post and its correspondents, including Mr. Atkinson, were being used by the uniformed military, which wanted more troops, in bureaucratic infighting against the Pentagon's political leadership--Secretaries Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and the like. In that case the story wasn't just absurd, as becomes obvious in retrospect, but an instance of the press allowing itself to be manipulated, willingly or not. At any rate, it's singularly unedifying and such despair is not uncommon in the book. One wonders how much easier the victory could have been but perhaps the answer is that for the men fighting them all wars just suck and every day is a quagmire. If so, that's a valuable enough lesson to learn, especially for those of us who get to sit home and send others out to fight, but it does suggest that we shouldn't take their complaints terribly seriously.Somewhat allied to this problem of quagmirism is Mr. Atkinson's obvious opposition to the war. He has every right to disapprove of it, but he makes a couple of disturbing comments along the way. At one point he makes fun of two soldiers for arguing that it was not a war about oil. As events have shown, and as all but true partisans surely recognized at the time, they were right and he wrong. Another, even more galling, instance of his cynicism comes when the great journalist and fellow embed Michael Kelly is killed in an accident and Mr. Atkinson refers to it as &quot;senseless.&quot; Now, perhaps he just means the accidental nature of the tragedy is senseless, but the death of a reporter in the very act of reporting on a dangerous situation seems the very opposite of senseless. It is noble.On the plus side, and the plus side is considerable, Mr. Atkinson centers the book around the compelling figure of Major General David Petraeus, who he also &gt;profiled extensively for the Post. The General exemplifies the intelligence, political sensitivity, hypercompetitiveness, and ambition of the modern officer corps. The portrayal of General Petraeus and of other senior officers in the 101st, like Lt. Gen. William Wallace, are excellent and give us much cause for pride in our armed forces. Also interesting are Mr. Atkinson's reports on events he was able to experience in real time--or at least their aftermaths--like the grenade and shooting attack by an American G.I who'd converted to Islam that took place just before the war kicked off while the 101st was stationed in Kuwait. And, as mentioned above, Mr. Atkinson's own confusion about the events going on around him--as well as that of the officers he was talking to--reminds us of the wisdom of Leo Tolstoy in War and Peace, that the belief that commanders are in control of events is an illusion. War is by its nature a chaotic enterprise where what you think you know at any given moment is more than likely wrong.Of course the story ends before we know how things will turn out in Iraq. By the end of Mr. Atkinson's stay it had already become obvious that diehards and extremists were going to cause significant problems as they resisted American, allied, and Iraqi efforts to reform the nation. But the pessimism with which the book concludes will hopefully turn out to be just one more case of being lost in the fog of war. When Mr. Atkinson sits down to write a history of the second Iraq War a few years from now it will be interesting to see how the perspective afforded by temporal distance changes the judgments he made here, while he was in the thick of things."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"This book is an outstanding read and worth every penny. Mr. Atkinson writes in detail about the deployment and combat the 101st Airborne Division was involved in during Operation Iraqi Freedom. A majority of the book is focused on the commanding general and his staff, but the author does write about those at the lower levels of command and the problems they faced. His writing is very detailed and makes the reader feel as if he is actually getting pounded with sand during shamals or seeing comrades die during combat. The writing draws you in and keeps you there. Mr. Atkinson is brutally honest in showing how politician's views and soldier's views of how the war should have been waged are vastly different. Mr. Atkinson is not complimentary toward Bush and Rumsfeld. He writes about their trying to go to war &quot;on a shoestring&quot; and how they got upset when the V Corps commander stated his opinion of how the war was going. Recent events in Iraq has proven once again that politicians who weasled their way out of serving their country do not have a clue what it takes to wage and win a war."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I read this book because I had heard good things about the author (Atkinson). It was a decent chronicle of the 101st's invasion of Iraq. However, it focused mostly on the strategy of the war and not the actual execution. It would have been nice to know what was going on at the lower levels of command. Also, the vocabulary was a bit obscure. I found it to be a little intellectually elitist. Finally, he should probably have kept his political digs out of the book. For instance, he comments that WMD have not been found. Iraq is a big place and they still might be found. Even if there are none, it just seems to be an out of place commentary."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I agree that this is not a history of the tatics used in crushing the Iraqi army... but is that the correct word to describe the contest that took place? I suspect that History will not focus on the tatical decision used to get to Bagdad ; it seems obvious the Us Army could have decided to walk and with our superiority in almost everything ( except perhaps the willingness to die) we would have been in Bagdad in a couple of weeks.Atkinsons's book is valuable and enjoyable because it shows that 1) the local ground and area US miltary commanders are incredibly smart, capable, compassionate people who do what they are told and do it well 2) Early on they all knew that the problem would not be winning the war but winning the peace3) they thought the biggest threat from Sadaam was chemical weapons (so they too were hoodwinked by their leaders, just as we all were).My only concern is to be convinced that all of Atkinson's comments about the hell to come in the months ahead, really did occur to him and his subjects in march and April 2003... I get the idea that some of this is retrospecive analysis.One wonders what Generral Petraus would tell Atkinson now, a year and hundreds of causualties later. Will he and others who have watched there boys and girls die on the ground be able to stand up to politicians in the future when the next &quot; great idea for a war&quot; comes along?"},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I listen to lots of audiobooks - one or more a week. This, in my opinion is the best I've heard this year. You gain a lot of insight into our modern day army, its leaders, their training, their character. It makes you proud of these troops and their leaders, as real people, not plastic heros. I also believe I enjoyed it more because the author read the book. The reader has a lot to do with the listener's enjoyment. Rick Atkinson is not only a talented author, but I believe he has put his real heart into this book, and it shows in his reading."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Rick Atkinson, one of our nation's most distinguished military historians, produces a uncharacteristically mediocre travelogue about the Iraq War. I found this book, along with all of the other Iraq instant histories out there, to be of questionable historical value. Atkinson's modus operandi in IN THE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS makes this book suspect even among the other instant histories currently clogging bookstore shelves. He simply followed the General in charge of the Army's 101st Airborne around for a month during the war, resulting in a \\"and then we left location X and arrived at location Y\\"-type narrative structure. While this makes for interesting journalism, it falls far short of the standards of History set by Stephen Ambrose's Band of Brothers (incidentally, about the 101st in WWII) or Mark Bowden's Black Hawk Down. There is precious little fact checking or external corroboration involved with this book. It is merely the war seen through a soda straw. IN THE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS lacks the breadth, poise and authoritativeness that laborious interviewing, research and long hours spent in the archives produces.The book also suffers from a ailment common to much recent military journalism: being over-awed by rank and taking high-ranking officers at their word. The best historians (e.g. Studs Turkel, Michael Herr, Stephen Ambrose) stake their claim by examining the plight of the common man caught up in uncommon circumstances. They talk to the grunts on the frontlines. Generals are, for the most part, politicians in uniform and Atkinson's book suffers as a result of his almost deliberate higher headquarters myopia. The title oughta be IN THE COMPANY OF A WEST POINT GRADUATE."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"The book should have been titled Bush Lied, since that is what half of it was about.The author is dumbstuck by the 101st CO and the other officers he was stationed with. If they made any mistakes the auther fails to mention them. However, he did not fial to mention any negative things they said about the mission or the plan (ie Bush).I wish the author had give his personal thoughts on wether Gen Petraeus lied or Gen Franks lied. Gen Franks claimed in his book that the Pres asked each Gen if they had what they needed and they all said yes. In the book the author said Gen Petraeus said he told the pentagon more troops were needed.Finally I wish the author had included Gen Franks, Isreal, Saudia Ariaba, Jordan, President Bush 41, Predident Clinton, France, England, Italy, and the many other world wide leaders and countries who lied and said Iraq had those weapons."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I really enjoyed Atkinson's book, An Army at Dawn, and looked forward to this account of American soldiers in Iraq. The book is a bitter disappointment. The author is so anti-Bush that it colors his report right from the start when he talks about how a father of many children dies and for what purpose. Of course most deaths in war are sad. Every writer knows that the lead of a story portends the slant of the story. He bashes Bush and his administration in the subtle ways of the media that leave critics looking bad if they complain. In the first third of the book, he didn't discuss in detail or with sophistication why the U.S. Congress, including many Democrats, approved the war. Nor does he mention how the previous administration thought Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. Nor does he mention how the UN sanctioned Saddam 17 times. He mocks the allies by pointing out the small guys. He says the U.S. was basically going alone when Great Britain, Australia, Japan, Spain, Italy and other countries supported the action. These examples go on and on. He puts all the blame on the Bush administration. Let's not forget that Saddam miscalculated badly by not seeking peace terms with his adversaries and he lost his country.I've only listened to the first part of the book on audio and it's boring. It's more about him the author than about the soldiers. What made them so great? Able to conquer a country the size of California in a few weeks? The Band of Brothers author very well described the rigorous training. Instead, Atkinson's starting point is the Shoney restaurant and all about his problems. The author rested on his laurels as a Pulitzer Prize winner, which probably intimidated his editors and kept them from pushing him to do a great job.Instead, this book lacks insights into why people did certain things. Like most journalists, he kept close to the leaders so he could file his breaking news. It's another sorry example of partisan media bashing by the top media. See Woodward timing his book to run a month before the 2006 election and the NY Times publisher saying he was sorry he couldn't prevent the Iraq war. It's no wonder that the elite media no longer have the respect of half the country.Peter"},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Most journalists were forced by uncertainties in Baghdad to cover the war by embedding with American units as they invaded Iraq. Rick Atkinson was one of these embedded journalists, and his book, In the Company of Soldiers tells the story of his time with the Army's 101st Airborne Division. Aside from his duties with the Washington Post, Atkinson is also a military historian of some repute (his World War II book An Army at Dawn won a Pulitzer in 2003) and it shows. He is interested most in the tactics employed during the invasion and in the commanders who implemented them. Atikinson's narrative is tied to Major General David Petraeus, a no-nonesense military man. The 101st, and Atkinson along with them, saw their share of action during those early days, but much of what transpired during those first weeks feels like a footnote -- or ancient history -- compared to all that has happened since. The most interesting parts of the book are the most personal. Atkinson's daily struggles against the harshness of the desert and the austerity of military life shine far more brightly than the methodical movements of the troops he travelled with. The book takes the US to task for fouling up the aftermath of the invasion, but Atkinson's epilogue seems hastily tacked on, an attempt to save the book from being made irrelevant by the nasty turn that this war has taken."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"In the Company of Soldiers follows General David Petraeus and the 101st Airborne Division as they deploy from Fort Campbell, Kentucky to Kuwait, then make the march to Baghdad. Unlike most of the accounts I have read of the 2003 invasion, this follows the \\"behind the scenes\\" action of the Commanding Officers instead of combat units. Atkinson does an outstanding job at documenting the crucial, tiring decision-making process behind the invasion. Every decision from the seemingly mundane, such as whether to protect helicopter rotors with thick paint or tape, to the assault on Baghdad is meticulously covered. The best aspect of the book is the details one would not have heard on CNN. One of the biggest gaffs occurred during the deployment of equipment. Every shipping box had a barcode which would tell the receivers exactly what was in each box and where it needed to go. But, the Server which housed the barcode Database was on the 3rd ship to arrive. Meaning the first two ships were disorganized when being unloaded. We also get to experience living with the Commanding Officers. We see them celebrate a victory, and weep a failure. Atkinson also reveals small quarks that help the average American relate to the Commanding General in Iraq, such as General Petraeus eating Pop Tarts for breakfast every morning.This book is very easy to read and should be read by any military history enthusiasts. By covering both the war planning and actual combat, like the capture of Najaf, Karbala, and Hilla, one experiences the war from the Pentagon down. Atkinson is also bipartisan until his afterward. It's nice to hear an account of the first 4 weeks of combat without the political rhetoric. Victories are commended, failures questioned. From fierce Apache firefights to bunking with a Private in the unforgiving Iraqi Desert, you are given the chance to relive the invasion."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"This book is the best i've read on the war.

A foretelling of the mindset of the American soldier after months of war.Rick Atkinson was a staff writer and senior editor for The Washington Post for twenty years. His many awards include the Pulitzer Prize for journalism and history, and he is a best selling author of &quot;An Army At Dawn&quot; and &quot;The Long Grey Line&quot;.He has written an extraordinary account of his days with the 101st Airborne Division.In late February 2003, Rick found himself at Fort Campbell, Kentucky learning the ins and outs of warfare and how to protect himself from weapons of mass destruction and chemical warfare.He was granted complete access to the commanders and the troops of the 101st. He saw first hand the preparations in Kuwait through the occupation of Baghdad. He was able to meet with Major General David Petraeus, on daily basis, often spent days with him. Gen. Major Petraeus was called &quot;the most competitive man on the planet&quot;, and he would often challenge his troops to pushup contests, which he always won. This is a man to be admired- he ran a 'tight ship&quot; and would suffer no fools. Rick Atkinson also spent time with the regular soldiers, learning their stories, and reading the emails from their families. From February 2003 through the end of April 2003, Atkinson spent time with the 17,000 soldiers in combat. He tells their stories of battle and the challenges they faced with the hostile environment. Atkinson tells the story of the Muslim soldier who fragged his colleagues and killed one of the officers. This was the first casualty of Major General Petraeus's command, and was a somber, telling event. Monday, April 14, the Pentagon declared an end to major operations in Iraq.The military success of the early Spring threatened by the end of the year to become a politico-military morass. As I sit typing this, the war continues with fierce fighting. At the beginning of the war, 20% of the active-duty Army was deployed it Iraq, two years later the figure has climbed to nearly 50% with the National Guard and Reserves just as strained. When will this end? The Pentagon expects to keep 100,000 men in Iraq through 2006. Rick Atkinson has written a life altering novel for him and for us. The war has indeed come into our living rooms- this book is recommended heartily. prisrob"},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"This book is reasonably well-written and describes the Iraq invasion from Division and Brigade command staff position exclusively.

Yes, we occasionally called then-MG Petraeus \\"King David\\" behind his back, but no one will ever be able to say he's not the most talented and hardworking officer to wear four stars in wartime since Creighton Abrams in Vietnam, and maybe Matt Ridgeway in Korea. Considering how much of the current (December 2007) effort in Iraq rides on General Petraeus' intellect, more people should get this look at how he actually works. For us who've worn the Screaming Eagle patch in Iraq, it's a great book since it gave those of us with an ant's-eye view of the party a look at what was going on up above us. My copy's been autographed by both then-MG Petraeus and Atkinson, and is among my better souvenirs.And that scene outside Karbala where he notes the nametapes of overloaded infantryment passing by, those guys were from my company's (B 3/502) 1st Platoon."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"I had read the \\"Army At Dawn\\" book before I had purchased and read this particular book. I really enjoyed the story telling of the North African campaign and had thought Mr. Atkinson would have done something similar for this book. I was wrong. My main complaint with the book is the choppiness in which it goes to tell the story. Having served in both Afghanistan and Iraq, I laughed at some his stories (AAFES and the missing chocolate cookie), cried specifically when he briefly details the letters soldiers were getting from home, and anguish at the breakdowns in communications when a task is at hand. The story telling was not cohesive and made the book like at times reading a personal diary focused on one day at a time and not connected to either the days before or after."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Well written, easy to ready, definitely an eye-opener: I had no idea the condition that have to be endured and the stamina that must be maintained to survive the environment alone, ever mind the war! I can better understand my friends and family who have served there. Would recommend this book."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this book is not about NCOs and junior-grade officers on the front line. In that sense, the title of the book is a bit strange in that \\"In the Company of Soldiers, a Chronicle of Combat\\" tends to conjure up images of front line action. At least it does for me, anyway. If that's what you are looking for, then there is a whole slew of excellent books out there to describe that experience, among which I would include \\"One Bullet Away\\", Sebastian Junger's \\"War\\", Donovan Campbell's \\"Joker One\\", and many others. All were written by junior officers or journalists embedded with frontline units. All provide excellent overviews of a small unit in action and also provide insight as to the types of things that concern lieutenants and sergeants.\\"In the Company of Soldiers\\", on the other hand, is principally based on observations at the corps, division and brigade levels. In other words, it provides insight into things that concern generals and colonels. This is valuable information, and this story, when read alongside those listed above, provides a striking contrast between the tactical concerns of small unit commanders and the strategic and logistical concerns of large unit commanders. It also provides insight into the type of individual that can effectively manage a large combat unit. It left me with a renewed appreciation that a unit's success all starts and ends with the commander, and that begins at the very top. Good officers are a very valuable commodity, and exceptionally good officers are dearer still. For the most part, we get to see the latter in this story, and it is very impressive. You get the sense that these guys are the best of the best and that they are operating at the top of their game even though the situation presents countless uncertainties and other risks. In this story, we see Petraeus as a two-star in command of a division, well before his later promotions and successes, and it is apparent even at this level that he is an ace at his job and is single-mindedly dedicated to the task at hand. I found this book's portrayal of genuine competence at the top level \\"in the rear with the gear\\" to be just as inspiring as the bravery and sacrifice of privates and lieutenants in an infantry platoon. You need both to win a war, and this story presents war-fighting from a position in the chain of command that is underrepresented in the current literature.Other reviewers have noted that the book's writing is a bit uneven in some places and contains some minor inaccuracies. They are correct, and for those shortcomings my review only provides four stars. In my mind, however, these occasional issues do not overly detract from the essential elements of the book's content. This is a valuable read for all officers and even NCOs who want to understand how a large unit runs and why decisions are made the way they are. It is an opportunity to gain a new perspective on higher levels within a combat organization.Along those lines, I recently read David Finkel's \\"The Good Soldiers\\", and was impressed with the book's portrayal of combat operations at the battalion level. In other words, things that concern lieutenant colonels and majors. Again, a different perspective from another level in a military organization.I think reading each of these books presents a good look at war from a commander's perspective at the platoon, company, battalion, brigade, division, and corps levels. This should be of interest to just about anyone who is interested in how wars these days are actually fought. The conflicts of the last 11 years have provided us with a host of talented writers and a great number of excellent books to better understand success and failure in a combat zone. Those I have listed here are among the best I've read, but I'm sure there are many others."},{"Title":"In the Company of Soldiers : A Chronicle of Combat","review":"Mr. Atkinson's writting style make this an extremely easy read - perfect for a summer weekend. The subject is very serious but, as seen from the high level command level, this is not a blow by blow combat tale. It does capture the pace and professionalism of the US armed forces and the effect that the US military has on organized resistance. It makes it perfectly clear why the assymetrical war in Iraq and Afganistan can last for years after a \\"war\\" that lasted for less than 2 months. If the US military can find you, it is pretty hopeless but it is a military set up for the battlefield not for an insurgency (but then again - what organization is really set up to deal with insurgencies in a land where the police force is small, targeted and untrustworthy?).A great read - highly worth the time."},{"Title":"Brainwashing, Drunks & Madness: Memoirs of a Medical Icon","review":"This book is an absolutely fascinating historical account of 20th century medicine, psychiatry and a unique man.

The title, &quot;chaplain,&quot; suggests someone who gives a bit of moral advice or adds some solemnity to a public occasion. Linzey does much more than that. For many years, he has been developing one of the most creative and constructive Christian theological projects. He is a systematic thinker in the sense that he examines and transforms every aspect of Christian doctrine from the perspective of compassion for animals. Yet he also is faithful and consistent in his appropriation of the Christian tradition. Indeed, he manages to recover aspects of Christianity of which even the most faithful are frequently unaware. I have often taught Linzey's earlier book, Animal Theology, in a college course, and that book is pitched at a slightly higher level than this one. But this book, Animal Gospel, is his most passionate and engaging work yet. If you are interested in what Christian theologians say about the animal rights movement, this is the one book to get. Linzey blends the theoretical and the practical in a comprehensive vision of what it means to be a Christian, not just what it means to be an animal rights activist. If you read this book, your views of Christianity will be changed as much as your views of animals. My only problem with Linzey is that sometimes he is too quick to use the language and assumptions of the animal rights movement, but the more I read of him, the more I realize that he uses the rhetoric of rights as a strategy to best implement the compassionate ideal of Christian faith. There is a growing movement among theologians to talk not just about the environment or nature but also about our specific obligations to animals, and we owe this movement to Linzey's pioneering work."},{"Title":"Animal Gospel","review":"Once again, Dr. Andrew Linzey has delivered a wonderful and inspiring appeal for Christians and peoples of every faith to embrace the highest virtue - EMPATHY. He proclaims that a heightened sense of empathy brings us closer to God and permits us to live in harmony with one another and all of creation. A commitment to jump off our &quot;human&quot; pedestal and experience the wonders and beauty of God's creation in a humble and respectful manner is the true essence of Spirituality. &quot;Animal Gospel&quot; is a truly enlightening exposition."},{"Title":"Animal Gospel","review":"Andrew Linzey provides a thought-provoking, erudite argument for why Christians ought to be concerned about animals. He does not resort to ill-founded arguments or emotionally manipulative pleas. Rather, he outlines in logical fashion the issues at hand: Animals are one of God's concerns; because God cares for animals so should those who claim to be God's people.The first part of the book makes the case for animal rights--but Linzey carefully defines what he means by animal rights. Animals have rights because they were created by God and have intrinsic value as a result. Linzey does not put animals above humans or even discuss them in terms of \\"equal rights.\\" Instead he asserts that while humans are given dominion over all creation, dominion is defined as service, protection and compassion. In other words, dominion is not unrestrained power and the right of superiority, it is the responsibility to love the world as God loves--via service. He does not minimize humanity, but demands that our humanocentric belief that God is only concerned about humans is simply wrong.Linzey challenges the church to rise up to her responsibility. In several chapters, he outlines how irresponsibly the church has acted in regard to the environment and animals--both in theology and praxis. Yet, in other chapters he describes signs of hope-moments when Christians have stood up for ethical treatment of animals.Linzey has spent years of his career developing his arguments. This book represents a collection of his best work (several chapters were previously published in other formats). The work is copiously footnoted and rigorously researched. For anyone who wishes to explore the issue animal rights from a Christian perspective, this is an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"Animal Gospel","review":"10 STAR BOOK!This book represents a REAL MASTERPIECE of work--VERY DEEP PROBING, DEEP REASONING AND THOUGHT, and VERY DEEP HEART work into Christian theology and the rights of non-humans.

These three books go together--\\"Animal Gospel\\" and \\"Why Animal Suffering Matters\\" are the final arguments.The following has been added September 2009 in order to support comments I made in another review I did:Reverend Andrew Linzey is a spiritual leader, religious leader. I adore him. Here are some excerpts from his \\"The Ethics of Hunting\\": You can read the entire \\"The Ethics of Hunting\\" on the internet. Everything in quotations are his words and I do not claim them to be my own.The following excerpts are from Reverend Andrew Linzey, British priest and theologian. They are part of his report entitled The Ethics of Hunting.\\"There is ample evidence that mammals experience not just pain, but also suffering, that is, stress, terror, shock, anxiety, fear, trauma, foreboding as well as pain, and that only to a greater or lesser degree than we do ourselves. Animals and humans show a common ancestor, show similar behaviour and have physiological similarities. Because of these triple conditions, these shared characteristics, it is perfectly logical to believe that animals experience many of the same emotions as humans. Logic tells us this and we do not need scientific data to believe in the suffering of animals. In fact, the onus should be on those people who try to deny that animals have such emotions. They must explain how in one species nerves act in one way and completely differently in another. They must explain why we believe that a child who cries and runs away from us after we have stamped on his or her foot is unhappy while a dog who behaves in precisely the same manner is said to present us with insufficient information for us to believe that the dog is unhappy. In the words of Konrad Lorenz, \`The similarity [between humans and animals] is not only functional but historical, and it would be an actual fallacy not to humanize.'\\"\\"It is not enough to say that animals should not suffer or that suffering is wrong, what is needed is an account of why that is so. Only when this case has been made can we fully appreciate the strength of the moral obligation to avoid harm. It is important to understand that this sensitivity has strong rational foundations. As I have written elsewhere:\\"It is important to spell out precisely why animals should be regarded as constituting a special moral case, or as having a special claim on our attention. When analyzed impartially we can see that there are a range of considerations that are peculiarly relevant to animals and also to some vulnerable human subjects. For example:\\"ANIMALS CANNOT GIVE OR WITHHOLD THEIR CONSENT\\"The point is obvious but it has considerable moral significance. It is commonly accepted that \`informed consent' is required in advance by any person who wishes to override the legitimate interests of other. The absence of this factor requires, at the very least, that we should exercise special care and thoughtfulness. The very (obvious) fact that animals cannot agree to the purposes to which they are put increases our responsibility and singles them out (along with others) as a special case.\\"ANIMALS CANNOT REPRESENT OR VERBALISE THEIR OWN INTERESTS.\\"Again the point is obvious but it has serious moral implications. Individuals who cannot adequately represent themselves have to depend upon others to do so. Burns writes that, \`Because it is not possible to ask an animal about its welfare, or to know what is going on inside its head, it is necessary to draw up some indicators which enable one to make a judgement' (para 6.10; p. 108). In fact, many animals show quite plainly that they are afraid, threatened, and so forth. But because they cannot communicate in words, we often ignore their cries, their avoidance behaviour, and their clear signs of stress. Scientific knowledge certainly helps, but it should not mask the point that it is precisely the animals' inability to communicate with us -- at least in a straightforward way -- which should invoke in us an increased sense of obligation and mark them out as a special case.\\"ANIMALS ARE MORALLY INNOCENT.\\"Because animals are not moral agents with free will, they cannot -- strictly speaking -- be regarded as morally responsible. That granted, it follows that they can never (unlike, arguably, adult humans) deserve suffering, or be improved morally by it. Animals can never merit suffering; proper recognition of this consideration makes any infliction of suffering upon them particularly problematic.\\"ANIMALS ARE VULNERABLE AND DEFENSELESS.\\"They are wholly, or almost wholly, within our power and entirely subject to our will. Except in rare circumstances, animals pose us no direct threat, constitute no risk to our life, and possess no means of offence or defense. Moral solicitude should properly relate to, and be commensurate with, the relative vulnerability of the subjects concerned.\\"\\"The key point to note is that these considerations make the infliction of suffering and death on animals not easier-- but harder to justify. Perhaps the best analogy is the special solicitude now rightly extended to weaker members of the human community, for example, newly born infants or young children. It is, inter alia, their sheer vulnerability, their inability to articulate their needs, and their moral innocence, that compels us to insist that they be treated with special care and protected from exploitation. But, if this argument is sound, it applies to sentient mammals as well.\\"\\"Hunting offends two basic moral principles. The first is that it is intrinsically wrong to deliberately inflict suffering on a sentient mammal for purposes other than its own individual benefit (for example, in a veterinary operation). This, I submit, is the most satisfactory definition of \`cruelty.' Historically and legally, the term \`unnecessary suffering' has been used and in its time may have had its pragmatic uses. But with hindsight, we can see that this term involved the problematic implication that there are \`necessary' cruelties, or that cruel acts could be morally licit. What follows ineluctably from the above considerations for moral solicitude is that there are certain prima facie acts against the vulnerable, the innocent and the defenseless (both human and animal) which cannot be other than morally unconscionable, and the deliberate infliction of suffering is surely one of them. We do not speak, for example, of \`necessary rape' or \`necessary torture' or \`necessary child abuse,' and neither should we do so in the case of the deliberate infliction of suffering on animals.\\"\\"But there is also a second, even more fundamental principle, namely, that it is intrinsically wrong to deliberately cause suffering for the purposes of amusement, recreation, or in the name of sport. It is sometimes argued that not all hunters enjoy the pursuit of their quarry and that may be true. But that hunters are involved in a collective activity that has the definite and deliberate aim of harrying a living creature to its death (which in the process causes suffering) is indisputable.\\"\\"It is important to understand why taking pleasure from the cruel death of an animal is nothing less than morally evil. In order to do so, we need briefly to give some account of some of the major theories of normative ethics. Roughly, they can be divided into three: (1) Deontological theories which hold that there is an objective standard of right and wrong and that there are duties incumbent on each individual, some of which are absolutely binding. (2) Virtue theories which hold that the standard of right or wrong consists in acts or behaviour likely to promote individual virtue or the \`virtuous life' -- specifically the classical virtues, such as prudence, justice, courage and temperance. And (3) utilitarian theories which broadly hold that the best consequences will be those that include the greatest possible balance of pleasure over pain. These theories differ in the account given of our obligations to animals, but the important thing to note is that all these theories, and their classical and modern exponents, would draw an absolute line at taking pleasure from cruelty.\\" In accordance with the Greatest Happiness Principle, of classical utilitarian theory, \\"the pain of animals must always be taken into consideration when coming to a moral decision. Certainly the death of any animal and its pain would outweigh the pleasure achieved in hunting and one would thus have to conclude that hunting cannot be morally justified. And, moreover, the taking of pleasure in pain or the making a sport of it would deserve the highest kind of moral censure.\\"\\"Unsurprisingly, Peter Singer, perhaps the leading contemporary utilitarian ethicist, is resolutely opposed to hunting and asserts that, \\"The trouble is that the authorities responsible for wildlife have a \`harvest' mentality, and are not interested in finding techniques of population control that would reduce the number of animals to be \`harvested' by hunters.\\"19 Suffice to say, it would take a tortuous calculation to justify recreational hunting by reference to orthodox utilitarian theory.\\"\\"Of particular importance is the united view expressed by classical theorists that cruelty has anti-social implications. It was this awareness that drove the humanitarian movement of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to oppose bull-baiting, bear-baiting, cock-throwing (throwing sticks at a cock) and cockfighting, and why practices, such as bull-fighting, and rodeos were made illegal in this country. If one looks at the early debates concerning animal protection, two rationales are frequently prevalent: Cruelty is unjust to other creatures, and also harms the perpetrator by diminishing his or her humanity. Consider, for example, the celebrated preamble to Lord Erskine's famous Cruelty to Animals Bill in 1809: \`...the abuse of that [human] dominion by cruel and oppressive treatment of such animals, is not only highly unjust and immoral, but most pernicious in its example, having an evident tendency to harden the heart against the natural feelings of humanity.'\\"\\"This latter claim was, at the time, largely rhetorical. It was simply assumed, in accordance with classical moral thinking, that this must be so. But there is now an accumulating amount of evidence linking violence and abuse of animals to other forms of violence, abuse, or anti-social behaviour. One recent authoritative work maintains that: \`Violence directed against animals is often a coercion device and an early indicator of violence that may escalate in range and severity against other victims.'\\"\\"Not least of all, we should not overlook the capacity of human beings to become desensitized through habitual exposure to practices which involve suffering and violence to animals. This has been, as we have seen, a frequent concern of philosophers and moralists. The question has to be faced: What example of respect, or rather disrespect, for animals is learnt through hunting? John Locke, writing as early as 1693, maintained that the education of children must abhor any tolerance of cruelty since \`the custom of tormenting and killing beasts will, by degrees, harden their minds even toward men; and they who delight in the suffering and destruction of inferior creatures, will not be apt to be very compassionate or benign to those of their own kind.' Specifically when unchecked, \`unnatural cruelty is planted in us; and what humanity abhors, custom reconciles and recommends to us, by laying in it the way of honour. Thus by fashion and opinion, that comes to be a pleasure, which in itself neither is, nor can be any.'\\"\\"The first and most obvious is that nature is an essentially self-regulating system; animals breed in relation to the food and environment available. Secondly, as Burns notes, there is no obvious \`equilibrium level' (para 2; p. 82) for each species; it is now held by many that populations rise and fall as a matter of course. It is believed that animal populations cycle just as trees, grasses and, in general, plants cycle. Thirdly, killing (\`culling') does not necessarily \`control' any species since the species itself compensates for any dent in its population. Scientists talk of compensatory reproduction. This is a well-known phenomena; many animals compensate for losses by breeding at an earlier stage, having bigger litters, and so forth.\\"FINALLY:\\"Given the weakness of the case for control by hunting, it is astonishing that society should have tolerated it as long as it has, especially since comparable acts against domestic animals are illegal. That society has tolerated it, and that people who hunt so vehemently support it, says something about the mechanism of moral rationalization that bedevils all attempts to think clearly and impartially about the morality of our treatment of animals. Since we now know that the case for control by hunting is negligible, we can only logically suppose other motives are in play, be they social, cultural, or sheer pleasure seeking. It is the recognition of this latter factor, namely pleasure seeking, that above all makes hunting so especially morally abhorrent. We may recall Macaulay's famous rebuke that the Puritans objected to bull-baiting, not because it hurt the bull, but because it gave pleasure to the spectators. But the Puritans were only half-wrong. Both the pain of the hunted and the pleasure of the hunter should equally concern us morally. Both constitute an offence which is so grave and so deep that abolition is the only moral course open to us.\\""},{"Title":"Animal Gospel","review":"I already had a copy signed by the author which was given to my husband.

Because Galileo so overshadowed earlier scientists, their names are rarely heard, and many science students have the impression that Galileo came up with these ideas in a vacuum, since their historical antecedents never get discussed much. For example, how many students are aware of the contributions of earlier mathematicians and scientists such as Nicholas of Cusa or Nicole d'Oresme?This book will rectify that impression. The discussion of the contributions of late Medieval and early Renaissance schools that made important contributions to the area of mechanics and physics, such as the School of Chartres (to mention just one example), I thought were especially good.

Dijksterhuis offers subjective interpretations only occasionally, but when he does he is very dogmatic. Fortunately, it is easy to refute some of his whiggish ideas by his own words.Consider the following conclusion on Kepler (pp. 321-322): \\"If the question was asked what are the new elements in Kepler's work, it has to be replied that these are not in the first place results which greatly deviate from the old system; the main achievement is a method that is very clearly different. The principal features of this method are:(1) Rejection of all arguments which are solely based on tradition and authority.(2) Independence of scientific inquiry of all philosophical and theological tenets.(3) Constant application of the mathematical mode of thought in the formulation and elaboration of hypotheses.(4) Rigorous verification of these results deduced from the latter by means of an empiricism raised to the highest degree of accuracy.\\"(1)-(4) is a very poor characterisation of science. No true scientist ever conformed to these principles, certainly not Kepler, of all people, whose Mysterium Cosmographicum and Harmonice Mundi (virtually ignored here) violate all of them from start to finish, nor Galileo, nor Newton, etc. Let me give a few illustrations.(2). \\"[Kepler] passes without the slightest effort from the world-picture to the Trinity, and it is by no means inconceivable that the resemblance he sees between the two helped to inspire one of his most fruitful ideas, the conception of the sun as the causa efficiens of planetary motion.\\" (pp. 305-306).(4).

There is virtually no support for \\"the myth that Galileo was a great advocate of experiment\\" (p. 353). On the contrary, \\"in Galileo's work, verification by experiment sometimes appears to be of secondary importance because it may be regarded as somewhat superfluous if the preceding reasoning seems very convincing; thus only purely mental experiments remain or the experiments are only described without being performed.

Although \\"the aim of the Cartesian method is indeed to cause all scientific thinking to take place in the manner of mathematics\\" (p. 405), thus in principle endorsing (3), \\"few marks of it are to be found in the work of Descartes himself\\" (p. 405). In fact, perhaps the main appeal of his work is his rejection of (2): \\"To a considerable extent ... men will no doubt ... have been impressed by the unity of the world-picture in which his powerful mind had blended natural science, philosophy, and religion\\" (p. 408).(2). \\"The strong influence which Newton's religious ideas exercised on his scientific thought is revealed, among other things, in his belief in the existence of absolute space and absolute time. The former to him symbolizes God's omnipresence, the latter His eternity.\\" (p. 487).(2) and (4). It is conventional to praise Newton for trying to answer only \\"how\\" and not \\"why\\" objects fall, planets move, etc.; \\"Hypotheses non fingo\\", as he says in the general scholium of the Principia. However, \\"on the very same page he puts forward a supposition 'about a most subtle spirit which pervades and lies hid in all gross bodies ...' He recognizes, it is true, that the experiments available to him are insufficient for accurately establishing and proving the laws which the operation of this spirit obeys. However, the fact that he concludes his great work with the mention of this fantastic idea clearly proves that the occupation of framing hypotheses exercised a greater fascination upon him than might be expected after his blunt declaration of policy.\\" (p. 484). In fact, \\"the great ingenuity he displays in this matter leads us to suppose that the saying Hypotheses non fingo is an expression of self-denial. Actually he dearly loved to frame hypotheses, but he forced himself to refrain from doing so\\" (p. 486), for religious reasons, but \\"however zealously Newton may attempt to safeguard religion against the dangers of threatening it from the side of mechanicism as a metaphysics, as a physicist he is ... greatly impressed by the successes it had achieved as a scientific method\\" (p. 488).Indeed, the science of Kepler and Newton et al. conforms less to (1)-(4) than to the principle that \\"it is better to maintain the order of nature and be in conflict with the senses ... even though in doing so we fail to solve certain sophisms to which we are led by the senses\\" (p. 214; Roger Bacon, quoted with contempt by Dijksterhuis) or to Dijksterhuis' characterisation of Greek scientists as \\"too much concerned to satisfy the human craving for a picture of the universe that could be readily understood and seemed to obey simple laws of harmony\\" (p. 119). Similarly, Dijksterhuis' description of \\"the early scientific thought of the Greeks\\" could very fittingly be applied word-by-word to Kepler, namely that they were \\"indulged in fantastic speculations ... which took too little account of hard reality to lead to fruitful theories. It is not for nothing that the aged Egyptian priest in the Timaeus says to Solon that the Hellenes are always like children.\\" (p. 72). Kepler's childlikeness allows him to go beyond (1)-(4), while, as Dijksterhuis is forced to admit, the most unchildish of the Greeks, Aristotle, got nowhere with his supposedly mature (1)-(4)-ish attitude: Aristotle replaced \\"the tendency ... of constructing an imaginary nature by reasoning from preconceived principles and forcing reality more or less to adapt itself to this construction\\" by \\"a purely empirical attitude, based on the recognition that the true knowledge of nature can only be gained from carefully collected observational data\\", but this \\"does not ... explain why the ... achievements of Aristotle in the department of physics are still so small\\" (p. 69)."},{"Title":"The mechanization of the world picture, (A Galaxy book GB298)","review":"Add my unreserved kudos to the initial 5-star review below, and then some! Dijksterhuis' \\"Science In The Middle Ages\\" section, based on the relatively extensive source material surviving from that period, may be the more comprehensive; but the preceding \\"Legacy Of Antiquity\\" section constitutes one of the two or three most detailed and incisive summaries available of the several lines of \\"Presocratic\\" philosophers who set the stage for Aristotle and Plato (who were in turn the two biggest influences on Medieval science, philosophy, and philosophy of science).The book's subtitle names Pythagoras as the starting point, but the \\"Main Currents Of Greek Philosophical Thought About Nature\\" section quickly flashes all the way back, via Parmenides and his Eleatic \\"change and difference are total illusions\\" School, to early beginnings: Empedocles and Anaxagoras, as the founders of the \\"corpuscular/dynamic\\" tradition that would culminate in Leucippus' and Democritus' widely resisted \\"atomic\\" theory.The later classical thinkers reacted to Parmenides' critique of the \\"primary substance\\" theory of Thales and his followers -- the Founding Founders of Western philosophy, mathematics and science -- and to his \\"Change Is All\\" nemesis, Heraclitus -- in various and distinctive ways. Dijksterhuis' analysis of the essence and variabilities of corpuscular (\\"tiny particles in the void\\") theory packs more insight into fewer paragraphs than any other work on the history of science that I know of.Plato is handled well, and Aristotle is, deservedly, examined closely and at length. Islamic contributions, Renaissance and Enlightenment perspectives, and the influences of astronomy, chemistry, mechanics and more are interwoven in a masterly display of scholarly attainment and principled synthesis.Hence, this title is engrossing reading in its own right, as well as being an essential reference for anyone interested in researching/writing about the origins of natural science and related philosophical matters (my own focus is partly on the evolution of the notion of \\"explanation\\", starting with the Age of Myth and transitioning into the Greek mode that would define Western science and, as the author rightfully claims, a good deal of general culture as well; hence the great value here for me.)That transition from myth to methodology, by the way, isn't nearly as cut-and-dried as it is commonly presented in popular surveys and school texts. Hence, a highly recommended adjunct to the present title is a pair of complementary masterworks, \\"Before Philosophy\\" by Frankfort et. al. and John Burnet's \\"Early Greek Philosophy\\". The former is a superbly insightful study of the nature of the mythological modes that preceded a philosophy built upon what Frankfort so pithily calls \\"the autonomy of thought\\"; the latter provides a wealth of detail that Dijksterhuis largely omits in keeping with his narrower focus, along with a wealth of enlightening analysis and characterization (motives, foundational notions, cultural countercurrents, etc.).Both are bargain aftermarket titles, and compulsive reads for anyone the least bit interested in the nature and history of reasoned thought.In rereading this review, I find myself having to add two more key resources:First is Schlegel's \\"From Myth To The Modern Mind\\", which manages to complement both Frankfurt and Dijksterhuis with its insightful introductory survey of the history of anthropological views on the \\"primitive\\" mind, and its focus on the evolution of cognitive processes underlying the culture of myth and the transition to early philosophy and science. This work is a real eye opener, and an invaluable reference for researchers in the field of the evolution of human thought.Second is Bertrand Russell's \\"A History Of Western Philosophy\\", a cultural-context-themed and brilliantly original survey rightly described as an unparalleled achievement in this overcrowded field of exposition -- as well as being downright smileworthy in places, due to Russell's resolute lifelong determination to be flatly unimpressed by (practically) everybody.Enjoy, enjoy! And do check my other reviews for some great leads, as I only take time to comment on exceptionally valuable and interesting titles...."},{"Title":"The mechanization of the world picture, (A Galaxy book GB298)","review":"A leek as I am in the field of Math, physiscs &amp; Chemistry I am very intetested in the historical progress of this fields, that eventually all come together in the great Isaack Newton, and in fact that is where this books is ending.I read it cos I was interested in what there is exactly to be ment with a complete mechanical view on the world, this book gave me an idea of what that would mean. And while I never took exact science classes I have deep admiration for all the one who contributed to this field. My interests came purely from a philosophical perspective, and till about halfway the book, that what you read is not so much different than reading any regular philosophybook, but then its getting tougher, if you dont have any possession of exact science knowledge. Even while the writer of the book often points out that this book is ment for those who are as a tabula rassa (to speak with Lockes words) in this field. But I thought that it still was not easy. I cant say I understand all the theories that have passed bye, but I can now see a beter historical line from the classical days to Newton, that explains cleary how science have developed and who were responsible for what. especially the more social debates, influence on society an d how it changed peoples thoughts very slowly, I read with great interest. Unfortunatly there was to much abstract and to less social historical background.Still I think a memorial achievement that everyone that is seriously interested in philosophy, history of science, scientific revolution, enlightenment or before you are going to read the works of the masters, should read."},{"Title":"The mechanization of the world picture, (A Galaxy book GB298)","review":"Dijksterhuis' The Mechanization of the World Picture is a perfect example of how history of science should not be written.Being a good positivist,the author provides us with a rationalist reconstruction of how elements of mechanistic discourse and practice from the time of the ancient Greeks to the eighteenth century were incorporated into the canon of modern science.Filled with anachronistic analysis, decontextualised theoretical accounts and erroneous and specious reasoning, Dijksterhuis' book provides students of the history of science with an excellent exemplar of internalist, Whig history of science according to the discredited (but still academically influential) canon of the history of ideas.While the author's recounting of a vast swathe of historical development may be impressive to the novice, his picture of the history of science as a gradual accumulation of better and more inclusive and comprehensive scientific theories through the application of a single, universally applicable scientific method finds very little support amongst the majority of professional historians of science today."},{"Title":"Four theories of the press: The authoritarian, libertarian, social responsibility, and Soviet communist concepts of what the press should be and do","review":"\\"Four Theories of the Press\\" has, for years, been required reading for senior journalism students in most American universities. For many students, it is the only time journalism \\"ethics\\" was presented in the classroom even though the book is not about ethics. It is about four classic theories of the way mass media presents information to consumers. To summarize the four theories Siebert says:-- The authoritarian system is owned by the state, which controls mass media. This is practiced around the globe in places like North Korea and Iraq.-- The libertarian theory is essentially to journalism what laissez faire is to economics -- complete freedom of expression and ideas with no controls. This is essentially the World Wide Web.-- The Soviet system is, like the authoritarian system, state-owned. The difference is the Soviet system regulates its own content. With the death of the USSR and its satellites two decades ago, the remaining users include Cuba and some African countries.-- The social responsibility model was the American press beginning in the postwar period where muckraking and media investigation of wrongdoing was practiced to make the population wiser and to help improve society. This model existed in major media outlets up until about the time of the Internet. Now, with newspapers dying everywhere and electronic media competing not only with entertainment, cable outlets and the Internet, this theory is dust.Today, the mainstream American press doesn't adhere to any of these theories. The social responsibility model requires resources most American media outlets no longer can afford including the resource that it can alienate its few remaining advertisers that pay the bills.Instead, this has been replaced by a more highly-defined model where local outlets don't cover much national or international news and national models work to capture a fragment of the audience by appealing to their politics, prurient interest, or other market faction. Wise media outlets are beginning to understand that free is not a good business model and they are restricting their Web access to subscribers of their hardcopy or finite products. This is likely a wave of the future and may help the American media move back to the social responsibility model.Meanwhile, the libertarian press thrives but it is every man or woman for himself or herself on the Internet, which is increasingly the dominant communications media for everyone. From Vonage and other companies selling cheap phone service through an Internet connection to the likes of AOL and other major Internet access networks providing their own news, the world has become Wikipedia-ized. Today, the news media is far more individualized than its ever been and public content entities like Wikipedia allow anyone to become a scholar or journalist.Government and private enterprise have capitalized on this trend by turning their communications entities into news-providing resources that can caputre events and give raw footage or original stories to local news media outlets. The local outlets, which are being resource-squeezed by the economy and competition and no longer have the resources to get this stuff themselves, gladly accept these freebies, thinking they still own the means to production like in the good old days. This is another way ownership of the media has changed in the Internet era and should probably be the basis of a \\"fifth\\" theory of the press in the 21st century, one where news media, government and business cooperate instead of compete, much like the three entities did as Japan and Germany were rebuilt after World War II.Since \\"Four Theories of the Press\\" was developed in response to the limitations of the printing press and rarely upgraded in the electronic 20th century, its relevance in the 21st century is questionable. The idea that news media plays an exalted role in American life is no longer accepted as polls show journalists and media outlets on a par with car salesmen. So this book, while an entertaining timepiece of the way things used to be, probably no longer reflects the realities of the world unitl a fifth theory is included."},{"Title":"Four theories of the press: The authoritarian, libertarian, social responsibility, and Soviet communist concepts of what the press should be and do","review":"This item arrived in perfect condition as promised and in time for my daughter's college class.

Demanding that black demonstrators and white demonstrators be able to walk together, the peace marchers were imprisoned, leading many in the group to fast and employ other nonviolent techniques of protest. Their presence and discipline had a lasting effect on the Albany Movement and other nonpacifist civil rights groups in the South.The remainder of the book relates Deming's final protest walk some twenty years later in 1983 with the Seneca Women's Peace Encampment, a group of women-only peace marchers scheduled to walk from Seneca, New York, the site of the first Women's Rights Declaration in 1848, to the missile base in Romulus, New York. This nonviolent march in honor of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other feminist heroines was interrupted by protestors. Deming and fifty-three other women were arrested and spent five days in a Waterloo, New York, jail. These events are told in \\"A New Spirit Moves Among Us,\\" an essay written in letter form to a friend in defense of women-only actions, an interview with Deming conducted after her release from jail, and a statement of purpose issued from jail by the Waterloo Fifty-Four.As Grace Paley notes in her introduction, Prisons That Could Not Hold is \\"the story of two walks undertaken to help change the world without killing it. Barbara Deming was an important member of both. Twenty years of her brave life lie between them. . . . That difference between the two walks measures a development in movement history and also tells the distance Barbara traveled in those twenty years.\\"Barbara Deming (1917-1984) was a writer and social activist.
