Along with other strange stuff like magic tricks etc. It shows the kind of stuff previous generations of boys were capable of. Before the age of class action suits, product liability suits, insurance settlements, government consumer agencies etc. The book is a collection of articles originally written for young boys as part of Popular Mechanics Magazine, on how to do all kinds of interesting and dangerous stuff!Like early biplane hang gliders, making moulds for metal foundries, do it yourself glass blowing, miniature cannons, an automatic washer using water power, how to make dry cell batteries recharge by drilling and injecting chemicals, a mission-style concrete dog house, kiln, still, do it yourself plating, boats, make electric motors, a lathe from pipe fittings, how to &quot;fume&quot; oak with ammonia, how to make a peddle powered trolly line, improvised microscopes, windmills, &quot;wondergraphs&quot; (making curved lines like used on dollar bills), camera obscura, etc.Am not sure these things are under copyright anymore, as the copyright changed from 75 years to 100 years or so after Disney lobbied to protect Steamboat Willie. If this was in the Public Domain, it would be interesting to update it and publish it on the web for people in less &quot;developed&quot; countries.Interesting for historical interest if nothing else. One little article shows how to make a table fan that doesn't use electricity. Before the age of home power, you could use a little water wheel made of tin to run a fan off the home water faucet. In those days, they didn't have water meters. Of little practical use today, but it shows what people can do and how to do it. A little bit like an old boy scout manual, but more mechanical. The book is not organized at all, just a bunch of articles about projects, maybe in chronological order as published, but it has a good index. Some small one-paragraph items are repeated, probably to use up space at the bottom of the page in the original issues. I found myself writing my own list of dozens of interesting project and page numbers in pencil on the inside cover.If you have an interest in making things and turn of the century history, it is a fun book, and a great value, In My Humble Opinion.gw 9/03"},{"Title":"Practical Projects for the Handy Man (Popular Mechanics)","review":"I purchased this book for my son-in-law at his suggestion.

It was well thought out, easy to understand and set out nicely too. The text was just the right size and was seperated just well enough to make it easy to read. If you had a particular question in mind, you could easily skip to that section but you can just as easily read it from front to back, which is what I did.This book is a must for anyone interested in the basics of Judaism from it's major holidays, to what the Torah and Midrash are, to Judaic views on Adoption, Birth Control, Abortion and other ideas. It talks about thye Mezuzah, Jewish Dietary Laws, Traditions, Rituals, Converting, Zionism, The Holocaust and the different Modern movements. (Orthodox, Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist.

The authors lay out the calendar, then an explanation of each feast and how it is celebrated. The information if for celebrating in the home, but it also goes over what you would see at a synagogue celebration and why it is done that way. There is a chapter on how to convert to Judaism, but the book is not designed to convince anyone to join, but simply to state how, just in case that is why you brought the book. The book briefly goes over Judaism's view of God, but has a bibliography so that someone could acquire other books if the desire was to go deeper. The main emphasis of the book is on how to create the Jewish spirit or atmosphere in ones home. Another interesting chapter of the book deals with the diffences and similarities between Orthodox, reform, conservative, and reconstructionist Jews. There is a great glossary of terms at the back of the book, but all terms are defined in the book as you go. The chapters are short and reader friendly. If you are looking for a good brief overview, this will definately serve that purpose."},{"Title":"Every Person's Guide To Judaism -","review":"This book provides a concise review of the Judaism.

I have eight more to read. This book is the best of what I've read so far. Katz gives a clear explanation of why Rome's fall was the result of many factors, including financial turmoil, cultural and religious shifts and infiltration of non-Romans into the military machine. Katz is at his best in the relatively long chapter five, Europe in Transition. In it, he surveys the many changes that accompanied the decline of Rome and Germanic cultures, the division of the eastern and western empires, the rising cost of centralized government, the rise of the Roman church and changes in art and architecture. I recommend this well-written little survey to anyone wanting a quick background on the fall of Rome."},{"Title":"The Folks in the Valley: A Pennsylvania Dutch ABC","review":"I used the book with my students and they really enjoyed it.

The reproductions I've seen in the past reduce the size of the art like watching a 70mm film on a regular TV set.Nothing is being produced like this anymore. McCay's talent is beyond amazing, it would take a normal artist months to produce one page like he was doing every week. The book is exhausting and I can only read a dozen pages at a time. These are exact reproductions of actual newsprint pages from the time so all the printing imperfections are here but that should not dissuade the appreciation of this comic.If you are a true drawn art aficionado find the money for this.

Did not expect the amount of artwork and extras in this book! Windsor McCay was a revolutionary artist before his time!! Wish he were around today....PHENOMENAL!!!"},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"This book is the one. I was made aware of Winsor McKay's Little Nemo in the late 1970's, and have been a fan ever since. I've been amazed at how far ahead of the curve McKay was, and how much of an influence he was on so much art so much after his demise.The adventures of Little Nemo were wonderful- by that I mean full of wonder. The colors were bold- way bolder for his day than anyone else. The panels blew off the limitations of convention as McKay left the restrictions of flat panels behind, letting the story demand its own, unique and innovative visual perspectives. Uh-oh- I'm sounding like an academic here, and I'm not. I'm a Little Nemo enthusiast and I'll let the experts explain in laborious detail what I cannot.What I can explain is that Nemo was a startling experiment in his time, and if you want a definitive book that will allow you access to his adventures in Slumberland, then this is the one. If you want a more comprehensive overview, I guess Canemaker is your man. Canemaker's is a great book, too, and has the biographical details. This book has enough text for you to understand the strip in the context of its time, but lets the art speak for itself. This is the best book I've ever seen for the sheer joy of Little Nemo.This is the only book that reproduces the comics in full size, and the editor swears that he has taken all the necessary pains to get the colors right. I will take his word for it, as I have only seen Nemo in other books and in preserved strips of the day, and who knows what the original colors were? Mr. Maresca has sworn that he took the time to get the colors right, and they are fantastic. And seeing it in its original size is a revelation. Nemo was magical, the Harry Potter of his day.I have collected Nemo books and emphemera, and this is the one that is the most...exciting. Another bonus for me is that it has strips that I've never seen before. And the strips are reproduced in sequence when sequence is important, so a story can play out over several weekly installments. This is a big, oversized delight, and if you can't enjoy Nemo, you can't enjoy Shrek or The Incredibles. Says me."},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"Beautiful dreamer: Winsor McCay's 'Little Nemo in Slumberland'By Michael BrowningPalm Beach Post Staff WriterFriday, December 02, 2005Winsor McCay dreamed in rainbows, rainbows almost measurelesslylarge and lovely, shapes outswept in perfect perspective acrossspacious pages of newsprint in a Sunday comic strip that is stillregarded as a sustained pinnacle of fantastic design andimagination: Little Nemo in Slumberland.He did it a hundred years ago, from 1905 to 1912, before TV, almostbefore movies, when the comic strip itself was only eight years old,and was regarded as just a gag and a novelty. He worked modestly anddutifully all his life, drawing, drawing, drawing, riding the Eltrain from Sheepshead Bay to Manhattan every day, laboring in ashabby office, always wearing his hat, even indoors, even whileworking.He was silently working wonders. Practically plotless as a dreamitself, Little Nemo is today regarded as the most beautiful work ofgraphic art ever to appear in a newspaper.The mechanics of it were simple. It would begin with a fancifulframe, exquisitely drawn. Then McCay would go to town, building thefancy to impossible heights, ever-more-marvelous reaches of visualimagery, until at last the whole thing collapses and, in a tinyframe at the lower right-hand corner, Little Nemo wakes up andrealizes it was all a dream.It was visually astounding. It still is. Yet people wrapped fish inMcCay's masterpieces; they lit stoves with his pages. Little Nemowas never much appreciated at the time it appeared, though todayoriginal printed pages go for $30,000 or more.Now, thanks to an extraordinary new book, it is possible toappreciate what McCay had in mind, what he wrought. A selection ofthe best of his work, actual size, has come out at last. Nemo hasn'tlooked this glorious in a hundred years.Peter Maresca, a former Apple computer designer who idolizes McCay,has published at his own expense a huge handsome book, Little Nemoin Slumberland: So Many Splendid Sundays!, which costs $120.Done to honor McCay on the centenary of Little Nemo's firstappearance in print, the mega-volume measures 21 inches by 16 inchesand weighs more than 8 pounds. It was printed in Malaysia, on paperlaboriously sought out from Japan. It is so big it had to behand-bound. It exceeded the capacity of commercial bindery machines.It reproduces faithfully, and in their original size, McCay'sastounding visions in color and reproduces them \\"down to the lastpixel,\\" the publisher says.\\"This shows you the insanity of my mind,\\" Maresca said. \\"I wanted toget the exact look of the newsprint. I didn't want pristine whiteborders, and I didn't want the yellowed Scotch-taped effect. So wetook five background pages and blended them to get the right visualtexture, the grays and greens that real newsprint has, and then wehad to blow it up twice to get the exact grain. I wanted a veryauthentic background.\\"Even after a century, the splendor of McCay's work has the power totake your breath away. His huge, columned, sapphire-domed,night-clad cityscapes, his fantastic beasts, sparkling ice-caves,outsized butterflies, tremendous fireworks, dizzying perspectives,his giants, his gems, his multicolored mushrooms and airships andskyscrapers and elephants -- all these were outpoured weekly in atremendous, wide-irised, full-spectrum rush of perfect draftsmanshipthat still exceeds the special effects in most movies today.\\"He anticipates the wide screen,\\" Maresca said. \\"He loved thetheater. He captures a lot of the exploding technology of his time.He was working when the Wright brothers invented the airplane, whenthe New York subway system was being built.\\"Nowadays Nemo is revered by illustrators like Maurice Sendak, whosemagic island in Where the Wild Things Are owes a debt to McCay'sSlumberland. He also influenced Bill Watterson, whose Calvin andHobbes also has a small boy who dreams wild dreams.At the time, though, it was just one more comic strip in a host ofhigh-quality offerings being put out daily by furiously warring NewYork newspapers. It was never syndicated. It played only in NewYork.\\"It never was all that popular,\\" said Mickey Finn cartoonist MorrisWeiss, 90, of West Palm Beach, who met McCay in New York in 1934,the year before the artist died. \\"It never really took off. It wastoo whimsical.\\"Weiss was scarcely 20, McCay was nearly 68 when the two met. McCaydied shortly afterward, in July 1935.\\"He was a slight man, very quiet. He always wore his hat whileworking,\\" Weiss remembered. \\"He didn't have a big, palatial office.\\"He was very nice to me. He gave me an original of one of hispolitical cartoons. If you look at it, it's incredibly detailed. Youlook at something like that up close and you think: 'Wow, theeffort! The work!' But if you're a cartoonist, that's what you do.It isn't work. You are completely into it, and you do it.\\"McCay was born Sept. 27, 1867, in Spring Lake, Mich. He was the sonof an indulgent merchant-father who early recognized his talent.\\"I never saw a tramway or an electric light before the age of 15,\\"McCay said later. \\"But I loved to draw.\\"An art professor named John Goodeson taught McCay the power ofperspective. His lessons would result in some of the most dazzlingdrawings in newspaper history. Using perspective, McCay was able tosuggest limitless distance in the space of a few inches.The young man went to Detroit and became a quick-sketch artist in alocal \\"Dime Museum,\\" a sort of vaudeville fun-house. He enjoyed theapplause and for the rest of his life would seek fame and publicapproval that always seemed to elude him by a hair's breadth.At one point McCay was doing three separate comic strips a week aswell as appearing in a nightly vaudeville show, where the audiencewould challenge him to draw anything in a few seconds. He would. Hewas a slave to his pencil.He went to Chicago in 1889, Cincinnati in 1891 and New York in 1903.There he would work at a pace so prodigious, turning out drawings soprolifically, that their sheer volume is still staggering. They wereall done from scratch: No celluloid overlays, no Adobe Photoshop.Just ink.He began with strips titled The Jungle Imps, Mr. Goodenough,Sister's Little Sister's Beau and The Phurious Phinish of PhoolishPhilip's Phunny Phrolics. McCay finally arrived with Little SammySneeze, a running gag strip that built up to a huge climax in whicha child would sneeze and blow everything and everyone away.He struck a vein in 1904 with Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend, whichpresages Little Nemo and which purists still consider his cleverestwork. Every strip begins with an ordinary situation, which graduallygets warped, magnified, pushed and shoved out of all recognition. Inthe last frame, the hapless dreamer awakens and swears never to eatWelsh rarebit (a toasted cheese sandwich) again.The crazy dream, followed by the rude awakening, became the patternfor Little Nemo In Slumberland, McCay's masterpiece, which debutedon Oct. 15, 1905.The first strip began with Nemo flying through the air in asnowstorm, meeting strange winged animals including a kangaroo. Thevery second episode was one of McCay's masterpieces, reproduced inthe new book: A forest of multicolored mushrooms whose tall stalksbreak at last and whose caps fall in a soft avalanche. The thirdepisode had Nemo surrounded by storks on impossibly tall, glassylegs that gradually become entangled chaotically.On it went, getting more and more magnificent. The modest littledraftsman from Michigan produced Nemo every week for just over sevenyears, ending on Dec. 29, 1912.As time went by, Nemo gradually took on social issues, going to Marsin a huge, beautiful airship where he finds that a rich mogul hasbought up all the air and charges people to breathe it.\\"You have to buy your words,\\" said Maresca of that particular story.\\"The culture is completely overcrowded and polluted on Mars. On airvending machines you have signs like 'CUSS WORDS WILL NOT BE SOLD TOMINORS.' People are shipped off to work in tin cans. I find it notunlike the times we are living in now.\\"The air-monopolizing Mars-mogul was a subversive comment on theexcesses of the Gilded Age, when huge amounts of wealth seemedconcentrated in the hands of a very few people. One of them,publisher William Randolph Hearst, was to become McCay's employer.He clipped the cartoonist's wings gently, directing him to dopolitical cartoons on subjects that Hearst decreed. Nemo wasresurrected in paler and paler versions as late as 1924 to 27, butthe brilliant fire of the early strips looked more and more likeembers.McCay meekly obeyed all his bosses. The last part of his career wasa falling-off. He showed up for work each day, put in his hours,drew industriously. But apart from a foray into animated film (hisGertie the Dinosaur was one of the first cartoon movies), he neveragain produced anything as fantastic as Little Nemo.The first 5,000-copy press run of So Many Splendid Sundays isalready practically sold out, with orders coming in rapidly fromeverywhere, France in particular.\\"I'm having to ration them out,\\" Maresca said. \\"I'm trying to befair. If demand warrants, I will try to do a second printing latethis winter.\\"\\"This heartbreakingly beautiful book... \\" \\"This stunning volume... \\"\\"This beautifully done book... \\" &ugrave; cartoonists Art Spiegelman, GarryTrudeau and Patrick McDonnell have raved over the new, giganticreprint.There is a sense of justice at work here. At long last, thanks tomodern computer technology and Maresca's own personal collection ofMcCay pages, it is possible to time-travel back to those splendidSundays when you could buy a masterpiece for a few cents."},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"I had read about the size of this book, but I was truly surprised by just how large it was in my hands. It's essentially the size of entire front page of a paper like the New York Times (length-wise and width-wise). It really has to be seen (or held) to be believed. Aside from being difficult to carry on the subway and having difficulty figuring out where to put it on my shelf, the size is much appreciated.As for the inside, the images have been reproduced and cleaned-up with such loving care, it is truly amazing. While there is little information on the life of Winsor McCay, other books out there have thoroughly discussed it (the Canemaker McCay book with Sendak introduction is worth getting for those interested). Around 100 of Maresca's favourites have been chosen to represent Nemo, some of them being the most complex of McCay's Little Nemo series.My only regret is that there is not more. The editor has indicated that he will not release another volume, but I wish he would reconsider. A few years back, Fantagraphics released six books of all of Little Nemo's exploits, but those books, while nicely done, reproduce Nemo in smaller format, and they have long since gone out of print (as will this book soon I'm sure). Further, as Maresca chose 100 of the best pages, what little continuity exists in Little Nemo is somewhat lost. Granted, each Sunday's adventure was often independent of the previous Sunday's, but not always.Regardless, Maresca has done an incredible job and should be commended for helping preserve some of the most incredible work by an underappreciated American artist. Surprisingly, Maresca could not get a publisher to take on this project, such that it was self-published. Hopefully this edition will do well, and there will be more to come either from Maresca or a publisher who realizes that a full-sized complete reproduction of McCay's work would be a worthwhile and profitable task to undertake."},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"These are the best reprints of Little Nemo I have ever seen. The paper is off-white, the colors are bright - there is no need to buy the original sheets from hundred years ago any longer. But don't expect lesser known pages, they have all been reprinted by Remco and Fantagraphics before. We should all thank Peter Maresca for this labour of love. And McCay deserves it: between 1905 and 1910 he invented the grammar of the comic strip. His panels are not crowded with figures as in later years, the lay out is imaginative, and some early pages are really scary and subversive.By the way, there's more underway: a German collector is preparing a large Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend book for all those people who think that the Checker reprints are a bit to small."},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"Very good - and impressive - edition of Little Nemo in Slumberland. Beware however of the fact that the edition is not complete. It covers a subset (120) of the pages produced by Mc Cay between 1905 and 1910, and therefore does not sport the complete story of Little Nemo over this period. So if you want to buy the book as an art book, do not hesitate. It's gorgeous. If you want to buy the book to read the story of Little Nemo or to offer to a children, than you'd better look at other, older - and probably less visually appalling - editions of this classic."},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"Let's be honest: this book's not cheap. Is it worth the price tag? Without question or hesitation: yes. If you're even contemplating buying this book, I probably don't have to tell you how great the Little Nemo strip was. What you'll want to know is that this book will make you feel like you've never really seen Little Nemo until now. It is a magnificent, absolutely stunning book.First of all, this book is huge. McCay's work is reproduced at its original size, which reveals his superb draftsmanship in all its glory. If you remember Little Nemo as lovely but kind of cramped, you're not going to believe how open and expansive the strips look here.Secondly, the color reproduction is superb. I'll take the editor's word that a great deal of effort was expended to match McCay's original coloring directions. What I will say is that the colors here are vibrant without being garish. It's really unbelievable that such sophisticated color work comes from a strip that's a hundred years old. I don't think most newspapers today could pull this off.You really have to see the book to appreciate how incredible it is. This really sets a standard against which the other collections I've seen fall far short. If you can swing the price, you won't be sorry. You might, however, have a hard time finding a place to store it!"},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"I had never heard of Winsor McCay before my husband brought this book home. I was stunned by McCay's work, by the detail and beauty of the drawings, by the clever and imaginative (and funny) stories, by the whole visual impact. I can't even imagine opening up your Sunday paper to THIS every Sunday. Thank you Peter Maresca for giving us this great gift. I only wish my son were six so we could share Little Nemo's adventures together. How he would have loved this."},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"This is the most beautiful book I have ever seen. Having purchased the complete Little Nemo book series in the 1980's I really looked forward to finally being able to see this lovely comic in its original format. When the book arrived today I realised that it was even better than I had hoped for, extremely high quality and of impressive size.The only drawback is that it does only contain a selection of the story, but I can always read the missing pages in the cheaper old edition. A big applaud for the publisher who dared produce this wonderfull piece of art."},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"I was one of the lucky few to get my hands on this astounding book before it sold out and I must say-lucky me. For those of you who savor outstanding draughtsmanship and deeply appreciate the graphic art form of the comic page, your ship has come in. This tome is about as faithful a rendition of Winsor's Little Nemo as any 21st century cartoon connoisseur will ever see. Page after inventive page, the LNIS-SMSS reader is rewarded with drawings that recall the dreams of earliest childhood. A second edition is very likely, buy it, and transport yourself to slumberland. The grandeur, narrative and art of this book's oversize pages are a true joy to experience. The only shame is that with only 5000 copies, few will be able to treat themselves."},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"If you don't yet own this book then don't pay extra for the out-of-print 1st or 2nd printings. The new 3rd printing adds 9 additional Sunday pages making it the best version to own. If you have not seen the Nemo pages reproduced at their full size and wonder if it is really worth the price the answer is YES! The artwork looks amazing at its original size each page is a beauty. Having also owned smaller versions of the Nemo pages it is much more enjoyable looking and reading them at the larger size. This is easily one of the best comic strip collections ever printed. The second volume of Sunday pages is also highly recommended."},{"Title":"Chinese Theories of Reading And Writing: A Route to Hermeneutics And Open Poetics (Suny Series in Chinese Philosophy and Culture)","review":"Whenever I go to the library of our university, I always go to the shelfs for books that have just arrived. One day, I found standing on the shelf a book titled \\"Chinese Theories of Reading and Writing: A Route to hermeneutics and Open Poetics\\", written by Ming Dong Gu. I was immediately attracted to it. It is a unique book, thoughfully conceived and well written, coming out just in time. This book represents a breakthrough, I think, in the field of comparative study of Chinese and Western poetics, a field which is very active in the past ten years. It is of such a high level, I can only admire the author's accomplishment. Certainly, this book represents the highest level reached in the study of Chinese and Western comparative poetics in the last ten years. In many aspects, I have to describe what the book has accomplished as a breakthrough in the dialogues between Chinese and Western poetics. The topics this book writes about are obviously difficult: hermeneutics, semiotics, Chinese language, philosophy, poetry, Saussure, Lacan, Derrida, Eco, and so on. The author handles these difficult topics brilliantly, in his unique way, and in an easy-to-understand language. He not only delves into some important areas such as the Book of Changes, Buddhism and traditional Chinese literary theory, but also explores the philosophical basis of Chinese reading and writing clearly and artfully. Among scholars of comparative poetics, he is the first one to be able to relate the Dao with cross-cultural theory of reading and writing. Nowdays, many scholars in the field of sinology and comparative literature of Chinese and Western literatures have doubts about the compatibility for comparative studies of Chinese and Western literatures. This book gives us an optimist view. It convincingly demonstrates that Chinese and Western literatures have a common ground in hermeneutics and literary openness. There are many points I very much like in the book. For example, he made a fascinating distinction between Yi \\"meaning\\" and Yi \\"significance\\". It seems that a distinction between Yi and Yi makes no sense for people speaking in English. Even for scholars speaking in native Chinese, they are not always sensitive enough to consider their differences. Yet this author explains the two concepts in terms of You \\"being\\" and Wu \\"nonbeing\\" in a clear and brilliant way and makes sense of some fundamentals in Chinese theories of reading, writing and philosophy: The book is written with highest scholarship and deep insight. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Chinese literature, comparative literature, and comparative thought."},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"It looks like it has some really old stuff in it that's why i think that i will like it."},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"I've read this book 3 times and each time I read it I love it even more. It takes me to a world that is so very different from today. It is easy to get caught up in the culture and lives of the Chinese"},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"The most in-depth book of the trilogy, this book particularly deals with the struggles of the only son of \\"The Tiger\\", the son of Wang who became a soldier. His struggles take him across two continents, and I think he has more honor and class than any of the Wangs. I sense a change in the author's writing style with this book, or perhaps she was just reflecting the change of the times. I thought the third book better than the second."},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"I am a Pearl Buck fan since I was eighteen years old. I love her books very much. This book is number three of The Good Earth Trilogy and also very worthwhile. I read this book a long time ago and I am eager to read it again. I know I will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"I have not finished this book. Wish it would have been available on Kindle. Enjoyed the 2 prior books and look forward to finishing this one."},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"I liked all three volumes equally and yet, differently. The first was to set the stage of the \\"beginnings\\" of a family. At least, where she starts us. There is more going in that volume with all the changes, hardships, struggle. More traditional story than character. At least for me. The second volume really sets up the personality differences within the family, the changes from the father to his children. Then, in the last volume, much much slower pace..........much to say about the the world, how this 3rd generation has so changed with the times. And of course they had the money to do it. We see a more global approach to society and much of the frustration that Yuan and his generation feels as a result: prejudice, struggle between classes, and still a clinging to old Chinese customs.Others who reviewed this said that they thought the ending was unrealistic. I am torn on only this point. But I was so sad for Yuan by the end, I wanted resolution. And maybe, just maybe we saw it as abrupt when all the while Pearl planned it that way because, the reader like Yuan was not privy to exactly what Mei Ling was really thinking and feeling. Or perhaps she didn't know herself until she saw him with his dying father."},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"This book mainly concentrates on the son of Wang the Tiger (and the grandson of the original Wang) but it does reveal a bit here and there of the three sons of Wang. Wang the Landlord and Wang the Merchant come across as spoiled even though they grew up on the farm and didn't get really rich until their adulthood. In this book, the Revolution is in full swing and it was interesting to see Wang's grandson deal with life in America. You can't help but feel sorry for poor Wang the Tiger after all he'd been through and what he did for his son to ensure the future of the son he loved. While 'The Good Earth' remains the best book in the trilogy - and one of Ms. Buck's best works overall - 'A House Divided' is a very good book in itself and is a definite must for any Pearl Buck fan."},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"The first two books in the Trilogy were so good that I was skeptical the final book could keep up the momentum but this was fantastic.It leads the Wangs into modernity with relevant historical facts hidden in the deep heart of the Tiger's only son who struggles to find his place in the world."},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"The best of the trilogy. Pearl S Buck creates a Tolstoyesque picture of Chinese agrarian life: harsh, simple, man vs nature. Important today in understanding Chinese roots and how far that huge nation has come in the past few decades."},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"I love the condition the book arrived in. I also appreciate the fact that the transaction and delivery process was done in an efficient way. Thanks!"},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"It is my second favorite, it is written diferently than the other two. It's themes of finding love, and the new generation vs. the old. I'm glad the triology ended when it did; I don't think another book would have ended it as well."},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"I would say that this book could certainly stand alone simply because there was so much happening in this turbulent setting of the revolution. In many ways \\"A House Divided\\" was my favorite of the \\"House of Earth\\" trilogy, (still, The Good Earth was beautiful!) because it was an adventure that spanned the globe. Yet there was no lack in telling how the main character evolved emotionally and intellectually from the first page to the last.Many times throughout the book, Pearl Buck successfully showed how Yuan's world was filled with black and white; no grey. For example, a person was expected to be 100% revolutionary, or a 100% traditionalist. Or one had to be 100% Chinese, or 100% foreign. Yuan was a very conflicted man from the start and struggled with these issues pretty much until the end. To me that was the most intriguing part.I was fascinated with Yuan's six-year stay in America. He experienced racism first-hand, the confusion of living in another country, trying to assimilate, seeing and appreciating the beauty of the country and the friendliness and openness of some of its people, the freedom to pursue one's happiness and potential, but clearly his own traditions and culture prevented him from fully accepting the foreigners into his heart.I think the author gave some real insight into the minds of people living during the revolution. Many people, like Yuan's cousin, Meng, were fevently passionate about it. It was clear that it took a certain kind of person, with a linear, unwavering focus in order to hasten a violent change. In this case, that meant one had to be filled with anger and hatred.Also through Yuan, we were exposed to the hypocrisy of the revolution as well. While the ideology spoke for the common people, the revolutionists were frustrated and repulsed by the common people's ways of life, such as they were for centuries. Eventually, many gave up on the older generation, and focused on the youth of the poor, because they were more easily influenced. Of course, it touched on the fact that no one was permitted to question this new state. Those who followed the cause were expected to accept it blindly.In keeping with his torn mental state, Yuan's hesitation to decide where he stood in terms of the cause was understandable. His experience gave him first-hand knowledge of how frustrating it was to live under the old filial rules, yet he'd also witnessed the softer moments with his father, and others who represented the old world. He at least was mature enough to realize that people were deeply complicated, which made it impossible for him to truly believe that \\"rich people are evil, poor people are good.\\" At the same time, as much as he loved the land, and found peace of mind working among the common people, he was at times, disgusted by their surroundings, their \\"odor\\" permeating his space no matter where he went.Pearl Buck eloquently described the same black and white issues of the heart in Yuan. Time and time again, he wished to be emotionally open, yet didn't dare. Yuan was repulsed by the display of free behavior of the new generation of China and the young Americans. Again, his reaction to the American women who danced with his cousin Sheng was an interesting glimpse into his perception of himself. Although Yuan hated the white women who ignored or rejected Sheng because he was Chinese, he had no respect for the white women who did dance with Sheng. And he felt ashamed for Sheng for \\"lowering his standards\\" to such women.Yes, perhaps the end was unrealistic, but as a hopeless romantic American, I can appreciate it. However, one can see the huge circle this book fills out with the trilogy. Yuan is ultimately the one who understands and respects his grandfather's efforts with the land, back in the first novel. Yuan is the one who finally repairs the ties to his father and ends the cycle of broken relationships. The trilogy ends as his father, the Tiger, spends his final days in the earthen house where he was born.When I read certain books, I sometimes imagine what they would be like on film, and I think it would be fantastic to see it done with the entire \\"House of Earth\\" trilogy. But then again, is it even possible to make a film that would do this epic justice?"},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"I would have ranked this book five-star, if the ending had not been so abrupt and unrealistic.A House Divided is a novel with many good contrasts in its themes. Certainly, in almost all Pearl's novels, there is the contrast of the East and the West. Then there comes the comparison of the different generations. In addition, the conflict of the old and the new ideas is also successfully portrayed. People from different class have very difficult behaviours. Throughout the story, the book focuses more on &quot;The rich have the rich's things to worry,&quot; a sentence in the first Volume of the Good Earth.Characters are three-dimensional. Their behaviours are most of the time Chinese-like, though we have to accept the fact that Pearl has been influenced greatly by western romancism love tremendously, being an American herself. I would like to praise the part of the story in which Yuan goes to America to study. I think it is very faithfully written. Perhaps one of the reasons why I prefer this book to its first volume &quot;The Good Earth&quot; is because A House Divided is closer to my life ---- I am a teenager who is studying in a foreign country alone. That is what Literature is all about ---- our life. I truly have reflected upon all the difficulties Yuan has faced during his American studying, and it matches my situation well.If you are a reader who is very interested in Chinese culture, this book is definitely a good choice for you. It has helped me to understand my home country -- China better too. I indeed am surprised by the good work of Pearl Buck. She has indeed shown the West the East well.The story ends in the near-death time of Yuan's father, the Tiger who has treated Yuan extremely well despite his bad temper. However, Pearl ended by writing that Yuan tried to kiss Meiling, the girl who he loved. I do not think this is appropriate in a situation where a person, especialy the father is to die. What filial piety does this Chinese son have? Well, I shall the chance is so slim that it is almost zero percent.Give it a try. I like this last volume the most among the three Good Earth Volumes."},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"This third book in The Good Earth series was somewhat a slower read the the previous two. However, the story was wonderful, and despite the ending, which some might find unrealistic, I enjoyed it. I was so pleased that Yuan found happiness, acceptance and love.I found the themes of the book relevant today in that our culture, ideas, lifestyles, and the influence and relationships with our children, effect their lives and influence future choices.Yaun was deeply loved by the Tiger, however, was not free to grow into an individual. This somewhat stunted Yuan emotionally, and he found himself in constant conflict over the ideas of his father and the new China. His time in America began to mature Yuan. It allowed him to return home to begin his journey into manhood and make choices about his future. However, although he now had choices, he was still duty bound to his family by a debt incurred by the Tiger.The book was wonderful and I am sorry to see the Good Earth series end."},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"The final book in the House of Earth trilogy was my least favorite and most disconnected of the three. She jumps into the third generation and third book with not a whole lot of background or character development (except for Yuan), so I cared the least about the characters, their situations and trials. The story was interesting, but I found that I could not relate as well to the characters or understand their plight. But I think she did a marvelous job at showing the differences between the generations and how exposure to new ideas, cultures and technology can quickly change the traditions of a culture; sometimes the change is good and beneficial, sometimes it's detrimental. I also like how she juxtiposed Yuan, who tries to hold on to his tradition and country and resists change, to other family members who embraced the change with all their hearts. I think that The Good Earth is a brillant read, but if you missed the next two in the trilogy it wouldn't be a tragedy."},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"A HOUSE DIVIDED is the final book of Pearl S. Buck's trilogy about the family of Wang Lung, the protagonist of THE GOOD EARTH. This book finds his grandson, Wang Yuan, son of the warlord Wang the Tiger, graduating from the war college at the beginning of the first Chinese Cultural Revolution. Yuan, a serious, thoughtful, but willful boy does not want to follow in his father's footsteps, but instead feels an affinity with the earth and growing things as his grandfather Wang Lung did.Yuan defies his father and runs away to live in his grandfather's old mud farmhouse. This begins a chain of events which take Yuan across the world. He ends up in the coastal city where his half-sister and her mother live, as well as his uncle, Wang the Landlord, along with his spoiled family. Yuan gets exposed to, but never really embraces, the westernized party lifestyle of his half-sister and the revolutionary activities of his cousins Sheng and Meng.After Yuan is arrested as a revolutionary, his family ransoms him and sends him to study in America, where he spends six years attaining an advanced degree in horticulture. Being a foreigner in a strange land causes Yuan to examine all his feelings, beliefs and prejudices. He is doubly introspective when he returns to China and sees his country anew through foreign eyes. Yuan is caught in a trap by his education, neither belonging wholly to either the old China or the new, his heart as divided as his family - half live in the modern coastal city and half live back in the country.I thought this was the best of the trilogy because Yuan's introspection makes him the most well-developed and conflicted character in this multi-generational tale. However, Buck's plodding, biblical style is not for everyone and I will admit that every page seemed like as two or three (or more!) It took me several weeks to complete this novel."},{"Title":"A House Divided","review":"A follow-up to the Good Earth and Sons, this amazing novel illustrates the life of a passionate young man caught in between the old and new ways of China during the beginning of the revolution. If you want to get inside the mind of today's people of China, you have to look at yesterday's people. Pearl gives us a wonderful opportunity to do that.

However, even with everything out there, I still find this text to be the gold standard for an introductory ancient history survey. The selections are well organized (both thematically and chronologically). They offers readers a glimpse not only into the important military and political events of the ancient past, but also the social, cultural, religious, worlds of the men and women who lived in ancient times.Additionally, I find the introductory blurbs very helpful in grounding students who are approaching primary material for the first time. They can avoid the frustation often assoicated with primary sources and can start digging into the texts for the wealth of information waiting for them.As a student of women's history in ancient Rome, I am particularly impressed with Nagle and Burstein's selection of materials that address gender issues in the ancient world."},{"Title":"The Ancient World: Readings in Social and Cultural History (2nd Edition)","review":"One of the most difficult things about teaching ancient history is either the lack of textbooks for students or the lack of really good textbooks. For a long time, Nagle's survey books were the only ones available. This is not true for the &quot;readings&quot; book that is written to accompany his survey book. Overall the selections are rather haphazard -- they are organized both thematically and chronologically but not culturally or geographical. Some of the entries are great but many are far too brief to be of real use to students. There are many &quot;source&quot; books for ancient history but they all have this same problem. Ultimately I suspect that most instructors will spend time creating course packets than relying on these source books."},{"Title":"Show Me The Money!","review":"This is a great book for anyone who enjoys movies.

I've made the mistake of buying some of the most popular self-help books on the shelf and was totally disappointed to find them, at best, full of mundane and obvious advice. At their worst, they offer up suggestions that the universe will provide for you if you believe it will, that you can do anything, regardless of the facts of reality and that just telling yourself how great you are will cause self-esteem.We all know deep down that none of this is the right advice - it's just the easy advice. Dr Hurd gives the right advice. He teaches us things like what really causes self-esteem, how to examine emotions and put them in their proper perspective, how to love, how to be moral and much, much more. This is a book for the rational thinkers who want to deal with the world in a realistic manner, be responsible for their own lives and achieve their own happiness.There is also some excellent information on how to help your child grow up, for the parents out there.This is a book that will challenge you to think rationally and come up with your own solutions, not just hope for a solution from the cosmic universe."},{"Title":"Grow Up America!","review":"Grow Up America! belongs in every home in America. It's candid, direct, concise and to the point. Be responsible for your actions, your feelings and your thoughts! For others? Absolutely not. For you? Absolutely. Dr. Hurd gives a whole different meaning to &quot;selfish&quot; and how putting yourself first dramatically improves the quality of your life. His book is clear, easy to understand, and practical. It's refreshing how he speaks out about issues (that I've only been willing to complain about) with fortitude, backbone, and honesty. His chapter on &quot;Personal Responsibility&quot; really surprised me! I consider myself a very responsible adult (who can't stand when people portray themselves as &quot;victims,&quot; helpless, etc.), and he brought to my attention how I was playing a victim by feeling resentful (blaming others). Ouch! So much for the joy of enlightenment. I now realize that if I take care of myself first and choose to be happy in whatever I'm doing, there's no reason for resentment. I've also learned that when feelings of resentment surface (or any negative feelings), and I take responsibility for them, they're neutralized. When I &quot;own&quot; my feelings, the feelings can't own me. Bottom line: Grow Up America! hits the nail on the head: being responsible = being happy. Check it out for yourself! You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Grow Up America!","review":"At $138 and change for the only copy left available at time of viewing and of initial review*, I thought this a fitting end for a book that the silent majority already bypassed. Even more fitting to see its value fall now to closer to what it's worth. What once seemed promising is actually a near total fake and utter fraud, which accounts for the \\"something not quite right\\", \\"too derivative, without the substance\\" and plain old \\"empty\\" feel I had about it years ago, closer to the time they had it printed. For a full identification of its real 'producers', see the reviews and comments by same for Hurd's (both) later and earlier 'work', \\"Effective Therapy\\" and \\"Good Therapy, Bad Therapy and How to Tell The Difference\\" (to all intents and purposes - the same stuff, different decades.) To situate the reviews, I get and admire Ayn Rand's work - as part of the originally targeted audience \\"Grow Up America!\\" once presumptuously wanted to ride the backs of - on its quest of reaching for all those it considered in need of its \\"wisdom\\" - as in everyone else. This is also the reason why I found this social worker's discourse annoyingly unsatisfying, at best. Luckily it didn't have the sense or skill to make it in the big wide world, so has rather reduced its aspirations to a more localized try at a feeding frenzy that tries include us - the members of amazon - to legitimize its \\"presence\\". What does it contain? Too many quoted mantras, slogans and endlessly repeated self identifications as rational (the 'if it says it enough, it might get you to think its true' approach) and not enough good honest content. Virtually none of its own in fact. Certainly not the selfish attack of selflessness it would like 'u.s.' Americans to think it is. I'd say \\"It might be if it grew up\\", but in this case that would be sadly redundant. Oddly enough, it does manage to retain the tired and dated feel it had the day it was printed, a decade or more ago. \\"Responsibility\\" and \\"happiness\\" become watchwords for ineffectual hyper-vigilance in the outer world, and introspective failure, or wanton introspective disregard and laziness. Beyond the constantly quoted material, a more careful analysis reveals that the author has sacrificed his own capacity for any self reflection not born of its obsession with everybody else, and while admonishing us to do the same - or be the next victim - in its endless warp of a vision quest to find any other life worth eating - is not just coincidentally then why all of \\"America!\\", no less, is needed to (vainly) try fill up the void. The void the author personifies! Thinly disguised mysticism (of other men, and then as mere \\"functions\\" - biological or not - strictly to be used for its \\"self\\" inflation at will) and a terrible book to boot. Although it accurately looks like an 80's reject left on the shelf, does have this more boringly sinister and abject void-like quality. I've knocked only the tip off its proverbial and compressed air-filled iceberg, which was alas more than enough to release the customary stench of stale and lifeless things. Hopefully alerting passing ships, prospective shipping or traders to the danger - bobbing around on the surface - from one who was lucky enough not to sink in collision. Whether \\"Grow up America!\\" ends up fetching more what its worth - which is less than a dime - or not, the facts don't change. Only best left unread. *Availability of \\"new\\" titles for this item may be subject to manipulation, but this reviewer is not.Amended on 02/08/13 to reflect the (from what I can tell from simply my individual perspective) rationally falling figures. See comments to identify and learn more about the three 'producers' behind this \\"work\\" ('3' to make '0' - hence a void - reflected currently and perhaps not coincidentally in the review votes exactly.) Can I also simply say to any other prospective review detractors, that a negative vote will not change the facts, the review or my words, or in fact even annoy me. I will say to any such voter, in the exact context of this review and the subject at hand, that I can see why you'd rather - somewhat cravenly - hit a button without identifying yourself or going and writing your own review. Can you? For any genuine reader, this book is designed to support a web presence (formerly a paper newsletter) and it's intended to draw its audience into that, as its primary function - or purpose - if it could be said to have one beyond pure (voided) \\"self\\" inflation; Into a 'world' of counterfeit-objectivism, pseudo-psychology and quasi-political posturing - and coffee mugs and possibly still some t-shirts available in your size - giving the air of artificial 'enterprise' and commodity - a 'daily pose' of 'reason' (which they call a dose, as if it's the audience that's sick, - ) more often than not featuring \\"Hurd\\", speaking about, \\"Hurd\\" - in whatever fabricated context giving 'interviews' about himself (to no audience but his own) and usually a sub-theme justifying to himself in front of his few viewers why he no longer feels any emotion at all. Other sub-themes have been how and why arrogance and pride are the same thing, and also how living a lie or selling a lie is fine, as long as you don't tell lies, or call it marriage. (His favorite subjects to pontificate on, while he sells the \\"Dr\\" image to himself, even though he's neither a medical doctor, nor a psychologist, but actually a social worker without (m)any remaining clients - so definitely nothing like the hardworking and committed kind of social worker who works with real people with real hardships and real values.) To his electronic 'clients', no more than a numbers game to keep him dining out and heading off to the strip in Las Vegas (they told me in a superior manner they'd been 37 times to that destination, not for work 'you understand', demonstrating their capacity for 'happiness' no doubt**,) regardless, whatever Hurd's recycled 'thoughts' of the 'day', week or year though, \\"Hurd\\" is the only expert (even though at 50 or so, he is still a kept boy with a sugar daddy who's managed to keep him(self) from any real challenge, work or achievement of his own since adolescence.) He also manages to keep his less presentable views to himself (particularly about sexual offenders and predators,) unless he is out on the town, which is why his more hidden views seep out in ways that seem to escape his detection. His output is all of the same utterly shallow, hollow and pretentious vein, generally with a side helping (or undercurrent) plumbing the 'depths' for any trace of residual guilt it can use to aid its 'mission'. A cheap and nasty sideshow with an empty (hence, the nasty) undertow designed to only float one 'life' boat that permits no other survivors from its own continually recast crisis placed over all 'victims' while not allowing that particular word to be used except as an insult. Hence keeping all captivated. It's nasty alright, no matter how 'polite', just keeping all waiting for the \\"next right candidate\\" or \\"updated information\\" (that has no bearing in the real world, and even less in a conceptual one) - but only tuned into or turned toward them. Pure and utterly vain (and pointless) scam-artistry. Nothing more, unless you count all the stolen and foundationless premises.**A personal afterthought: No offense to the people of LV, unless these odious 'characters' are in town. I enjoy the friends I have there - and Lawry's steakhouse and Red Rock Canyon are personal favorites. The 'Absinthe' show still on at present is great (but not family) fun too -if you'll allow one remark of the moment - so the point is more about the eternally pretentious and repetitively passive nature of even what these proponents call their 'happiness' and how they relate it to their world rather than the 'fake' version they cast online. Behind the fake, in their case, is the 'real' fake. Since being 'happy' is referred to on the cover of this unspeakably hollow 'treatise', a real picture of them pretentiously and endlessly (and boringly) relating their exploits 'socially' - is justified. They are the most unlikeable and detestable folk I think I've ever had the misfortune to come across. It is high time they stopped being able to treat the human race as if a slot machine, particularly when the 'work' they offer to attempt it, is rather like, no exactly like the old type of a petty con and prankster who used a magnet to make wheels spin up a jackpot. This spinner of fake jackpots of the human spirit is now apprehended \\"second\\" handed - along with its stolen magnet. Luckily they can't simulate a good laser.

I was therefore surprised that the book that I consider the best Heyer story I read- along with her contemporary novel &quot;Pastel&quot; and her Regency novel &quot;Cotillion&quot;- was a non-Regency historical novel. &quot;The Great Roxhythe&quot; is the best of the Heyer books I read. It veers away from the usual light-hearted, unrealistic romances and plunges into the politics and intrigue of the age of Charles the II, and it deals with the relationships between men and women in a less sentimental (and more realistic) manner. Slow, complex and mature, it's a definite read for people who like a &quot;mature&quot; Heyer story."},{"Title":"The Great Roxhythe","review":"Suppressed by the author for decades, who did not like the results, this unusual tale will not be a favorite for the \\"typical\\" Regency fan.Set in the time of Charles II, the \\"Great\\" Roxhythe is a fictional character drawn, according to Jane Aiken Hodge, (author of the definitive biography of Heyer, \\"The Private World of Georgette Heyer\\"), from actual characters that surrounded the \\"Merry Monarch,\\" Charles II in the Restoration Era of England.I first found this tale in a library and have never forgotten it. It is not easy to get into, and one must enjoy the lone, devoted and maybe not-quite-moral hero as he is. There is no romance as such, except the romance of the era and of Roxhythe himself. Serious Heyer fans may detect some ghostly foreshadowing (as in \\"The Black Moth\\") of the later (and the most definitive Heyer \\"rake\\") character Justin Alastair, Duke of Avon from \\"These Old Shades\\".If you love a serious story set in an amazing era written by a top historical novelist, try this one. I never understood why this one was suppressed (along with two very early and not very good novels that are now in print). But Heyer was her own worst critic. I loved it and love it still."},{"Title":"The Great Roxhythe","review":"If you're expecting one of Heyer's usual light-hearted regencies, you'll be extremely disappointed in THE GREAT ROXHYTHE. In fact, I would recommend you skip this one entirely. I found it as dull as ditch water and the characters one-dimensional; definitely not up to the author's usual standards. However, if you've read and enjoyed any of Heyer's other historical novels (ROYAL ESCAPE, THE CONQUEROR, MY LORD JOHN, and SIMON THE COLDHEART), you'll probably enjoy this one too."},{"Title":"The Great Roxhythe","review":"It's fairly clear why the author suppressed this book, the writing is not as mature nor are the characters as fully developed as in Heyer's later works; she nevertheless did herself a disservice by the suppression. Or might have done herself a greater service by using the honed skills of her craft to re-write the story later in life. Too much of the story is exposition; the characters only come to life when she gives them more to do than sit around the room plotting and politicking. Roxhythe is at his liveliest and his wittiest in the first part of the book, acting as a secret courier for King Charles II. Yet the more Roxhythe becomes involved in Charles's schemes to obtain money or thwart his enemies, the less interesting he becomes. Even within its limitations though, the book does create a Roxhythe so great in stature, in loyalty, and in love, that we are left heartbroken at story's end. And with that, Roxhythe is still but a pale foreshadowing of a more fascinating character Heyer would create later, Justin Alastair, Duke of Avon, and also he is perhaps but lightly tinged with the better qualities of the real Lord Rochester. The overall story covers a greater span of time than the author (or perhaps the publisher) allowed for within the alloted pages. Heyer needed more elbow room to develop this into the epic of a great man; this book serves as more of a sketch or synopsis, and leaves me wanting the full story of Roxhythe and his contemporaries. But you know what? A minor work by Heyer is still better reading than some of the finest works on the bestseller lists today."},{"Title":"The Great Roxhythe","review":"If you are a die-hard Heyer fan like I am, and have read everything she has ever writen, you have to read this book.This is a book that Heyer herself considered sub-standard. She refused to have it reprinted in her lifetime. For a long time it was unavailable. I bought an original edition for a lot of money. It is on my valuable and rare book shelf.I found it a very interesting read. It is not one of her lighthearted Regency romances, but I dreamed of Roxhythe after I read the book. I found him a compelling, tragic figure. I actually found the book more interesting than some of her other historical novels (not the Regencies). Don't read it if you want to be entertained. Read it if you want to see another side of Heyer."},{"Title":"The Great Roxhythe","review":"Georgette Heyer is, in my opinion, the cream of the crop of romance writers. She started the Regency genre of romance novels. But some of her works, like the Great Roxhythe, were written early in her life & she \\"suppressed\\" the book, not allowing it to be re-published after its first publication. The book is the story of Roxhythe, a close friend of King Charles in 17th century England. Publicly, Roxhythe was a courtier in the king's court. Secretly, Roxhythe was a skilled negotiator for his King. The work is more a character study of Roxhythe & his relationships with the Court & his King than it is a romance. The character of Roxhythe made enough of an impression on me so that even though it's been awhile since I've read the book, I remember him well."},{"Title":"The Great Roxhythe","review":"Georgette Heyer did not like The Great Roxhythe herself but her father thought it was one of her best works - I agree with her father.

It is what I call a 'meaty' book that is quite distinct from the author's lighter novels.Second hand copies are selling as high as $200.00 so purchasing a new copy at just over $20.00 plus postage from Amazon is an excellent way to go.

Dewey studies thought from the psychological and philosophical points of view and derives practical ideas for education.Reading this book, I was surprised to see the applicability of its contents to my main activity field, which is business management. Today's main effort in business research is toward innovation and learning. Thus, thinking skill is probably the most important resource of any organization.Dewey's view of thinking is surprisingly consistent and as fresh as any of the new management theories. Just to mention one aspect, he warns about the confusion of mental analysis (looking for the general aspects of an object) with physical analysis (dissection into parts), which leads to study living objects as if they were dead. This is the essence of systems thinking, which is so fashionable today!The ideas Dewey presents about education are very useful for today's business environment.

His study of work and play is a great lesson of wisdom.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone seriosly aiming at world class business performance."},{"Title":"How We Think","review":"Dewey's \\"How We Think\\" is the first book of his I have read.

It takes every day simple actions, breakes them up into their smallest unit and discusses why we did it that way.What have I gained from this book? Everytime I do something, I attempt to break it down into its simples being, and determining how this breakdown fosters greater intelligence within myself.As a text book or a book one wants to learn something from, I give it five stars.

Thinking is according to much of what he says more important than what is being thought about.Thinking is about cause and the effects that follow. A process is implied and likewise a connection is made to influences that have a negative influence on the process. Thoughtful conclusions are less likely when influences from unbalanced appetites, caprice or the circumstances of the moment.The book concentrates on the influences to thought.

Higgs skillfully and carefully tests this thesis against history. The thesis stands. Governments do indeed exploit crises as opportunities to confiscate ever-greater powers. After each crisis, the amount of power recently added to government's stock might shrink somewhat, but very seldom back to what it was prior to the crisis. This is one of the most important and compelling books published during the 1980s."},{"Title":"Crisis and Leviathan: Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government (A Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy Book)","review":"Robert Higgs presents an interesting and painfully obvious thesis: that government takes advantage of crises in order to grow larger, but then never shrinks to its previous size once the crisis has ended. As a case study, Higgs analyzes the growth of Big Government in the United States - a horrendous story of the degradation of constitutional values and the seemingly inevitable growth of the Leviathan State.The book is more significant now than ever, since its publication in the 1980s. Government has grown substantially, especially the various \\"wars\\" on drugs and terror that have greatly increased the size of government and US government involvement in several aspects of domestic life and foreign affairs.The scholarship is particularly good - mountains of empirical evidence, all relevant to his thesis, are well documented and presented concisely in this book. The book is straightforward and easy to understand; it should be accessible to economists and intelligent non-economists alike. If you've wanted to understand how government insidiously (or naturally) becomes larger regardless of constitutional constraints, read this book. It might fill you with rage, but maybe you can put that rage to good use. Are the ideas of limited government destined to be considered a failure in the far future, or can leviathan be chained down? If this is all government is about, in the United States or anywhere, do we really want a government at all?Read this book. Libertarians will consider it a great read and invaluable intellectual ammunition; everyone else should read it, if for nothing else, to better understand the nature of the beast."},{"Title":"Crisis and Leviathan: Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government (A Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy Book)","review":"Crisis and Leviathan is one of the more original books on Public Choice in since 1980. The idea behind the ratchet effect is simple: the benefits of governmental responses to crises are seen, but the costs are largely hidden. Hence, people tend to see government as more effective than it really is, and want more of it than is justified by the real, but unseen, facts. Some people object to this book, but I have yet to hear solid counterarguments to its logic.This book contains much empirical/historical support for its hypothesis. This is sound political history, using economic analysis. There are some questions about how we should interpret Crisis and Leviathan. I have heard some argue that the ratchet effect implies that it is impossible to limit the size of any government; any type of government will always grow larger over time. This would seem to imply that we are on an inexorable path to totalitarianism. Some would say that this means that we should abolish government altogether and live in Anarchy (meaning the absence of government, not the absence of social order). Yet the idea that we can privatize all government would seem to imply that we could also privatize part of government, leaving police and courts public rather than private. Why not?Of course, there have been successful efforts to downsize or limit the size of government. This is what needs further explanation. Why or how did some efforts to restrain or downsize government work. This has happened a few times in history, yet Higgs does not explain why? In any case, Crisis and Leviathan raises important issues and deals with them intelligently. This book should be standard reading for Poli-Sci majors."},{"Title":"Crisis and Leviathan: Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government (A Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy Book)","review":"Naomi Klein's very popular \\"Shock Doctrine\\" asserts that governments and free marketers (most notably Milton Friedman) use every crisis imaginable to push through free market reforms that the population opposes. The problem is she gets the whole thing exactly wrong. In the vast majority of cases crises lead to bigger government.Robert Higgs shows how this process has worked in the United States. He terms it the \\"ratchet effect\\". Basically government will rapidly expand in a crisis, then after the crisis ends the government will shrink but still be bigger than it was prior to the crisis. As crises cometh and crises goeth the government grows bigger and bigger.Robert Higgs focuses on four episodes in particular. The first being the depression of 1893 which, unlike crisises in the 20th century the government dealt with it by not getting involved despite massive pressure to do so. Then onto World War 1, the Great Depression and World War 2 as well as a brief discussion of the Cold War.In each of these instances the government created massive programs and took extensive control of the economy while launching massive propaganda campaigns to promote these programs. For the most part the Supreme Court was complicit no matter how obvious it was that the constitution was being trampled (despite thankfully declaring some cartelization agencies like the NRA unconstitutional).Yes corporatism and hand outs to politcally connected firms happen by exploiting crises, however this is still big government run amok (who after all is giving these handouts?). And while the likes of Johan Norberg have discredited Naomi Klein's book. The fact that her thesis is not just wrong, but for the most part exactly opposite of the truth needs greater attention. While Crisis and Leviathan is a bit dated, it nevertheless provides a great explanation of how the ratchet effect works and the danger crisises present to liberty. It's especially important now in our current economic crisis."},{"Title":"Crisis and Leviathan: Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government (A Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy Book)","review":"Crisis and Leviathan is a hard hitting and imaginative book about the growth of government in the United States throughout the 20th Century. It is this book which has made Higgs into a modern intellectual giant of classical liberalism/libertarianism amongst the likes of Richard Epstein, Murray Rothbard, James Buchanan, Douglas North, Paul Craig Roberts, Walter Block and Hans Hermann-Hoppe.Robert Higgs' Crisis and Leviathan is a lucid and scholarly tract with painstakingly researched references, footnoted and jam packed with nuggets of analysis which may modern historians pass by without a second thought. The reason for this can be easily pointed out. During the 20th century the dominance of functionalist in sociology has swayed many historians to embrace the growth of government as an outcome of civilized society. Therefore they tend to think of the growth of government as an exogenous factor; as if it magically appears out of thin air.Unlike the previous reviewer, I don't think that Higgs' book is just another rehashing of libertarian theory or ideology (If it were we may ask - is this a rewriting of the Libertarian Manifesto by Rothbard or Capitalism and Freedom by Friedman; my answer would be hardly). Higgs is hardly unimaginative; in fact he is a creative thinker with a penchant for understanding history while incorporating economic theory. Anyone who would question this would profit by actually spending some time reading the theoretical section of this book instead of skimming it. Here Higgs demonstrates within a few pages a technically sound method of understanding and interpreting facts of historical value. No one is questioning the originality (Weber or Spencer thought it up before him, for example - do we need to mention Schumpeter, who is mentioned extensively) of his argument, only its application to the growth of government in the United States during the 20th century. (1st - that is the thesis of this book. 2nd - If you don't believe that government did grow - then you need a few more history lessons.)Higgs, unlike the many of his modern conservative contemporaries, thankfully disdains war and like Robert Nisbet carefully shows why the \`will-to-power' is so attractive to conservatives who are in a position to abuse it. From this vantage point it is easy to envision Higgs scorn for the dominant ideology, one which has lead to the rise of what he calls participatory fascism. He points out decisively and consistently that each successive crisis during the 20th century has begat questions by the \`public' of how the government can and ought to fix the problem and ultimately \\"do something\\" to fix it.Under the wave of new legislation, property rights by regulation are eroded concurrently so that its ownership is no longer de facto, yet still de jure. Higgs employs Schumpeter's analysis contained in \`Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy' to formulate a similar conclusion to what C. Wright Mills' called (who was not a libertarian; neither was Schumpeter for that matter - it is truly amazing that someone can be a Marxist and a scholar or a Neo-Con and a scholar, but when it comes to being a libertarian and a scholar, then your intentions are no longer pure) totalitarian democracy in his famous \`Sociological Imagination.' Although Higgs focus tends to gravitate towards the welfare/warfare state, rather than the gradual socialism of Schumpeter.Higgs does tend to gloss over some historical details or the periods without crisis. While some may claim that this is inconsistent or incoherent, his reasoning doesn't seem off base to me. Its difficulty lies in the functionalist progressivism, which is more reactionary than revolutionary.Although many assertions appear to be sweeping to some, his references are well documented and scholarly. Again, this frees him from being bogged down by anything other than the question which is pertinent to his thesis. Higgs, although selective, tastefully intertwines his historical accounts while showing how his theoretical model works. Interestingly enough, the answer that he comes up with is that ideology drives history. Again, this may be nothing new to an astute scholar; but is certainly path breaking for those who are stuck in the never-never land of pure materialism, like so many in the economics profession.In fact, this is not an escape hatch, but a demonstration of how history used to be understood. What ultimately drives the plans of man is an ideological vision of the world, not merely the interplay of things. This was the error of many neo-classical economists, who desperately wanted to show that men were mere profit maximizers or the economic man; which has little or no way to explain the appearance of Marxism, for instance.If his book is a polemic, then there is no question his ideological pedigree. Fortunately, unlike so many other recent scholars, he is not hiding it. After all, it is truly unfortunate that most modern scholars feel it necessary to conceal their political and philosophical origins in order to give them a false air of objectivity. (In fact, Higgs quotes Mises, as a hardcore libertarian, within the first page of the book.) This may be a reason to attack his core ideas, but I found that Higgs was no pure ideologue.If anything, his more recent books, like \`Depression, War and Cold War' are considerably more radical."},{"Title":"Crisis and Leviathan: Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government (A Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy Book)","review":"Robert Higgs did not intend to write a tragedy, but since the publication of Crisis and Leviathan 26 years ago, reading this is like reading a tragedy--the tragedy is the loss of the Republic and its liberties.First, consider when Robert Higgs wrote this book as it was published in 1984. This is original, critical thinking at its best.The thesis is a ratchet theory of Big Government, and consequent loss of individual freedom and liberty.I highly recommend anyone interested in the truth of the evolution of our Republic read this book to find out how we got here--and the bibliography is a treasure chest of references for further reading and areas to explore."},{"Title":"Crisis and Leviathan: Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government (A Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy Book)","review":"As of this writing the president of the United States is prosecuting a war* with admirable objectives. But at what cost to American society?Within weeks of the initiation of the U.S. effort the administration has announced steps that will curtail the civil liberties of citizens and visitors alike, even circumventing the right to proper trial. There appears to be a good chance that U.S. citizens will be required to carry so-called national ID cards.Higgs explains why this should come as no suprise since war is the grand historical excuse offered by politicians to increase their powers and diminish those of their subjects, whatever the merits of their original objectives. This is one of the essential books in the literature of liberty, and it could not be more pertinent as a siren and antidote to the threat to freedom posed by ever-larger government.*The war I referred to was against the Taliban, not the subsequent Iraq debacle."},{"Title":"Crisis and Leviathan: Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government (A Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy Book)","review":"This book is somewhat intriguing. It is indeed an authoritative scholarly account of the growth of government in the United States, and for that reason only well worth reading. However, there is a pervading subtext of libertarian conspiracy theory about governmental power in the book that leaves the reader wondering if the author might not be masquerading a scholarly endeavour (that in itself is very rewarding) in order to suggest that government is the incarnation of evil. The fundamental truth which is developed here, that there is a permanent and necessary contradiction between the development of governmental power and individual liberty is unsophisticated, not to say outright crude. In addition, the author's thesis that after each crisis resulting in the growth of governmental capacities and power the government (always conceptualized as a large undifferentiated whole in the book) tends to rationalize its subsequent business in order not to loose what it just gained is not a discovery of the highest order. This is the rule in every institutional setting, whether corporate or bureaucratic, we know that since Max Weber's work on bureaucracy, without the libertarian hogwash."},{"Title":"How to Play Cricket: A Step-By-Step Guide (Jarrold Sports)","review":"I think that this is a great book because it tells you how to play cricket step by step.

I think this book does a great service to historians for why the War of 1812 came about. One author took the diplomat side of the story while the other covered the naval aspect. What one finds explains a lot about the subsequent war five years later.British sailors were poorly paid and badly treated. American sailors were better paid and treated. British sailors deserted in droves for the American merchant marine and small U. S. Navy. Britain took it upon herself to stop ships at sea or even a foreign harbor and take what sailors it needed to complement the ship's crew. This was British Arrogance at its worst. No apologies/nothing in the way of compensation if they took other's nation's citizens. The British Navy regarded this as a right. Today we call it piracy. The U.S. government under Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison tried to stop it. However, American merchants and the U.S. Navy willingly took on British deserters for crew on their ships. This also was probably wrong. The confrontation was set. The Leopard stopped the U.S. Navy frigate Chesapeake and demanded to search it for deserters. When the Commodore refused, they put several broadsides into the U.S. ship. The Chesapeake was completely unprepared for battle. The Chesapeake surrendered and three British deserters were taken off.This was not the end of the affair. There was needed a scapegoat for the U.S. ship's surrender. This was the Commodore, even though the Captain and some of his lietenants were as guilty of being unprepared as the Commodore. The subsequent trial and acquital of the junior officers was unfair.This is a nice easy read. Again, hats off to the authors for writing about a little known event."},{"Title":"Rachel Saint: A Star in the Jungle (Christian Heroes: Then & Now)","review":"This is the first book I have read about Rachel Saint, and I enjoyed learning about the part she played in bringing the Auca Indians of Ecuador to Christ.

Something different from the old &quot;memorize this algorithm, then drill and practice.&quot; This book doesn't quite get there. Granted, Romagnano's ways are a bit different and probably marginally better than the old ways of teaching math. But I think essentially, all he is doing is working word problems as a class and spoonfeeding students the solutions step-by-step. At least the author was kind of enough to give transcripts of portions of his class so you can see that his students are still not getting it. If you are looking for books that demonstrate ways to teach so students will think and learn about MATHEMATICS, and not just memorize procedures and algorithms, I suggest other books, like &quot;The Teaching Gap,&quot; or &quot;Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics&quot;"},{"Title":"Wrestling with Change: The Dilemmas of Teaching Real Mathematics","review":"The book is a clever play on both Dr. Romagnano's love of math and college wrestling experience.

Emily Dickenson said \\"Dwell in possibility\\" - reading this book is that in exponents!"},{"Title":"With All Despatch","review":"With All Despatch is chronologically the last of Kent's pre-Napoleonic Wars Bolitho novels. It is also the most recently written depicting that era. As such it is one of his most polished if somewhat familiar.Kent has used the structure of With All Despatch before. Essentially he has written the novel in two linked sections with a mini-climax in the first followed by the major climax and denouement in the second. In Gallant Company was particularly effective using this format and in With All Despatch the two sections are linked even more solidly.In this entry Bolitho who is still mourning the loss of his lady must obtain men for His Majesty's service while battling smugglers on England's North Sea coast. Complicating the matter is possible collusion between a senior officer and the smugglers. The head smuggler seems unreachable and there is an obvious parallel with organized crime and drug cartels of today. As the novel progresses it is also obvious that France and England will be at war soon. Can Bolitho meet all of his objectives and defeat his enemies? To provide a clue, the series will continue with many more novels for 23 more years.In spite of being a popular series the reader has to know that Richard Bolitho is a tragic figure. The chronology in most books shows his death in 1815. By With All Despatch Bolitho has lost both his parents and his brother who turned traitor before dying. His faithful sidekick Stockdale was killed after nearly 10 years with him and Bolitho notes that his replacement Allday has been with him for 10 years. The reader has to be waiting for the other shoe to drop with Allday. The series could be really depressing if Kent didn't fill the novels with nail biting tension and thrilling action sequences. Kent's obvious knowledge of sailing and love of the sea also provide charm to the series.With All Despatch is one of Kent's most polished. Perhaps it doesn't have the fire and intensity of earlier offerings but it is still good. While the entire series is violent some of this novel is particularly gruesome. I wouldn't recommend With All Despatch for younger readers unlike the earlier novels."},{"Title":"With All Despatch","review":"Although not one of the best in the series, this novel captures the grim life at sea and the struggle against nature. In this book, brutal smugglers ply the English Channel between Holland, France and England. The central characters are well written and alive with problems, dialog and several seem destined to re-appear in future Bolitho novels. However, Mr. Kent seemed to have Bolitho dwell in his past too many times. A dark, brooding side of the naval hero seems to fill many pages, but it does make Sir Richard that much more of a fleshed out character. He does feel for his dead friends, former ships and in some cases, former enemies. That aside, the tale moves along like a nimble sixth-rater with all sheets unfurled in a southern wind. The action is swift and brutal as Bolitho gives battle to the smugglers and their allies. Stormy weather, plenty of thunderous cannon fire, smashed bulkheads, parted ratlines and terrified crewmen. The author once again details the sea as an angry foe without mercy. The battle at the end of the book between a couple of corvettes and three cutters is suberb Kent writting. A welcome addition to the collection none the less. Well worth reading and blends seamlessly into the very next novel. An excellent series that has re-defined nautical fiction."},{"Title":"With All Despatch","review":"Two years after the American Revolution, and the British Navy is still licking its wounds.

So officers like Captain Richard Bolitho, who has recently recovered from a South Sea fever (one he barely survived), must beg for a post - any post. For a ship - any ship. Bolitho, a former frigate captain, struggles to be grateful when he's posted to command of a trio of topsail cutters assigned to hunting smugglers in the Nore. He takes this job far too seriously for the liking of some of his superiors, who may well be profiting from the very trade they are supposed to suppress. And what of France, where the Revolution has changed everything except the age-old hostility between the nations that face each other across the English Channel?This is a two-part novel, and a very readable one in both cases. Bolitho grieves for his dead love, Viola, and battles his traitorous brother Hugh's unfortunate legacy while doing his duty in a largely thankless assignment. The plot almost takes a back seat to the story's themes of love, loyalty, and duty. And that, for me at least, worked just fine.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of \\"Granite Island\\""},{"Title":"With All Despatch","review":"Bolitho is feeling distraught. It is peacetime 1791 and he's on the shore. He's recovering from fever. His romance in the South Seas has ended. Of Viola he has only a gold watch. France is under the Terror. Then Bolitho gets his first multi-ship command, a flotilla of topsail cutters with the newly installed Smashers (nasty short-range carronades), but hardly the frigate he deserved. He's in charge of the hated press gangs at the Nore, site of a later fleet mutiny. His loyal coxs'n Allday deserts him! And he suspects his superior and a captain or two of collusion with English smugglers, who are taking heinous advantage of refugee French women. Life is ugly all around, and dominates the dark mood of this novel. Bolitho races about on many filthy errands, in foul seas, and against big odds. That, at least, is nothing new.Deja vu: the story line is reminiscent of \\"Midshipman Bolitho,\\" once again chasing smugglers. Again the smugglers have a deadly intelligence system and protection from a mystery authority. Nominally in command of his destiny, Bolitho encounters a master politician who sends him on highly dangerous secret missions into Holland. Curiously, for all Bolitho's empathy and respect for his crews, he never seems to invite his officers to dinner. There's little in this series of the sumptuous larders most captains supplied.Kent includes nice bonus appendices, one on the specialist warrant officers, the other on the origins of some naval customs. But nary a word on the possible historicity of the events told here."},{"Title":"With All Despatch","review":"Excellent study in overcoming overwhelming adversity with the aid of true friendships and common sense.

He had an amazing life through his art, and outside of it.Here, at the age of 77, past the point of modesty, conceit and pride, he tells his remarkable story of learning his craft, harnessing his incredible God-given talent, and channelling his drive into success.We learn about his trysts and liasons with other icons, his marriages, his faults and missteps.He owns up to many things that have not made him proud, including naming names during the deplorable McCarthy communist witch hunts of the 1950's.He talks openly of his failures as a parent and a husband, his infidelity, and his loss of faith.He also recounts his many astounding successes in film and theatre, including the many great actors and actresses he worked with.His honest self-assessment is a breath of resh air.This is one of the greatest autobiographies I have ever read."},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"A fascinating read about the life of America's greatest stage director. Included are stories about the original productions of \\"The Skin of Our Teeth\\" (where Kazan went up against Tallulah Bankhead and lived to tell about it!), \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" and \\"Death of a Salesman.\\" He also writes about his life as an immigrant, his \\"informing\\" during the Red Scare, and his subsequent career as a film director and author. Anyone who loves the theatre must read this book by one of it's giants."},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"I have read this book four times. I can't recall an autobiography of any century that is more candid, and is written with such extraordinary brio."},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"Kazan describes both personal and public events in a way that gives the reader a feeling of intimacy with the author. After reading the book I felt as I had known the man all my life. Kazan's frank accounts of his affairs with famous actresses of his day are unique for their detail and honesty. Compare this to the vague accounts in Brando's &quot;Songs my Mother Taught Me.&quot; Apart from the gossip the telling of personal details of his relationship with his first wife and the description of the death of his second wife from breast cancer are wonderfully poignant. I felt as if I had been there myself. Kazan's description of his emotions at the time of these events rings so true that they are embarrassing to read, as if the reader had found his diary hidden in a drawer. He admits to emotions and motives most people would not honestly admit to even to their own conscience."},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"Kazan is the only person I can think of who hit home runs in all three fields, theater, film, and fiction. As a director of plays he received five Pulitzer prizes, for directing films, two Academy awards, and in fiction his novel &quot;The Arrangement&quot; became a #1 bestseller for 37 consecutive weeks. Although he calls his autobiography simply &quot;A Life,&quot; this book is twice extraordinary, in the dramatic events it covers and a rare candor about himself and his contemporaries. With so many other good books clamoring for my attention, I intend to read it a third time now that this new edition is available."},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"Elia Kazan's mammoth autobiography manages to cover every aspect of his sometimes tumultuous life, from childhood to old age. His career as an actor (short-lived) to his profoundly influential stage & film directing are dissected, reflected upon and frequently harshly self-criticized. His writing of his testimony before HUAC may offer no satisfaction to those who hoped for an apology, but Kazan does manage to explain himself and the unbelievable pressure he felt during that miserable time in American history. He's hard on himself and a fair amount of his work (he owns up to his artistic failures such as PINKY, MAN ON A TIGHTROPE as well as his film version of his own best-selling novel THE ARRANGEMENT --- he wanted Marlon Brando, but settled for the woefully miscast Kirk Douglas). There are humorous anecdotes about Tallulah Bankhead, Fredric March, and Tennessee Williams. On the flip side, Kazan decimates former collegue Lee Strasberg for, in his view, essentially hijacking the Actor's Studio (which Kazan helped to establish). Kazan relishes the acting teacher's ill-fated London stage production of THE THREE SISTERS. He's also pointedly critical of Lillian Hellman (one of many friends he lost after the HUAC testimony). A great autobiography by one the twentieth century's TRUE artists!"},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"Great book, a biography for the ages, escpecially if you are a Hollywood/movies buff. He will tell you, as honestly as you can imagine, his struggles for survival, his revealing of \\"names\\" during the HUAC investigations, and the reasons behind all this this. Plus, if you like his movies, you have a first rate writer and critic of his own works, and their history. You will hear about the tragedies of his own life,and the devastating results of his inner conflicts. Don't delay buying it. It is the history of cinema for several generations, a great life story. Yes, Kazan may not have been a good novelist--he tried the genre--but a great writer of nis life non-the-less. And a good historian to boot. Worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"A Life in Letters (Penguin Modern Classics)The Goring CollectionElia Kazan had no desire to work for his father as a rug merchant. The magnet that drew Kazan in was show business, but in the early days of his career he showed little aptitude for any place in the theatre. He was quite good at painting sets and by simply hanging around was eventually given a few bit parts in several plays. He got little notice from the critics but Harold Clurman took him under his wing and Kazan grew some as an actor within the Group Theatre. Most of the group had socialist leanings and early on Kazan went along with the crowd. However within a year or so it became obvious that he was too much of an individual to follow any structured ideology and he let it be known that he would never become a part of the communist party.During the 30's there was very little money to be made by working with the Group Theatre. He finally found a way to augment his income, and that was doing radio plays and was pretty good at it.Kazan's wife Molly's great grandfather was president of Yale University. Kazan slipped around the edges of conflict; Molly stood up right in the center of the storm. He learned to compromise when he was young in order to avoid confrontation. Molly's principals permitted no deviation from her obligations of what was right.In the late forties and early fifties the Stanislavsky method of acting was making its way from the Moscow Arts Theatre to New York. Lee Strasberg and Kazan opened the Actors Studio on West 44th Street in an old church building. At the time there were a number of adherents to the Stanislavsky Method teaching their brand of the method and each claiming to have tapped into the authentic Stanislavsky system while pointing out the others as imposters.In time Lee Strasberg and the Stanislavsky method were one.Kazan asked the question, what is the best performance you've ever seen? Was it Garbo in Camille, Judy Garland at the height of her career, Walter Houston in the Treasure of Sierra Madre or Lee J. Cobb in Death of a Salesman?Those were all inspiring, but you may have someone else in mind.During one summer in Hollywood Kazan turned his life around. He made the decision that he would never make it as an actor. His friend Clifford Odets wrote a screenplay for Lewis Milestone and it gave Kazan a chance to spend time with and learn from one of the great film directors the art of script writing as well as the basic mechanics of directing. The film they worked on was never made but Kazan got the guidance and the inspiration he needed to begin his career as a director.Back in New York Kazan was hired to direct \`The Skin of our Teeth' and in spite of fighting over every line with Tallulah Bankhead from start to finish he managed to bring a successful play to Broadway.He then followed that up by rescuing a play starring Helen Hayes called Harriet. Kazan brought the play back to life from the brink of disaster. Then he suddenly had two Broadway hits on his hands at the same time. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn came a bit later, and that also turned into a big hit.Kazan paid his dues in Hollywood with a couple of lack luster films followed by Street Car Named Desire with Marlon Brando on Broadway and film. Then his big success came with On the Waterfront.Kazan had more than a little conflict in his personal life, that of a wife and family and a mistress along with the HUAC Hearings in Washington.Elia Kazan has written in the highs and lows of his life and career, and there are times you might find the book a bit tedious in detail - but if you'll follow along to the end you will be richly rewarded for your effort.Tom Barnes author of \`Doc Holliday's Road to Tombstone.'"},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"Kazan didn't create the witch hunt, and he didn't create the blacklist.

The end is depressing. Between the two I found this book very interesting about Mr. Kazan's career in the theatre and movies. He knew many big names, and worked with alot of them. I rented the video &quot;On the Waterfront,&quot; for the first time while reading this book. Mr. Kazan said &quot;Waterfront&quot; was his movie, his statement on how he felt about testifying before the Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, D.C. Personally, I applaud Mr. Kazan for his courage in naming names. Communism was a real threat to our country. Elia Kazan should know. He was one of them at one time."},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"With a former Supreme Court Justice warning the USA today (March 10, 2006) about starting down the road toward a dictatorship, it seemes fitting to re-visit the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in the 1950s when the right-wing was trying to scare our citizens into giving the government supreme power, just as neocons are trying now.Elia Kazan defends his decision to name names during the Hollywood Hearings of the 1950s, saying that his ideas toward the Communist Party had changed and he thought the higher ups (maybe from Russia) were dictating policies to the American communists in the movie business.Maybe so, but he also admits the Hearings already had all the communists' names and admits they were only showing their power to control people here in Hollywood,using intimidation to instigate the blacklist. In real life, the USA government was the bully, not the old, tired communists of the 1930s.If so, then why did he ever think the movie he directed, \\"On The Waterfront,\\" was a good analogy for what he faced? The USA government caused the black list and precipated suicides and family break-ups in their Hollywood investigation.It was the mob who caused the deaths and intimidation in \\"On The Waterfront.\\" Is Kazan saying that Congress behaved like the mob? Or that the mob behaved like Congress?Granted, Kazan was a great director, brilliant at times. But to him the bottom line was the bottom line, and to keep his position as an all-star director, he had to name names. While he tries to seem noble, the reader can see his 'reel' motivation was money and his career. So what if he named names! He was working.Today, we see the right wing using similar tactics in the Bush administration: questioning people's patriotism, using smears and mud-slinging against opponents, trying to get people fired if they disagree with neocon policies, keeping a blacklist of university professors who oppose them, and most recently, equating the AARP group of loving gays instead of our troops.After reading Kazan's book, I did gain a firm insight into right-wing politics, and these politicians use juxtaposition of images to label their opponents. Right-wingers still don't care if they distort the record. To them, winning is everything."},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"Before I read this book, I knew a little about Elia Kazan. For example, I knew that he had been a successful Hollywood film director in the late forties and early fifties. Indeed, I had seen some of his films: East Of Eden, in particular, came to mind. I had also read somewhere that he had also been a prominent and successful theatre director on Broadway; that he had given the likes of Marlon Brando and James Dean their first starts; that he was one of the influential people behind the advent of the Method Acting style; and finally, that he had been a \`friendly' witness-that means naming names, of course--at the HUAC hearings in the early fifties: what a snake, I thought!But hey, I've now read the book, and I know the real story and the real Elia Kazan. The book is an 800+ page epic. And an epic in every sense of the word. Kazan's autobiography is a long, brooding, and fascinating recall of his eventful life. He has, as he acknowledges in the later pages, lived a variegated and full life, he has no regrets about any of it, and he realises that he has been fortunate to have led such an interesting life. And \`interesting' it certainly is. The book, though, is no glamorous odyssey of a life lived in Broadway and Hollywood; neither is it a chronicle of the great and the good of America's creative talent. Yes, there are valuable insights and vivid portraits of people like Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg, Clifford Odets, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Marilyn Monroe, Marlon Brando and John Steinbeck. You will also meet some of Hollywood's movie moguls, particularly Darryl Zanuck at Fox. Yes, those stories are told, but all in the context of the main enterprise: the laying down for posterity of the intimate detail of the life of one of America's most celebrated creative talents of the middle of the twentieth century. Kazan unashamedly reveals his inner thoughts, his recollections, reasons, reminiscences and experiences-whether they show him in a good, bad or indifferent light. The book is brutally frank and you can only admire the author's unstinting honesty-possibly a cathartic aspect to the work aided Kazan along the way.Remarkable for a book of this size, there is never a hint of unevenness or flagging. It's an enthralling, engrossing book from start to finish. Much of life's rich tapestry, to use the euphemistic clich&eacute;, is explored here. Kazan is clearly an astute and perceptive observer of life. Life essentially means human beings, of course, and this brings us to the essence of the book, human nature, particularly the behaviour between man and woman. Manipulation, expediency, lust, deceit, hurt, love, the passion and the platonic: it's all here in a very stark black and white. Yet still the book continually sparkles, even when the reader faces some genuinely sad and pitiful moments, particularly relating to Kazan's fiercely supportive and loyal first wife, Molly. There is no cherry-picking of \`the good times' in this book: highs and lows, triumph and disaster, they all co-exist side by side. Kazan doesn't shirk from revealing his overwhelming determination at the time to have his cake and eat it ie. a loving wife at home and a passionate mistress outside.Apart from the inherent problems that male/female relationships spawn, if you forgive the pun, Kazan also talks extensively about his rather frustrating and unfulfilling time at college; his less-than-perfect relationship with his father; reflections on the life of a Greek immigrant family trying to make their way in the \`new world', in this case, New York; more reflections on Greeks, this time those living in another \`foreign' country, Turkey (where Kazan's parents had emigrated from), and the altered behaviour necessary to survive amongst \`the enemy'; and, of course, he describes the whys and wherefores of his \`friendly' HUAC testimony, and the subsequent vitriol directed against him as a consequence from many quarters, including so-called \`friends'; we learn of the unsavoury modus operandi of both the Communist Party in America and the HUAC authorities in the late forties and early fifties; and Kazan's single-mindedness and determination as, post-HUAC, he persevered and produced his best work as a film director; also, an interesting account of how Kazan's second wife, Barbara, and her confused but brave struggle against cancer; and so on.The book is a courageous and brutally honest self-expose, if you like, of a man who has remained largely silent over the years. He doesn't gloss over his extra-marital activities, and the hard-heartedness and guile required on his part to maintain his passionate love for his mistress and, at the same time, his more platonic love for his first wife. This reflects the \`insoluble' (Kazan's word) nature of man's relationship with the opposite sex.The book is beautifully-written-quality throughout--and the prose intimate, inviting and lucid. The honesty and intimacy of Kazan's words, as he describes his thoughts, feelings and rationale at the time, ensure that you live his life with him, and by the end of the book, you also feel you've been through one hell of a life.Over a year ago, I read an excellent book called A Child Of The Century, Ben Hecht's autobiography, published in the fifties. I never thought I'd read another autobiography to match or surpass it. I have, and it's called A Life, by Elia Kazan. Waste no more time and buy this book. Alternatively borrow it or steal it, but whatever you do, read it!!"},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"Kazan has written a stunningly truthful autobiography that should be read and savored. Here is &quot;Gadge&quot; an icon of mid-century American theatre and film spilling it out all over the page. From his unfulfilled teenaged longings for blonde American girls, to his first marriage in which he felt trapped, but stayed on and on, to the many affairs he indulged in, all are chronicled almost too graphically, but from a distinctly detached (a writer's?) point of view. One doesn't feel that he loved or even liked any of them.But so what? Here's a man who could brilliantly direct both &quot;Streetcar&quot; and &quot;Salesman&quot; in the space of a few years and then go to Hollywood and deal successfully with the likes of Darryl Zanuck and the 20th Century Fox grind-them-out-fast film factory. The Hollywood stuff is both funny and refreshingly honest. Who else has dared to challenge the Spencer Tracy was and remains the greatest screen actor legend? And then there's the deadly little aside about Marilyn Monroe giving him a not-so-subtle look as she sat quietly beside her then mentor, Johnny Green. The sainted Tracy as an out of shape, lazy and not very dedicated actor, and the &quot;vulnerable&quot; Marilyn as a cunningly on-the-make tart who would have traded in her devoted agent for the famous director, given the slightest encouragement, are just two minor examples of the fascinating insights that appear on almost every page.It's a very fat book. It had to be. Kazan was in his eighties when he wrote it and he's led an extremely full life. It was a long and winding road from the Group Theatre to that uncomfortable, halting appearance at the 1999 Academy Awards cermonies. They made him (and the latest wife) wait until almost the very end, but he made it through. And there was Nick Nolte remaining seated and staring mean and hard at this fragile old man. And there, too, was a smiling Warren Beatty rising graciously and applauding. He redeemed himself that night. I'm sure the old man noticed."},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"This book is perhaps one of the greatest autobiographies of the modern Theatre. Kazan pulls no punches in depicting his epic journey from Greek immigrant to one of the greatest theatre and film directors of all time. His life parallels the crucial artistic movements and conflicts of the Twentieth Century: The Group Theatre, The HUAC hearings, The height and fall of the Hollywood Studio System, the founding of the Actor's Studio, and the development of the American Theatre. Kazan, along with Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams played a crucial role in creating a strong and vibrant American Theatre. All throughout this amazing journey are insights into the craft of acting as well as the trials and tribulations of a man struggling for personal identity. This book demands to be on the shelf of any student, practitioner or fan of the Theatre. Five out of five stars"},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"I knew absolutely nothing about Elia Kazan prior to reading this book. He does a superb job of reconstructing his life from his early years learning theatre stage craft at Yale all the way through to his final years (he was 78 when he completed the book). He is seemingly forthwright about many of the tough decisions he faced throughout his career from the House of UnAmerican Activities revealing of many of his old 'comrades', which he does a decent job of articulating why he did whatthat, even if on the surface it seems lecherous.What I was left with was the impression of a person who lived life to the absolute fullest, a person with conflicting and often questionable morals (particularly with women), and the thick skin you need to have to survive and thrive in the arts. A book like this far surpasses any 'how to' book for aspiring artists and is proof that there are no hard and fast rules other than perseverance, conviction, hard work, and individuality (finding your own voice)."},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"First, let me state I have often judged other people by their past actions. Was Kazan wrong for providing names of alleged Communist Party members? I can't answer this, and you shouldn't answer it, not until you read this book! Yes, Kazan named names. Yes, he did ruin the careers of certain artists. Please, don't judge until you have read his story! This is an honest, masterful show business autobiography! Kazan was a fearless, authentic, visionary director. He admits to adultery, poor parenting skills, and using people for his own good. Alfred Hitchcock allegedly tortured Tippi Hendren during the filming of the THE BIRDS by having the little critters thrown at her face in repeated attempts. Why? To foster the character's psychological terror. Would you want that man house-sitting for you while you are on vacation? Hell no......Can Kazan be rewarded for his art, yet escape judgement for his past behavior? You decide, but read his story first! Kazan's films never shirked from dealing with pressing social issues, yet the movies are visual poetry. Hey, you try to make a movie about corruption on the Brooklyn docks! Oh, and make it a heart-wrenching allegory, a love story, and a black-and-white masterpiece! One other thing, don't forget that the Mob basically controlled the docks at that time and were not too keen on being protrayed in an unflattering light!!One of Kazan's gifts was his tremendous empathy. Kazan the author allows us to develop this same empathy. He is a wonderful story teller, relating anecdotes about personalities like Tallulah Bankhead, Tennessee Williams, and Brando. Granted, he worked with a pantheon of American writers, like Tennessee Williams and John Steinbeck. Granted, with source material like A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE and EAST OF EDEN, and actors like Jessica Tandy, Marlon Brando, and Julie Harris, he clearly had an edge over other industry directors.Again, before you judge his character, read his book, sit down and watch his complete output of films, and draw your own conclusions. Don't let Nick Nolte or Ed Harris, both of whom refused to applaud or stand when Kazan was given his lifetime Academy Award, decide the issue for you. This book should be a must-read for young people considering a career in film or theatre."},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"One of the most honest, compelling, brilliant, wise, stunning books I've ever read. Kazan's life was awe-inspring, and to have it retold with such lucidness and unflattering candour is a gift for the ages. Not only was he one of the greatest theatre directors and film directors of the 20th Century, he writes like a blessed demon. This was a spellbinding, page-turning read. Immersed in its pages, I learnt so much about life, America, directing, theatre/cinema history, and myself. I also learnt more than I've ever known about how men think (wish I'd read this years ago).It's such a pity Kazan's life has become simplistically defined by one act, and his artistry overshadowed - ironic, too, considering he made films with a deep, compassionate, liberal humanity. You can look at his life through through the prism of that one act, or read this for a much richer, fuller, deeper understanding of Kazan - the good, the bad, the ugly. And the genius.This book made me want to live my life more fully, view myself less vainly, and create my work more honestly. Can't ask for more than that."},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"I was truly surprised by this book when I read it some years ago. I was surprised by how engrossing and powerful it was , all the way through. This man lived a tremendously interesting life, rich in great creative challenges and triumphs, rich in meetings and experience with remarkable people, rich in sexual adventures and complex human relationships. The story of how the child of Greek immigrants came to become the director of two of the classics of the American Theatre \\"Death of a Salesman\\" and a 'Streetcar Named Desire\\" and of two of the great American movies, \\"On the Waterfront\\" and \\" East of Eden\\" is told with remarkable frankness and perceptiveness.Kazan does not come across in this work as a saint, but rather as a truly strong person who took what he wanted from life, even if this meant hurting others. His personal and inner torments however too make up an interesting part of this story.One more point. His writing follows the rule of Henry James and is always interesting. This is a work whose richness in anecdote and event are so great that it fits into the 'couldn't put it down' category."},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"This is the best show-biz biography I have ever read. Poor, Greek immigrant, Kazan fought his way up the entertainment ladder to direct my favorite movie (On The Waterfront) and my favorite play (Death of A Salesman). Along the way to these achievements he was an original member of the Group Theater; he relates his experiences there including an in-depth retelling of his relationship with Lee Strasburg. He met prectically everyone in the business from an aspiring Marylin Monroe, Marlon Brando, James Dean, Arthur Miller and what seems thousands of others in the theater and movie world. His antecdotes are fresh and revealing, even those that may be common knowledge. Of particular note are the chapters devoted to the making of Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront. His work with Brando, who was seldom better than when he worked with Kazan, is discussed. Along with his great movies and plays, Kazan tells his side of the House On Unamerican Affairs controversy that swirled about him until his death. While the book is massive at 864 pages, it is over too soon. It is a rare, literate portrait of the man Kazan, who changed American movies and theater forever-- and for the better."},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"This is simply one of the finest books I have ever read in any genre. Brutally honest, relentlessly engaging, furiously analytical without being pompously intellectual, stunningly written, Kazan tells his life story without pretense and with no holding back. His family origins, early years with the group theatre, breakthrough work on Broadway and Hollywood, gossip raised to the level of art, stories of the great theatrical and film figures of the second half of the twentieth century--it's all here. We get to know about Brando, Dean, Clift, Williams, Miller, Inge, Monroe, Beatty, and on and on, in ways we haven't before. His relationship with his wife, who is as rich a character as in a great novel, is told with such warmth and complexity, and his profound ambivalence about his relations with others, is also at the heart of this work and it fuels our interest in Kazan's private life as he weaves connections with his art and his public life. It's also as good a political and artistic portrait of the times as you could wish for. And it's all just so damn entertaining"},{"Title":"Elia Kazan: A Life","review":"I became a part of Kazan's world upon reading the first sentence of this remarkable book. Kazan raises candor to the level of literature, something most writers simply cannot do. But it's so worth aspiring to as a means of written communication.Kazan must have kept extensive personal files and journals to construct such a flowing narrative, which maintains a consistent energy through its 800+ pages. Kazan spares no one, least of all himself, in recounting motivations, actions and consequences throughout his extradordinary journey as an actor, a director and a writer.What interested me first about Kazan was his association with the Group Theatre, Harold Clurman, and Clifford Odets. His later adventures with Tennessee Williams, Marilyn Monroe, and the House Un-American Activities Committee also make for engaging reading. However, there's a depth to the writing that goes beyond Kazan's show business background. I learned a lot about myself by reading this book, and that quality makes this a superb autobiography."},{"Title":"Il Deserto dei Tartari","review":"Difficile trovare una trama piu' semplice: il senso di questo romanzo &egrave; che gran parte delle donne e degli uomini di questo mondo spende la propria vita in attesa di qualcosa che non arriver&agrave; mai e se ne va senza lasciare alcun segno. Ma l'accettazione di questa apparente insensatezza della vita umana, nel mantenimento di una propria dignitosa pulizia, diviene il vero percorso di guerra da affrontare. Il giovane ufficiale Giovanni Drogo - un uomo senza vistose qualit&agrave;, ma che al termine della sua vita potr&agrave; dire \\"dopotutto la coscienza non &egrave; troppo pesante\\" - viene assegnato, senza averne fatto richiesta, ad una fortezza isolata nel deserto, dove \\"tutti sono venuti per uno sbaglio\\", come gli spiegher&agrave; il medico militare. Da quel momento tutta le sua vita &egrave; dedicata al presidio di quel pezzo di deserto, il deserto oltre il quale vivono i \\"tartari\\"; ma l'attacco dei tartari, la cui esistenza stessa appare pi&ugrave; un ipotesi che una certezza, non arriva, n&eacute; arriver&agrave; mai. Buzzati raccont&ograve; che l'idea del libro nacque durante le lunghe notti passate inutilmente nella redazione di un giornale; gli venne l'idea di trasporre questa condizione di attesa in un contesto militare di fantasia e nel luogo dove, per definizione, nulla pu&ograve; accadere. Ecco allora la metafora della \\"Fortezza\\" e il ritratto dei tanti uomini diversamente impegnati, chi per la causa comune chi per procurare vantaggi a se stesso, ma tutti destinati ad un'opera la cui mancanza di senso pu&ograve; sfuggire solo ai pi&ugrave; ottusi. Drogo condivide l'attesa di una guerra che non giunger&agrave; mai (i caduti sono un soldato ucciso da un compagno perch&eacute; non ricorda la parola d'ordine o l'ufficiale disperso in una tormenta) finch&eacute; arriva anche per lui il momento di lasciare la Fortezza, quando vecchio e malato viene cacciato come un inutile peso. Ormai solo e senza affetti sosta in una locanda durante il viaggio verso una casa che non ha alcun desiderio di raggiungere, e in una notte finalmente stupenda, evocativa di una felicit&agrave; cos&igrave; possibile eppure cos&igrave; sfuggente, si accorge che \\"la vita dunque si era risolta in una specie di scherzo\\". Ma libero dai condizionamenti della vita normale, realizza che vivere con coraggio la sua ultima notte pu&ograve; essere la vittoria pi&ugrave; importante, l&igrave; dove nessuno potr&agrave; ammirarlo, dove le trombe non suoneranno e i superiori non premieranno il suo coraggio. E finalmente, nel buio, Drogo sorride. Un romanzo di eccezionale bellezza e profondit&agrave;, una intuizione lucida ma in fondo intenerita sul senso della vita e sulla capacit&agrave; delle societ&agrave; moderne, cos&igrave; protettive, di farci dimenticare chi siamo realmente."},{"Title":"Splinters from an African Log","review":"I read this a long time ago, so my memory is faded. I remember I liked the book a lot and I could not put it down. The author was a young woman, just out of medical school. Not much life experience yet. I don't remember what color she was, but I think she was a typical western girl from the suburbs. That's the impression I got. She was hired by a Christian missionary medical place in africa, where things were very primative.I remember one particulary moving part near the beginning. They got a tour of their office, and it was pointed out to them that the pantry was really a coffin, and if someone died, they would need to be buried in a hurry because of the heat and threat of disease. Well, one of the head people - the one with all the answers -- got sick. It was determined that the only way to save her life was to get ice. It was hotter than blazes with no electricty. No way to get ice. The small medical staff joined their hands in prayer and begged God to send ice. Then our young girl sat at the front desk to mind the front door (since she was the new girl) and she looked at the pantry on the wall wondering how to get it down. It still chokes me up to think what happened next.She talks a lot about the struggles they had in the field, and how they gave everything they had to help people, but resources were so short. Then she would go home to see her parents, and see the luxery her friends lived in. How one milkshake could by medicine to save lives. How the people in congregations were oblivious to the missionaries their churches were supporting. It was a very moving book."},{"Title":"Electronic Evidence and Discovery: What Every Lawyer Should Know","review":"This textbook not only gives theory information, it also cites cases that are practical and useful in e-discovery applications.It is very condensed and easy to read."},{"Title":"Electronic Evidence and Discovery: What Every Lawyer Should Know","review":"Electronic evidence is a hot topic in legal circles today - and with good reason. If you haven't yet been served with discovery requests seeking electronic documents or email, you soon will be. What are your obligations in responding to discovery seeking electronic evidence? Do you possess the technological sophistication necessary to properly advise your clients what to do regarding preserving electronic evidence once it becomes apparent that litigation is a possibility? When is it appropriate for you to request a computer forensic investigation? What is the current case law on which party is responsible for the costs of producing electronic evidence and what are appropriate sanctions for not producing electronic evidence or failing to prevent it from being spoiled?These questions and many more are answered in this comprehensive analysis of electronic evidence. The book begins by examining the need for every lawyer to become familiar with this area of the law.In addition to the \\"old-fashioned\\" method of discovery, electronic evidence is affecting virtually every investigation, whether criminal or civil. Today, there is not usually a \\"paper-trail\\" to establish who did what and when. Instead, electronic footprints and fingerprints often provide the clues to solving a multitude of question of conduct or action. Today's investigators must understand computer forensic best practices as they mine metadata and electronic files for digital clues and evidence to support a case.Today, many businesses are creating and storing documents in electronic format only. Due to the inexpensive cost of digital storage, those documents are often copied to a variety of locations and preserved for extended periods of time. In many cases, the computer is often a good starting point of investigation.Almost every interaction with a computer or other piece of electronic media creates an electronic trial of evidence. Computer media is often the best place to begin looking for potential evidence, whether on one hard drive, a network of servers and desktops, or a pile of backup tapes. In order to discharge their duties to clients, lawyers practicing in the 21st century must now be prepared to handle this modern form of evidence, along with all the new and unique technical and legal issues that come along with it.The authors succinctly describe how electronic documents and email are not easily deleted. Because electronic documents leave an electronic fingerprint on a computer's hard drive, when data is deleted the space occupied by that file is merely marked as available for use. Unless new data is writtenonto the part of the hard drive where that file was located, even \\"deleted\\" data is recoverable by experts. A common phrase used by those frequently dealing with electronic evidence is that \\"delete does not mean delete.\\"Case law is clear that deleted data can be discoverable. In addition, courts have ruled that electronic evidence is discoverable regardless of its location, including, desktop computers, laptops, servers, floppy disks, CD-ROMS, DVDs, Jaz and Zip disks, PCMCIA memory cards, USB drives, and backup tapes. Virtually any device that can store electronic evidence is potentially discoverable, including cell phones, PDA (personal digital assistants), Blackberries or MP3 players (such as iPods).One of the more interesting issues presented dealt with the preservation of electronic evidence once a lawsuit or investigation has begun. One area that many lawyers may not have considered is the inadvertent destruction of electronic evidence by simply maintaining the status quo.Many businesses (including law firms) employ a tape backup procedure to create a copy of all data produced by a company. These tapes are retained for purposes of disaster recovery and are often recycled or reused as a cost savings method. In other words, daily backup tapes are sometimes reused the following week or month, and data on the older tape is overwritten with updated information. When litigation is likely, it may be necessary to advise clients to suspend or at least modify their automated tape recycling protocols. For a large organization, this may require immediate discussions with the client's I.T. manager or staff. The authors suggest that it may require even more drastic steps.Until appropriate copies or backups are created, a party under a duty to preserve should work with their I.T. team to ensure that (1) all document destruction policies are halted, including recycling of backup tapes; (2) any automated destruction protocols or system maintenance such as defragmentation are stopped; (3) new software that might overwrite relevant data is not installed; (4) virus protection software and techniques are up to date and properly working to protect from data loss; and (5) website content and links are preserved.The authors warn that the best way to avoid unintentional spoilation due to everyday computer use is to make a mirror image of the hard drives in question. It's best to use computer forensic experts for this process since most commercially available software fails to copy deleted files or remnants of older files. Unless a lawyer is familiar with this area of practice, it's easy to see how lack of technical knowledge can quickly get the client - and the lawyer - into serious trouble.The authors ably describe the importance of electronic discovery and they fully explore all the legal and technology issues in this fast-changing area of the law. The book has an excellent Appendix that cites and summarizes all the important electronic discovery and computer forensics case law (conveniently organized by topic). The Appendix also presents local and state statutes dealing with electronic evidence, along with sample electronic evidence preservation letters to clients and opponents. In addition, sample interrogatories and requests for production of documents are given, together with secondary research resources.Computers have become an integral part of everyday life. Electronic data is all around us. Lawyers must recognize that discovery of electronic evidence in many cases will be essential. This book provides a wealth of information that will help attorneys navigate the potential land mines found in this emerging legal practice area. This book is aptly titled - every lawyer should know at least the basics about electronic evidence and discovery."},{"Title":"Electronic Evidence and Discovery: What Every Lawyer Should Know","review":"I found this book to be a crucial read for paralegal's, attorney's and consumer's as it provides a quick read and is critical to know what records can be accessed with a subpoena, and are not protected by privilege."},{"Title":"This Fabulous Century","review":"My grandma has this series in her basement and every time I go to her house I look through them all.

But also much more: His feeling on race. He obviously did not hate blacks, proposed a theory that they were less intelligent, had an aesthetic view of man akin to Gulliver's Travels and the horses. Theory of education is much akin to European model of today, much better than current theories in use. He opposed multiculturalism and opposed teaching children religion in schools or anyplace else, preferring Greek, Roman and European histories and philosophy for guidance of children.

This work, Jefferson's only book, shows his powerful, brilliant mind at it's best. Jefferson shows the depth of his knowledge, not just on his own beautiful state, but on human nature itself. Some of the gems in this work are his views on education, advocating free public education for all, free government, advocating a revisal of the defective original Virginia Constitution. His knowledge of slavery, and the Indian races before his eyes are from personal experience and observation. Although painted by the deconstuctionist left as a &quot;racist&quot; Jefferson was a dangerous radical to the Virginia gentry due to his advocacy of emacipation and deportation of slaves. His views on black inferiority are exaggerated since he placed them forth as a scientific hypothesis based on personal observation. Jefferson could not see a &quot;multicultural&quot; society in America made up of former masters and slaves with resentment and prejudice still in the hearts of both. Many of his predictions about race relations have come true: hate, resentment, power struggles, and a continuing obsession which he forsaw would destroy the America Republic.The best edited version of the is Koch and Peden's edited on in &quot;The Life and Selected Writings of Thomas Jefferson&quot;, but the full Notes is very good, but the reader must be prepared for numerous charts and tables.

This book is filled with fascinating details, stories and antedotes that keeps the reader engrossed from beginning to end. Will Swift clearly has a great understanding not only of British Royal History but American History as well, this knowledge combined with a effortless, free flowing writing style makes this book a pleasure to read. For anyone with a interest in the Roosevelts and/or the King and Queen of England this is a definite must read. Don't miss this book and the story of infamous first royal hot dog."},{"Title":"The Roosevelts and the Royals: Franklin and Eleanor, the King and Queen of England, and the Friendship that Changed History","review":"If you like a blend of biography and history as I do, you will love this book. Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth are vividly portrayed here. Their alliance and, later friendship, and their commitment to mix charm and duty for the public good are set against Joseph Kennedy and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor's self-serving attempts to gain attention and power. The author, a psychologist, shows us the inner workings and motivations of all the main characters without sounding like he is doing a case study.Most of us are aware how FDR and Churchill worked together to build the \\"special relationship\\" between America and Britain, but this book rounds out the story by showing the complicated three-way partnership between Churchill, Roosevelt and the king. I was surprised by how little I knew about the king and queen's role in softening American isolationism and in persuading Roosevelt to send war materials to Britain when it was at the brink of extinction.I was fascinated by how the king and queen won over Americans in Washington and New York during their 1939 state visit. The author gives us the full drama of the hot dog picnic at Hyde Park and explores how it helped to heal British-American relations.The Roosevelts and the royal family remained friends until Eleanor's death in 1962. There is a wonderful vignette in the book about Eleanor's visit with her granddaughter to Buckingham Palace for tea with Queen Elizabeth II in 1957. The Roosevelt- royal connection has recently been revived by Prince Andrew on visits to Hyde Park.The author has obviously done his homework- with careful research at both the FDR Library and Windsor Castle- and has talked to many of the Roosevelt grandchildren. Like Jon Meacham's Franklin and Winston, and Doris Kearns Goodwin's No Ordinary Time, this book brings historical relationships to life, and provides an accurate depiction of a period in time. This is a truly impressive biography of four of the twentieth century's greatest leaders."},{"Title":"The Roosevelts and the Royals: Franklin and Eleanor, the King and Queen of England, and the Friendship that Changed History","review":"Will Swift does a terrific job in bringing to life the personalities and issues of a critical time in world history. This book is a must read for those interested in the events of the time, and how those events influenced today's relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States."},{"Title":"The Roosevelts and the Royals: Franklin and Eleanor, the King and Queen of England, and the Friendship that Changed History","review":"We often loose sight of the reality that even the most globally sweeping events in history are ultimately influenced by the individual personalities of the protagonists. Broad political and economic forces are certainly the context and catalysts behind major historical developments, but the actual sequence and nature of events can often be most fully understood by an analysis of the psychological and emotional temperament of the key players in the drama. Will Swift's fascinating study of one paradigm moment in the history of the 20th Century clearly illustrates this premise. In clear, colorful and energetic prose, he unfolds the narrative of the evolving relationships between two of the most influential married couples of the century, Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt, and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. The fascinating counterpoint of both parallels and contrasts between the respective partners themselves and the two couples, are traced with the evident professional expertise that Dr. Swift brings to this study as a psychotherapist. Of particular interest are his portraits of the First Lady and the Queen. The unsensationalist, candid and sympathetic discussion of Eleanor's intimate relationship with Lorena Hickcok is nothing less than the coming of age of Roosevelt scholarship, which for too long has been unable to confront this dimension of the story with the calm objectivity it calls for. And for those of us for whom the Queen Mother was little more than a silent, smiling, waving icon with extravagant hats for the past fifty years, this portrait brings a remarkably strong and intelligent woman to life.While the narrative builds up to its symbolic climax with the Windsor's famous visit to Hyde Park in June 1939, all of the complex events, personalities and issues surrounding the alliance of the United States and Great Britain in the years preceding and following World War II, are covered and synthesized with clarity. And while the focus is certainly the War years, the respective chapters offer comprehensive and intriguing personality-centered biographies of the four individuals whose lives they weave together.I have long been an admirer and student of both the Roosevelts and of British royalty - a combination that is not unlikely, and clearly has contemporary parallels in the popular linkage between Jackie Kennedy, Princess Diana and their respective personalities and experiences.I found \\"The Roosevelts and the Royals\\" a wonderful addition to the literature of both Anglo-American relations, and the distinctive culture of both countries. It's a great read, fun and even suspenseful as it's subject unfolds... the lavish praise of the leading scholars of the Roosevelts and the Royal Family are richly deserved !"},{"Title":"The Roosevelts and the Royals: Franklin and Eleanor, the King and Queen of England, and the Friendship that Changed History","review":"The potential audience for this engaging work extends far beyond the royal watchers. Will Swift's unique lens framing The Roosevelts and the Royals brilliantly illustrates the political culture tie (not ascot) that binds. This psychologist masterfully showcases the subtlety that allowed the American public to access the royalty from which they once fled. As world reknowned Seymour Martin Lipset tells us in his theory of American exceptionalism, Americans have more values that join them than separate them-but always assumed that these value distinctions are what cut the cord from the mother country. The visit between the Roosevelts and the Royals tapped a major American vein, the undercurrent of core American values-egalitarianism, populism, individualism, laissez faire and liberty. We were \\"free\\" to serve hot dogs, what many Americans might be dining on in picnics across America. Compelling in both organization and writing, the book reveals the ultimate complexity of people, and that leaders can serve distinctive purposes in different time periods, often based on our fundamental orientations as people. Perhaps only such a well-trained psychologist could detect and successfully communicate what resonated between these people, in quite genuinely a friendship that changed history, and could capture the symbolical roots of the now formidable US-British alliance. Swift is able to show the generational learning the can occur between countries-the mother country, and the rebellion of the fledgling toddler nation, who ultimately sees what \\"genetic\\" propensities remain. So well-researched and written, it need not be reserved for political scientists and royal watchers, but for good book lovers everywhere, who truly appreciate an original."},{"Title":"The Roosevelts and the Royals: Franklin and Eleanor, the King and Queen of England, and the Friendship that Changed History","review":"This book is a fascinating view of American social history throughout the FDR years. It's backed up by extensive research and has pages of scholarly source notes, yet it's really fun to read--a highly enjoyable look at the American-British alliance and how strong this was at the time of the Greatest Generation."},{"Title":"The Roosevelts and the Royals: Franklin and Eleanor, the King and Queen of England, and the Friendship that Changed History","review":"The professional book review cited by Amazon really says it all about this book. The author's premise - that the Roosevelts and King George VI & Elizabeth had an extra-special relationship - is very overreaching, and padded to the nth degree. I guess that Hugo Vickers (per the Author's introduction) who is supposed to have read it from cover to cover before publishing, didn't notice the flawed research, the melodramatic phrasing, and repetition of hoary old gossip as the truth. I am so glad I only borrowed this from the library and didn't waste my money on a purchase."},{"Title":"Mountain Bike America: Washington, 2nd: An Atlas of Washington State's Greatest Off-Road Bicycle Rides (Mountain Bike America Guides)","review":"Very detailed comments on each ride. The authors have included relevant information on surrounding communities (ie laundry facilities, camping, dining, etc). Great maps!The only thing wrong with this book is a somewhat confused idea of what is East or West of the Cascades. I looked under the &quot;East&quot; section and was astonished at how few rides there were. It took me a while to realize that most of the good &quot;East&quot; rides are actually in the &quot;West&quot; sections. Somewhat distracting.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Sojourns in West Africa","review":"Steve Keenan has written a wonderfully authentic account of Peace Corps experiences that span nearly a a lifetime. Steve's narrative demonstrates a continuing concern for the citizens of Liberia, the country in which he served in the early days of Peace Corps, and that continue to be a focus some 40 years later. Sojourns in West Africa describes, in colorful detail, three encounters with \`the Mother Country': his initial experiences as a youthful adventurer and two subsequent journeys, under far more difficult circumstances, as a mature and dedicated benefactor of people he connected with some 40 years earlier."},{"Title":"THE HAUNTER OF THE DARK [Caermon Limited edition]","review":"Over the years I have come across many illustrated, comic book adaptations of Lovecraft works, and even more Lovecraft \\"inspired\\" creations. Most fall short in capturing the cosmic horror that is Lovecraft's trademark. There are two works, however, that succeedwildly in this endeavor. The absolute best, both artistically and horrificly, is John Coulthart's \\"The Haunter of the Dark : And Other Grotesque Visions\\" . The illustrations in this volume fully depict the occult evil and sanity shattering madness that Lovecraft specialized in. Judging by the attention to detail that Coulthart put into his satanic artwork, I would guess that he is more than just a casual dabbler in things arcane. He is also a spectacular illustrator.The 2nd noteworthy Lovecraft graphic work is not an adaptation of one of Howard's stories. It is one that uses him as a character in his own insane little world. \\"Lovecraft\\" , by Hans Rodionoff, Enrique Breccia, & Keith Giffen, is a faithfully wicked & terrifying concept piece.Buy both books and revel in brilliant insanity."},{"Title":"THE HAUNTER OF THE DARK [Caermon Limited edition]","review":"\\"The Haunter of the Dark and Other Grotesque Visions\\" touts a bunch of drivel by Alan Moore, who's become pompously undisciplined in his writing, but it is really the showcase for Coulthart. \\"Haunter\\" collects two and a half Lovecraft stories in graphic form. Coulthart tries his hand at \\"Dunwich\\" but admits he couldn't really improve on Enrique Breccia's in \\"Heavy Metal\\" magazine, so stops halfway through the story. (See Breccia's \\"Lovecraft\\" for more of his work.) It ends with a nice splash, though. Coulthart's most proud of his \\"Call of Cthulhu\\", which is hard to read because he breaks up the frames into odd angles to mimic the \\"horrible geometries\\" described in the story. This adds to the mystery of the story and a growing sense of horror as the pieces come together, an achievement unique to the comic medium. However, I'm convinced that Lovecraft's own effects are ultimately dependent upon the written word's ability to conceal things from and gradually reveal things to the reader's imagination, to tease us out of all rational thought. They just can't be equalled in another medium. Another jewel of \\"Haunter\\", though, is the portfolio of Lovecraftian \\"gods\\" that follows the stories. Coulthart uses the computer to combine, among other things, some of Ernst Haeckel's \\"Art Forms of Nature\\" etchings with his own drawing. Coulthart's not the first person to make this connection. It's well known that Lovecraft admired Haeckel's philosophy, and others have dabbled with using Haeckel's illustrations to evoke the creatures HPL describes in his stories. But Coulthart really commits to the connection. One only wishes he had given some credit to Haeckel. After this portfolio (with its nonsensical \\"evocations\\" by Moore) comes a collection of controversial \\"Lord Horror\\" illustrations. They are both prurient and puerile -- I damn them with my alliteration! HPL is most effective when trying to maintain dignity as well as sanity in the face of overwhelming cosmic terror, which is itself \\"dignified\\" in its own horrible (to human eyes) way, just of another, perhaps even loftier order."},{"Title":"THE HAUNTER OF THE DARK [Caermon Limited edition]","review":"The first half of this volume contains some of the best Lovecraftian graphic work to date. Several plates out Coulthart's \\"Call of Cthulhu\\" will probably be familiar to new readers, having appeared in other Lovecraft publications, and his \\"Haunter of the Dark\\" creates an equally brooding atmosphere filled with obsessively detailed images. Beyond that, there are ten fairly good, though sometimes gory pages on \\"The Dunwich Horror,\\" set up in story-board fashion.Then things really deteriorate: thirty-plus pages of elaborately swirly but atmospherically bland graphics devoted to the Mythos deities, accompanied by the babbling, Anglo-apocalyptic prose poems of Alan Moore, and twenty-five pages of the artist's non-Lovecraftian work for David Britton's \\"Lord Horror\\" series, which resemble the obsessively detailed and sadistic pen and ink drawings of some gifted teenage horror fan. The artist suggests a plausible linkage between the grimly stylized concentration camp architecture in several of these and Lovecraft's own apocalyptic vision, but many readers, I suspect, will find the results obscenely offensive. One can see how this stuff attracted the attention of British censors in the nineties, and it is irritating to find Lovecraft's name prominently displayed on the cover of a book that eventually strays so far from the spirit of his work. My inclination would be to look for the \\"Haunter\\" and \\"Cthulhu\\" series in another graphic-fiction anthology (maybe it's already out there); as it is, I would not recommend this as a gift for any Lovecraft-loving young person."},{"Title":"THE HAUNTER OF THE DARK [Caermon Limited edition]","review":"This is some beautiful, and exceptionally dark, illustrative work. He really does a great job of bringing HPL's words to life in graphic form. Nice coffee-table piece if you like to freak out your friends."},{"Title":"THE HAUNTER OF THE DARK [Caermon Limited edition]","review":"I really wanted to love this book. I am a huge Lovecraft fan and I enjoy graphic novels - this seemed like a sure thing.The biggest problem is the font. It looks cool, but it's very difficult to read, and I have to reread words in nearly every frame because the first reading made no sense because the font is so challenging. This kills the momentum of the story.The art is disappointing. It's not in color, which is fine. But it is heavy, dark, and too abstract/surrealistic. I have no problem using art in books as a starting point for my imagination, but this art makes it hard to visualize anything.Between the font issue and the abstractness of the art, I couldn't even finish it."},{"Title":"THE HAUNTER OF THE DARK [Caermon Limited edition]","review":"If you're a Lovecraft fan, then you know how annoying it is when you see a drawing of one of his Gods or characters and it looks stupid. The drawings in this book are amazing. There's a piece called The Great Old Ones in it that had drawings of all the Gods that is completely awesome to see as a huge Lovecraft fan."},{"Title":"THE HAUNTER OF THE DARK [Caermon Limited edition]","review":"This book i something of a total mish-mash. There's a bunch of random stuff at the end that seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with HPL.

In six parts, the author covers 91 of the current about 125 raga-s. The book also includes notes on transliteration and notation systems, musical terminology, glossary, and bibliography, as well as 29 illustrations of famous musicians and musicologists. Treatment of each raga has been broadly divided into introduction, comparative study, and technical details like ascent and descent, vadi-samvadi, pakad, chalan, and references. Every student of music should read this book.On the other hand, the book treats the thaat system too casually. Several current raga-s have been omitted. A short chapter on history and survey would have been useful Inclusion of illustrative compositions, even if only notation, would have been extremely helpful. lastly, a short treatment of taal-s would have been very relevant.There are very few publications of this kind. There is no doubt that this book fills admirably the special kind of need felt by students and scholars alike."},{"Title":"Comparative Study of Selected Hindustani Ragas; Based on Contemporary Practice","review":"excellent and very musical, very concise and clear. very well documented and practical. the top of that kind of book."},{"Title":"A thousand ways to please a husband with Bettina's best recipes,","review":"Though previously I was familiar only with the 1930's edition, I recently purchased the 1917 edition. It's great. There are 152 short chapters, which focus on newlyweds Bob and Bettina, their friends and families for about a year. A couple of pages set up the scene, then give the menu for a meal and the recipes. As well as recipes there are tips on stain removal, low-cost decorating, festive table setting, etc... The emphasis is on hospitality, economy, good stewardship, time efficiency, and a pleasant home. It's an insider look at housekeeping in the pre-technology era. One chapter spotlights a trip to the store for a \\"refrigerator\\"; after reading a few lines I realized the author was referring to an ice box, and a discussion ensued between Bettina and her friend, Mrs. Dixon, of the merits of the different models (top loading as opposed to front loading of the ice), drip pan and sizes of ice blocks required. One chapter mentions women's suffrage (women didn't get the vote until 3 years later). It's a fascinating look at homemaking during my grandmother's time.Recipes are fairly easy to follow but don't include recommended oven temperature settings. That information is easily obtained by a similar recipe in a modern book.The authors are Louise Bennett Weaver & Helen Cowles LeCron. The written description on the title page says: \\"The Romance of Cookery and Housekeeping Decorations by Elizabeth Colbourne\\". The illustrations are Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts and charming.While probably not a book for the ultra-modern, it is a delight for those who enjoy cozy books, like Miss Read, Jan Karon, Anne of Green Gables, Laura Ingalls Wilder, etc..."},{"Title":"A thousand ways to please a husband with Bettina's best recipes,","review":"For me, this was a trot down memory lane, since I loved my mother's original copy. The cover put me off, thugh.Although I don't go back quite to 1917, much of this was evocative of The Olden Days. My mother's copy was well-used and a perfect way to start cooking for a household of 2, with occasional parties and entertainments. The book is also a portrait of social (not society) life in the early 20th century, combined with the then-conventional view of women. My mother's copy is long gone and this is for one of my daughters.&#34;Remember, all measurements are level&#34; was, for some cooks, a novel idea in those days."},{"Title":"A thousand ways to please a husband with Bettina's best recipes,","review":"This is a scan of the actual printed book.

BUT the charm survives."},{"Title":"A thousand ways to please a husband with Bettina's best recipes,","review":"This book is written in story style. Each chapter is 2-3 pages long and includes a narration of some even in the main couple's lives and culminates in what the wife cooks for her husband (and often guests) that day. The first chapter is the couple's first home-made dinner after returning home from their honeymoon. Most of the recipes in this book are difficult to replicate in a modern setting because the appliances used are entirely different from what's available now. As best I can determine, the stove the wife in this book is actually powered by a wood fire. The book was published in 1917, after all! Also, some people might find the book a bit offensive because the plot involves various side characters solving all the problems in their lives and marriages by following the main character's example and settling into a domestic, traditional gender roles marital lifestyle, and cooking 1001 recipes for their husbands. Personally, I found it an interesting peek into the lives of the women of the past, and many of the recipes sounded delicious. A few were quite silly, though, such as a recipe for \\"A Ham Sandwich\\" and \\"A Pot of Coffee.\\"I found this book at Goodwill thrift store for $0.49."},{"Title":"A thousand ways to please a husband with Bettina's best recipes,","review":"At first, I was wondering about the title of the book, but the more I read it, the more I love it!

Nylander manages to bring the past alive for both the lay reader and the material culture student. A must for scholars of New England's past."},{"Title":"Our Own Snug Fireside: Images of the New England Home, 1760-1860","review":"This book is easy to read, the material is presented in a logical and straight-forward manner, chapter by chapter, covering all aspects of life from 1760 to 1860, including clothing, cooking, food, heating, family life -- everything you always wanted to know but didn't think to ask. I totally disagree with the previous reviewer [(A history student (MA)]. Author Nylander has certainly done her homework. The references cover a 100 year span and are from all types of sources -- the majority from first person accounts including diaries and letters, as well as books, newspapers, etc. There are various pictures (drawings) illustrating furnishings, equipment, placement of objects both within and outside the home. I have a MUCH better understanding of life during the mid-18th to the mid-19th centuries. The Author is an expert in colonial New England history and I thank her for sharing her expertise in this thoroughly enjoyable, readable, unstandable book."},{"Title":"Our Own Snug Fireside: Images of the New England Home, 1760-1860","review":"I enjoyed the book and agree with the other positive reviewers. However, the layout of the book was really terrible, and it hampered my enjoyment of the work.The book is presented in a wide format, which in paperback is difficult (floppy) to hold with one hand. This is a sit-at-a-table book, or at least a sit-and-hold-it-in-two-hands book.The body of the text itself is of normal width, thank goodness, but most of the illustrations, along with captions and credits, are presented in the wide margins. This doesn't do justice to the pictures, which are smaller than necessary, and requires that the credits and the captions be in very small font size, which makes them difficult to read (especially when you're handling this floppy book!)I'm sure this was someone's idea of a graphically interesting presentation, but I think there are good reasons for the normal book format.I still recommend the book, but wish that publishers would pay attention to readability first!

Jane C. Nylander has taken captions, accounts and paragraphs from diaries of several people of all classes, who lived in the era of 1760-1860, and expanded on how that culture lived. This is a treasure of a book through the eyes and written word of these people lived in colonial New England"},{"Title":"Our Own Snug Fireside: Images of the New England Home, 1760-1860","review":"This book is remarkable for its thorough coverage of all aspects of life between 1760-1860. I purchased this book for my own historical research, having read numerous books (both modern and antiquarian) related to the time period covered in Nylander's \\"Own Snug Fireside.\\" I highly recommend her book for its accuracy, depth of subject matter, daily life details, and excellent photos/ drawings of the subjects being discussed. After reading her book, I not only became much more informed on the historical period, but I felt as if I'd gone on a journey back in time. The book is full of useful period engravings, photos, reproduced paintings in each chapter. The balance and thoroughness of each topic gives the book a seemless, authoritative feel. This book deserves the same attention and recognition of any of Larkin's books; it is an excellent achievement about a time period worthy of more modern scholarship. One of the other reviewers makes a very unfair charge, claiming that this book is based on only a couple of historical diaries; rather, this book's bibliography is eye-poppingly lengthy (literally hundreds of bibliographic entries) and the information Nylander writes about is spot-on accurate. As I have a particular interest in historical accuracy, and have read extensively on this time period, I can vouch that Nylander's information corroborates not only with other modern scholarly works but with antiquarian works printed between 1760-1860."},{"Title":"Our Own Snug Fireside: Images of the New England Home, 1760-1860","review":"Nylander's semi-biographical book on New England women's history is problematic for many reasons. Firstly, she carries the brunt of her argument on insufficient evidence...only four diaries. In a region that's rich with historical documentation, she should easily have been able to find more evidence. Secondly, Nylander systematically ignores issues of class or race, instead depicting a very rosy image of white upper class women as representative of all women in this time period. At the very least, Nylander should have been more forward about her intended focus."},{"Title":"Mackenzie's Legacy: Mackenzie's Mountain\\\\Mackenzie's Mission","review":"I am a long time lover of a good romance books. Danielle Steele being my favorite. Linda Howard has blown Steele out of the water. I had never heard of Linda Howard but picked this book up on a whim. It sounded good so I thought I would give it a try. I finished the whole thing (both Mountain and Misson) in two days flat. I then went in search of the rest of the Mackenzie stories and found Mackenzies Honor which has Mackenzies Pleasure and A Game of Chance. I have loved all four books but I am a bit disapointed that I could not find the story of Maris (Mackenzies Magic). I know that it was not a full length book and it is out of print. The other four were out of print too so it seems like they could have included Magic in one of the compiled bookes. I have a hunger to know about Maris and I hope it is re-released soon.Anyhow, I have since read more than 10 more of Linda Howard's books and have liked them all but none compare to the Mackenzies. I completely fell in love. I am working my way through all of her books and have not been disapointed yet. Howard delivers a wonderful story in each of her books. She is the best author I have come across yet."},{"Title":"Mackenzie's Legacy: Mackenzie's Mountain\\\\Mackenzie's Mission","review":"I just started reading Linda Howard novels this year and I read the last of the series about the Mackenzie family first and then had to try and find the first of the series. Fortunately Mira decided to republish these in double books. I enjoyed reading the whole series. Each book is able to stand alone even if you never read the other three books. It was a very enjoyable read, fast paced and interesting. Wolf, Mary and Joe are all very finely drawn believeable characters. The story line was kept me interested and did not seem to be a formula. Linda Howard's writing style is fast paced and I can easily read one of her books in a day. Her comtempory romances are especially good. Hope Linda Howard keeps on writing for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Mackenzie's Legacy: Mackenzie's Mountain\\\\Mackenzie's Mission","review":"Both of these stories are great.

There are suspenseful moments of laughter, outrage, excitement, and pride, and of course those steamy, drool-worthy moments that make you blush and turn green with envy at the same time.It's impossible not to like these stories. Be sure to get \\"Mackenzie's Honor\\" for the stories of Zane and Change as well as \\"Mackenzie's Magic\\" (always part of an anthology since it's a novella) to round out the set.Linda Howard writes the best hero's in the genre and always delivers a do-not-miss book.

This book opens your eyes in different ways and helps you to love your life if you think it sucks. Hence, this book is good for those women who say: I've got everything in my life (house, loving husband, children, etc.), but I still feel unhappy. Read this book and you'll understand that you're the happiest woman in the universe!"},{"Title":"Burned Alive","review":"It is highly suspenseful and I especially liked the evil telephone motif. This was back in the days before calling features when the phone still had enough mystique to sometimes in still fear.Several reviewers have impugned the credibility of this story. The basic premise, unfortunately, is highly plausible and not just confined to Muslim countries. Someone also expressed contemptuous disbelief that Souad's mother would actually suffocate her baby daughters. This story takes place about three decades ago. Today gender (almost always female) infanticide has been made obsolete by ultra-sound. In countries like India (majority Hindu) and China (majority atheist) female fetuses are aborted at such a high rate many young men have difficulty finding wives. Many baby girls who manage to make it out of the womb alive end up in orphanages. This perturbing aspect of females helping to perpetuate their own subservient status is an irony usually overlooked by readers.Burned Alive is a timeless story. This version just happens to take place in Palestine. Souad lives a very isolated and abusive life. Instead of her parents building self-esteem in their daughter, and warning her about the archetypal Humpty-Dumpty, they treat her as some sort scourge turned servant as compensation for not having been born male. She is kept locked up behind walls so that she won't escape and no one will use her. When she eventually manages to sneak out she is putty in the hands of a wily older man looking to score. He showers her with \\"kindness\\" and flattery, tells her he loves her and wants to marry her, etc. He gets her pregnant and then leaves the country for an extended vacation. It also turns out that he's already married or has a fianc&eacute;e.This creates an embarrassing quagmire for Souad's family: It makes the men look like a bunch of weenies who can't control their women. It also spoils their cash crop since in many cultures the groom must pay a bride price to the male head of household. Ergo, pregnant Souad must be annihilated in order to punish her and save face.In the US murder is the leading cause of death among pregnant women, usually perpetrated by the husband or boyfriend who wants to be relieved of his paternal responsibility. Fortunately, defending one's so called \\"honor\\" is not a defense for murder. So, Charles Stuart, who fatally shot his pregnant wife and superficially shot himself blamed it on a non-existent black man. Rae Caruth denied shooting his pregnant girlfriend and if this had been prior to the advent of DNA testing he could have simply denied paternity. Scott Peterson blamed it on a band of marauding Devil worshippers. His trial was a death penalty (which is rarely carried out) case and he was convicted of two murders.I am very grateful that in America women enjoy a status, economic power, and legal protect that exceeds that of many nations. Unfortunately, these advances haven't eradicated misogyny, which fuels violence against women.FYI: For those interested in this subject I also recommend The Garlic Ballads by Mo Yan. It takes place in the Chinese countryside in 1987. A young woman, Jinju, is forced into an unwanted marriage with a much older man in order to secure a happy marriage for her older brother. Corrupt officials refuse to help her and she runs off with her true love. It is also a brutal story and its premise is basically the same."},{"Title":"Burned Alive","review":"When she was 18, her brother-in-law poured gasoline on her and set her aflame. She was meant to die because she was pregnant and unmarried, bringing disgrace to her parents. But she survived, and now, 25 years later, \\"Souad\\" bears witness to the horror of \\"honor crimes\\" that kill thousands of women every year in many countries across the world. She begins with a bitter account of what it was like to grow up female in a remote Palestinian village in the Occupied Territory. \\"Being born a girl was a curse.\\" Unlike her brother, she never went to school. Her father beat her daily. She worked as a shepherd, a \\"consenting slave.\\" She barely glimpsed the city, where women were free to work and move around. Her rescuer was Jacqueline, a European aid worker, who was in the Middle East to care for children in distress and who arranged for the badly burned young woman to be flown to Switzerland, where she and her newborn baby received medical care and support. Today Souad is \\"somewhere in Europe,\\" married with three children, her testimony still anonymous for her protection. Occasional chapters by Jacqueline fill in the wider context, but it's the immediacy of the shocking first-person narrative that drives home the statistics. (From the other version of \\"Burned Alive\\" here at Amazon.com)This is a book that will stay with you for a long time. I felt like crying when I finished it, because it's so horrible that things like this happen. Honour crimes DO happen. There have been several just in Denmark over the past few years. I'm glad there are people out there like Jacqueline, who is willing and able to help."},{"Title":"Burned Alive","review":"This is a much read for any and everyone but especially those like myself that are interested in women in oppressive societies.

Look at book of Genesis, where Tamar, a widow, gets pregnant; her deceased husband's father says \\"take her to be burned.\\" What right did he have to kill her? Was she his \\"property?\\" I suspect the answer might be yes."},{"Title":"Burned Alive","review":"I read this book a while back when doing research on violence against women and focused in the Middle East and Pakistan. I was touched by this story, as with all the others, because it sems inconceivable that the ego of an entire family rests on the 'honor' of a girl. Yet this is reality in many many places and even in some societies inside the USA. It took a lot of brabery to get this book written. Many cases go unkown because women are scared to come public with these atrocities done to them by the people they love most.I highly recommend it for readers searching autobiographies. One word of caution: an isolated event does not represent a society. It is the law and the observance of the law protecting women against domestic violence that can really provide a testament on how a society allows or forbids this type of behavior."},{"Title":"Burned Alive","review":"I mean aside the argument whether or not this is a true story, the writing of this thing is just awful. You don't sympathize with the protagonist because you get annoyed by them within the first 3 sentences. The story doesn't flow. I am not even going into the factuality of it all. You couldn't read it if it was a known piece of fiction.

She is also quite honest about her difficulties after moving to Switzerland. What makes this book a wonderful read is that she does not portray herself as \\"cured\\" after replanting herself in Switzerland. she discusses the psychological challenges that await her, as she tries to make a new family and also connect her old one, as her child from the improper union was adopted by another family . My only problem with the book is that Souad seems quite eager to adopt western traditions, morals and actions.

The documentary hypothesis assumes that the Bible as we have it is the result of four (or more) strands of authorship, designated as J, E, P, and D. This book makes its challenge on the basis of comparisons to a five-part structure evidenced in other ancient epics, and other poetic structures and techniques. This book is particularly fascinating when read alongside Richard Friedman's _Who Wrote the Bible_ which is a popular exposition of the documentary hypothesis.For example, Freidman's prize example of the documentary hypothesis, based on work by Julius Welhausen, shows that you can slice the Noah story into two separate accounts, written by two different authors, each with an allegedly separate vocabulary and concerns. Kikawada and Quinn look at the same passages, questioning the assumptions behind the documentary approach (showing, for example, other ancient writings that mix different names for diety in the same passages). They also show both large scale and local chiasms (inverted parallel structures) running through the Noah story, showing that the same repetition that documentary scholars see as evidence of multiple authorship, can be seen from another perspective, as evidence of concious artfulness. Reading Friedman and Kikawada and Quinn might also send you scrambling for another look at Thomas Kuhn's _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_, so that you can consider how one goes about choosing between conflicting paradigms.All in all, a fine, fascinating, surprisingly provocative work. It should also appeal to those who appreciate Robert Alter's books like _The Art of Biblical Narrative_. It has the same effect of renewing your appreciation for stories that you thought that you knew well."},{"Title":"Before Abraham Was: The Unity of Genesis 1-11","review":"In this fairly short and tightly reasoned book (unfortunately not now in print), Isaac Kikawada and Arthur Quinn argue very convincingly that the \\"documentary hypothesis\\" has had its day.Their thesis: that a hundred-odd years of scholarship inspired by Wellhausen's theory has _itself_ produced the very evidence which proves it false. In order to support this contention, the authors examine the portion of the Bible at which support for the \\"documentary hypothesis\\" seems strongest: the story of Noah and the Flood. And true to their aim, they deftly show that the very features of the text which seem to support multiple authorship can, when viewed slightly differently, also be seen as evidence that the text is the work of a single author capable of great brilliance and subtlety.It is this last point that I think deserves the greatest emphasis. Too often, the stories of the Jewish scriptures are written off as \\"primitive\\" or \\"barbaric,\\" and superficial contradictions or immoralities are taken as evidence of the unsophistication of the text's author(s) and target audience. Recognizing and questioning our hidden assumption here is an essential step toward recognizing the possibility that -- as Kikawada and Quinn put it -- if we think we spot an error in the text, it is more likely we who are at fault.For consider: since the \\"documentary hypothesis\\" requires a \\"redactor\\" who was not unduly concerned about obvious \\"contradictions,\\" why do we rule out the possibility that a _single_ author might have been similarly unconcerned? And if the latter possibility is _not_ ruled out, why do we assume that these apparent \\"contradictions\\" are not stylistic contrivances that are intended for a more sophisticated audience than we have thus far considered?And in that case, might not the very features of the text revealed by proponents of the \\"documentary hypothesis\\" be themselves evidence of a deeper unity and design? Why, rather than look for such unity and design, do we assume the \\"redactor\\" must have been so stupid as to be unable to recognize difficulties that are obvious to any child (and indeed were discussed in the Talmudic literature at least two millennia ago)?Kikawada and Quinn have laid waste to the \\"documentary hypothesis\\" by accepting what is good in it and showing that it undermines itself. This little book will be of interest to all who wish to defend the integrity of Scripture, and especially to readers of Umberto Cassuto's _The Documentary Hypothesis_ (unfortunately not now in print either)."},{"Title":"Before Abraham Was: The Unity of Genesis 1-11","review":"For any student of biblical exegesis who has been fed a diet of documentary hypothesis, and come away with a vague feeling of indigestion and a fear that you will not be able to keep it all down, this book will provide hoped for relief. It is solid food that leaves you feeling full and satisfied and hoping the authors will come back with another course in the near future.Kikawada and Quinn take the hand grenades that have been tossed into the orthodox foxhole over the last century and lob them back at their owners with devestaing effect.The authors meet the proponents of the documentary hypothesis on their own ground, tear down their strongholds and proceed to the high ground taking no prisoners.If you long to read Genesis again with a sense of joy and wonder, this is a book that will refresh your spirit with it's powerful new hypothesis of the eseential unity of the authorship of the Book of the Beginning."},{"Title":"Before Abraham Was: The Unity of Genesis 1-11","review":"I am surprised that this book has never attracted the attention it should have. Quinn and Kikiwada, two Berkeley scholars, make a compelling case for reading Genesis 1-11 as a unified text. The documentary thesis, with the sometimes convoluted efforts to separated out even fragments of verses to various author,s was very much a product of late romanticism and the belief in the representation of time and progress in natural phenomena--from the discovery of time differentiation in sedimentary rocks to the awareness that star gazing was a look into different times simultaneously. This same documentary thesis was popular among Greek scholars at the same time. Few critics now argue that Homer's Iliad is a mere patchwork, yet the documentary thesis of the composition of Genesis remains.With an extensive knowledge of linguistics, rhetoric, and literary theory as well as the careful use of the evidence used to jsutify the documentary thesis, Quinn and Kikiwada produce a reading of the first eleven chapters of Genesis which reveals a sophisticated and elegant construction that is far from being a patchwork or mosaic. Genesis 1-11 is a layering of chiasmus upon chiasmus, with each reinforcing the general themes of dispersion, a theme whic runs counter to that other closely related Near Eastern narratives of creation and the flood.The late Arthur Quinn died prematurely, but it is time that biblical commentators and biblical scholars paid these two men their due."},{"Title":"Before Abraham Was: The Unity of Genesis 1-11","review":"This book should be shelved next to &quot;The Bible Codes&quot;. The Bible codes claimed to find meaningful patterns in the way letters are distributed through the bible; Kikawada and Quinn claim to find a meaningful pattern in the repetitions and contradictions of the biblical text. They claim this is the author's art, rather than evidence of separate texts having been sutured together.Their reading is simply not convincing. The repititions in Genesis do not look like the similar repititions in other Near Eastern literature. They have a different quality, which is evident to any reader who is willing to look at the texts as historical documents rather than as some kind of lifeline to God.The documentary hypothesis lives. Kikawada and Quinn are forgotten by all but a handful of tenacious Christians. Do a websearch and see who supports their theory - evangelical Christian organizations."},{"Title":"The Poetry of Michelangelo: An Introduction","review":"This book gives a comprehensive and clear insight into the poetic works of Michelangelo yet also manages to gives a tremendously deep psycological commentary into the man behind some of the most original and awe-inspiring works of art."},{"Title":"Violence in God's Name: Religion in an Age of Conflict","review":"Surprised at academia's reductionist understanding of the link between religion and violence, McTernan seeks to bridge the gap between current theory and the practice of conflict resolution. Prior to teaching at Harvard, McTernan worked globally to promote peace. This work is a continuation of this interest, and is structured into six steps.First, McTernan provides a background to three current sociological theories on the cause of conflict: creed, greed, and grievance theories. The creed theory, or clash of civilizations theory, first argued by Sam Huntington, proposes that religion is the most profound difference between cultures and over time belief in different gods enhances the likelihood of conflict. The greed theory, outlined by Paul Collier, argues that civil strife is caused primarily by economic factors. The likelihood of conflict increases with a population in poverty, a dysfunctional economy, and a \`lootable' commodity or natural resource. Grievance theory, summarized by Ted Gurr, assesses the ethnopolitical climate of a situation and proposes that conflict is likely when a constituency feels resentment towards governmental discrimination and repression. Each of these theories is ultimately unsatisfactory in explaining the link between religion and violence, but all three suggest a part of the larger picture.In his second step, McTernan argues that religion is a salient factor in global conflict and should be regarded as such. There is a current trend in academia to reduce religion to a surrogate for grievance, greed, protest, and ambition. To reduce religion to this level proves myopic as religious terrorists attempt to use violence to create a new social order. Therefore, according to McTernan, religion needs to be seen as an \`actor' in conflict in its own right.The author's third step surveys the history of the world's major religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) to show the violent history of each. At the threat of extinction or with the need to expand its borders, each tradition justifies the use of violence. Within each of these faith traditions, the ambiguity of the sacred texts provides justification for using violence in the name of the Transcendent. McTernan also seeks to emphasize that current use of violence in religion is based on past ambivalence towards violence: one can find sufficient models in history where violence was used for religious purposes.Fourth, McTernan highlights contemporary examples of religious violence: Northern Ireland, Israel/Palestinian, and Sri Lankan conflicts. He recognizes that within each of these conflicts there is a complex interplay between such factors as politics, economics, ethnicity, and colonialism, but religion shapes and defines the dynamics of each conflict. The author opines that in order for durable solutions of peace to be found, religion must be addressed as part of the problem.McTernan's fifth step focuses on poverty, tolerance, leadership, and the role each can play in exacerbating or resolving religious violence. Poverty is not the sole cause of religious extremism, but a strong political will to resolve poverty on the global stage can reduce the threat of faith-based terrorism. Freedom of conscience and religious liberty are rooted in the tenets of each faith, and should be used to recognize and instill an environment of tolerance. Absolute truth claims, according to the author, should be resisted and the sacredness of human life should be top priority in order for people of divergent faiths to exist harmoniously. Political and religious leadership should not view conflict as a \`technical problem' with quick-fix strategies but should use \`adaptive leaps' to resolve tension. Religious leadership should be anti-clerical and should allow the whole community to help make decisions.Finally, McTernan provides his own insight into resolving religious conflict. In order to find durable solutions for religious conflict, strategies should not be top-down resolutions, as these view the conflict as a mere technical problem. He suggests that in order to make an adaptive leap, a bottom-up strategy must be employed. In order to build an environment of tolerance, places of worship on the local level should be enlisted to create programs for inter-religious understanding. Religious leaders should be proactive in addressing their own communities' responsibility in perpetuating violence, and a reexamination of beliefs is necessary in order to avoid absolute truth claims."},{"Title":"Violence in God's Name: Religion in an Age of Conflict","review":"I found this book to be very insightful. He methodically goes through the history of every major faith tradition (and a few extra) and illustrates numerous instances throughout history where both the leadership and/or the adherents of that faith have used their holy writs to instigate war and promote violence often doing so with a passionate zeal that is incredible and full of gore. However, rather than concluding all religions are therefore dangerous and should be eliminated, he urges all followers to take full responsibility for those ancient teachings and that shameful history and deal with it proactively and appropriately. Saying that \\"that is not *really* what we believe\\" or pretending that violence has not been perpetrated in our religious history only continues to allow people to use religion to justify murder and war. I read this several years ago and find I keep citing it and returning to it in my thinking. It is very provocative especially for those of us coming from faith perspectives. If we heed his advice we can begin to address the ways religion is (mis)used."},{"Title":"Violence in God's Name: Religion in an Age of Conflict","review":"It is difficult to take this book's claims about Islam seriously when the author refers to the Egyptian radical Sayyid Qutb as \\"Sayyid Qubt.\\" How could an editor miss this egregious mistake?"},{"Title":"Gloster Gladiator Aces (Osprey Aircraft of the Aces No 44)","review":"Compared to it's successors, the Hurricane and the Spitfire, the Gloster Gladiator hasn't been much published.

But the British used other fighters, one of which was the Gloster Gladiator. A fabric-covered biplane, the Gladiator was an anachronism by 1939. Yet it served well during the early part of the war, not only in the RAF, but also with the Royal Navy and Australian, South African, Finnish, Swedish, Greek, Belgian, Norwegian and Chinese air forces.Author Andrew Thomas clearly did a tremendous amount of research for the book, including interviews with surviving pilots. The color profiles and and photographs are excellent. My only minor quibble with the book is that it would have been improved with a short description of the aircraft itself and its versions."},{"Title":"Gloster Gladiator Aces (Osprey Aircraft of the Aces No 44)","review":"I have read a number of Osprey's Aircraft of the Aces series. The quality is a mixed bag. Some titles are excellent; Polikarpov I-15,16,153 aces is one of the best. Others are as I stated in a previous review to be tedious, somewhat boring recollections of day to day operations of the fighter aces, while not providing a strategic background or for that matter, any maps.One thing which is missing from a number of Osprey titles is any data on the Aircraft the aces flew. The series is called AIRCRAFT of the aces, after all.Although the subject matter has not had much publication, Gladiator aces is lacking. No data whatsoever is provided on the performance aspects and differences of the various Gladiator marks or more importantly, their opposition, mostly the CR.42s of the Regia Aeronautica.Reading this title, one gets the impression that the Regia Aeronautica was shot down in droves. Indeed, the CR.42 was superior to the Gladiator in all respects.On the positive side, the color plates are excellent quality. Great for the modeller, like myself. Also, the first hand accounts of ex-Gladiator aces is wonderful. More should have been included.Overall, unless you are buying the title for the color plates for modelling reference material, I would pass this one by. Indeed, not as good as other Osprey titles."},{"Title":"Gloster Gladiator Aces (Osprey Aircraft of the Aces No 44)","review":"Very interesting book well written and full of pictures.

St.John 'Pat' Pattle, Oiva Tuominen, Paavo Berg and more. This book boasts 82 pages of well written facts on the Gloster fighter. This book has color plates of British, Finnish, Chinese, and Belgian Gladiators.This is another good book by Andrew Thomas. Two thumbs up from me.

But then the ending happened: flat, nothing; I wanted more, a confrontation, dialogue between the villain and the characters. The ending was so abrupt. It's a maddening book.

Andrew Smith's new version of the Gospel of Thomas is a fine introduction to that important text. His commentary on the \\"Inner Meaning\\" of the Gospel of Thomas, linking it to the \\"Fourth Way\\" school of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, is very interesting; it is a landmark effort to make Thomas a useful spiritual guide for the present day. Today, Smith writes, &quot;The Gospel of Thomas asks us to choose between being dead and becoming the image of God.&quot; In addition to a full translation ofthe Gospel of Thomas, Smith's book contains a useful historically-based introduction to the text to enable ordinary readers to put Thomas into historical context and a set of penciled illustrations based on religious works by Rembrandt van Rijn."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Thomas","review":"Many fine works have been written about the Gospel of Thomas, still- and this seems to be the whole point- many of the sayings are cryptic and challenging. I often carry this book around with me, reading a saying and trying to come to my own understanding.

I found the commentary very interesting, it gave some clues to a possible interpretation- not the last word certainly, but then who has that?"},{"Title":"The Gospel of Thomas","review":"This version of Thomas has the virtue of being pocket-sized and easy to carry around, but had little else of value for me. The author attempts to correlate it with the philosophy of P.D. Ouspensky in a heavy-handed fashion that feels like a tract for Ouspensky, but doesn't present Ouspensky's thought clearly.There is very little actual commentary to help understand the crytic and at times opaque sayings of Thomas. Yet, as the superior Stevan Davies translation suggests, Thomas was written to challenge the reader, and force him inside to meditate as it were for answers. Davies does a decent job of commentary, more satisfying for me than the Marvin Meyer translation and commentary.Of course Elaine Pagels' &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; is essential reading for anyone who has appreciated the illuminating brilliance of Thomas. In time, I feel Thomas will be even more of a &quot;sleeper gospel&quot; and have a profound influence on what is preached in main-line churches, as well as having much potential to heal misunderstandings between Christians and Jews."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Thomas","review":"I've read many translations of the Gospel of thomas, but this is the first one that is just the right size for carrying around with me.

Now, in general, guessing the final revelation in a Keeler novel is quite impossible because new characters and previously-unknown situations come right out of the blue in the last few pages, so that the ultimate \\"solution\\" (for any writer but Keeler) would be considered a cheat. But Keeler doesn't twist this one... the ultimate reveal, of the notorious Blond Beast of Bremen, who of course has been \\"hiding\\" in plain sight throughout the novel, is a very big letdown any way you look at it, even though the Beast is a kind of super-criminal, a gifted mimic, actor, ventriloquist, acrobat, war criminal, con man and wife killer, there is just no way he could succeed at the impersonation he is supposed to be accomplishing undetectably throughout the course of the novel's events.As usual in Keeler novels there's an insurance fraud, which is made possible by a highly implausible practical joke that quickly gets out of hand... and there's a baffling puzzle: why do two competing groups want the ordinary alarm clock that was the property of a wealthy man who recently died, when careful examination reveals nothing concealed within the clock? There's also a murder mystery--- who killed a certain Chinese laundryman, and why?There are quite a few loose ends in the final wrap-up, including several key characters who are frequently mentioned but never come on stage at all. On the other hand, Keeler's detailed depiction of the operations of a large-circulation Chicago newspaper seems to be knowledgeable and authentic. I'm therefore not at all sure how to rate this one in the context of the rest of Keeler's huge output of crime and suspense and puzzle novels."},{"Title":"CHILDRENS MINDS","review":"This is a very easily read book putting forward key arguments against the theories of Piaget and Chomsky and proposing action steps to make more children succeed in todays' school environment (she sees rankings at school and the resulting feeling of being a failure as the key demotivating factor leading to children stopping development). Her main criticism of Piaget is that he is drawing his conclusion from experiments that are ill-fitted for children. First, she challenges the postulate of &quot;egocentrism&quot; in the ages below 7. She proves by sharing experiments of her own and her research fellows that children who failed in Piaget's &quot;mountain experiment&quot; (the task to describe 3 differently coloured mountains from a doll's rather than one's own perspective), suceeded in her &quot;policemen experiment&quot;, where the child is asked to hide from a policeman requiring it to take the view of the policeman to find the right hiding position. Her argument is that children are very well capable of seeing the POV of other people as long as this is relevant to them. While children below the age of 7 know very well the situation of having to hide in order to avoid punishment, they cannot identify with a doll's view of 3 mountains. The same way she proves that the capability to reason deductively ( a skill Piaget denies for children below 7) does exist in children but can only be shown in experiments that reflect the fact that children do have their own interpretation of the experimenters question, intention as well as the meaning of the situation based on their individual history. She continues with experiments proving that making sense of situations comes BEFORE language understanding that Chomsky's assumption of a LAD has no ground. And she finishes with applying her findings in her vision on how more children could be successful in our school system."},{"Title":"CHILDRENS MINDS","review":"Donaldson's book will stand for many years as the sterling example of a clear argument promoting learning language through a combined Chomsky/Piagetian perspective.

Using the entries here, it is easy to locate the manufacturer, model, relative date of manufacture, and background on most commonly-encountered lanterns.

Erwin Schrodinger's profound knowledge and deep philosophical thought are reflected in each chapter as he walks through the nature of reality as perceived by classical and quantum physics. The critical issues discussed are: Is cause - effect relationship required for physical reality? Does statistical and chance (probabilities) replace cause and effect? How quantum uncertainty affects physical reality? Could we determine the initial state of an electron? Does positivism makes sense in quantum world. These are some of the questions asked, and he tries to answer them with an easy to understand language. This work is another example of this great genius who was curious about life and the universe from a very young age.Schrodinger credits Franz Exener, Fritz Hasenoehrl, and David Hume for the idea of departing from mechanical concept of cause and effect. He suggests statistical outcome to replace pure cause - effect relationship. But practical impossibility to determine the initial state of an electron in spacetime precludes from understanding the final (effected) state of the electron. Statistical laws are even more clearly manifested when the behavior of each individual particle is undetermined. It is likely chance (probability) lies at the root of casualty. If the behavior of each atom in every single event is determined by casualty then the details of each individual cause - effect events in a multi-electron system must be registered (positivism,) in reality only the statistical outcome is registered. Thus chance is primarily important for the observed reality. The second alternative is the compulsion of physical law and not probability (chance) and statistical outcome would determine reality. An experiment can not decide between these two possibilities because scientific reasoning will allow us either to derive chance from law or law from chance. If mass, position and velocity of an entity is precisely known at the very start, and then the future behavior is easily predicted by classical physics. But classical physics does not make sense in quantum world (subatomic level), because identical conditions at a point in time do not invariably lead to identical results, but it results in identical statistical outcome; the relative frequencies of various possible events. According to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the velocity for a precisely defined position in space is not determinable. The second problem is determining the actual state of an electron. For example, it does not have a definite orbit around the nucleus that can be virtually detected, and it is in a state of perpetual motion around the nucleus without losing kinetic energy contrary to laws of classical physics. Experiments can measure only the energy level difference recorded in the form spectra. Virtual observation is essential to confirm the real existence of an object according classical physics. The exact registration of electromagnetic field generated by moving electron is precluded by Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Uncertainty principle is not an incomplete knowledge. The current view does not accept either ubiety or velocity as permanent objective realities. The word finding a particle at point A does not imply that it was there before. Our measuring device has brought it there or we disturbed its velocity while measuring and this doesn't imply it had a value. The implications of being and having are not the same even though the positivist philosophy concludes that they are one and the same.1.Schr&ouml;dinger: Life and Thought2.What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"3.'Nature and the Greeks' and 'Science and Humanism' (Canto original series)4.

International Communication and Education)","review":"How do foreign language (FL) teachers feel and act in respect of the intercultural dimension of their language teaching? In 2001, 424 FL-teachers in seven countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Poland, Mexico, Greece, Spain and Sweden) have answered a questionnaire for a quantitative, comparative study.Teachers think that FL-teaching should motivate and enable students to use the FL in practice. Therefore they teach more language than culture. For their culture-teaching they lack time, training and appropriate teaching materials (chapter 2). Teachers claim that they are sufficiently familiar with the FL-culture (chapter 3). Teachers in different countries have different views of their students' predisposition towards FL-learning, towards the FL-culture and FL-contact. In Bulgaria pupils are well predisposed, in Spain not (chapter 4). The picture teachers give of the type, frequency and time they devote to culture-teaching is complex. In average, results are satisfying, but there are great differences between the countries (chapter 5). Teachers use text-books extensively, even if they deem them to be useful only to a certain degree (chapter 6). Teachers organize contacts to expose their students to the target-language. They know that this is an opportunity for intercultural learning (chapter 7). Teachers would like to teach intercultural competence through their FL-teaching, but they are sceptical about modality, timing and effects (chapter 8). Therefore teachers believe in language-and-culture integrated learning, but hesitate to put it into practice (chapter 9). Teachers treat topics to the degree they are familiar with it and, in general, teach culture to the degree they deem it important (some do not), but some of the teachers willing to integrate intercultural competence teaching do not do so in practice (chapter 10).The authors recommend the following policy:Teachers should be provided with examples of how language and culture teaching can be integrated. They should be assisted in choosing and adapting teaching materials and be shown the opportunities of experiential learning for that purpose. Therefore teacher education should comprise: methodology courses with culture learning theory and theories of culture shock; courses for how to create experiential learning environments; courses in anthropology, ethnographic investigation technique and social psychology focussing on the individual.Cultural competence should become an attainment target of FL-teaching chapter 11).EVALUATIONThe book is well structured. The main findings are clearly stated, but could have been highlighted graphically. The policy recommendations are most sensible and clear.The study defines an average profile of all FL-teachers despite the fact that the teachers were not a balanced sample (age of teachers and students, mother-language of teachers and students, language taught, hours of teaching and teaching experience, public or private employment, institutional role of language teaching, national specificities etc.).The comparative component refers to the nation where the FL teaching takes place. Only once the comparison includes another factor: With regard to the pupils' views of the culture associated with the target language, the target languages English, French, German and Spanish are compared instead of the countries.In fact, this imperfect quantitative approach has been criticised by Bai Rui (2006), who would have proposed a multiple methods approach to be able to provide more insight into teachers' belief. Nevertheless, readers may arrive at conclusions of that kind: All they have to do is to fill out the questionnaire (Annex 1, pp. 186-214 of the book) with the necessary degree of introspection.Although the book does not pretend to be about theory (p. ix), which makes it difficult to seize the impact of some of the findings, as Bai Rui (2006) remarks, some comments of conceptual nature may be in place.1. The point of departure of the study is that language and culture cannot be separated and should therefore be taught together. Language courses should become integrated language-and-culture courses.If culture is always an inseparable part of language, then language courses have always been language-and-culture courses. Teaching the use of the polite form of address always needed context, has always been trained through dialogues. I would assume that it has always lead to an implicit comparison with the own cultural standards for politeness.Transferred to the study this means that the culture awareness of the teachers does not necessarily correspond to the load of culture in FL-teaching. It might correspond to the load of intercultural communication skills. The difference between the two is that 'cultural competence involves ['] a specific cultural area ['] whereas intercultural competence involves knowledge, skills and attitudes at the interface between several cultural areas ['] (p.viii). Intercultural competence is surely a useful skill, but it does not substitute cultural competence and even less linguistic competence. If the cultural turn in language teaching does not mean to take the language-and-culture path, but the language-and-intercultural competence path, then it does not only change path to the same goal, but it changes the goal itself. There is no doubt that psychology and economic geography and intercultural competence facilitate communication, but we wouldn't want to integrate all of them into a language course. In the contrary, the more we think that those skills are important, the more we should focus on them and teach them in special courses, differentiated from other content.After the study Lies Sercu, the author of 80 and co-author of the other 120 pages, has conducted research to understand if FL-learning is more effective when it integrates the cultural context or when language and cultural context come as two differentiated units. It seems that this question should have been addressed before and not after the 2001 study.Chapter 6 is in fact dedicated to what teachers think FL teaching materials should be like. The results are surely interesting as market research, but textbook-fashion is different from learning efficiency.2. There is another hidden presupposition for the study: Intercultural is taken as international. Of course the authors are aware of the underlying problem. The questionnaire asks 'What percentage of your school's population are ethnic minority community children?' (Question 2.2, p. 189) and the situation is 'unclear' (p. 215), in the sense that some teachers are in front of a rather homogeneous class, but others are not.It is clear that the reflection on one's own cultural background is different in a (socially, ethnically, etc.) heterogeneous group. Not necessarily more difficult, because once you have a couple of Indian students in your class, the 450.000 Indians in London will appear less as a surprise. From this point of view it is a sign of consciousness when teachers claim to be 'sufficiently familiar with the culture of the foreign language they teach' (p. 47) and not 'very familiar', because that would require an insight into, let's say, the Greek community in Melbourne of more than 800.000 persons.The FL-teaching situation cannot easily be limited to a one-on-one cultural contact. We know that, but when the study talks of Belgian teachers being familiar with German culture, we might miss the point that the Belgian students may not all be of a classical Belgian culture and the motivating part of German culture might rather be Turkish rap than Goethe. Intercultural competence is becoming complex. No wonder that teachers are not always satisfied with their text-books. And no wonder that teachers prefer to stick to language teaching, which already requires all their intercultural competence.I would not go as far as Holliday, Hyde & Kullman (2004), who are sceptical of the concept 'national culture' as such. Still, FL-teaching seems to have the cultural load already in the language and need not to refer to national cultures. But one thing is clear: Teachers will need more intercultural competence, and students will need more, therefore the conclusion of the book, the policy proposals, are very opportune."},{"Title":"Computing Concepts with C++ Essentials","review":"This is not the book to buy if you wish to learn C++.

I'd say it waffles on a lot but that's the nature of a lot of academic books regardless of subject.It's better explained as a good read from cover to cover but not as a stop and go source of reference.

The author uses his own classes to make C++ programs look like an easier OO language. Of course, this bit of information is not passed on to the reader. So the unfortunate victim painstaking types out the program into the compiler (in this case VC++ 5.0) and of course nothing works (the fact that he uses the latest ANSI standard which is unsupported by all but the latest compilers does not help!). The book keeps the reader in the dark about the fact that there was a world before ANSI.What a waste of a good many trees.

Coordinated by a world sage on this matter, Georgetown University's George W. Carey, the book is a series of essays by various authors. Occasionally an author sounds to be preaching the good old time religion, ignoring its contradictions, but overall this is a spectacular text - regularly breathless - about the demise of communities in America. Suggestions in restructuring are made to recover communities if we even desire deep human connectedness anymore, which is questionable. Missing are the effects of prosperity. Observation implies communities pull together in scarcity as long as it's not too severe. And though Leakey's central tenet for human survival is socialization, required by scarcity, it seems with prosperity we dissolve associations with equally natural tendencies - unless this is simply masked by hypotheses submitted in this book.Historically beginning with the \\"New Republic's\\" founder, Herbert Croly and his \\"Promise Of American Life\\" in 1909 (a strong influence on FDR), the authors survey these past and present opponents to their traditional, conservative approach to communities vs. Robert Nisbet, Tocqueville, etc. Those opponents are progressive liberals with utopian notions of harmony and unity through force of central government intrusion to \\"make us better people\\" for the greater good, which is also a goal of these conservatives, sounding opposed to \\"too much\\" individualism. Clearly humans need regulating, but how and how much are points of central contention between both parties. Progressives appear well meaning, idealistic and as out of touch with human nature as communism or sociologists, promoting forced fellowship, rather than natural human fellowship as messy and time consuming as it is.Doing for our heart and souls what forever feasting on fatty foods and television does for body and mind, modern communitarianism has - with the best of intentions that have become dogmatic - atomized us through two primary avenues. According to the authors, one is centralization of government assuming increasingly more of our lives once managed by face-to-face associations of people with vested interests in their community - not by distant strangers wrapped in legalese in far away bureaucracies. For example, when government hands out free food and finances, what need is there of local churches to care for their needy? Government's accomplice is an ever-expanding umbrella of \\"rights\\". Communities can no longer impose their will on members as this infringes upon individual rights. Today in America, parents may no longer intervene as council, guidance or command against their daughter's abortion. So much for the very kernel of society, a voluntary association if ever there was one, the family - now subordinated to individual rights as enforced by a court outside the home (assisted by society's view of fathers as dangerous, requiring protection by the State). We find that our \\"national community\\" (a nebulous abstraction) has created as sanction for its action, \\"social contract theory\\" - the idea we are collections of atoms, distant and removed from one another, bound by the weak gravity of legal contracts (historically false), not common sentiments and principles. We now require government to do what it cannot as it encroaches in the name of the people, \\"for the people\\", not \\"by the people\\". As national community continues to fail (Katrina, Rita, urban housing, welfare, education) we demand more of the same from the same inappropriate entity. Though traditional communities advanced by the authors may be stifling to the higher minds of true artists and genius, almost no one is either, especially in oligarchies where talents are absorbed by primal urge or never developed.

Ropes has written a classic history of the Union Army of under the brief leadership of John Pope which ended with Pope's defeat at the hands of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson at Second Manassas in August 1862. This slim book was part of a &quot;Campaigns of the Civil War&quot; series originally published in the 1880s, and the current edition is a verbatim of the original.While much has been said about Pope's bombastic &quot;Headquarters in the Saddle&quot; speech that offended many of the rank and file, and of his &quot;scorched earth&quot; policies that prompted Robert E. Lee to label Pope a &quot;miscreant&quot;, recent histories suggest that it was the selfishness of George McClellan and the uncooperative attitudes of McClellan's lieutenants who served under Pope, specifically Fitz-John Porter, that were primarily to blame for Pope's resounding defeat.This contemporary account of the actions of Pope's army pretty much affirms the recent accounts, commenting on how Pope was able to consolidate the scattered and badly beaten (by Jackson) elements of the Union forces in the Shenandoah into one cohesive force. Pope also established a pretty credible Union cavalry force that unfortunately was not supported by the Union infantry. This actually led to Pope's undoing when John Buford and a small cavalry force found itself alone up against Longstreet's entire corps in the Thoroughfare Gap. Forced to concede the Gap, the Union cavalry alerted Pope to the fact that Longstreet was coming in to relieve Jackson, who was pretty badly battered. Pope refused to heed this warning until it was too late, and was soundly thrashed.The reluctance of Fitz-John Porter to commit his corps to the fray, and of his mentor McClellan refusal to send troops already promised to Pope only contributed to an inevitable, though not necessary defeat.If only Ropes' book, with its small print wasn't so difficult to read!Even the wonderfully graphic maps are barely legible. I would recommend &quot;Second Manassas&quot; from the Time-Life Voices of the Civil War series, and &quot;Return to Bull Run&quot; by John Hennessey for further exploration of the Pope period in the Union Army."},{"Title":"The Army Under Pope","review":"This books is a compantion volume to Francis Palfrey's \\"The Peninsula\\". McClellen moved the Army of the Potomaic by sea to drive up the Yorktown peninsula on Richmond. Pope remained behind with what was renamed the \\"Army of Virginia\\" to defend Washington (The only instance of a Union army being named after a state instead of a river.) It was hoped that he could keep Washington covered while advancing on Richmond, and link up there with McClellen. But Stonewall Jackson was loose in the Shenandoah, which posed the threat of an end run attack on Washington. Lincoln feared for Washington's safty and kept Pope's force pinned at Fredericksburg, while Jackson slipped from the valley to join Lee in the defeat of McClellen. Once McClellen was beaten and withdrawing by sea, Lee and Jackson turned against Pope. Pope was defeated at the battle of Manassas (2nd Bull Run) and retreated into the city of Washington.This excellent study of small unit actions shows exactly what the opposing commanders were thinking and worrying about. The appendix contains actual exchanges of battlefield communications.Readers should know this 1885 classic is public domain and available in many editions which vary wildly in quality and type size.This book is part of a 12 volume set.(1) The Outbreak of Rebellion - John G.

Alister McGrath is one of my favorite authors and theologians, and I thoroughly enjoyed his chapter. I also enjoyed, though I disagreed with, Hick's chapter.This book presents four viewpoints on the issue of the exclusivity of Jesus Christ by some of the best in the field. John Hick discusses advocates Christian Pluralism and raises some interesting questions that aren't very easy to answer. Clark Pinnock, whom I had not encountered before this book, writes very well for Inclusivism, which was a position I had never heard defended by a known and credible Christian scholar. McGrath writes about Particularism, with Agnosticism toward those who have never heard. And Geivett and Phillips argue for the position I am surrounded by in my own context, which is straight Particularism (or Exclusivism).I enjoyed the book. Seeing the authors respond to each other, and not always incredibly charitably, gives the feeling of being in on a more private discussion. I loved it. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a discussion on the issue of Pluralism. The only point I was dissatisfied with was that there is not an extensive discussion on the fate of those who do not hear the Gospel. Great read!"},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"A great range of concepts and vocabulary is thrown around. A bit technical, but I found it intellectually and spiritually inspiring. And now I found out my alma mater is using it in one of their theology classes. I recommend it but its not for everyone."},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"Is Jesus the only way to God?What happens to sincere people of other faiths?What about those who never hear the gospel?You haven't been in ministry long if you haven't been bombarded with questions like these. Do you ever find yourself struggling to articulate compassionately the exclusivity of Christ for salvation? Are you intrigued by the arguments of inclusivism and pluralism?The Zondervan Counterpoints series answers the question of \\"salvation in a pluralistic world\\" by bringing together a wide spectrum of viewpoints on this sensitive subject. Four views are presented here regarding the fate of the unevangelized.First, John Hick makes a case for normative pluralism - the view that all ethical religions lead to God. In Hick's chapter, Hick testifies to his abandonment of Christian distinctives and his belief in the unknowable Transcendent which be believes is common to all religions. Pluralism becomes much less attractive upon reading Hick's attack on the most fundamental doctrines of Christianity.Next, Clark Pinnock makes a case for inclusivism - the view that salvation is found in Christ alone, but that conscious faith in Christ is not necessary for salvation. Pinnock's enthusiasm and optimism for the \\"goodness\\" of other religions is too sweeping. His case is emotion-based more than reason-based, but to his credit, he does seek to back up his belief with Scripture. I have written on inclusivism on blog, so I won't repeat my thoughts on the position.The third position is Alister McGrath's belief that salvation is in Christ alone, but that we cannot know for sure the fate of those who never hear the gospel. McGrath's contribution differs sharply from the others in that he presents his argument by questioning many of the assumptions behind the idea of \\"salvation\\" and by seeking to avoid being too influenced by the Enlightenment.The final contribution comes from R. Douglas Geivett and W. Gary Phillips. These men present the traditional view of salvation in Christ alone and the necessity of conscious faith in Christ.Upon reading this book, I was struck by how one's view of God seems to determine which side one will takes in this discussion. Hick's \\"God\\" is virtually unrecognizable to traditional Christianity. Pinnock's \\"God\\" is the all-American, equal-opportunity for everyone Deity that is \\"fair\\" according to human standards. McGrath's \\"God\\" won't fit in any box. Geivett and Phillips holy \\"God\\" has revealed himself in Scripture and calls all people to repentance and faith in His Son.Pick up Four Views on Salvation. It's a worthwhile read. This book does more than address the question of salvation in our pluralistic world. It leaves you with a firm understanding that the very identity of God himself is at stake in the debate."},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"This book is part of the Zondervan Counterpoint Series which I would highly recommend. For the lay person who has a full time job, the various views presented can get you up to speed quickly. What is lacking in depth is made up for in breadth. This book on religious pluralism is just as fresh today as in was when this book was written. All four views are well represented and the format where each author responds to the others is very good. For those who want to dig deeper on this topic, I would recommend Sander's \\"No Other Name\\"."},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"This is book is part of Zondervan's Counterpoints series. According to the editors of this work, the purpose is to bring Christian thinkers together to discuss the question of the salvation of non-Christians. The contributors are: (1) John Hick, advocating pluralism; (2) Clark Pinnock advocating inclusivism; (3) Alister McGrath advocating a somewhat exclusivistic position; and (4) R. Douglas Geivett &amp; W. Gary Phillips advocating exclusivism.As is often the case with this series, the book suffers from poor editing. All of the essays are worth reading, but they generally don't deal with the alleged topic of the book. For example, Prof. Hick tells us that he believes in universal salvation and that he has written a book arguing for this position, but he doesn't give his reasons in the essay. Prof. McGrath touches on the issue, but not in any great detail. Prof. Pinnock deals with the topic in a limited manner. It is only Profs. Geivett &amp; Philips who actually go into the question in some detail. They provide an exegesis of Acts 4:12 and some other passages. However, none of the other contributors responds with any detailed exegesis. What is often seen as the key passage concerning the salvation of non-believers -- Romans 2 -- is only mentioned in passing. So, this book is really a discussion of religious pluralism, not salvation.In spite of my criticism, I think this book is helpful to anyone who wants a background on the general issue of religious pluralism. If you are looking for a discussion of evangelical views of the salvation of non-believers, then this isn't the place to look."},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"I was somewhat disappointed in this particular book, since I was hoping it would deal with what salvation means (Saved from what?) and how people are saved. Instead, it focuses exclusively on who may be saved.Without a good understanding of the meaning of salvation, it is hard to be confident about who it may or may not apply to. However, the WHO question seems to be of more concern than the WHAT, WHY and HOW questions to most people interested in questions of salvation."},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"If you are interested in the different ways Christian's view salvation from an orthodox perspective, this is a good one. I think Hick's contribution should have been left out. His essays would fit better in a book with a Christian, muslim, and bahai or something. But lumping in him with a bunch of Christians is just annoying and distracting.I came to this book with an open mind because I frankly don't have a problem if hard restrictivism is true due to William Lane Craig's philosophical work on the subject. He has shown that it is logically possible for an omnibenovlent God to desire all people to be saved and for some people not to hear the gospel and be lost. In my opinion, middle knowledge completely solves the \\"fairness\\" problem. Geiveitt/Phillips touch on Craig's work on the subject but not enough. As a result, Pinnock gets extremely rendunant saying that \\"it's not fair\\", \\"it's not fair\\" for people to be lost simply because they haven't heard the gospel. If this was a Calvinistic God, this may be true, but not under middle knowledge.I found Pinnock's essay to show the problem of fairness, but I don't think his solution is scriptural, although it is logical. The only difference in McGrath's position from Pinnock's was that McGrath wasn't as dogmatic as an inclusivist as Pinnock. He said he was much more of a particularist than Pinnock, but doesn't exactly give a reason why. My guess is he wants to stay closer to the traditional view simply because it is more traditional, and McGrath likes Luther and Calvin and more traditional minds quite a bit. His essay is also skimpy in the scriptural area.G/Phillips in my view, show the view that fits best with scripture. And since I have no philosophical objections to their restrictivism, it was very easy to notice how well their view fits with scripture and the others don't. Although I need to look at inclusivism more, I don't see a scriptural basis for it, nor a philosophic necessity for it. I was impressed that they got such able exclusivists to argue for the side. They weren't fundamentalists by my definition. They clearly believe in an old earth, and not a young one, which would have ruined a lot of their credibility. They also used good scholarship, including Pannenberg's and didn't dismiss him as a non-christian for not believing in inerrancy. Everyone in the debate were very knowledgeable scholars, and no one was a bible-bashing anti-intellectual as some exclusivists come off.G/Phillips's essay seemed the best organized, and dealt with the most pertinent issues. McGrath's seemed sort of elusive, and Pinnock's overly long.So if you're looking for a good argument for exclusvism that isn't by a bible-bashing anti-intellectual Christian, this is a good book. The other views can only help make you more knowledgeable also."},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"The contributors to this book provide (for the most part) intelligent and lucid statements of their respective positions. The book (having been published by Zondervan) is obviously targeted toward an evangelical audience, so the inclusion of John Hick, a prominent religious pluralist, is a welcome feature.The main positions offerred are: 1) Pluralism: all religions offer salvation (John Hick); 2) Inclusivism: Salvation is mediated by Christ alone, but is available universally in that God's saving grace is operative in every culture, place, and time (Clark Pinnock); 3) Particularism-Agnostic: Salvation is through Christ alone but one must ultimately remain agnostic as to who and how many, who have not heard the gospel, will be saved (Alister McGrath); 4) Particularism-Traditional: Salvation is attained only through an explicit knowledge and faith in Christ (Doug Geivett and W. Gary Phillips).Each chapter presents one view, and then the other contributors critique the chapter's arguments. The chapter's author then responds to those critiques. This leads to a lively exchange between the various writers. The problem of those who have not explicitly heard the Christian gospel is an important one. Evangelicals who haven't thought much about it will want to read this book."},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"Having studied these four views previously, I was disappointed after finishing this particular title. All of these authors could have made their arguments much more concise and readable, but none of them chose to do so.Hick basically states that many different religions lead to the same God. Pinnock holds that salvation in Christ may be found through other religions. McGrath asserts salvation is found in a relationship with Christ, and persons who have had no chance to enter that relationship MIGHT receive God's mercy in some unknown way. Geivett and Phillips maintain salvation is ONLY found in a relationship with Christ, and persons who have had no chance to enter that relationship will spend eternity separated from God.This book could have and should have been written in such a manner to appeal to the average layperson. These individuals are the ones who struggle with these issues and want to be better informed. Instead, all of these essays are directed towards other scholars. The overly-technical manner in which they are written will not appeal to most persons without professional theological training.For pastors and well-versed teachers, this book provides a helpful summary of four current views on salvation. For everyone else, this volume will be confusing and hard to follow."},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"This book offered an expansive and surprisingly lively exchange between four streams of theological thought pertaining to the relationships between Christianity and other religions, specifically in connection with salvation. John Hick represented the pluralism camp, Clark Pinnock represented the inclusivist camp, Alister McGrath represented a more broadly defined camp within particularism, and Douglas Geivett and Gary Phillips jointly represented a narrower branch of particularism.I found the experience of reading this book to be extremely rewarding. It was a difficult read, probably as philosophical in nature as anything that I've ever read. The language that the authors used was more complicated and intricate than typical (though they would certainly argue that they dumbed-down and truncated their standard arguments to fit within the confines of this particular format). And I was amazed and pleased by the honesty and direct nature of the dialogue. There were no punches pulled, and these great thinkers were perfectly willing to challenge and even insult each other (or at least each other's ideas).Though I was drawn to Hick's narrative introduction, I was immediately put-off by his aversion to the Bible. I instantly disconnected when he essentially decried the Bible as a series of man-made texts that were culturally/politically/theologically crafted for particular earthly purposes. I was further frustrated by the tenor of his writing throughout the book and found him to be less gracious than his colleagues. And without any foundation in the Bible or traditional Christian thinking, I found his arguments to be disconnected from any truth-source. Though he brought great challenge to my thinking, I remain unconvinced by his arguments.Pinnock was hard to understand, as he claims to fall within evangelicalism but seems to press very hard against the walls of that distinction. He makes a very compelling case against the notion of a loving God who would choose billions for hell, but I found his argumentation to be rather scattered and unconvincing.Geivett/Phillips were most closely aligned to my own spiritual upbringing, and they had the advantage of having me in their camp at the start. And though I found their approach to be comfortable for me (very Scripturally-based and well-organized), I was unimpressed by their logic and argumentation. The other authors seemed to be able to poke some significant holes in their reasoning, and I found their responses to be inadequate.Ultimately, I finished this book most impressed by the case and position of Alister McGrath. This result was somewhat surprising, as I've mentioned that I expected to align most closely with Geivett and Phillips. Instead, I found McGrath to have a very winsome tone through his writing. Though very direct and confrontational when needed, he was never patronizing like Hick, never desperate like Pinnock, and never careless like Geivett/Phillips. I appreciate the clarity of his logic, as I was not lost in his thoughts as I occasionally was with the others. And I found that he struck a helpful balance between commitment to the Scriptures and the history of Christian thinking while honoring God's sovereignty by leaving a few important questions essentially unanswered. He did not bash the Bible (like Hick), he did not insult Augustine and Calvin (like Pinnock), and he did not proof-text (like Geivett/Phillips). He simply made a solid case for the reality that salvation is available in and through Christ, and our job as Christians is to spread that message everywhere, regardless of whether we know for sure what God plans to do with anyone that we miss. This gives us a vital job to do but leaves the final work in God's hands."},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World edited by Okholm and Gundry discusses the issue of salvation in light of the multiplicity of contemporary worldviews. This is part of the Four Views series published by Zondervan.The following four perspectives of salvation are discussed:* John Hick - Pluralism - all religions lead to God* Clark Pinnock - Inclusivism - universally available but through Christ* Douglas Geivett/Gary Philips - Exclusivism - only through acceptance of Christ* Allister McGgrath - Exclusivism (slightly nuanced)Although the Four Views series is normally characterized by solid argumentation, it has been criticised for its narrow perspective. This limited scope often makes the texts come of as a bit of an hair splitting exercise between conservative American Protestants. In this regard, the current instalment is notably better - John Hick's extreme liberal if not non-Christian perspective helps to significantly widen the discussion.With regard to the quality of the contributions, I thought given the limited space they were generally good (McGrath's piece struck me as hastily written and a bit off tone). As one of the most recognizable proponents of religious pluralism, Hick's comments were especially helpful and interesting. Without a doubt he advocates the most politically correct position in the current Western intellectual climate. At the same time, however, it is the most at variance with scripture and tradition - indeed, while hopeful; Hick's position is arguably not truly a Christian one. Pennock's piece and the one by Geivett and Philips were also useful in filling out the spectrum of viewpoints. McGrath while sometimes an able commentator added little to the debate.Overall this is a good read for those interested in Christian theology. I encourage Zondervan to continue this series, but with a wider range of contributors (Catholic and/or Orthodox might be helpful). As it is Four Views is a good series - with a wider range of perspectives it could be outstanding."},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"If you want to see first-hand how postmodernism has infected the Doctrine of Salvation within evangelical Christianity - this is the book. Coming from a conservative evangelical background it was interesting and informative to have a concise overview on the other schools of thought all in one volume. It also provides an excellent affirmation of the exclusivity of salvation through Christ. I particularly enjoyed how the contributors interacted with each other on the four views. A must read for anyone who wants to be equipped to evangelize in the 21st century."},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"If faith in Jesus Christ is the only way to salvation, what about those who never heard the Gospel message through no fault of their own? Are they doomed to everlasting perdition in Hell simply for that reason? Or does God save even non-believers, provided they live morally upright lives? And if God does so, how does that square with the traditional Christian message that Jesus was unique? Can Christianity still claim to be unique and uniquely true in a pluralistic world?These are the questions addressed in \\"Four views on salvation in a pluralistic world\\". Essentially, the anthology is a written debate between a number of theologians taking different opinions on the matter: John Hick, Clark Pinnock, Alister McGrath, Douglas Geivett and Gary Phillips.Of these, Geivett and Phillips take the traditional approach, which could be called Particularism or Exclusivism. Since salvation is by faith in Christ alone, people outside the fold will indeed be lost, including those who never had the opportunity to hear the Gospel. This is compatible with the loving grace of God, Geivett and Phillips argues, because God somehow knows that people in areas where the Gospel haven't been preached would have rejected it, even if it had been preached there. Who hears and who doesn't hear the Gospel is therefore under the providential guidance of God. Unless I'm mistaken, this argument was originally proposed by a Jesuit!John Hick takes the most radically innovative approach, called Normative Pluralism by the editors. He believes that all or most religions contain both truths and falsehoods, and that the truths of all religions reflect the same morality, the same yearning for salvation, and therefore the same Ultimate Reality. In that sense, all religions are \\"true\\" and salvation can be attained through all of them. Hick also writes about his own spiritual journey, which took him from atheism to Christian fundamentalism, and then further to a Pluralist position. This is the most interesting part of the anthology. Hick is obviously a very liberal theologian, something of a cat among the ermines in this conservative anthology. His pluralist form of Christianity sounds similar to the Hindu philosophy known as Advaita Vedanta. He also denies that Jesus ever called himself God, and thus has a very \\"low\\" Christology.Clark Pinnock defends the Inclusivist position. Pinnock is apparently something of a \\"heretic\\" in evangelical circles. In another Counterpoints volume, he defends purgatory and annihilationism! By Inclusivism, Pinnock means a position similar to that of C.S. Lewis or Vatican II. Salvation is by Jesus Christ alone, but God uses the non-Christian religions to draw people closer to Christ. Although the other religions are strictly speaking false, their followers could nevertheless be saved. God indirectly mediates his saving grace even through heathen religions. In a sense, this means that a Buddhist or Muslim might be an unconscious Christian. Pinnock believes that many uncoverted heathens were saved during Biblical history: the Queen of Sheba, Melchizedek, the Ninevites, Job, Cornelius and others. He even claims that the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah were saved (based on a statement of Jesus that the fate of unbelieving Israel would be worse than that of Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgement).Alister McGrath's position is the most difficult to fathom. For starters, McGrath uses postmodernism as a club against the enlightenment tradition, while nevertheless suggesting that Christianity is absolutely true (!?). Nor is it clear whether he believes that non-Christians can be saved or not. Indeed, the editors introduce him as someone having an agnostic position on the subject. He also spends a large part of his contribution making veiled personal attacks against John Hick, and fulminating against how modernity spawned Stalin, Hitler and Pluralism (!!). A cold shower might do this guy good, I think. Still, McGrath also raises more serious points against Hick's posititon. Since Pluralism must amputate what makes Christianity distinctive, e.g. the notion that Jesus was divine, in what sense is Pluralism really \\"pluralist\\"? Isn't it really a covertly intolerant position? McGrath also points out that concepts such as \\"religion\\" and \\"morality\\" are very different in different cultures. Nor does \\"salvation\\" mean the same thing in, say, Christianity or Hinduism. For that reason, it's impossible to harmonize \\"all religions\\". In what meaningful sense can \\"all religions\\" really be said to reflect the same truth? Here, McGrath is obviously on to something.Personally, I'm not a Christian, and one of many reasons is that I suspect Geivett and Phillips to be right on the issue of Bible interpretation. In other words, I think Ur-Christianity, although it had other sympathetic features, was indeed exclusivist in its view of salvation. That, of course, is an intolerant position, put mildly! There are Biblical passages that could be given an Inclusivist spin (Pinnock knows them by heart), but this doesn't seem to fit the general context of the New Testament as a whole. Christianity didn't transcend the usual in-group/out-group dichotomy. For this reason, I obviously consider the Inclusivist and Pluralist positions to be positive developments, not because they are \\"true\\" (they are not), but because they are better from a moral and political perspective. Out of the darkness, into the light?I found the book interesting, but I agree with some of the other reviewers that it's a mere introduction to the subject. There is little theological meat in this debate, since the contributions are relatively short. Hick and McGrath obviously dislike each other, and there are a lot of digressions and soap-boxing about other issues in the various articles. Still, to somebody completely new to the theological conflicts concerning salvation in a pluralistic world, this anthology might nevertheless be helpful."},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"The world we live in is characterized by diversity and a clamoring for equality. Our pluralistic society seeks to hear the voices of all its components without one drowning out another. The challenge of engaging this society has forced Christianity to rethink its positions so as to either change or to at least clearly articulate its beliefs in order to communicate to a multifaceted society. An overview of this change/articulation is found in the book Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World.The first perspective discussed is normative religious pluralism, or what some might call \`Christian pluralism.' The person defending this position is its leading advocate, John Hick. He begins by relating how he eventually rejected his conservative upbringing and came to hold his present theological stance. His position is that each major world religion (Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism) provides a sufficient way of salvation, independent of any other religion. For him, the god of each religion is the \`Ultimate Reality,' an awareness that is different for each religion. Hick's main arguments in support of Christian pluralism are: (1) no particular religion can claim moral superiority over other religions and hence cannot claim to be the one true religion; and (2) he asks wherein lies the love and grace of the Christian God if most of the human race is lost due to nothing more than the \`bad luck' of being born in societies that have never heard the gospel? Hick reinforces his view by pointing out that Jesus could not have been divine. The picture we have in the gospels of a supernatural Jesus is simply a creation of the early church; this argument is similar to the proposal put forth by the Jesus Seminar.Another perspective is that of particularism, which is actually divided into two different views. The idea of particularism is more in line with the traditional Christian position that salvation is grounded only in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. However, there have developed two similar but different strands of particularism. The first is called \`hard restrictivism.' This view holds that only those who explicitly profess faith in Jesus Christ will be saved. This position is promoted by two authors, R. Douglas Geivett and W. Gary Phillips. This duo offers the most detailed Biblical examination of any view in the book and they argue that the Bible is clear that salvation cannot be found in anyone else other than Christ. They uphold the orthodox belief that Jesus is divine and the final revelation of God. Alongside hard restrictivism is the position of Alister McGrath, who advocates \`optimistic agnostic particularism' (where agonistic does not mean that a person is unsure about the existence of God but that one is unable to say for sure that God can only save if Christ is explicitly believed in). McGrath's point is that he cannot say with certainty there is no hope for those who do not hear the gospel of Christ. He holds the same position as Geivett/Phillips regarding the deity of Christ; however, where McGrath differs from them is that he is not convinced God is \`prevented' from saving those who never hear the good news of Jesus Christ. He holds this position all the while refraining from claiming the certainty of God's saving grace in the non-Christian world as held by Hick and Pinnock (see below).The last view, proposed by Clark Pinnock, is somewhat of a via media, a middle way. The inclusivist view rejects the universalism of Hick and the particuarlism of McGrath and Geivett/Phillips. For Pinnock, God's presence is everywhere in the world, and hence his accompanying grace is preparing others outside the church for acceptance of the gospel of Christ. He follows the tone set by the Second Vatican Council and adds a point by telling the reader that inclusivism upholds the position that salvation is ultimately found in Christ, even if such knowledge may only be discovered by an individual after death. Also, Pinnock points out that his theology avoids the \`dark features' of particularism, which \`restrict' God's salvation to only a select minority, one fortunate enough to have heard the gospel.The format of the book is straightforward. The editors open with an introduction that profiles the contributors to the book, as well as discuses their respective views. Following the introduction are four chapters, each containing an examination of one the four views of salvation. Each chapter contains five sections. The opening part is a discussion and defense of a particular view. This part is followed by the response of each of the proponents of the other views. The chapter concludes with a rebuttal by the scholar who opened the chapter. There is an index.On the positive side, the reader will find in one source a good cross section of current trends in Christian theology. Pluralism, in a general sense, is a fact of life today and Christianity has felt its impact. The reader will be introduced to the main points of the entire spectrum of Christian thought in a point-counter point fashion Several technical terms (e. g., general revelation and special revelation) will be fleshed out in detail (though terms such as god, religion, and salvation will never be agreed on). Also, if one is interested in the debate between liberal and conservative scholarship, this book will help. Not to be overlooked is the helpful footnotes, both in terms of sources and explanations.On the downside, there is much repetition in the book, for when the contributors respond to the others, they often quote verbatim from other parts of the book. The editors could have helped the reader by at least citing the page from which the quote was taken. The index does little to help, as it is not in the familiar form of alphabetized by topic, but grouped under a particular view. And (not of the fault of the editors) there is often personal attacks made by one writer on another. While one expects sharp disagreement between people who passionately hold to personal positions (and what is more passionate and personal than religious beliefs?), I am not sure it speaks well of Christianity to have criticism of an argument develop into ad hominem or personal insult.Overall, this work is a four star book that will enlighten, if not entertain, the reader."},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"I'm going to apply this commentary for the entire Counterpoint Series published by Zondervan Publishing Company. My compliments to that company for creating this series. I initially purchased \\"Four Views on the Book of Revelation\\" but soon realized it was only one in a series. I got so much out of that volume, that I decided to purchase the entire set to study and keep for reference. My spiritual growth has been remarkable as a result. Seminary students and professionals would probably enjoy this series, which seems geared for them. But this series is also excellent for those college-educated laypeople who feel inclined to enhance their understanding of Christian theology. That is, with one caveat: Buy a decent theological dictionary to refer to at first. It probably won't get used much after about the third book you choose to read, but initially you will be need it to be confident of some of the terms used among advanced theologians. Then, the Counterpoint series will give you a full understanding of many different concepts and concerns of the Christian faith which have been applicable from early on until the present. I've learned a lot, and the only way I think I could do better is if I were enrolled in Seminary. A list of all the titles I am aware of from this series is:Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?Five Views on Law and GospelFive Views on SanctificationFour Views on HellFour Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic WorldFour Views on the Book of RevelationThree Views on Creation and EvolutionThree Views on the Millennium and BeyondThree Views on the RaptureTwo Views on Women in Ministry"},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"Four Views On Salvation in a Pluralistic World manages to accomplish what most counterpoint books do not. It gathers four assertive, yet respectful theologians who can adequately express the view they represent, and challenge the positions of the others.The editor's preface is pretty helpful in laying the groundwork for the book. Terminology is always important in theology and in this case it is rather confusing. The editor does a good job, especially in trying to normalize the labels given to each position so as to not start out with prejudicial names. Mainly, this occurs on exclusivism/restrictivism being renamed to particularism. Two terms not distinguished well enough are Universalism and Universality. Universalism is the view that everyone will be saved by God without specifying the mechanisms or a Savior per se'. Universalism is Hick's view and it is a natural fit with pluralism. The Universality (axiom) is one of Pinnock's Inclusivist devices, saying everyone will be saved, but only through Christ (even if they never have heard of him). The Universality axiom and Universalism are similar but they are not the same.Hick opens with an expose' centered on his journey from orthodox Christian belief to his well-known pluralism. He considers himself Christian but feels this is just a function of the culture he was raised within. His theological descriptions are much more like a pantheist or perhaps a deist. Hick's conception of God, does not (or cannot) transcend the gap between itself and man well enough to deliver a clear, unambiguous message. Instead, man is left groping in the dark, and manufactures something that will transform personal lives to move away from self-centeredness. This is much of what spirituality has to offer in Hick's view.On the flipside of Hick's theology, he critiques other views by pointing out in his experience (all anecdotal), he feels the amount of sainthood to villainous behavior is about the same in all cultures irrespective of underlying religion so Christianity has no special claim to God. This is one thing to discuss, but it does not have the crushing weight Hick ascribes to it. Something in Hick obviously favors pluralism and now he rationalizes it through personal experience. I have read other works by Hick and frankly have always been amazed he receives the degree of credibility as a theologian he commands. He is intelligent and kind, but his theology seems ridiculous. He seems to find the supernatural so dubious that he distances it with vague language saying very little that is specific enough to matter in religous practice. For Hick, theology is whatever he makes it up to be. McGrath observes Hick's theology is often improperly considered a marquis of post-modernism. In fact, it is a sad remnant of modernism. Hick is behind the times, not defining them.Pinnock shows he is his own theologian who (unlike Hick) holds the Bible in high regard. He makes some good points about Melchizedek, Cornelius and others being righteous pagans (this point is briefly addressed by other authors in the book). Pinnock gave me some things to think about, and I would not mind reading more from him, but he also proof-texts the Bible as obviously as any theologian I know of. Pinnock does not engage many widely discussed- passages that undermine his position (again, the other authors take a little of this up with him). Perhaps the page limits in a short essay held him back from presenting a significantly more robust case, but frankly I have some doubts.Allister McGrath does a fine job of showing why it is disrespectful to each religion when the pluralist lumps them all together to sooth his own conscience. \\"Dialog implies respect, but it does not presuppose agreement.\\" (p156) McGrath makes the case for a rather nuanced position, which (like Pinnock) expects other religions may be used, by the Spirit, as a type of pre-evangelism before its adherents hear the gospel of Christ. He remains agnostic on the issue of there being salvific power in those non-Christian practices if the gospel is never heard. McGrath is interesting and definitely has a voice of his own. Pinnock does catch him in an inconsistency. McGrath critiques Universalism by saying it denies humanity the right to say no to God, but as Pinnock points out, McGrath is a Reformed theologian. His Calvinistic theology has no place for men to say no (or yes) to God on salvation since it is predetermined, by God. So why critique Universalism for having an extremely similar attribute? Great point Pinnock.Geivett/Phillips present and defend the traditional evangelical view that Christ is the only way to salvation, and it is a narrow path according to scripture. If anyone thinks the traditional view must sacrifice something in these kind of discussions, this article may challenge that thinking. Geivett/Phillips use a fair portion of their article to present a classical apologetic for Christ starting with evidence for the existence of God. I love apologetics, but I believe this is somewhat out of place in their article. Perhaps they felt it provided necessary background, but much of the information would support Pinnock's position as well as it does theirs. Hick goes too far in saying this classical argument is \\"such as to convince only those who already believe their conclusion.\\"(p248) Of course, most of us know classical apologetics are used everyday to help inform honest seekers. Hick is not moved because he has made a dogmatic commitment to his strange concoction of deism, naturalism and inconsistent religious homogenization.If you are interested in soteriology (biblical and non-biblical), you will like this book. One understated issue affecting the topic of the book is the authority behind religious statements. When Hick promotes pluralism, where does the authority for those religious claims come from? After all, he is saying things about God. The same question can be applied to all four views, but is not explored explicitly enough. I enjoyed the book and hope you do too.Grace and peace to you, whatever your stripe"},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"This will be brief. Overall I am pleased with the Counterpoints series Zondervan has published, but like the publisher, these works are filtered through a fairly conservative lens. The present volume is a case in point. The editors admit in their introduction they agree with a particularist approach to salvation (i.e., exclusivist, traditional, etc), and while I certainly appreciate this nod towards being transparent in their editorship, as I read through the book it didn't take long to realize I would need to seek out other sources - none evangelical in tone and stance - to inform my understanding of the debates in soteriology and today's church. John Hick and Alister McGrath offer particularly strong arguments in their essays - their writing is cogent and informative. Clark Pinnock is perhaps misrepresented in this volume, because his brand of inclusivism teeters on the edge of particularism. In fact, he sounds like a disillusioned traditional evangelical who doesn't know how to make sense of salvation so he just takes a vague middle road. The Geivett/Phillips article is pretty useless in my opinion - they reiterate nothing new or interesting that you can't hear on a Sunday morning at your local Baptist church. Furthermore, their responses to the other authors are spurious and at best nothing more than piecemeal critiques. Their writing and responses are just as close-minded and tired as is their theology of salvation.With that said, you should judge the book for yourself. I do recommend it, but with the caveat that it should be read with a critical eye and an understanding that this discussion of salvation is somewhat narrow, but there is value in the book. Again, Hick and McGrath are the highpoints."},{"Title":"Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World","review":"Some of these reviews annoy me so much I feel compelled to write one.This book is a superb achievement - to get the leading credible academic representatives of the various evangelical responses on the forever vexed question of who gets to 'heaven' and who doesn't, AND to bring their prime theological enemy (John Hick, who passed away at age 90 in 2012) into the conversation too, is an important and commendable achievement. I commend this book to anyone exploring answers to these issues which affect alot of human views and behaviour in our religiously confused world today.1) Geivett presents the hardcore exclusivist position, meaning that anyone who dies outside of saving faith in Jesus, is pretty well doomed (a haphazard and cruel arrangement on God's part, if true? Hick and Pinnock think so);2) McGrath offers us the same but wisely prefers to leave God the problem of what happens to the 'unsaved' (i.e. it's not for us to say, which he calls 'Christian particularism');3) Pinnock is considered a progressive evangelical because he aligns with the Roman Catholics i.e. he's inclusivist in his approach at least, which says people of any/no faith who manifest godliness will be allowed into 'heaven' because God's love through Jesus has gained forgiveness for all whether they realise it or not and so God accepts that they have failed to happen to believe and accept that 'through no fault of their own'.4) Lastly comes Prof. Hick's viewpoint which is attacked by all those in the book whenever possible, because it's the most \\"radical\\", in that he abandons the Christian supremacy which all the others hold onto. Very simply, he says that all the main world religions (judged by their spiritual and moral fruit in human lives), influence humans to move increasingly out of natural self-centredness and toward greater God/Divine Centredness. Therefore, it's more helpful and mature to simply accept that any and all religions that do this are effective vehicles for enabling Salvation. i.e. all such religions lead in that sense lead humans toward a greater orientation in God/The Divine Reality and the related spiritual fruit in their lives. Of course he considers the true meaning of 'salvation' to be human transformation from self-centredness to God-centredness rather than the traditional Christian notion of our being saved from sin alone, which is a key issue for him. He is the worlds most articulate academic spokesman on this subject, by far, so it's interesting to see him in debate with some of the most important leading evangelical thinkers.Of course Hick has long been aware that the main obstacle to his view is how we view Jesus - for if God visited Earth and initiated his own special group of people and did certain key things for us, then of course that would be the one true religion of God. So you get a whole debate on the subject of Christology (our understanding of Jesus: Son of God, or not, etc) in between all the other subjects which is valuable too.It's a fascinating comparative read with each responding to the other so clearly.No book is perfect but for a semi robust discussion I recommend this book 100%."},{"Title":"The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia","review":"If you are a Christie fan you must have this book. Once you start dipping you will not stop and once you start to cross-reference you'll end up being late for work. This dedicated addition to the Christie files is just great. It contains not only references to just about every character that ever appeared in a book by Agatha christe but has film references, T.V. references. (Will somebody please help me find the now lost &quot;Agatha Christie Hour&quot; programmes) as well as theatrical references.If you buy only one non-fiction Chritie reference book you will not be dissapointed with Matthew Bunson's brilliant hommage as no better critique could you find than a dedicated fan who would go to this much trouble. Thanks, Matthew, hope you sell loads"},{"Title":"The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia","review":"I must confess that I am writing this without having finished every page of this work. I commend any author for attempting to sort out and cross-reference every character and piece of writing, along with film and TV adaptations, of as prolific an author as Agatha Christie. But I have two complaints. The first is that, so far in my reading, there have been a great many silly errors throughout, ranging from wholly incorrect names to the misidentification of a character's position in a novel (in one example, a person is listed as a victim when in reality that person is the killer!), to incorrect details in plot. For a long-standing fan of Dame Agatha's work, the relatively large amount of errors suggests sloppy research and makes the author's methods suspect.The other point that strikes me is that I am not sure who the author considers his intended audience for this book. The entries of the novels are particularly light in terms of fact or discussion. They tend to describe the beginnings of the stories in great detail and then end quickly with \\"And then Poirot solves the case. The notes following these synopses are often quite brief, with a casual mention of of trivia (\\"This novel demonstrates Christie's knowledge of poisons) or a recounting of an anecdote well-known to real Christie fans, such as an explanation for why a particular book was dedicated to a particular person. I suppose these stories would be of most interest to new readers of Christie, although why they would be reading this book rather than the novels and stories themselves is puzzling to me. For a person such as myself who has made a study of Christie's work and read each book many times with pleasure, he or she should be warned that Bunson's work doesn't offer much insight into Christie's mind, style, much less any new \\"fun facts\\" about our favorite novels.When the author moves from the section on novels to the one on characters, the errors become deeper, not just ones of fact but of, I assume, perception. Here's an example: Maude Abernethie, a character from \\"After the Funeral,\\" one of my favorite Christie novels: \\"An imperious member of the ... family....She is the very dominant wife of Timothy Abernethie, and uses her position to keep her husband under her control. It thus comes as a terrible blow to her when she breaks her ankle and is forced to employ the cook and housekeeper, Mrs. Gilchrist, thereby losing a little control over her husband.\\" I don't see how anyone could interpret Maude as a dominant character. She is completely under the thumb of her hypochondriacal husband and does everything she can to protect his interests. HE controls HER. And to add a little period to the mistakes, the author has married off MISS Gilchrist! I know I sound picky, but a true fan of Christie has a right to expect accuracy, if not enlightenment.I can't ask for a book to be something it's not, but I long for a book that really analyzes Christie's work. I know it's usually considered forbidden to reveal endings, (I wouldn't mind this at all, since I know all the solutions!), but a look at Christie's observations of British society through an analysis of her characters and plots would be fascinating to me. Even an encyclopedia that delves a bit more into a plot or a character than this work does would have been more enjoyable for this big time Christie fan to read."},{"Title":"The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia","review":"Let me start out by saying I have not read every page in this homage to the great Ms. Christie. Instead, over the past few couple of weeks I have looked up the detailed descriptions of items of interest to me like the list of television shows, stage performances, and movies created from one of Ms. Christie's works. That is the beauty of thisencyclopedia. Fans of the author and readers of mysteries can easily pick and choose their personal preferences. Besides the above, Matthew Bunson provides a detailed synopsis of each novel and short story, and a brief description of each character (I cannot argue if it is not complete) that ever appeared in one of these works.THE COMPLETE CHRISTIE: AN AGATHA CHRISTIE ENCYCLOPEDIA is a fun piece of work that will provide much enjoyment to fans of Ms. Christie. Perhaps the only drawback to this wonderful book is a lack of a table of contents tied to the wonderful listings in the appendices that would enable casual fans to do even more specific digging.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia","review":"A very straight-forward guide to the characters and stories of Agatha Christie. One of the best things about this book is that it does not spoil any of the mysteries. Plots are briefly recapped and characters lightly sketched, but the endings are never revealed. One or two character entries might provide clues as to \\"who done it,\\" but other than that, this is a great book."},{"Title":"The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia","review":"I found this book an excellent source of information about the writings of Agatha Christie. A short essay covers each of the works including short stories. There is also a large section covering the characters from each of the books and stories. In addition there is a section on movies, plays and TV productions of the various stories. Some of the plots are given away a bit if you read up on the characters, etc. before you read the book. Read the book first and find out more about it from this resource afterwards. I find this an extra tool to bring more enjoyment from the writings of Agatha Christie."},{"Title":"The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia","review":"There is a lot the Agatha Christie fan will like about this work. I particularly like the plot summaries, and I suspect many other readers will as well. These provide just enough of the plot to set the stage for, or recall the core of the story if previously read, without giving away the stories' solutions. This was not an easy task.However, not infrequently the summaries contain factual errors. As but one example, in the summary of \\"Hercule Poirot's Christmas', the author provides the location for this story as Gossington Hall when the location is actually Gorston Hall. The author also mentions this title was reprinted in paperback as \\"A Holiday for Murder'. Although published with this title in paperback,\\" it was also reprinted with this title in hardcover in 1983, as one of the volumes in \\"The Agatha Christie Mystery Collection\\". Although \\"The Complete Christie\\" has a copyright date of 2000, no hardbound edition of \\"A Holiday for Murder\\" is mentioned. There are a number of similar inadvertent errors and oversights throughout the work.Fortunately, the majority of errors will be obvious to Christie fans, and there is enough new information so fans will find this book worth reading and referencing. The plot summaries take up over 1/3 of the book with \\"The Characters\\" section, a brief description of the characters in Christie's stories, taking up about 1/2 of the book. The remaining major section of the book is devoted to \\"Film, Television, Stage, and Actors\\" associated with the adaptation of Christie's works. This last section contains the greatest density of black and white pictures from various adaptations, although there are pictures sparsely scattered elsewhere in this work.Bottom line: Really 3 1/2 stars. Containing lots of interesting details, and a work I still reference. With more careful editing and fact checking before release, it would easily have earned five stars. Even with its problems still a worthwhile purchase for the Christie enthusiast."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for Sat Ii--French","review":"Kudos to the author for the best book to prepare for the SAT II French test.

Much of the magic of the greatest family film of all time is translated remarkably well into these pages. While mere words on a page can't capture the depth of emotion and intelligence Benji expressed visually in the film, the spirit, pathos, fright, wonder, and excitement of Benji's heroic adventure are all here. There is no embellishment to the story, as this is a truly faithful adaptation of what you will see in the film, but it is well worth reading. Children in particular may attain a better understanding of certain aspects of the film by reading this book or having it read to them. I should emphasize the fact that this does make a wonderful children's book; it is by no means written \\"down to\\" children at all. Benji is a gift to children (and adults) of all ages.The story itself revolves is a tale of adventure, love, friendship, sacrifice, and incredible courage, all viewed through the eyes of a very special dog . Benji has many friends all over town, but he calls home an old abandoned house that has stood vacant for at least forty years. He enjoys his independence, though, and greets each day eagerly, always heading first to the Chapman house for breakfast with his special friends Paul and Cindy. From out of the blue, though, Benji's life changes dramatically. First he meets a little white dog, a pedigreed little cutie with class and charm; it's love at first sight for Benji, and he settles into a new life, one shared with little Tiffany. Then a group of people invade his happy home, soon bringing in two kidnapped children who turn out to be Paul and Cindy Williams. Only Benji can save the children, but he will have to risk everything he values the most in order to save the day.Benji will forever be the world's most huggable hero, and he really was an important part of my childhood.

Julian asks a lot of relevant questions on the nature of divinity, debates sections of text, Pagan and Christian, extensively, and places those wich are relevant side by side, for a compare/contrast session that is sure to leave you asking questions at best, and offended at worst. He is a bit brash sometimes, and tries to make a case against parts of the bible, but that makes it more interesting, and he asks himself a lot of the same questions that i did. It also helps that this book is over 1200 years old, and is still very relevant. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Julian, Volume III (Loeb Classical Library, No. 157)","review":"The third volume of the Emperor Julian's works contains invaluable information concerning his views on Pagan religion. Included are letters to members of the Pagan priesthood, as well as general information regarding Julian's religious ideas written to friends. Julian's works are certainly the most important primary resources for late antiquity Paganism... as emperor his view was unique in that he had resources far beyond those of his contemporaries."},{"Title":"Julian, Volume III (Loeb Classical Library, No. 157)","review":"Julian, known as Julian the Apostate by his opponents, was Roman emperor from 361 to 363. He was the last pagan ruler of the Roman Empire, and the only one who wrote an extensive treatise against Christianity. Julian was brought up as a Christian but apostasized later in life, becoming a zeolus pagan and Neo-Platonist. As emperor he attempted to do away with Christianity, which had become the state religion of the Empire under Julian's predeccesors Constantine the Great and Constantius (who were incidentally Julian's relatives). This pagan counter-offensive came to an abrupt end when Julian was killed in combat against the Parthians in 363.Loeb Classical Library have translated all of Julian's extant writings, and published them in three volumes. The most interesting volume is this, the third, since it contains a re-construction of Julian's treatise against Christianity, \\"Against the Galileans\\". As usual in this series, the Old Greek original text is reproduced alongside the English translation. (Other English translations of \\"Against the Galileans\\" are also available here at Amazon.com.)\\"Against the Galileans\\" is a very interesting text. Many of Julian's arguments against Christianity feel very modern, showing that critics of the Christian message had pretty much the same objections then as now. Some of the emperor's arguments can be used even by atheists, others could presumably be used by New Age believers. Obviously, Julian also has a few arguments of his own. The term \\"Galilean\\" is Julians insulting name for the Christians.In a short review like this, only the barest outline of Julian's arguments are possible. To Julian, the Christians are wicked people who have apostasized from the pagan traditions of their fathers to Judaism. But they distort even the Jewish Bible, and sometimes the words of Jesus himself. Thus, their creed is completely new and hence false. In the ancient world, everything new was suspect by definition, as the old and venerable was seen as better.Julian doesn't believe that the Jews are the chosen people. After all, the Jews are insignificant and have often been conquered by stronger nations, such as Egyptians, Babylonians and Romans. God cares for all of humanity, not just for a small nation in a part of Palestine. The God of the Jewish Bible must be a purely local god, a subordinate to the highest God. Besides, the Jews are primitive, have no great poets and scientists, and their laws are more cruel than those of the Romans. Despite this criticism of the Jews, Julian is nevertheless quite pro-Jewish. He prefers the ancient traditions of Israel to the novelty of the \\"Galileans\\". Indeed, Julian even writes that the Jews in many ways resemble the pagans, for instance in their sacrifices. Julian actually wanted to rebuild the Jewish temple, a project that came to naught when he fell in battle.A large part of Julian's text deals with what we would call \\"Bible difficulties\\". To Julian, Christianity distorts the Jewish Bible (the Old Testament). There are no prophecies of Jesus in the OT, the Jewish laws are forever and cannot be suspended as Paul argued, and the consistent monotheism of the OT is incompatible with the Trinity. Perhaps more sarcastically, Julian argues that the Christians distort their own New Testament as well. For instance, he points out that neither Matthew, Mark, Luke nor Paul ever refers to Jesus as \\"God\\". Only John does this, but Julian assumes that the Gospel of John was written later than the others, and hence lack value. Julian then mocks the Christians for worshipping corpses, by which he means Jesus and the martyrs.A common pagan argument against Christianity seems to have been that the Christians were common folk, almost wretches. This elitist argument is rehashed by Julian, who write that the apostles deluded maidservants, slaves and women, and people like Cornelius and Sergius, of whom no further historical record exists. He belittles the miracles of Jesus, pointing out that they took place in a few Palestinian villages, and hence were unimportant. How can a creed that began in a remote rural region and has only existed for 300 years, mostly among the underclass, really be divine, especially if its inherently illogical as well? That seems to be the gist of Julian's arguments.No matter what one might think of \\"Against the Galileans\\", it is nevertheless a fascinating read, especially considering that it was written by a man who was, albeit for a few years only, the ruler of the Roman Empire."},{"Title":"Julian, Volume III (Loeb Classical Library, No. 157)","review":"Since there are so many of these darn things the review shall be divided into three sections. First, a brief description of the Loeb series of books and their advantages/disadvantages. Second shall be my thoughts on the author himself, his accuracy, as well as his style and the style of his translator. This is of course only my opinion and should be treated as such. The final part shall review what this particular book actually covers.The Loeb series date back to the turn of the last century. They are designed for people with at least some knowledge of Greek or Latin. They are a sort of compromise between a straight English translation and an annotated copy of the original text. On the left page is printed the text in Greek or Latin depending on the language of the writer and on the right side is the text in English. For somebody who knows even a little Greek or Latin these texts are invaluable. You can try to read the text in the original language knowing that you can correct yourself by looking on the next page or you can read the text in translation and check the translation with the original for more detail. While some of the translations are excellent mostly they are merely serviceable since they are designed more as an aid to translation rather than a translation in themselves. Most of them follow the Greek or Latin very closely. These books are also very small, maybe just over a quarter the size of your average hardcover book. This means that you'll need to buy more than just one book to read a complete work. They are also somewhat pricey considering their size. The Loeb Collection is very large but most of the more famous works can be found in better (and cheaper) translations elsewhere. If you want to read a rarer book or read one in the original language then you can't do better than the Loeb Editions.There are 3 volumes of Julian in the Loeb series which includes all his known works. Julian the Apostate was Emperor of Rome in the middle of the 4th Century. He was a member of Constantine's family but he abandoned Constantine's new faith and tried to return Rome to paganism. He was also a philosopher which explain the quantity of his writing which has survived. Ever since a child he had been locked away in a villa by his cousin Constantius who also had his father killed. His life before becoming Emperor was filled with danger since any hint that he could be a threat to his cousin would be met with deadly consequences. In the end through lucky chance he ended up as Emperor only to be killed in just over a year when his Persian campaign failed disastrously. He is easily the best documented Emperor in Roman history since we have more of his writings than of any other Emperor's as well as an excellenthistoryby Ammianus Marcellinus (the last great Latin historian),panegyricsandlettersby the orator Libanius, and violent denouncements from Christian writers like Gregory of Nazianzus all of whom knew him personally. He wrote letters, orations, philosophical treatises, satires, and hymns. He also wrote a Commentary of his wars in Gaul which was based off of Caesar's Commentaries and which is unfortunately lost. Also missing is his denunciation of Christianity called Against the Galilaeans. Only fragments survive. His works are (mostly) easy to read and engaging and the translation is solid if a little formal. It was translated in 1923 after all. This is one of those cases where this material is unavailable outside of the Loeb series.This last volume contains a collection of Julian's remaining letters. Letters are never as easy to read as other works but there is much valuable information in these. While they do vary significantly depending on the topic and the recipient on the whole they are interesting and keep your interest. Also included in this volume is the remainders of Julian's 'Against the Galileans,' his diatribe against Christianity."},{"Title":"Essentials of Russian: Reading, conversation, grammar,","review":"A huge number of exercises - very much grammar-translation method and also pre-89 (and at times more 1930s in its ideas of Russia with collective farming making an appearance quite early and everyone being engineers!)Recommended for the practice drills more than anything else - downside is no answers, but it's easy to figure out because of the pacing of the learning."},{"Title":"Cafe Nervosa: The Connoisseurs Cookbook","review":"Every recipe I have tried has worked beautifully.

It acknowledges its supremacy as a factual telling of Emerson's life that cannot be surpassed. Whicher's book aims to be a complement to the painstakingly researched outer life of Emerson by focusing on the great sage's inner life, not just his intellectual biography, but the very nature of his thinking.Whicher acknowledges his debt to scholars who he has learnt from, to mark his own unique contribution to Emerson Scholarship. F.O. Mathiessen's \\"American Renaissance\\" and its emphasis on the aesthetic dimension of Emerson's thought; Henry David Gray's systematic exposition of the intellectual problems that Emerson faced and influenced his thinking; Henry Nash Smith's early paper on Emerson that first brought to light the dramatic nature of Emerson's thinking; Joseph Warren Beach's study that situated Emerson's ideas and the nature of his thinking within the context of the then new and burgeoning idea of evolution; the discussion of the backdrop of puritanism and the pragmatic nature of his thought as they are expounded by Perry Miller and Henry Bamford Parkes, respectively. As many Emerson scholars after him have noted, Whicher importantly adds that he has the benefit of referring to the newly collected notes and journals of Emerson to bring us this picture of the inner life of Emerson, something which specific studies of inspired scholars, that he has also admired, like Ralph L. Rusk (\\"Letters), Kenneth Walter Cameron (\\"Emerson the Essayist\\") and Paul Sherman (\\"Spires of Form\\"), did not exhaustively use.Whicher stresses the life of \\"spectator-ship\\" that the young Emerson, perpetually ill as he turned out to be, was condemned to. His writings, especially his private thoughts recorded in his journals, document the ebb and flow of his spirit, alternatively listless and resolute. But in the end it is a testament to his determination to write his way into freedom from the growing skepticism that is endemic in early 19th century culture. This skepticism of religion is due to the philosophical influence of David Hume, Bishop Berkeley, Classical Pyrrhonism, the reigning literary influences of Montaigne, Gibbon, and German \\"Higher Criticism\\", and the personal influence of his early, and very close atheist friend, Achille Murat.Whicher reminds us that the young Emerson's enlightened Unitarian stance was supposed to be an \\"advance\\" from the Calvinistic beliefs that he inherited from his forefathers. But one of the \\"grounds\\" of Unitarian belief - revelation - was decisively in jeopardy with Hume's convincing attack on the idea of miracle. Unitarianism began to prove less attractive to him in face of this new necessity, this absence of faith and God, given these irrefutable arguments against faith. The discovery that Emerson makes despite the objective \\"outer\\" facts of the world, the inner world of confidence, defiance, and the discovery of God within, with its own laws is finally his decisive step away from Unitarianism, and out of skepticism. He can rightly ignore the consequences of Hume's fatal argument that is binding only in the Newtonian world of natural laws. Personal conviction, intuition that finds the \\"omnipotent\\" deity within us, Emerson declares, is not subject to the necessity of Hume's world. This defiant observation makes room for an inner self, a self impervious to reason. Thus a self that recognizes the applicability of Hume's argument and a self that holds itself immune, this \\"double consciousness\\" looms large in Emerson's writings. Emerson's Hamlet-like inner dramatic struggle begins, importantly, with the early acknowledgement of this idiosyncrasy of mind: the \\"double consciousness\\".This is but a summary of the way the book introduces \\"The inner life of Ralph Waldo Emerson\\". This book will go on to expound the struggle of Emerson's inner life like no other commentary has done: with eloquence and precision. It will merit repeated readings. It will above all instill in the reader the curiosity to go back to read, or re-read, Emerson's incomparable essays."},{"Title":"Freedom and Fate; an Inner Life of Ralph Waldo Emerson","review":"This reading of the inner life of Emerson reveals that behind the public face of the simple great optimist, was a complex personality with a real sense of the tragic side of life.

I purchased it and hungrily began reading it for knowledge about a topic with which I've only just become acquainted.It does not have everything.What it has: 1) imaginative and descriptive applications of creativity, often taken from the author's own life. 2) Fluffy filler about parts of the world's history and their connection to creativity and the mystical Pathworking field of experience. 3) Way in the last quarter of the book, some guided imagery examples are floweringly written. They are decent, affording the book the 2nd star.What it does NOT have: 1) descriptions of the sephiroth, where from the term Pathworking comes. 2) How to make your own way through the paths--i.e. descriptions of where, how and why one would travel, likely scenes, etc. 3) any description of the progression of these worlds, as one moves further on their path of Light.At the very least, I thought it would contain examples of pagan/occult or Christian rites/ traditions rooted in Pathworking. Sometimes, the examples do come close to this.My opinion: Rent this from the library.

Don't miss this one.Michael Shea, MD"},{"Title":"Four Corners: History, Land, and People of the Desert Southwest","review":"If anyone has been to the Four Corners area, particularly the Grand Canyon and Monument Valley, you will appreciate the author who takes you well beyond those more obviously known pleasures and takes you into more remote and attrarctive parts of the large four corners area giving the reader an introduction to geology while explaing in the initial chapyers how the land and continent was formed. The books goes on to discuss each area, its rock formations including mountains, plateaus and valleys and the vegetation that makes each area unique. The author includes interviews with numerous specialists throughout the book along his own personal journey through these ares that he hikes and camps and spends time in some very remote areas. His discussion of the people that once lived on the land and the ones that currently do provides a human linkage to present day. The mystery of the Anasazi is quite fascinating as these ancient cliff dwellers disappaered around 1400 AD but may have become part of the present day Hopi tribe. The description of their cliff like fortess dwellings and the archelogical studies is one of the most interestiung parts of the book. Why did they live along a cliffs in large communities and what happened to them? The book is not a quick read but one that deserves patience to appreciate the indepth descrptions that Brown provides. The only downturn, which is very slight, is that the author has little tolerance for tourists that in his opinion, along with the specialist he meets, strongly feel that tourists overwhelm these sensitive sites. However, for one who loves to travel these wonderful places with great respect for the sensitivity of the environment, we must all do our part to try to rein in those few that unfortunatey create a negative impact no matter where they visit or live."},{"Title":"Four Corners: History, Land, and People of the Desert Southwest","review":"This is a fascinating account of the land and people of the Four Corners region of the southwestern US. Brown is as interested in the geology of the region as he is in the settlers of it. The book is basically divided into five large sections, one for each major point on the compass and a fifth entitled \\"Center.\\" He begins each section with a thorough discussion of its geology. From there he proceeds to the peopling of each section, from the early hunters and gathers to the Anasazi, Spaniards, and Mormons. His long sub-section on the Anasazi is especially good. One thing Brown makes clear is that, unlike the \\"politically correct\\" view held by many today, the Americas were not a Garden of Eden before European contact was made. Native tribes fought ferociously with one another over land and resources; even slavery was practiced among the tribes. And after the disastrous Pueblo uprising of 1680 that virtually emptied the country north of the Rio Grande of all Spanish inhabitants, the Spanish realized they would have to cooperate with the Natives to insure security and success.Brown is an excellent writer and captures the uniqueness of the desert Southwest well without going into rapturous (and phony) doggerel. He is a \\"loner,\\" however, relying on historical records or scientific textbooks for most of his information, and rarely brings along another geologist or historian to hash out information. (This being the case, it's surprising that there is no bibliography included.) Even his own personal observations, other than a few camping/hiking scenes thrown in here and there, are kept to a minimum. Some might object to this impersonal approach, but it didn't bother me at all. The book is interesting and informative - an excellent overview of the desert Southwest."},{"Title":"Sunken Treasure: Six Who Found Fortunes","review":"Here are the real life stories of those daring few who risked everything, and sometimes suffered greatly, searching for the fabled sunken treasures from centuries ago.

Although the accounts were interesting, I would have preferred a bit more historical context of the ships they were searching, along more post-find follow up (ex, more information on where the treasure ended up, etc). I also found that the inforamtion on all of the stories was presented the same way -- the way the story was built up all the way to the discovery of treasure became very anti-climatic after the 4th or 5th example.

Gray had a much deeper friendship with Heidegger's student Hannah Arendt."},{"Title":"The warriors; reflections on men in battle","review":"I have never experienced combat or even war for that matter, but it has always consumed my thoughts. (this would be the single point of contention between me and the author who believes no one gives thought to these matters.) To me, war constitutes all of man's extreme qualities and concentrates them into a single moment. Cruelty and Love, Fear and Courage, can coexist in the same moment and in the same person. If we want to really understand what it is that makes us human, I think we need to understand men in combat, or at least reflect on it and try. This observation is the first part of Gray's 'thesis'.WWII interests me NOT because of the American involvement in what is hailed as \\"The GOOD War\\". I think that is mindnumbing nationalistic propaganda. MY interest in WWII stems from the fact that more civilians died in that war than did combatants. (Another point of the author) What is happening to our world's society? When did the line between combatant and innocent civilian disappear? Why? This is the second part of Gray's 'thesis'.This book, written by a philosophy PhD (awarded his doctorate with the same mail that brought him his \\"greetings from the president\\" letter--his 'draft'), and a soldier who spent 4 years in the war, is an attempt to answer these questions as best he can. It was written in the last years of the Vietnam conflict. This is what prompted him to reflect on his own war experience and the quesitons philosophical, ethical, and moral which had haunted him. He does NOT make any claims that one war is better or different than the next. It is NOT a book about the glory of WWII and the vulgarity of Vietnam, like one might assume.Gray witnessed the material and human destruction of war from all angles. Having been involved for so long in this otherworldly event transformed him. It disrupted the continutity of his life. While in the war, his past life was meaningless, and then when away from the war, his war years became faded and irrelevant. This was his greatest fear and the ultimate impetus for his writing. This is an important work.He ends the book with Lee's quote...\\"It is good that war is so terrible, else we should grow to fond of it.\\" [I paraphrased]"},{"Title":"The warriors; reflections on men in battle","review":"If you are looking for the answers as to what motivates men in battle you will not find them in this book. Gray is a philosopher who happens to be a war veteran, this book is mostly philosophy based in assumption and probably could have been written without the benefit of Gray's war service. Relatively speaking little of the work is referenced to Gray's war experience.The jacket blurb makes much of Gray's war experience. Gray was not a front line combat soldier but a counter intelligence officer in a divisional headquarters. I do not wish to cast aspersions on the man's war service but the jacket gives the impression of authority born of front line combat experience.Where this book really falls down I think is that he fails to explain observed behaviour of men in battle. Much of his talk about men in battle is under they assumption that they are the same people who joined the Army when they get to the front. Gray almost completely ignores the effect of military training, the influence of leaders and the bonds of comradeship.As an amateur military historian looking for answers about the behaviour of men in battle from somebody who was there, I found none in this book. My search continues."},{"Title":"The warriors; reflections on men in battle","review":"Gray wrote a \\"moral equivalence\\" book long before the term entered our discourse: a totally dishonest attempt to glorify the German killing machine of World War II and bring the Allied efforts to defeat it down to the Nazi level.

He saw many things he despised, yet was surprised to note that war also had its delights. On reflection, he realized that was logical. Without positives why would we war? This book details the seductive elements of war, explaining some of the feelings many of us have in viewing and studying combat of all sorts. Without understanding those feelings, we are more likely to dismiss them as only shameful and deceptive. Understanding them will help us, Gray hoped, to avoid the terrible cost of seeking them by warring again. This is probably the best book on why we war and the surprising things war teaches us about ourselves ever written.

This is not an easy read, but is well worth your effort to read it. Never before has an author described the conflicts of mind and conscience (or lack of) of the warrior, the combat veteran.

A very different view as oppposed to movies and text book history, where all the American soldiers were hero's with little or no fear. Gray does an outstanding job of making someone who has never been in the hell of war, understand why soldiers act the ways they do. An excellent read for any war student or historian."},{"Title":"The warriors; reflections on men in battle","review":"It is all too easy to understand why a book this good is ignored today; post-modernists cannot even agree that there is such a thing as an objective world, let alone establish that it is inhabited by human beings or justify claims that they engage in a violent practice known as warfare. What is less easily fathomed is the fact that the book has never really garnered much attention, something that Hannah Arendt comments on in her rather disappointing introduction to this fine book.Gray's \\"Warriors\\" is that rare combination of lucid intellectualism and poignancy that ought to be an immediate success with readers, yet the book remains obscure (indeed, I had to order it since my local seller didn't stock it). Ironically, it addresses many topics that should be of interest to contemporary scholars: trauma and what we now call PTSD, memory and forgetfulness, objectification, guilt.... Gray also ruminates on what he calls the appeal of battle. At various points I was reminded of the psychological insights of Robert Jay Lifton, whoseThe Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocideintroduced the idea of \\"Doubling\\" (as Lifton calls it). And there is plenty of evidence for Lifton's psychological theory in this book, though Gray doesn't refer to it as such.What makes Gray's book so impressive is his ability to remain critically aloof and emotionally close to his topic at the same time--a very tricky proposition that he pulls off marvelously. He very smoothly juxtaposes passages from Plato and Shakespeare to those from his own personal letters or war journal, the latter of which is moving without ever being maudlin or depressing.If Gray's last chapter, \\"The Future of War,\\" seems dated and hopelessly optimistic, I think we can forgive him. Gray, like the existentialists who were his contemporaries, cites Nietzsche here, but unlike them, he suggests that one day we may have the superhuman strength to \\"break our swords\\" once and for all. Sadly, as our present world stage confirms, ubermenschen we still are not."},{"Title":"The warriors; reflections on men in battle","review":"This is a deeply personal and thoughtful reflection on the subject of men in battle. While its style displays the academic training of the author, it is really the story of his own search for a philosophical understanding of his experience as a soldier in World War II. While not insistently theological, the author seems to believe that war is included in God's providence and redemptive activity. The strength of the book is the writer's passionate investment in the subject, and his willingness to struggle honestly with the questions facing every warrior."},{"Title":"The warriors; reflections on men in battle","review":"Glenn Gray's The Warriors is not an easy read. The analytical writing style will not appeal to readers that are looking for exciting anecdotes of battle from WWII. What we have instead is a look at the range of attitudes different soldiers have toward battle, love, death, the enemy and guilt. What some readers might derisively describe as \\"moral equivalency\\" on Gray's part, is really objectivity, born perhaps of his academic experience in garnering a doctorate in philosophy from Columbia University.What gives this book its real value is that Gray's academic thoroughness is combined with a keenness of insight into human nature. He deftly catalogues the gamut of psychological and emotional conditions that are manifested in the behavior of men in combat. One of his major conclusions, that men fight, not for their country or lofty ideals, but for their \\"comrades\\" in arms, should come as no surprise to anyone well read in infantry memoirs from WWII. I place quotes around the word \\"comrades\\" because Gray assigns to that word a very specific meaning.As for drawbacks: There is no index, footnotes or bibliography. Also, the last section on \\"The Future of War\\" could have been omitted since it seems too optimistic and utopian in tone compared to the grim realism of the earlier chapters.The Warriors is an important book for anyone wanting to look beyond the cheerleading of the \\"Good War\\" or \\"Greatest Generation\\" and see what really animated the men who fought in WWII. As the author says, it is war that compresses the greatest extremes of the human condition into the smallest of ranges in time and space, and no more so than in the unprecedented savagery of WWII."},{"Title":"The warriors; reflections on men in battle","review":"A superb, thoughtful, reflective, and honest account of war, warriors, and guilt.

Volumes have been written about the Army during various wars and how volunteer forces contributed to the victories. Here, Edward Coffman discusses the the so-called caretaker Army that manned the lonely frontier outposts, and how it progressed to the organized machine it is today. Although it's a natural progression, it's not easy to see it without the strength of Coffman's narrative and his ability to balance deeply personal views of soldiers in the field with the major policies issued by the powers-that-be. Much reviled, maligned, and distrusted by the American public, the peacetime Army is truely the grandfather of today's modern military. Although many people credit the temporary wartime armies with that distinction, Coffman traces the struggles that the civilian and military leaders had to endure in order to produce an effective military. This excellent work contains revealing excerpts from personal journals that provide a clear view into this forgotten way of life ranging from reasons why people joined, deserted, and came back again. Coffman devotes a great deal of time to minorities, in the military, and wives and children of the soldiers to give us a well-rounded view of what garrison life was like. Coffman also discusses the real, but overlooked work of the early army: the building of forts, buildings, and public roads. Long considered a haven for misfits and incompetents, the Old Army deserves a deeper scruitiny. Coffman provides the kind of indepth study that has long been lacking. Coffman's ability to focus on the larger history of the Army while still providing illuminating anecdotes makes this fascinating reading."},{"Title":"The Old Army: A Portrait of the American Army in Peacetime, 1784-1898","review":"America's abhorrence of a large standing army in peacetime, and the officers, men, and camp followers who comprised the small constabulary Army of the nineteenth century, is the theme of Edward M. Coffman's excellent social history. Coffman's engaging chapters delve into the lives of \\"Officers,\\" \\"Women and Children\\" and \\"Enlisted men.\\" The book is arranged chronologically from 1784-1860 and 1865-1898 with those three themes revolving throughout. Since the focus here is the peacetime army, the author deliberately skips the War of 1812 and the American Civil War. The result is undoubtedly the best fusion of social and military history to date. Coffman points out, throughout its fledgling early history of administrative changes and budget cutbacks, living conditions within the institution remained deplorable. Supplies, uniforms and rations were inadequate. Likewise, living quarters and proper sanitation were always poor. The author cites a typical example where one bathtub was shared by 100 men. Predictively, drunkenness and desertion were a constant problem, however, Coffman shows that neither officers nor enlisted men were under paid for any significant length of time throughout the nineteenth century. The author injects facts, statistics, and demographics into an engaging and fast-paced narrative, that is difficult to put down. In his discussion of officers, Coffman covers many essential topics. These areas include: officer-rank & file relations, personal rivalries and career anxiety, as well as line-staff tensions and the emergence of professionalism within the officer corps. The role of West Point, education, and racism towards African-American soldiers are also adequately discussed. The most informative chapters are devoted to Women and children, and the vital role they played in the early peacetime army. The author describes the intricacies and significance of courtship and marriage, raising children in remote out-posts, and, the often forgotten role of other camp followers, such as laundresses and servants. Coffman also selectively incorporates the methods of comparative history, balancing the United States frontier army with its British and European counterparts. The author offers some insights into the correlation of pay scales, health standards, discipline, recruitment, and education. Accenting his plethora of sources arranged in copious notes, are the diaries and memoirs of several foreign observers who recorded their impressions of life within the scattered American Army. The author concludes that by the 1890's, however, living conditions across the board had improved, and the US Army was becoming a desirable career alternative just in time for its debut on the world stage. \\"Mac\\" Coffman destroys the notion that social historians make poor military historians and visa-versa. This classic is required reading for anyone seriously interested in American military history. Five-stars, Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Old Army: A Portrait of the American Army in Peacetime, 1784-1898","review":"By definition, \\"the Old Army\\" is the Regular Army establishment that existed before the last war. The Regulars were always a small body, a result of American distrust of a standing army since the very beginning of our national history. The Regulars became the backbone of the greatly expanded military as civilians volunteered or were conscripted during an emergency, and they were those who were left after the emergency was over and the militia or the draftees went home again. This volume is the first of two in which Coffman, a highly regarded professor of military history, responded to a suggestion by Paul Prucha that he expand his previous study of the social history of the American military. The second volume (_The Regulars_) depended heavily on surveys and correspondence with surviving 20th century soldiers, but this first one, naturally, is taken entirely from published histories and memoirs and from official sources. Nor does Coffman consider the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War, or the Indian Wars; this is strictly a study of the Regular Army in its continuing role as part of the background of American society. After a shaky beginning, in which the distinct possibility existed that the army of the Revolutionary era might even be entirely disbanded, career military men, both officers and enlisted, found their mission in the nation's accelerating westward expansion, from the Ohio country to the Canadian border, to the Southwest and the Plains. From Hancock Barracks in Maine to Ft. Pickens in the Florida panhandle, from Ft. Snelling, Minnesota, to Ft. Davis, Texas, and on to the Presidio in San Francisco and Ft. Vancouver on the Columbia River, the army was always stretched thin, under-supplied and under-appreciated, with promotions coming slower than the glaciers. American society generally had a low opinion of professional soldiers, seeing them as last-chancers who had failed at everything else. Drunkenness, gambling, and desertion were serious problems throughout the 19th century, along with disease and boredom in isolated posts. The author does a terrific job, paying attention to the underlying premises and psychological themes of the career soldier, and to the life of the military family, to the roles of religion and sports and education, and to the strange, not always hostile relationship between the Army and the Indians. His style is that of a storyteller which makes what he has to say especially easy to comprehend. I highly recommend this volume (and its sequel) to anyone with an interest in U.S. military history or in American social history generally."},{"Title":"The Old Army: A Portrait of the American Army in Peacetime, 1784-1898","review":"My interest started with the Army as an element in the western expansion. I started with books such as Utley'sFrontier Regulars: The United States Army and the Indian, 1866-1891andFrontiersmen in Blue: The United States Army and the Indian, 1848-1865. But to gain further insight into the entire Army as a force as well as a culture, Mr. Coffman's work was a great addition. It added to the understanding of a force that was largely a constabulary police force (with the exception of the Civil War) but evolved to become a modern army by the end of the Spanish-American War. Mr. Coffman's scholarly work provided the understanding of that evolution in an interesting and readable manner."},{"Title":"Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric: The Use of Reason in Everyday Life","review":"The book itself is great and easy to understand. Just about anyone is able to pick this book up, read it, understand the arguments, and then realize when and where fallacious reasoning is used. My only problem comes with the exercises the book gives. While it is nice that questions and arguments are given where you are supposed to find the fallacy or determine whether it is a good or bad argument, at the same time, out of 28 questions, the book only gives the answers to four questions (in a given exercise at the end of the third chapter). It would be nice if a book that cost over $50.00 gave answers to all the exercise questions it asked, so that people like me, who learn easier by seeing the answer and question together, will have examples to learn and check answers.

Prof. Kahane has set down nearly every possible trick, deception, or error that could possibly come up in public--or private--discourse. In this new edition the reader will find many recent examples of the improper use of rhetoric from news articles, public speeches, advertising, and media &quot;observations.&quot; Despite the rather functional title, Kahane has written a readable, entertaining, enjoyable book. As in most textbooks, there are exercises at the end of each chapter, but when was the last time you wanted to share such &quot;brain teasers&quot; with friends? This book does have one drawback--you'll again never be able to sit through advertisements, political speeches, or journalistic commentaries without noticing flawed reasoning, dirty tricks, and irrelevancies.

My impression of this book was that it was biased to the left. When I checked up on a Bible quote from proverbs (prov. 14:15) that I didn't remember (listed on the first page of the appendix), it turns out that none of the five bible versions that I checked had the quote worded in that way. It was as if it was 'interpreted' and rewritten to suit the context of the book. Some causal claims that are made in the book are dubious, at least to me. It covers a wide range of topics, but I think it comes off as a 'jack of all trades and master of none'. I thought the section on Fallacies was terrible. You can find better information about fallacies from T. Edward Damers book 'Attacking Faulty Reasoning' and Gary Curtis' website www_fallacyfiles_org just to name two. I noticed that even though Kahane was contributor to the Journal of Informal Logic, hardly any material contributed by his peers was included in this text. I find that odd. Logic (formal and informal), Critical Thinking, Argumentation, Rhetoric and Persuasion are all closely related. Additionally, one example of bias to add to the other two by two other reviewers is the example the book used about the Italian Prime Minister who was elected that owns a media empire. The insinuation was the he had unfair influence due to his ability to use his media empire to promote himself. The political groups he defeated were socialist and communist coalitions with their own media empires (in fact you have to pay a tv tax of 104 euro for the privilege of watching the three socialist / communist government owned tv stations) and another possibility for his win may be that the people may have been tired of paying high taxes and not getting much in return."},{"Title":"Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric: The Use of Reason in Everyday Life","review":"As a community college teacher, I used this book very successfully with my students.

Instead of being objective and raising questions in a philosophical way, they use their fallacy recognition to present an emotionally charged counter-attack. The authors are outraged at fallacious reasoners and even use emotional language in describing the view of one such reasoner as a &quot;goody-goody idea&quot;.

They are worth pondering, not just with regard to the Welsh, but in relation to nationality, nation and nationalism in general.Williams points out that at many points in history, not everyone that we think of as Welsh would have been considered as such. In the pre-Norman days, only gentry were considered to be true Welshmen and women, the many serfs and slaves were not, just as so much of the population of ancient Athens were considered to be foreigners. This would apparently include one of my favorite fictional sleuths, Brother Cadfael. Williams is concerned that in the present, this includes people who do not speak Welsh. He notes that, at the time of writing at least, there was little English-language programming on Welsh subjects, even though that excluded a large percentage of the population.Williams also recounts the regional differences in Wales, which sometimes persist over a long period of time.The history is never romanticized, and Williams seems rather pessimistic about the future. He has me rooting for Welsh, none the less."},{"Title":"When Was Wales?: A History of the Welsh","review":"Arguing that Welsh identity's about to vanish, and that the one-fifth who speak Welsh out of the two-and-a-half million in the Principality (as of twenty-five years ago) hold the English-speakers in contempt as \\"di-Gymraeg\\" or \\"Welsh-less,\\" Professor Williams ends his densely compiled, if relatively brief, Penguin paperback history dramatically. It's a leftist, populist, and straightforward response to romantics and traditionalists. Williams relates a series, from its formation, of rearguard if clever Welsh reactions largely to external, increasingly English, actions.He criticizes those venerating the \\"hen wlad fy nhadau,\\" the \\"old land of my fathers.\\" Williams suspects any \\"Welsh Wales\\" set apart from the increasingly polyglot, multicultural, majority who leans in their suburbs and cities towards American even more than English culture. Concluding around the time of the miners' strike during Thatcher's term, the 1985 book circles back to its earlier contention: there never may have existed a separate polity. Wales, as soon as it was defined, had to place itself in relation to England.As its own nation, \\"only one king in Welsh history is called good.\\" (54) Medieval boasts of bards and kings gain Williams' cold scrutiny. Trapped by complicated \\"kindred\\" demands to share power and wealth among relatives, feudal Welsh rulers competed among each other and against the always encroaching Saxons-- their longest if not their only foes. No romanticization here: serfs and slaves remain silent, barely noticed among the chronicles, and Williams reminds us of their erasure.The Welsh heartlands early on began to contract against the Saxons and their Welsh collaborators. The \\"gwerin\\" chose allegiance to their language, folk tradition, and soon the Welsh Bible. Their loyalty to Nonconformism and Dissent, and later the Liberal Party and then Labour, marked the separation of Cymry Cymraeg from the Marches, and the borderlands and coasts that the English began to populate and then industrialize. Those areas, especially in the south-east, turned into cities and factories, sharing only regional boundaries with the mountain people, and the north.The re-definition of Great Britain, by the time of the union with England in 1536, strongarmed Wales as a \\"junior partner\\" in what Williams characterizes as a proto-mafia controlled by colonial capital and the imperial Crown. Wales never stood a chance against Westminster, but often weakened early on due to its own disloyal fifth column. The rivalries within medieval Welsh inheritance lured many nobles into offers they could not refuse with the Saxon mobs.This intricate narrative moves slowly. While a mass market title, this could be used in the classroom effectively; John Davies' subsequent \\"Hanes Cymru\\"/ \\"A History of Wales\\" became a decade later Penguin's first Welsh-language title, and the standard reference in both tongues. Yet, Williams may provide a shorter, if no less rich, guide for readers wanting a history of Wales in half the pages. He also appends maps and a short reading lists for those needing direction; there are no footnotes outside of a few clarifications. Compact yet scholarly, its three hundred closely printed and carefully arranged pages demand steady attention-- if considerable familiarity with British history, Welsh culture, and English politics.I was alerted to a minor slip when citing Williams. He may have erred in crediting John Dee for taking credit for the term \\"British Empire\\" in the 1580s. Dee along with Peckham and Hakluyt popularized this coinage in the later 1500s to propagandize for the Madoc legend revived by Humphrey Llwyd around 1559. This tale could justify British, via the Welsh, pre-Colombian settlement of the Americas, to strengthen Elizabethan anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic claims. This also co-opted Welsh intellectuals, explorers, and leaders into serving their new Queen.Williams tells such episodes from a typical tale, of Welsh pride mingled with frequent subservience, with mixed detachment and energy. When he discusses highlights such as Glyn Dwr's rebellion, the Rebecca Riots, the \\"China\\" red-light section of Merthyr, the 1926 strike, or the determination to revolt against the Means Tests of the Depression, the tone lightens and quickens. The six pages describing \\"Imperial Wales\\" and the Liberal ascendancy under Lloyd George splendidly sum up a the dazzling facets of a confident period for a newly diverse nation.Williams tends to distance himself from Welsh Wales, even as he knows it well. His sympathies, if well explained, side with the much-maligned majority that for him represents 80% of contemporary Wales. They made the modern nation prosper: \\"Industrial capitalism came hard and it was fought hard. People were trying to build community in the teeth of it. To those problems, no tradition offered any answer; they had to find their own. They had to walk naked.\\" (191)Yet, much as he defends their interests, he honestly must face the imminent inclusion of Wales within an Anglo-American hegemony.

The author has eaten her way through an impressive variety of sushi, and her affection for her subject is evident throughout. However, the book is thin on practical guidance -- you won't find instructions on how to make sushi, or how to distinguish good sushi restaurants from those to be avoided at all costs. And it's dated: I haven't seen kobashira in a sushi bar for 10 years or so, after a contamination scare in Japan halted exports of this scallop. Still, the book is a pleasure to look at and to handle -- and I'm forever grateful to the author for introducing me to kohada."},{"Title":"Sushi -","review":"While this is not the book for those seeking instruction in the preparation of sushi, it is a wonderful book for those who enjoy eating sushi and sashimi in restaurants.Mia Detrick describes the history and cultural context of sushi and the etiquette and tradition of the sushi bar so eloquently, that I could not postpone my next visit to one.

I have many books on sushi, and I've been making it for years!Looking back, I believe the most helpful part in this book for me was the part about making the rice properly, including making the sauce-mixture for the rice. ANY real sushi lover knows if the rice isn't just perfect, you can just go ahead and start making another pot, since even the best of ingredients can't make up for a poorly prepared rice.This book taught me -long ago- how to get get it right and now I do every time.

In 2003 I opened my own sushi bar! This book has set the standard of what I have expected from sushi bars, and guided me through designing my own. Wonder how many copies I've sold over the years?

Excellent photos, especially for 1981. The text isn't terribly strong though, there's not a lot of content to it frankly.

The illustrations on how to teach you how to make sushi are bizarre and nearly indecipherable. This book is so old it was TYPESET!"},{"Title":"Sushi -","review":"Published in 1983, this book is now 27 years old and parts of it hopelessly out of date. While it may have been pioneering in its time, a lot has changed about the American palate since then. Japanese cuisine is now a very popular, fashionable, and healthy dining choice, and no longer that rare, little understood, and exotic curiosity that it was 3 decades ago. Sushi restaurants have proliferated in the US and abroad, and more Americans are accustomed to eating it now (but authenticity is another matter altogether). Many sushi restaurants are not operated by Japanese employees, or even owned by Japanese people so the lessons on etiquette and proper Japanese table manners are only useful when dining in authentic, traditional sushi restaurants that cater mostly to Japanese clientele instead of Americanized sushi shops. For instance, Detrick explains that hot shibori (cloth towel) are to be folded back after wiping ones hands and placed on the table after use. You're just as likely to get a paper napkin instead.This book is mostly an illustrated dictionary of nigirizushi. The photos are pretty and delicious looking. Many of the entries imply that frozen fish flown in from Japan is superior to domestically available counterparts or substitutions. I'm not sure how many sushi restaurants really fly in fish from Japan these days, unless they are very high end. This information may no longer be accurate. Japan, for its own sake, imports A LOT of fish from other countries (3 million tons), like China, US, Thailand, Australia, Russia, and Scandinavia. Japan's own waters have been fished dry in many parts of the country. It also talks about bluefin tuna being commercially unimportant in the US market, being used only as pet food. Bluefin tuna species are now teetering on the edge of extinction (classified as critically endangered by the World Conservation Union) and not ecologically responsible to eat.At the end of the book is a section on how to make sushi rice and roll it. Perhaps this should've come in the front. It would've been nice to see photos or illustrations of the fish or marine animal involved also, instead of being just pieces of sushi draped over rice. Lastly, this book also does nothing to help readers distinguish an authentic Japanese restaurant from an imitator cashing in on America's love of sushi. For example, if a sushi restaurant is named \\"Fuji Yama\\", it's definitely not run by Japanese people. (Mt. Fuji is called \\"Fuji-san\\" in Japanese, and proper sushi shop owners would never name a restaurant after a mountain.) If it has noren in the doorway (like short curtain), it is more Japanese, although not a guarantee. If they make you take off your shoes and put them in a shoe locker, then it's definitely Japanese."},{"Title":"Sushi -","review":"This book is a complete waste of money, It should be a school book with all the facts about sushi.

You will not learn to translate a Sumerian text from this book. There are no vocabulary lists or exercises and there are only two cuneiform characters in the entire book. But that is fine since this book is not aimed at a begining student.Instead, Dr. Edzard has written a book that is aimed at more advanced students and specialists in the field, and he has done a great job of it. The author discusses differences of opinion between scholars regarding the finer points of Sumerian grammar and does a good job of illustrating how our knowledge of Sumerian is tied to ancient Akkadian texts which translate Sumerian into Akkadian. The long chapter on the Sumerian verb is daunting, but that is strictly due to the complexity of the material.This book is also wonderfully concise. The material is properly covered, yet the book is only 190 pages long.A student wishing to learn Sumerian from scratch should probably start with \\"A Manual of Sumerian Grammar\\" by John Hayes. Once they have mastered the material in Hayes' excellent book, they should then turn to Dr. Edzard's book for further study."},{"Title":"Sumerian Grammar (Handbook of Oriental Studies/Handbuch Der Orientalistik)","review":"Sumerian, the language and the culture of the 39 firsts, writing being one these, is a fascinating language, though most people who study it mix into their studies a good share of Akkadian which is very irritating. Akkadian is a Semitic language that has nothing to do, or so little (a few loan words) with Sumerian, except that they used the Sumerian invention of cuneiforms to write their own language, and apparently being a good share of the scribes at the time, they imposed some strange writing habits, such as writing the word \\"lugal\\" (\\"king\\") the wrong way, that is to say \\"gal+lu\\".The second remark we have to do is that Sumerian is mostly agglutinative and this here grammar lists the agglutinative elements both on the side of the nouns and on the side of the verbs. Agglutinative it is and yet that is not enough to say so. Edzard has the tendency to freeze some presentations in traditional ways and thus to lists the marks that are not really present in the chain but are \\"mentally\\" present, that should be present. I mean Sumerian is in the process of restructuring its agglutinative marks in many ways: it discards the use of some when it is not necessary due to the redundant discursive context. For example a locative-terminative implying an ergative, the ergative may not be marked in the verb chain.Then Sumerian is making its marks more and more abstract, which means they lose all semantic value to only keep their syntactic formal value. The various marks are restructured so that some cases use the same vocalic marks and others only use a particular consonant or vary the consonant on the basis of these vocalic marks. Sumerian is in the process, under our eyes, of reducing the number of marks and making them more and more abstract. This leads to a synthetic quality and no longer an agglutinative quality. We can also find in Sumerian some analytical elements, such as the anticipatory genitive that decomposes the genitive link and exteriorizes the marks. Thus from N1+N2-ak (genitive mark) we shift to N1-ak (genitive mark) + N2-possessive-pronoun-corresponding-to-N1. This shows this language is evolving from what it used to be and still mainly is, an agglutinative language, to a more synthetic or even analytical language.When I have said that I have only said a very small part of what is to be said about this grammar. It is too short and it saves on the decompositions of the sentences, the specifications of each formative element, and of course the cuneiforms. This makes the use of the grammar difficult because you need to know Sumerian already to follow, or you must be very good at jumping from one page to the other. It is true there is no competitor on the market, but it is true there are several tools today to work with on the Internet and there this grammar appears very short indeed, I mean in pages.Daniel Foxvog has a Sumerian Grammar and a Sumerian glossary (2010) on the Internet. John Halloran has an important Sumerian lexicon (2010) on the Internet, and there are quite a few more, including dictionaries, purely on the Internet, hence working like databases. As for the cuneiforms there is only Labat in print and John Heise on the Internet. Labat is superb though he calls it Akkadian. John Heise (2010, under development) is great because we can use the cuneiforms on our machines, hence write if we want, but he does not have all the subtlety Labat had and the compound signs are not always available. But the present grammar does not consider the cuneiforms at all and yet they are behind. The chains are analyzed along the cuneiform signs though most of the time one sign covers two marks that have been merged into that one sign.To conclude it is a difficult tool for someone who is starting. Foxvog is a lot better along with John Heise for the cuneiform signs. The reference to Akkadian should be controlled and most of the time suppressed. The two languages are too far apart. But that comes from the fact that the geographical proximity of the two languages is mixed up with some kind of possible eventual genetic connection. This is purely absurd because Semitic languages, Akkadian being one, are first articulation languages, consonantal languages, whereas Sumerian is a third articulation language, and what's more evolving from the agglutinative stage towards the synthetic stage.As Robert E. Dewar said in \\"Malagasy language as a Guide to Understanding Malagasy History\\" (2006) \\"languages differ in the extent to which they are susceptible to language contact change\\" and that is the case with Akkadian and Sumerian. They are too far apart linguistically for any partial or full merger in spite of millenia of sharing a territory and political-cultural power. That's the main point we have to align on those grammars of Sumerian: directly in the title like Labat or indirectly in the text like many others, Akkadian is a or the reference. We do not study Italian through German, as far as I know, except in Italy.The last criticism for this grammar is that it does not contain a glossary of the basic Sumerian words with their translations in English. Labat's (in fact his daughter) goes in the wrong way as far as having a glossary of Akkadian words, which makes the use of their manual difficult for Sumerian students. Luckily John Halloran's Lexicon is avaialable.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Sumerian Grammar (Handbook of Oriental Studies/Handbuch Der Orientalistik)","review":"Very well written and compreensive grammar.

Winch's research shows that journalists try to &quot;construct&quot; boundaries by arguing both within and outside the journalism profession that journalism has essential, distinctive characteristics--and that it is different from entertainment.Recent disputes regarding the proper role of journalism are discussed in several chapters, and will spark interest in many readers. For instance, one of the chapters examines discussions among journalists about the newsworthiness of allegations of womanizing by Bill Clinton which were raised by Gennifer Flowers during the 1992 presidential election. Another chapter examines the uproar over a 1992 Dateline NBC story about exploding GM pickup trucks in which sparking devices were used to insure fiery video footage. Another chapter shows how early television journalists felt pressure to make their genre of news more entertaining and easier to digest (and hence, more profit-centered), than traditional forms of journalism.Although the information is presented as scholarly research, the subject matter will interest non-academics alike, and Winch's (my) writing style is very readable."},{"Title":"Untied Feelings: Poems of a Different Kind","review":"Mr. James gives voice to such a varied cast of characters in, what I consider to be, an excellent expression of love and caring.

In the novel Milly befriends a certain Captain Segura who is known for his ruthless torture of prisoners. While spending time with Segura, Milly ventures to a country club where she soon discovers a love for horses and the urgent need to have one of her own. Shortly after asking Wormold for her own horse, which would be quite a burden on a modest vacuum cleaner salesman, Wormold is confronted by a British Intelligence officer Hawthrone. Mr. Hawthorne subsequently makes a proposition to Wormold that if he were to spy on the Cuban government for the British there would be a handsome benefit of $... upwards a month. Mr. Hawthorne later meets with Wormold to discuss what his spying in Havana will consist of. It is explained to Wormold that by using book code he will need to recruit other agents and file reports in London. Wormold is named Agent 59200/5. As Agent 59000/5 he begins by filing false reports of agents he's recruited and military constructions based on vacuum cleaner designs. Soon London is highly interested in the activities in Havana and sends Wormold a secretary named Beatrice. After her arrival officials in Havana are alerted that spies are present in their community. A chaotic witch hunt begins to suppress the individuals responsible at all costs. The characters Wormold created are suddenly real life people, in real life trouble. Wormold, his friends, and his family are suddenly thrown into a great deal of danger.After reading the fast paced novel I was please that Greene was able to keep my attention for the duration of the piece. The unusual story of a misconstrued spy leads to not only action and excitement, but humor and wit. The novel drips with dramatic irony as the reader can see where the events are heading, but Wormold remains oblivious. By applying such a great contrast in characters Green is able to create conflicts among conflicts as the motives of all the characters intertwine. Besides the entertainment value the piece also carries a wonderful message of love for one's family and the desire to protect them at all costs. The novel surprises the reader on a consistent basis providing for an enjoyable reading experience. Greene does not lack detail, but does not spend time detailing unnecessary subjects. His descriptions of scenes and the feelings of characters is parallel to none. Graham Greene uses a fantastic arrangement of love, action, wit, and humor to create both an enjoyable and imaginative story.

In a conclusion which will satisfy everyone who has ever become impatient with political maneuvering, Greene carries the absurdities of power to their limits, orchestrating a grand finale which shows British politicians at their most venal--and most ridiculous.

Encouraged to recruit other agents to provide more information (and earn even more money), he chooses names at random from the country club membership list and fabricates personas for them, featuring them in fictionalized little dramas which he churns out and forwards to his \\"handlers.\\" Always careful to fulfill their expectations exactly, Wormold becomes a more and more important \\"spy,\\" his stories become more creative, his \\"enemies\\" find him and his \\"agents\\" to be dangerous, and his friends and the real people whose names were used as fictional agents begin to turn up dead.Skewering British intelligence for being such willing dupes of a vacuum cleaner salesman who never wanted to be an agent in the first place, Greene betrays both his familiarity with the inner workings of the intelligence service, of which he was once a member, and his rejection of Cold War politics. In a conclusion which will satisfy everyone who has ever become impatient with political maneuvering, Greene carries the absurdities of power to their limits, orchestrating a grand finale which shows British politicians at their most venal--and most ridiculous. Ascerbic in its humor and delightfully refreshing in its choice of \\"hero,\\" this novel is Greene at his very best.

This book is impossible to put down, as are most of his novels. Strictly top-shelf."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"There is so much that has been said, so much ink that has been spilt, lauding Greene and especially this, his most widely-known novel, that all I can add is that time has not tarnished or clouded its impact. Greene's influence is everywhere, from Billy Collins, Arthur Machen, Dashiell Hammett and most recently found in \\"The Banana Massacre.\\" Bravo Greene, love may you wave!"},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"My third Graham Greene novel and, like the other two, in terms of tone, mood and just the narrative itself, this one is completely separated from the others.The mood is set early, as is the tone as Greene paints the world of the main character, Jim Wormold, and his life in Cuba. Greene's narrative just drips with color and descriptive text insomuch as you can almost smell the air around our man. He introduces the other players at, what seems, just the right time. This story has a comedic overtone that has your tongue firmly planted in your cheek early on and, for the entire length of the book, your tongue never comes out your cheek. Oh the irony of the whole situation.At first, our hero is reluctant to take on the task of \\"secret agent\\" but, as his young daughter grows and demands a better lifestyle he chooses self pride and parental pacification over morals and self-respect. Sinking deeper into his other life, he concocts fabricated reports that, he feels, justify his monthly stipend from the bureau. Unfortunately, the powers that be are taking his imagination seriously. The web tightens.Superb stuff from the mind of Graham Greene. It's a fast read and, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"This is a nice introduction for those who have not read Greene, and also a great title for his fans to enjoy. This is not as heavy in serious, darker meaning as many of his other works. Instead the overall tone is a rather witty and sarcastic, much in the vein of Vonnegut (his later titles especially), though not as absurd as Heller's works. It is a spoof on the 'Intelligence' business and has much in common with another novel by an author obviously influenced by Green, John la Carre's 'Tailor of Panama'.In this quirky novel Jim Wormold is approached and basically bullied into working as a spy for England while he lives in Cuba selling vacuums. Wormold figures if he has to do the job, he might as well profit from it, so he goes about embezzling the government funds by creating fictitious agents and expenses. He fabricates false reports, and even notifies England that people he knows of are his spies, when in reality they don't even know Jim. Things seem to be going well for awhile, but suddenly it all gets too real. Something that Jim is working on catches the interest of certain parties, and he gets caught up in a life or death struggle. By then he has built too sturdy of a facade, so even trying to explain that he 'made things up' isn't believed. Those he tries to convince think it is part of his role as an agent and he is trying to diffuse the situation.There are a ton of fun characters in this novel. The characters are what remind me most of a Vonnegut or Heller novel. They are often so obsessed with looking at the big picture that they don't notice the details; kind of seeing the forest and not the trees.Greene has a wonderful style of prose, and it is a real treat to read. His short stories especially highlight his amazing style, though their meanings are often less satirical and darker. If you like la Carre, then you would enjoy this novel. If you have an open mind for witty and sarcastic stories, then give it a read. I found myself unable to put the book down. It does clock in at 250 pages, so it's not a quick read, but it isn't one that requires studious reading so it does flow nicely. Highly recommended reading from one of the great English novelists of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"I expected a thrilling spy story but I got a clever farce which amused me greatly. Not at all what I expected - a unique surprise. I was amused at the clever way he gathered his deputies. It almost reminded me of Maxwell Smart."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Excellent book - a satire on the foreign services of the US, USSR, and Great Britain as regards Cuba just before the Castro Revolution. A good read for anyone, especially if traveling to Cuba."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Set in pre-revolutionary Cuba, Our Man in Havana is an intriguing and fun espionage story. Written in 1958 by English author Graham Greene, the novel criticizes secret services during the Cold War.Vacuum cleaner vendor in Havana Mr. Wormold, gets contacted by an MI6 spy, Mr. Hawthrone, who convinces him to become an agent for the British intelligence. He agrees because business is not doing well, and because he wants to take his devout daughter Milly back to Britain in order to save her from local preying men. Especially from Captain Segura, a military torturer known as The Red Vulture. Wormold, a solitary man left by his wife, has no training as a spy and feels insecure about his operative skills. At his return to London, Mr. Hawthrone's boss is very pleased with his recruit; they agree he will need further assistance and decide to send a fully trained secretary to aid him. The mole has been introduced to the secret book code, and starts to send disturbing information gathered by his agents. There is one the secret service pays special attention to: big scale weaponry is being built in a forest area of Cuba near Santiago, where the communist rebels hide. The report has filtered and captured the special attention of several agencies, and now Wormold's life is at stake. Little knows London about the veracity of such information...The strength of the story lies in the main character, Mr. Wormold. His sense of humour, the way he gathers information and how he ends up being a great chess player in the spying game, grips you from the start. The usual heroes of espionage thrillers, tough cold men that know the game well, are an object of ridicule as the story unfolds. Wormold, a vulnerable man that fears for the future of his daughter, is the unlikeliest agent a secret service could recruit. Yet his friendship with a possible sympathizer of the opposite side, his recklessness and wit in the weirdest occasions, and his vast imagination will help him when all hope is lost.This is the funniest spy story one could read. The suffering of the character in the most risible situations, makes you laugh throughout the whole book. The absurdity of the information war that followed the end of WWII, the hypocrisy of pre-Castro Cuban society and the criticism towards orthodox Catholicism draw the perfect atmosphere for the story to develop."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"This is really good.

But in this case both the characters and the action are too far into the realm of comics to be believable. [Of course you might say that Graham Greene knew infinitely more about incompetence and delusion in the Secret Service than I do, and without doubt that is true, but Greene's other similar books (e.g., The Comedians) don't go this far and look more like the truth.] The dialogue ranges toward the cute. The best parts are the conversations between Wormold and his daughter Millie. Those involving Dr. Hasselbacher are rather good also. At his best Greene wrote as well as Hemingway, but not in this book."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Well writtn and funny.

I think this is meant to be a spy-comedy, but as usual I didn't laugh one single time! I think Greene had intended this to be a good humoured comment to a time which was very tense upon the cold war. Things like that just don't really appeal to me, sory Greene!"},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"... about a really funny book except \\"Read it! You won't be sorry! You'll split a seam!\\"But I won't spoil any of the humor by explaining it; let's just declare that it's verrry Brrrritish. Besides, you've probably seen the movie, right? With Alec Guinness, whom else? I do have something to say about the milieu of the novel -- Graham Greene calls it an 'entertainment rather than a novel -- which was published first in England in 1958. Presumably, therefore, it was written in 1957 or earlier. How well do you know the history of Cuba before Castro? Fulgencio Batista y Zald&iacute;var was in the middle of his second stint as \\"the United States-aligned Cuban President, dictator and military leader\\" -- to quote wikipedia -- a police-state regime that lasted until 1959. Batista's tyranny was lurid, sadistic, financially and morally corrupt on a scale rivaled by few of history's true villains. Interestingly, Batista is never mentioned in \\"Our Man in Havana\\". Neither is Fidel Castro, though the presence of \\"rebels' in the hinterlands is rumored, chiefly as an excuse for police brutality; there were two classes of people in Cuba, according to one police officer ... those who could be tortured, i.e. the Poor, and those who couldn't. Greene's characters are chiefly the latter, the rich and the foreigners, the sort whom it's 'safer' to murder than to torture. Does it sound a bit like an Ian Fleming spy thriller? The first half dozen 'James Bond' novels were written in the same decade as \\"Our Man in Havana\\". One could, i suppose, puzzle over the question of who was spoofing whom?\\"Our Man\\" -- our reluctant spy, that is -- is the Cuban agent for a British vacuum cleaner manufacturer. Needing to send \\"something of interest\\" to his 'intelligence' paymasters in London, Our Man draws a diagram of his most up-to-date vacuum, scales it the size of an airplane hanger, and reports that it's 'under construction' deep in the mountains of the interior. Needless to say, the \\"world\\" is petrified with alarm, and headquarters wants photos, which Our Man is at absurd pains not to send. Remember the \\"Cuban Missile Crisis\\" of 1962, when photos of exactly such a secret construction in the Mountains of Cuba were taken by a U2 pilot? Hmmm ... do you suppose Nikita Krushchev was a Graham Greene fan?\\"Our Man in Havana\\" is far more a satire than a spy thriller, although I'm sure it has been, and will be, associated with the works of Fleming and John Le Carr&eacute;. To my mind, the most apt comparison would be to Joseph Conrad's \\"The Secret Agent\\". It's not as original or as profound as Conrad's spy spoof, but it will perhaps be easier for a reader of 2011 to catch the jokes."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Graham Green is a masterful storyteller, and many of his novels are still as fresh and interesting as when they were first written, in many cases more than a half a century ago. He has drawn on his extensive experience as a World-traveling journalist and his time working for the British Foreign Service. This particular novel takes place in pre-revolutionary Cuba, when a lot of different interests were clashing on this Caribbean island. Havana of the time was a bustling city with a lot of international residents. One of them, a divorced Englishman with a teenage daughter, works as a vacuum-cleaner salesman. The business is not going all too well, and he is contemplating how he will continue to provide for the increasingly extravagant needs of his daughter. Unexpectedly he is recruited by the British Secret Service, and he reluctantly agrees to provide them with information that he will gather in the field. Unfortunately, he is really not cut out to be a spy, and in order to keep receiving payments for his services he is forced to invent a whole host of contacts and agents working for him. When a technical report that he sends to the home office becomes too important to handle, he is sent a young secretary in order to help him with his work. This infinitely complicates his deception, and he is at pains to keep the pretense going.This is one of the more amusing of Graham Green's novels, although it presents a very dark kind of humor. After all, people do get killed and tortured. These are not light matters to deal with even in a satirical work like this one. Furthermore, the book was published in 1958, just a year before the overthrow of the Cuban regime. It is hard to read this book without being mindful of all the tragedies that Cuban people have endured over the past half century."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Nice to see this classic in print again. Hitchen's insightful forward adds to the pleasure of reading Greene's wonderful \\"entertainment\\" again.

He is a fortysomething Englishman living in Havana, where he stayed when he fell in love with a Cuban woman who has now left him for good, in the company of their 17 year old daughter, the cyinical, likable, and beautiful Milly. Wormold has a vacuum-cleaner shop, but business hasn't been going well lately, on account of political trouble in pre-Castro Cuba. Every day, at noon, Wormold goes to the bar to have a drink and a chat with his friend, the old doctor Hasselbacher. One day he meets an English stanger who starts harrassing him into becoming a spy for the British MI-6, the intelligence agency. Wormold doesn't really feel like it, him being a peaceful and risk-avoiding guy. But Milly does something silly which puts Wormold in serious economic problem. Plus, the MI-6 is willing to pay for his services, so reluctantly but with no choice, he accepts to spy for the British. As he is no social mingler, he finds nothing to report about, but report he must, if he wants the money to keep coming in. Hasselbacher gives him what seems to be good advice: since the information is to be secret, no one will know it but Wormold, so why not invent everything, including sub-agents whom will also have good salaries and travel expenses? Wormold follow this advice and begins to send fake reports, mainly about a weapons-system \\"currently being developed\\" by the Cubans in the Eastern mountains. London is shocked and surprised. Could Wormold provide some blueprints of the weapons? Sure, why not. Little by little, and then at speeding frenzy, things get out of control. Covert sub-agents, both those whose names were just taken from the Country Club directory, as well as those living only in Wormold's imagination, begin to die and suffer attacks. Reinforcements come from London. Wormold doesn't know what to do and he's afraid about sweet Milly, who is wanted as a wife by the chief of police, a noted torturer and corrupt man. What will Wormold do?This book is as hilarious as you will get. Greene's black humor is wonderful and the characters are all likable in a spoofy way. Unwise recruitment of spies proves disastrous for the British government, but delicious for any reader of this crazy farce, one of the best spies books there are. Greene shows here, as always, a genius for plot and character-development, as well as a humor absent from his bleakest books, like \\"The Power and the Glory\\", or \\"A Burnt-Out Case\\". Great."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Jim Wormold is a vacuum cleaner seller (\\"Phastcleaners\\") in Havana. He owns a shop in Lamparilla Street where he lives with his seventeen year old daughter Milly who attends the American Convent School and is a devout Catholic. Among Wormold's acquaintances there is Dr Hasselbacher, an unstable character with a dubious past and the Red Vulture, Captain Segura, who is in love with Milly and wishes to marry her.One day Wormold is approached by Hnery Hawthorne from the British Secret Service who is in the process of \\"setting up the Caribbean network\\". Hawthorne proposes to Wormold to do some spying for the Secret Service for a remuneration of $ 150 a month. One of his duties is to recruit agents who will be able to report to him on different matters (political, economic and technological). Wormold takes up Dr Hasselbacher's suggestion to simply invent such agents and so Raoul (an alcoholic Cubana air pilot), Rodriguez (a night club king) and Teresa (a dancer at a striptease place) are the names of \\"agents\\" which Wormold communicates to London. Wormold is also supposed to send encoded reports to London but since there is nothing to report, the messages are pure fiction out of his imagination. Wormold even sends the Secret Service plans of supposedly secret weapons, using parts of his vacuum cleaners as a source of inspiration.In a tragicomic tone, Mr Greene shows an innocent man entangled in a web of deceit and crime because he wishes to secure his daughter's financial future. The author is also very critical with the way the people employed by the Secret Service in those days went about their duty. There are hilarious scenes about such amateur agents' navet&eacute; and the way they used to misjudge both the character and the personality of those they recruited seems almost unbelievable.

It's the kind of story that would seem easy to write until you actually sat down to write it. Only then would you realize just how difficult it is to marry genuine comedy with legitimate suspense in a quick couple hundred pages.Jim Wormold is a vacuum clean salesman who's recruited as a British spy by the soi-disant paragon of British espionage Henry Hawthorne. I won't say what happens next, but you'd be right in assuming that in the always faithful comedic tradition of mistaken identity, someone has to keep spinning more elaborate tales in order to keep up the ruse. What really gives the book its kick is the sharp dialogue and effortless writing. At first, it appears Wormold's daughter Milly will provide the vital backbone of the book. Her precocious wit and dubious Catholic faith make for some interesting exchanges early on, but Greene steers his story away from this domestic turmoil and onto a grander stage. I didn't know if it would work, but two-thirds the way through, when I was turning pages without realizing it, I suddenly realized it had. I'd bought the idea that a vacuum cleaner salesman was in the process of fundamentally changing the world order.\\"Our Man in Havana\\" is no \\"The Heart of the Matter\\" (Greene's \\"Legacy Book\\"), but like the tropical world it inhabits succeeds on almost every level it tries to, and that, more than a perpetually frowning pen, is the hallmark of every great writer."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"A vacuum cleaner salesman turned secret service spy?

The gentleman doesn't know what to do and makes up fictional agents and fictional military/ political developments in Cuba.This dark humour slides in great style with Graham Greene using his own experience in having travelled in various nations and having worked as a spy for England himself.The book's freshness is unique. So many novels from that period of time seem relics of past.

I laughed out loud many times throughout the book and the almost surreal satire is perfectly set against the backdrop of pre-revolutionary Cuba.

He wants to provide for her (and her equine interests - not cheap), but doesn't know how. Out of the blue, he is approached by another Englishman who recruits him to be Her Majesty's agent in Havana. They seal the deal in a public toilet. Wormold will get $300 per month plus expenses, and he needs to go out and recruit other agents and informants. The only problem is that he doesn't have the foggiest idea how to find any information that may be of interest. He does want any enterprising spy does - he just starts to make things up. Massive construction of a mysterious base in a remote mountain are of Cuba, detailed technical plans to a new super-weapon that is simply a drawing of his newest vacuum cleaner, etc. He claims to have recruited several agents, none of who he has actually met. All goes well (and Wormold regularly collects his paycheck), until London becomes intrigued and decides to send some help. Suddenly, one of his 'agents' is killed, and several others threatened, and Wormold is suddenly playing spy for real . . .This story is a humorous spoof of spy thrillers. Definitely lots of laughs throughout, but I'd have to say not uniquely outstanding. Makes all the spies and spy games look like Keystone Kops! The ending is particularly well done.

Greene achieves all this with the lightest touch, making his story of a failing vacuum cleaner merchant and his inventions for the British Secret Service an amusing and plausible romp through pre-Castro Cuba.Greene's style, by the way, is so quick and light that the characters begin to resonate only after the book's completion, when, at least, this reader began to consider this rich tapestry of characters and their interaction.

But this time, it's all in fun, although between the 220 pages of this slim volume, he manages to say a few important things about social class, the Catholic Church, and the absurdity of international relations.The hero of the story is Jim Wormold, a divorced vacuum cleaner salesman from England in pre-Castro Cuba. His 17-year-old daughter is growing up fast and he finds he needs money. So when the British Secret Service recruits him, he invents a whole world of secret agents and intrigues just to keep the money flowing.

Surprised and delighted, because OUR MAN turned out to be one of the more understated and enjoyable satires that I've read in a good long time.The book is a smart send up of a lot of the standard material one would have found in the noir films and books of the time (the novel was published in 1958, when the genre was starting to wear itself out). A British secret agent, looking to increase his community of contacts, has arranged for an ordinary vacuum cleaner salesman to file reports of any unusual activity in the area. The merchant, Mr. Wormold, reluctantly agrees to this arrangement for no reason other than the lure of extra money; he has a teenage daughter with very expensive tastes (to whit: men and horses). To keep himself employable, Wormold constructs a whole world of intrigue to write home about. The back-cover hints at one of the book's funnier gags, but all of Wormold's fictions (and especially the reaction they receive at the other end) are hilarious.Despite the comic portions of the plot, the characters themselves are allowed to retain a certain dignity. The prose is also as lush as one would expect from a Graham Greene novel. One particular scene stood out as a wonderful piece of writing. Placing two main characters inside a dark, dingy saloon, Greene describes the other inhabitants as looking like paratroopers about to parachute out of an airplane. Their quick glances at the door and their hushed demeanor are all exquisitely described. I like comedies as much as the next guy, but it's rare to find one that is simply this literate and also so entertaining.OUR MAN IN HAVANA is a relatively short novel; my copy clocks in at just two hundred twenty pages. It makes for a quick read, but not a throwaway one. It's smooth enough to be read as a straightforward thriller, if that's what you're in the mood for, as its comedy is more on the subtle than on the broad side. But, that said, the neat cuts of satire make this a hilarious and whimsical tale."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"More successful than most of Greene's &quot;entertainments,&quot; this comic spy tale set in pre-Castro Cuba concerns an insignificant little man-a vacuum cleaner salesman to be precise-who, against his better judgment, becomes MI6's &quot;man in Havana.&quot; A longtime Havana resident, Englishman Jim Wormold is divorced, but the custodian of his beautiful, Catholic teenage daughter, Millie. One day he is approached by Hawthorne-a hilariously daft MI6 agent, whose speech is littered with upper crust slang-who shanghais him into becoming a spy. Although he is resistant to the whole notion, his best friend (a German named Hasselbacher), suggests he simply manufacture his sources and intelligence and take the ample money. Millie's expensive tastes and his own devotion to her result in his succumbing to this temptation, and he spends a few happy weeks inventing subagents and fake intelligence. For the first time in years he's doing something interesting, and no longer has money worries-in the funniest bit, he submits drawings of vacuum cleaner parts as sketches of a new Cuban weapons installation.Of course, this being Greene, complications arise. He is sent reinforcements from the London office, and must scramble to keep them in the dark as to his deception. At the same time, his inventions seem to be taking on a life of their own as people start dying around him, and somebody seems to think he's a real spy. Integral to all this is the ever-present Captain Seguras, a policeman of some renown as a sadist who seeks Millie's hand in marriage. Although a deep melancholy and tragedy lurks in the background, and there's a rather lame love injected, it remains a delightfully absurd tale, one of Greene's better efforts. One is rather reminded of Joseph Conrad's classic, The Secret Agent, in which an ordinary shopkeeper receives payment as a spy for doing nothing-payments which allow him to keep the company of a beautiful woman-and whose misguided scheme ultimately crumbles around him."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"This is perhaps the most enjoyable Graham Greene novel I have yet read. Greene dubs it one of his \\"Entertainments\\" and it certainly IS entertaining. I am a huge Ian Fleming fan and Greene covers some of the same territory here: British spies in exotic locales. In fact, both Fleming and Greene worked for the British Secret Service around the same time. However, whereas Fleming is sympathetic to the Secret Service, Greene is more severe.The story concerns a vacuum-cleaner salesman in Cuba named Wormold. One day, he meets a very eccentric man from MI6 who wants Wormold to be Britain's man in Havana. Wormold takes the job in order to get money for his daughter. However, he is not very adept at being a spy, so he starts making up the reports...which suddenly begin to come true.Greene portrays the British Secret Service as a bunch of fools who are ready to believe whatever Wormold tells them. It is a typical Greene story in that it deals with the moral ambiguities of life and it has an extremely flawed hero. This is one of the best spy novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"In this novel, set in Cuba in the days before Castro, Mr Greene is at his most ironic. He tells the tale of Jim Wormold, a vacuum cleaner salesman who lives quietly in Havana and worries about his devoutly Catholic teenage daughter whom he is raising as a single parent. He is unexpectedly recruited, in a public toilet, by the British Secret Service to &quot;keep an eye on things&quot; in Cuba. When no obvious &quot;things&quot; present themselves, Wormold decides to invent agents and situations to pad his reports. But then things start to go wrong and reality begins to mirror fiction.Graham Greene captures the sleepy, sensual heat of the Caribbean perfectly. His characters are extraordinarily vividly painted and the book lurches wildly from comedy to tragedy to farce, damning the bureaucrats, the police and the sinister, grey men of the secret services along the way. With The Comedians and Brighton Rock this must surely rank as one of Mr Greene's best entertainments."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"I first read this book several years ago when it was titled \\"The Tailor Of Panama\\" and written by John le Carr&eacute;. I finally realize why I enjoyed that earlier book so, in that le Carr&eacute; modeled the work so directly (and with proper acknowledgement) on this 1958 masterpiece.Le Carr&eacute;'s effort isn't bad, but its often-maudlin tone detracts from the humor of the situation. Not so Greene, who subtitled his book \\"An Entertainment\\" and meant it. He doesn't waive all suspense and tragic overtones in search of punchlines; one of the chief joys of this book is how well it works as a spy novel. But unlike heavier Greene works like \\"The Power And The Glory,\\" \\"Our Man\\" plays in a kind of high-adventure, almost Ian Fleming kind of way.Greene's novel concerns a struggling British vacuum salesman living in Cuba, Jim Wormold, recruited by U.K. espionage to provide intelligence on the local scene as it becomes a hot spot in East-West relations. Wormold can't resist their money, but decides that instead of giving honest information, he will make up stories with the \\"assistance\\" of a stable of recruited agents he invents on the spot.\\"Just lie and keep your freedom,\\" advises Wormold's best friend, an old German doctor with a mysterious background named Hasselbacher. \\"They don't deserve the truth...They have no money, except what they take from men like you and me.\\"So Wormold does exactly that, for the benefit of his blossoming daughter, the flower of his heart whose faith in him and God he seeks to preserve though he doesn't share either belief. The result is a tangle of tall tales about alcoholic pilots and Mata Hari (...) he basically makes up as he goes along.At one point, he wonders whether he pushed his luck when he presents the plans for one of his vacuum cleaner models as a secret Soviet base, but he's hopelessly addicted to his fiction almost as much for the pleasure of creation as for the financial reward: \\"It astonished Wormold how quickly he could reply to any questions about his characters; they seemed to live on the threshold of consciousness - he had only to turn on a light and there they were, frozen in some characteristic action.\\"Wormold is playing a dangerous game; in addition to snookering his own country, he is also attracting the notice both of the rival camp and the Havana police in the intimidating person of Captain Segura, a rumored torturer who covets Wormold's daughter. But in oddly detached fashion, perhaps because his life lost much of its purpose when his wife left him years ago, Wormold improvises his way through with cosmic aplomb.There is a deeper meaning to this book, based on Greene's belief that neither East nor West deserved any special allegiance during the Cold War. One character puts it this way: \\"They haven't left us much to believe, have they? Even disbelief. I can't believe in anything bigger than a home, or anything vaguer than a human being.\\"It's possible to take issue with Greene's value-neutral attitude, but his execution is so deft, and his style so entertaining, that you can't help but admire him. \\"Our Man In Havana\\" is a thoroughly mesmerizing comedy that manages to impart some subversive truths about where the moral lines exist between serving one's government and serving one's fellow man."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"If you've got Scotch miniatures at home, you are bound to be reminded of this book pretty often.This is one of Greene's lightest, but best novels.Brilliantly crafted characters and a fabulous storyline make this a joy to read. The unworldy air of the events and a grand climax grips the Greene fan and the uninitiated alike.The conflict present in Greene's characters is present here as well -Wormold,the vacuum-cleaner seller cum spy struggles to keep his life in check and conscience within bounds. Greene himself was an MI-6 agent.Is he trying to put across something about MI-6 or the secret services in general?Apparently Greene once acknowledged this fact. A must-read."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"So, I picked up this book at a flea market in Obergnigl-a small suburb of Salzburg, Austria. The only reason that I bought it was because the inside cover told the reader that this book was forbidden to be brought into the United States of America or The British Empire. Well, naturally, who would not be incredibly intrigued after reading that lovely statement? I soon realized the reasons behind the hype over Graham Greene. After having read this book, the next day I went to the Rupertus Buchhandlung on Dreifaltigkeits Gasse in Salzburg and bought \\"The Third Man.\\" (I read that in one day...) In short, what I am trying to say is that this man is one heck of a fabulous writer. He takes you to the far corners of the world--and throws everything at you.. it's like an assault on the senses. In this case, the main character, Wormwold, is a British vacuum cleaner salesman in Havana, Cuba--pre Castro. A British Intelligence agent offers Wormwold a job in the bathroom of one of the local bars as the British contact in Havanna. Wormwold decides to take the job to save money for his quickly maturing (and Omnipresent Catholic) daughter. Well, one thing leads to another, and the next thing you know, his best friend (Hasselbacher) is being exceedingly obvious about his connections to Germany, a dog is poisoned with drugs meant for Wormwold, the secretary turns into a love interest, strippers are being dragged into Cuban/British Issues, the police are busy playing draughts (checkers) with whiskey bottles, and imaginary agents become real and are being killed. Ok, so that's a Huge summarization---so read it, enjoy it, savour it. This book is only for the people that can really appreciate noir fiction/spy novels... oh, and you have to have a sense of humor too. I also HIGHLY recommend \\"The Third Man.\\" It is, in my opinion, a better written novel than \\"Our Man in Havana.\\" However, this book has its merits and should be read for pure leisure... Graham Greene is a winner and should be savoured as a writer of fantastic spy novels."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"I read this book lying on a beach in Mallorca over the course of two days. It's an easy and amusing read. I liked the main character Wormold. He's so laid back and lets events overtake him and take control of his life. Not unlike a few real life characters I know! Anyone who can &quot;fall&quot; into the role of a secret service agent and then believe he can fool them with plans of vacuum cleaner instead of a weapon is clearly off his head. What makes the character funnier is that he thinks that he will get away with it and it is an earnest attempt to fool them that he is doing something meaningful. There is nothing sinister in his deception - just a naive desire to please and get by in life as quietly as possible. As you will find out in this book, the quiet life is something that he fails to achieve.The only reason why it doesn't score 5 points is that it's a bit light weight. It's over all to soon. - Perfect for the beach though."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Wormold is a middle-aged expatriot British vacuum cleaner store owner/salesman living in Havana with his only daughter, Milly, 16 or 17 year old archtyical good but bad Catholic school girl cum leathal &quot;Lolita&quot; cum Cher from the movie &quot;Clueless&quot;--her favorite passtime is spending her father's money, sometimes on credit to Wormold's dismay. Feeling a general ennui about life after Milly's mother (his wife) leaves him to run off with another man, Wormold's whole life is indulging Milly, drinking with an ex-Nazi (possibly) drinking buddy Dr. Hasselbacher, and collecting miniature bourbon and whisky bottles (he has 100s).When Milly wants a horse, Wormold decides to accept a manna from heaven in the form of a lucrative &quot;part-time&quot; job setting up the Havana station for the British secret service. Or was it a contract with the devil? As the heedless Wormold invents sub-agents and technical &quot;drawings&quot; for the &quot;enemy's&quot; (though which enemy we don't even know) secret installations in Havana, and generally fakes out the fools at Headquarters in London, real people start dying. What is going on? Can inventions--people and state secrets--of the imagination, &quot;as if writing a novel&quot; really come to life?Tightly written with Greene's usual cast of colorful characters both local and expatriot, like the would be suitor of Milly, a policeman reknowned in Havana for carrying a human-skin cigarette case, Captain Seguras, this book is short, dense, compact, and worthwhile reading. It's a comical/satirical look at the human condition as well one of Graham's favorite topics, international intrigue and the world of the &quot;spy.&quot;"},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"If you haven't read Greene, it's time to start. This was the first book I read by him and I'm going to go get whatever else is available. This excellent story, written in 1958, is still tremendously amusing-and oddly poignant-today. Somehow, Greene combines the absurd, humor, suspense, romance, and some reflections on the pointlessness of unthinking nationalism-all in less than 200 pages. This was one of the funniest books I've read recently, and in ways that the reader won't anticipate.The hero, Wormold, is living in Havana with his daughter selling vacuum cleaners. In one of the many priceless scenes in the book, he is hired to be a British spy in a bathroom in a hilarious episode that's part Kafka and part Monty Python. Wormold doesn't particularly care about the Cold War, but he really loves his beautiful and charming daughter, Milly, whose mother abandoned them both years ago. Milly could use a horse, among other things, and so Wormold agrees to be a spy-of a sort. But then he starts reporting elaborate lies back to his boss, and the fun-and disaster-ensues! Somehow, over the course of the book, Wormold unexpectedly turns from a pitiful middle aged man into someone we really like.Truly a great read!"},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Aha, with wit and irony, Mr. Greene takes us on a journey through pre-Castro Cuba, parts of Havana nightlife which are sadly no more. Its a delightful little read, of course, made much more delightful if you are sipping a daiquiri, on the rocks please, and none of that frozen strawberry stuff."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"What a great book. I hadn't read it in ten years, and had forgotten most of the details; the plot itself is revealed in the first few pages, so no matter that I could remember it.It involves, of course, a vacuum salesman -- who becomes a spy, sort of. He is recruited by British Intelligence, and makes money by \\"recruiting\\" imaginary agents and sending them on expensive fictional missions. Brillliant, farcical and more illuminating and entertaining than a hundred Ludlum-type \\"thrillers.\\"The amazing thing about Greene is his ability, in the context of his stories, to capture the essential humanity of his characters and place it in writing, and to convey deeper meanings and truths which underly their movements and plot.Greene's tale might seem preposterous -- but it isn't. Before Pearl Harbor, the Japanese employed an agent who clearly fabricated reports, and proposed means of sending secret signals from a boat he didn't own, and a house he leased to naval officers. In truth, intelligence agencies have suffered legions of failures and even the best of them made egregious mistakes with similarly disastrous consequences. Greene's book is not merely an amusing tale of a few people, it is an allegory and expose of the fallacies of secret organizations, and a biting commentary about the extremes to which they can go to protect their own -- rather than the public's -- interest. Greene, to be sure, must have witnessed some of the bungling, and underlying his farce is a warning and a commentary."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Graham Greene's novel about spies in pre-castro Cuba is funny, satirical and ultimately true about the ridiculousness of cold war paranoia. The tropical and laid back cuba where prostitutes, cigars and alcohol seem to be the only important products is suddently invaded by spies from the superpowers.The protangonist of this story is the vacuum salesmen wormwood who due to the need for some extra cash for his 17 year old daughter decides to take on a job as a spy for his native UK. However, wormwood soon learns from his friend dr.hasslebacher that its much easier and effective to simply make things up to confirm the suspicions of his superiors than to actually go about finding real intelligence. The power of human ignorance, stupidity and tendency to believe what confirms our predispositions is fully realized when wormwood's spymasters become more and more convinced by his faked reports. The crazier and more inane wormwood's reports, the more that his superiors believe him.This funny and innocent game soon turns deadly however when the spies of other nations are also misled into believing wormwood's reports are true and attempt to silence this source of \\"valuable intelligence.\\" The signature phrase of the book is \\"are your sympathies with the east or west,\\" a question often put to wormwood and the other hapless inhabitants of cuba whose daily lives could not be further from the power struggles of the superpowers.In the end, the heavy momentum created by the fear and suspicion of the superpowers threatens to crush all that is caught in between. This novel makes us question who are the truly evil people in this world? The secret policemen of cuba end up as a rather sympathetic character who falls in love with wormwood's daughter and befriends wormwood where the gentlemen of the british spy service are arrogant men who sees wormwood as nothing but a pawn to be sacraficed and could not even admit that they had been fooled by a lowly vacuum salesmen.For everyone who believes in the omniscience of the CIA or KBG or MI6 or whatever, read this book and remember the quote:\\"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\\""},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"This text set out to ironize over English secret service, probably also other secret services. The story is well on the side of the unbelievable, but its charm compensate for its lack of realism. Its fantasy - a vacuum cleaner is made into a dangerous war machine by drawing a small man beside it - compensates for its lack of real spy story creativity.The story is also a sort of distant, not quite believable, love story. However, the main characte, Mr. Wormold, does not quite believe it himself, and the girl, Beatrice, is the driver of the love story: haven't you got a room where there is a bed? Beds always make one talk.\\" (p. 103), so it is explainable.Lastly, is it is a funny story of a young girl, Milly that grows up with our hero Mr. Wormold, she attends a catholic convent, and she has no mother around. At seventeen her environment is her schoolmates: \\"is that (true lov) the thing you are talking about at the convent? Naturally. It's the future, isn't it? We haven't got a past to talk about, though Sister Agnes has\\" (p.95) In contrast to the English Secret Service Mr. Wormold talks about reality \\"I mean your daughter is real and her seventeen birthdays is real\\" (p. 103)Now, if we pretend that the English Secret service is the Englishnesnes, Mr Wormold is the contrasting reality and Milly is the future, the story is a deep metaphor for where the world is heading.I am not sure this is a great, great book. It is fun. And it has become part of our book heritage. As far as I see, due to the vacuum cleaner drawings.Quotations. \\"Dr. Brown, who had palmed off the unimportant Carter...\\" (p. 172). \\"It takes two to keep something real\\" (p. 103), you can't love and be as confident as he was\\" (p. 103)"},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"When a glib British Secret Service recruiter gloms in on a hapless vacuum cleaner salesman trying to make a living and raise a precocious daughter in Havana, the result can only be one thing. Chaos. Daughter Milly flirts with a Hollywood-model Latino torturer and spends far more than daddy makes. Mom has split long ago with some American hotshot from Miami. The action all takes place during Cuba's notorious 1950s Batista regime when guerrillas lurked in the jungled mountains while casinos or whorehouses lured \`players' from far and wide. Our man in Havana needs dough and he needs it bad. So what do you suppose a poor, unwilling spy does ? He invents agents (collects their salaries and expenses), hands in fictitious economic data, and even invents weird weapons programs rumored to be coming up in the jungles. London headquarters laps it up. His old German friend tries to warn him that he's getting in over his head. But our man draws designs of Weapon X based on vacuum cleaner parts. London sends him a secretary and radio operator. What an upgrade ! Now he's really up the creek ! The torturer wants to marry Milly. He's got to move fast.

He has that talent for being really hilarious at one time, and at the next, super sad. As Christopher Hitchens mentions in his introduction, Greene divided his books into \\"novels\\" and \\"entertainments\\". I believe Our Man in Havana is an entertainment, and it certainly shows. There's lots of whimsy in this one, and the whole plot is completely ludicrous. Wormold is a vacuum-cleaner salesman in Havana, when he is randomly recruited by Hawthorne, a British secret agent. He is set to report on economic and military goings-on in Cuba, and begins concocting wild reports based on Tales from Shakespeare by Charles Lamb and dreaming up military installations from vacuum designs. Then his stories start becoming true...This book is complicated. At first glance, it seems like just a funny espionage thriller (seems like an oxymoron, doesn't it?). But the book it's not. I had a lot of favorite quotes, one of which was \\"Childhood was the germ of all mistrust. You were cruelly joked upon and then you cruelly joked. You lost the remembrance of pain through inflicting it.\\" And I think that's really true. Once you reach the top of the order, so to speak, then you forget what it was like to be at the bottom. And \\"'There is always time for a Scotch.' It was obvious from the way he pronounced Scotch that Dr Hasselbacher had already had time for a great many...\\" Being a fancy way of saying that he is rather drunk.The part that really got me laughing was when...\\"'You called me, Senor Vormell.' For some reason the name Wormold was quite beyond Lopez' (his servant's) power of pronunciation, but as he seemed unable to settle on a satisfactory substitute, it was seldom that Wormold went by the same name twice.\\" Lopez goes on in the ensuing paragraphs to call Wormold \\"Vomell\\", \\"Ommel\\", \\"Vormole\\", \\"Venell\\", and \\"Vommold.\\" It was hilarious.Enough quotes (though there are many more, detailed in the excellent introduction ). Our Man in Havana is one of my favorite Graham Greene novels so far, better than The Quiet American and just as good as Travels With My Aunt. I may have to buy it now, it was so good.

I mean, when you get a ridiculous premise like this, why not play it up? Have the characters' dialogue be more outrageous, have them be more eccentric. All the characters in this book talk to each other in very believable conversations, but they are rather mundane--a little too much like real life.I guess what I mean is, this book attempts to mix humor in with a very serious, dramatic subject; but in attempting both, it completely succeeds at neither.It is too serious, too matter-of-fact, for comedy; it is too laced with slyness to be dramatic.If you think of the masterpiece of the same genre, of the same century which DID mix the two quite successfully, CATCH-22 by Joseph Heller, you will see quickly how Heller succeeded where this book stalls out: Heller allowed for much more eccentricities of his characters, in both dialogue and mannerisms; Heller also allowed for outrageous, unbelievable scenes now and again, laced in with some really serious matters.Greene plays it more conservatively, and as a result, this book comes off as well-crafted, but largely insipid next to the classic of this genre. It just didn't hold my attention like I was hoping it would."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"This review pertains to the audiobook cd set.

Yes, a vacuum salesman gets recruited as a spy, and passes on some bogus info causing some near panic situations. In fact he outwits his superiors!

The subject is well chosen and very interesting. It shows the life and behaviour of the agents of the different secret services in Cuba during the revolution of Castro (1958).

He has a daughter who is very religious. Because his daughter has an expensive way of living he has to take this job as a spy because of the extra money. But he is not very interested in spying, so he decides to invent his subagents and the reports. After having sent the drawings of a vacuum cleaner as a military constructions the other agents want to kill Wormold because they think that he is a very professional and dangerous agent.

I also enjoyed reading the book because of the fascinating characters, for example Captain Segura and others. They are really described very well and human.

Really I recommend it."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Subtitled \\"An Entertainment,\\" this terrific 1958 work surely is much more than that. Wormold, a failing vacuum cleaner salesman in Havana, is divorced and the father of Milly, his ravishing and very Catholic 17-year-old daughter. Desperate for money to satisfy Milly's extravagant expectations, Wormold is drawn into the shady world of British espionage. Completely perplexed as to what to do but needing to justify the money he's earning, Wormold begins to cite real people as his agents, invent covert activities, and write plots and counterplots in his reports back to the home office in London. The London office loves his work so much that they send him a secretary and an accountant to support his obviously important operation. Of course, London doesn't know who Wormold's reporting on; they could be the Americans, the Germans, the Russians, or the \\"rebels.\\" All too soon, Wormold's fictions spin out of control and the line between invention and reality vanishes.I was struck not only by the economy of Greene's effortless and crisp writing, his rich array of characters, the metaphors that worked so well, and Greene's hilarious satire and comedy, but also by the resonance this story has with today's world of secret agencies, events spinning out of control, and the absurdity of our blind faith-based leaders as they invent their own reality. Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld are a perfect fit in Greene's London home office. If Greene were with us today, he would have no shortage of material to write about, although he might be hard pressed to find jocularity among today's dangerous, thick-skinned philistines."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Quite a good read I have to say I was quite fond of the book. It's about a salesman in Havana named Wormold, who's living alone with his catholic daughter called Milly. His wife has moved to Florida. He's educating according to his wife's wishes. He's not very rich man but his daughter has extraordinary needs; a horse for example. It happened that one day he meets a stranger who offers him a quite good job. He accepts and more and more you recognize that he's working now for British Secret Service. His old friend Hasselbacher tells him not to recruit any agents to avoid troubles. Consequently he invents a few spies, pretends doing a good job and takes all the money the BSS is sending him. When he runs out of ideas he makes a drawing of a vacuum cleaner (he sells them), sends it to the BSS and declares it as a secret base in Oriente. Now the BSS decides to send him some reinforcement: Beatrice and Rudy. After her arrival she found out that Wormold has a unprofessional plan. Then his imaginary agents begin to die away. Now Wormold can't understand his situation any more. To avoid more death agents he decides to cable a final report (list of all foreign secret agents in Havana) and stop spying. But the whole thing comes out to be a very complicated story....."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Our Man in Havana by Graham Greene (1904-91) was published in 1958 shortly before the fall of Battista the dictator of Cuba. He was toppled in a coup by Communist guerillla Fidel Castro whose shaky hand still rules the Caribbean country. Greene considered this novel to be in the category he labelled \\"entertainments.\\" It is a short novel of only 220 pages. The Penguin edition includes a good introduction by Christopher Hitchens. Hitchens focuses on the use of alcohol in Greene's novels.The Plot: James Wormold is a 45 year old divorced vacuum cleaner salesman in Cuba. His daughter Millie is a seductive 17 year old who is being ardently courted by Captain Segura. Segura is a sinister figure who is called the Red Vulture. Down on his luck and finances Mr. Wormold is courted by Hawthorne an agent for M16 (British intelligence) to report on military installations being installed on the island. Wormold makes up false reports and creates imaginary agents much as a novelist does his fictional characters. He also sends London reports of military hardware which he has based on the parts of a vacuum cleaner. Interludes of the novel occur in London where a fetching secretary named Beatrice Severen is dispatched by the government to work as Wormold's secretary. The two fall in love. Meanwhile Wormold' friend Dr. Hasselbacher is killed by an enemy agent.Wormold escapes a poisoning attempt. He is rewarded with an O.B.E. award. The novel is rich in literary allusions, comments on Roman Catholicism and is a sharp witted political satire. This book is not for everyone but it still holds up as a good read for those who enjoy a witty tale well told."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"I've read several of Graham Greene's novels that are marked as the serious ones and have loved them all (especially The Power and the Glory and The Burnt-Out Case). He is clearly one of the best writers of the twentieth century. I've also always appreciated that he worked within the confines of the traditional novel, and the fact that he also produced quality genre fiction is even more unique and intriguing to me. I've always wanted to get around to some of his lighter fare.Our Man in Havana is my first crack at one of Greene's spy novels, though I knew going in that it wasn't supposed to be a prototypical spy tale but more of a satire on them. Whatever it was, it was a good read.Our Man in Havana is about Jim Wormold, a pretty pathetic divorced expatriate vacuum salesman living in Havana, whose daughter has begun to strain his limited income. He soon finds himself being recruited by a bumbling military intelligence agent to spy for the crown. He accidentally agrees to do the work, but finds that the money is quite good when he begins turning in fictitious reports and recruiting fictitious subagents (who have the names of real people with whom he's acquainted). Things turn bad, though, when his reports are believed by the intelligence agencies of multiple countries, and people's lives are put into danger.The novel is satirical in that British way that's silly, understated, and almost light-hearted but that also wields a sharp edge upon closer look (Waugh, Powell, and Spark could also pull it off). This makes for a crisply-written, quickly paced, and chuckle-inducing read. At the same time, though, it strikes at the paranoia of the Cold War age that seems not to have gone away still (though it features a different set of combatants), that persistent need for people to create enemies and to do so in the name of surprisingly empty abstractions. The novel, instead, appeals to people to do away with the shenanigans, to stop trying so hard to create enemies, and to turn toward the matters of the heart closer to home.Our Man in Havana was a successful entertainment, a fine comedic and romantic spy novel. It's also, if you take a closer look, a surprisingly poignant one."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Greene is best known (deservedly) for his serious \\"Catholic novels,\\" but he also was fascinated with the world of espionage, and he was perfectly capable of writing archetypal British dry humor. Put those together and you have a very funny book, set in the last days of the Batista dictatorship in Cuba. Mr. Wormold, a middle-aged ex-pat, runs the Cuban franchise for the Phastkleaner Company, purveyors of the Atomic Pile Vacuum Cleaner. Though there's nothing actually \\"atomic\\" about it, as he has to keep explaining to nervous potential customers. He's been in Havana a long time, and married a local girl who subsequently left him and ran off to New York. Now it's just him and his stunningly gorgeous 17-year-old daughter, Milly -- an adamant Catholic when she wants to be (when the \\"invisible duenna\\" is walking beside her) and a considerable handful when she doesn't. Wormold makes enough to get by but Milly, a competition-level shopper, now wants a horse. Which also means special clothes, and a saddle and tack, and stabling -- and a country club membership, so she'll have a place to ride. Where is he going to get that kind of money? Fate plays along in the shape of an Englishman called Hawthorne, sent by MI-6 in London to build a network of informants in the Caribbean. Before he quite knows it, Wormold has been recruited and told to develop his own local network and send in reports on the Cuban economy, military operations, relations with the Russians, and internal politics. Of course, he has no idea how to do any of that. But then his old friend, a retired German doctor named Hasselbacher, suggests he simply make up his agents and his reports -- it's a lot safer and London will never know the difference (and so events prove). And Milly can have her horse. That's the set-up and Greene (as Wormold) has a great time creating agents from all walks of life, gathering data from the newspapers and from government reports, and claiming expenses and bonuses from his paymasters. London is delighted -- so delighted, they send Wormold a couple of specialists to help run his station -- one of them a very attractive young lady who rather turns his head. It's not a long book, only a little over two hundred pages, but it's a lot of fun. Incidentally, this novel was a reworking of a screenplay idea Greene had pitched a few years before, set in the Baltic in 1938. The Crown censors told him to forget it because the movie would have made fun of the Secret Service. Can't have that, can we?"},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Wormold is right. Noone moves beyond sex.A suprisingly lightly written book about the people of HUMINT in the pre-Castro aera describing the survival of circumstances pretty well. Fun to read. Interesting is the name pick, old worm = Wormold."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Graham Greene obviously had fun writing this wonderfully satiric send-up of the espionage business. I smiled through most of the book, and often laughed aloud, and yet the story never veers so far into farce that the reader is able to entirely forget the very real events in Russia and Cuba that made espionage a necessary evil during this perilous moment in world history.Because this IS Graham Greene, the character development is a step above the norm: the main character, Wormold, is delightfully unexpected; his daughter is engagingly manipulative; and even the corrupt chief of police, a man who carries around a cigarette case fashioned from human skin, turns out to be something richer than the cartoon characiture of a bad guy he might have become in a less gifted author's hands. And it's not only espionage that falls victim to Greene's wit: he also hurls satiric darts at Catholicism, ugly Americans, Cuban culture, and do-gooder international organizations, to name a few.In summary, thoroughly recommend this to anyone who enjoys their humor with a dose of intellectualism. I've read it twice already but its spot on my bookshelf is secure: one of these years I know I'll be back for more."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Our Man In Havana is not so much a novel about Cuba, rather it's about MI6 attempting to employ an operative there. Mr. Wormold, a Brit ex-pat selling vacuum cleaners is recruited and the madcap story unfolds.The UK's Secret Service is presented as altogether eccentric, ridiculous and lethal.The hero's immediate superior, is the epitome of the effete Establishment - exclusive tie, stone-colored suit, royal monogram on his silk pajamas and a cold, stiff air.The London Chief, meticulous, romantic and fatally removed from everyday realities by his literary imagination, is more concerned with trumping the Americans and Naval Intelligence than verifying his agents' reports.Greene's ridicule is full of comic asides, from the French speaking secretary sent to a Spanish speaking country - \\"It's much the same. They're both Latin tongues\\" - to the lengthy admiration of the ingenious weapons that look just like two-way nozzles and snap action couplings one might find on a vacuum cleaner.The book is more satirical than funny, the plot might be a little slow for some, but the characters are well-drawn and memorable. I have found all of Graham Greene's works to be exceptional and this book is no exception.Order the DVD 'Our Man in Havana' starring the late, great Sir Alec Guinness in a role that seems to be tailor made for him."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Our Man in Havana, published in 1958 just months before Castro's coup, captures the earlier Cold War years in a Havana that was a pit of intrigue though the unanswerable questions of who is an agent and who isn't, and to what recognizable side does anyone belong make it comic and very dangerous at the same time. This is the story of an expat Brit in Havana, a vacuum cleaner salesman who has no real allegiance to politics of any stripe but who allows himself to be recruited to spy for the mother country since, as a single parent with a high maintenance teenage daughter, he's got bills to pay.The one thing Jim Wormold rightly assesses is, no one knows what is really going on. The directions from the home office are so vague that it is easy enough to invent agents and reports and not get caught, even when the home office sends the lovely agent Beatrice to pose as his secretary. It does not take long, though, for his deceptions to be picked up as truth, which multiplies the absurd intrigues and pushes him into the sinister heart of a place where a local police captain who lusts after Wormold's daughter coolly delivers a scary appraisal of who belongs to the \\"torturable\\" and \\"untorturable\\" classes. The ending is very funny but there are some tragedies leading up to it, the collateral damage of operating in the vortex of the world's political and moral ambiguities. Our Man in Havana is a run up of sorts to Greene's later novel The Human Factor, in which nothing is funny at all but the same question is asked of both protagonists: what do you put first, family or country?Christopher Hitchens provides a decent critical introduction to the Penguin edition and like all critical introductions it is pocked with spoilers, so read it as an afterward. He puts the novel in context with Greene's life and literary themes. Our Man in Havana was out there, complete with an agent number assigned by the home office, before James Bond and before George Smiley. With the Cold War robbed of its meaning after the Berlin Wall came down, and with intelligence mangled by political ambitions in the early 21st century, it is interesting to see that these stalwarts of the spy genre still have something with which to amuse or soberly ponder the world."},{"Title":"Our Man in Havana","review":"Graham Greene, a major, well-known 20th century British author, had a very long life, most of the century, and a very long and prolific writing career. He may be best known forThe Third Man;The End of the Affair, andThe Power and the Glory (Penguin Classics); but his books were greatly honored, highly-praised by the critics, generally best sellers, and often made into movies, as were the titles cited above. (The Third Man (50th Anniversary Edition) - Criterion Collection;The End of the Affair.( So was this one filmed,Our Man in Havana). The book is a later work of his, initially published on October 6, 1958, and just re-released. Greene famously divided his books into 'novels,' such as \\"The Power,\\" and 'entertainments,' such as \\"Our Man.\\" While working on the book at hand, he wrote to the Indian writer R.K. Narayan, a friend, that he was at work on \\"a rather hack job, an entertainment called 'Our Man in Havana.' I am getting too old to boil the pot.\\" However, he also wrote to his mistress Catherine Walston in 1956 that \\"Our Man\\" was potentially a \\"very funny plot which if it comes off will make a footnote to history.\\"The book is set in Havana, Cuba, during the last days of the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, and reproduces time and place very accurately on the page. The plot's reasonably gripping, and resonant. Like his later follower, John LeCarre, Greene had first-hand experience of the British Secret Service. On the recommendation of his lifelong friend Kim Philby, who turned out to be England's most notorious postwar spy/traitor, Greene had served in Africa's Sierra Leone during World War II, and this is a spy story. The lead character is Jim Wormold, an English seller of vacuum cleaners based in Havana. (Everyone can take a moment here to remember Alec Guinness as this character in the excellent movie based on the book.) Wormold is poor and desperate: his wife has left him, and he hasn't enough money to pay his hefty bar bills, let alone keep his beautiful teenage daughter Milly in her preferred lifestyle. So, without realizing what he's doing, or where it will take him and those he loves, he agrees to become a British spy; \\"Old Blighty's\\" man in Havana.This may be an entertaining entertainment, but not to worry: there's plenty more serious Greene here. His instinctive anti-Americanism, left-wing viewpoints; and jaded cynicism as to the spy's life. His remarkable ability to create characters, even those who don't get many pages, such as Captain Segura, a local policeman/torture enthusiast, with a cigarette case made from human skin. Segura strongly resembles Batista's dread 'enforcer' Captain Ventura, and in his dark glasses and unmarked car, he will turn up again, and again, creating terror in various Latin American countries, most notably in Haitian dictator \\"Papa Doc\\" Duvalier's feared \\"toutons macoute.\\"Greene traveled widely, as a journalist, and to research his novels. He had great serendipity in his visits: many of them occurred at highly interesting times. \\"Our Man\\" was published in October, 1956; on New Years Day 1959 the revolutionary Fidel Castro came down from the mountains. The author set his Vietnamese war novel,The Quiet American (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition); (also an excellent film with Michael Caine,The Quiet American), just before the critical battle of Dien Bien Phu. He setThe Comediansin the last days of Duvalier's Haiti. He had another stroke of luck: the long American blockade of Cuba has resulted in the country, and the city of Havana, staying much the same as the writer described them nearly fifty years ago.All in all, think I'd have to go with \\"a very funny plot which if it comes off will make a footnote to history.\\""},{"Title":"Grass on the Wayside (Michigan classics in Japanese studies)","review":"If you aren't familiar with the life of Natsume Soseki (and how many non-Japanese are ?), you could be forgiven for not realizing that this is an autobiographical novel. The introductory notes in my edition told me so, that's how I found out. With this information, you will soon understand that the author was an unsparing critic of himself. Pessimistic, dark and revealing of his most selfish behavior, GRASS ON THE WAYSIDE tunnels through the underground emotions and suppressed angers of the author's penurious life. Soseki's view of marriage and family ties is extremely bleak. \\"People didn't really change very much, he thought, they only decayed.\\" (p.112) He certainly included himself. Apparently he took no pleasure in any human relationship. The people who inhabit these pages are constantly sick and poor, but receive little to no sympathy or love from those closest to them. Like most of Soseki's novels, this one explores a certain palette of emotional colors, none of them bright. Unlike others, GRASS ON THE WAYSIDE has more activity, more characters described in greater detail, and rather than being smooth like \\"Sanshiro\\", \\"Kokoro\\" or \\"The Three-Cornered World\\", it has a certain uneven rhythm or start-stop quality in its 102 chapters. I feel this originates in the fact that it was serialized in the Tokyo daily \`Asahi Shimbun' when it first appeared.\\"Activity\\" is a relative word. For most of the novel, Kenzo, the protagonist, wrestles with the dilemma of how to avoid the requests for money of a former foster father and that man's estranged wife. As he struggles to escape the onerous demands of a man he feels he owes nothing, we meet Kenzo's brother and sister, their spouses, and his wife and her relatives. A few other characters also appear. Soseki still prefers introspective analysis to action in the Western sense. Kenzo does not act on his problem until Chapter 90. His decision is nearly coincidental with the birth of his third child. At the end, he muses, \\"Hardly anything in this life is settled. Things that happened once will go on happening. But they come back in different guises and that's what fools us.\\" If definite endings and complicated plots are your love, better skip this book. GRASS ON THE WAYSIDE is a typically Japanese novel by a Meiji period author, slow, indefinite, psychologically complex, and in this case autobiographical. I happen to admire Natsume Soseki greatly, but I concede that he might not be to everyone's taste."},{"Title":"Grass on the Wayside (Michigan classics in Japanese studies)","review":"The writer is tubercular and has a hard time making ends meet, especially since he can't say no to family members.

Jason Brown is the only writer that seems promising, and is the only one with two stories in this compilation. His two stories are not great, but they show good craft. From other authors, &quot;Like a Crossing Guard&quot; is an interesting piece, but it does not completely satisfy. Such is the case with &quot;White Flight&quot;, a piece dealing with school shootings. Problem with most stories in this collection is that they suffer from the same problems that plague recent short story collections from even well-known American writers. Lack of plot. And abrupt endings. We are witnesses to small events in some characters' lives, but these events never serve to shed light on the characters or the reader. I know this is a popular thing to do with short stories nowadays, but, personally, I find it a waste of my time. Call me old-fashioned if you want, but I much rather prefer the tales of old in which there was a clearly defined beginning, middle and end that explored a specific conflict. To me, that's the sort of stories that last generations. The ones that strike a chord in the reader. Those that not only comment on our society, but make a statement about it. Those that portray a specific aspect of humanity. Those that can do the above but entertain, too.

You know the type-- there's a comma or a period at the end of almost every line, so that as you read more of it, you find yourself putting a lot more weight on the word at the end of each line than you do on other accents. Lang also avoids any of the conventions that had recently come into play to make verse more interesting, e.g. Hopkins' sprung rhythm or the slant rhymes of which Swinburne was so fond; this is by-the-book poetry to the last letter. Which is rather unfortunate, as Lang does choose interesting topics about which to write now and again; unfortunately, a poem about the death of Moliere has about as much resonance as would a poem about what brand of biscuits Lang liked to eat after dinner. (And Lord save us from authors who write in dialect, even when that dialect is theirs; that's all I'll say on the subject in this review.)The ballades themselves are accompanied by a \\"Verses and Translations\\" section marginally more interesting, as Lang varies the form here somewhat, and (of course) many of these were written by others; still, one small section does not a book save.It's pretty enough stuff, but will vanish from memory mere hours after you close the cover. **"},{"Title":"Travelers' Tales Grand Canyon: True Stories","review":"This is a marvelous book, and why didn't someone think of it before?

It is also an excellent architectural introduction and a fine review of the role of the Cistercians in European history. (Hint: it was major...) But I have another suggestion for enjoying your next visit to Europe. Schedule your travel with stops near each of the abbeys that intrigue you most. They are always serene, there are often musical events in them, they tend to be off the beaten track but to have excellent country restaurants in some nearby village, and they make good starting points for hiking since they are usually isolated. My favorites are Poblet in Spain, Senaque in France, and Maulbronn in Germany."},{"Title":"Cistercian Abbeys","review":"Like many of the books in Konemann's architectural series, this one offers copious quantities of beautiful photographs. The limited text is informative, intelligent and thankfully devoid of the quasi-theoretical nonsense that spoils so many architectural books. The critical architectural issues are explained but for the most part, the images are allowed to tell the story. Simplified, but effective plans and other diagrams complement the photos and text.In an age when so-called \\"star\\" architects do more talking than building, it is refreshing to see these monasteries, built with humility and a sense of aesthetic understanding that is so absent in the architectural profession today.I also recommend Lucien Herve's wonderful B+W photographs in \\"The Architecture of Truth: Thonet Abbey\\""},{"Title":"Chemical Properties Handbook: Physical, Thermodynamics, Engironmental Transport, Safety & Health Related Properties for Organic & Inorganic Chemical","review":"The author has produced a unique chemical, physical, and thermodynamics properties reference for scientists, researchers, chemists, and engineers. Those working in agricultural chemicals, environmental studies, explosion hazards, petroleum refining, petrochemicals, pollution control, safety and health, soil and groundwater remediation, and many other fields where finding properties data is important, will find this handbook highly beneficial. Dr. Yaws, assisted by colleagues and students, has worked for years in the fields of properties correlation, usage, estimation, and values collection from hundreds of references.The NST/Engineers, Inc. reviewers found that in this book, in a compact form, readers will learn to use methods for getting massive amounts of temperature-variable data for a number of important properties variables. That is, as opposed to the older method of property versus temperature for each chemical compound being presented as a separate table, here key constants are provided in a single row of data. The compact form used is the correlation equation that contains the constants. You get the property value you want, at a temperature you choose, by making a fairly simple calculation. However, many other useful tables are provided where properties data is simply listed. As it is, the book has nearly eight hundred pages. Had the older method been used exclusively, it would have required a library of books.The correlation equations have been either developed or selected from the literature. References providing a deeper understanding of the correlations are provided. The typical correlation equation used gives the property as the dependent variable, temperature as the independent variable, and values for the necessary constants. The range of temperatures is given over which the correlation and its constants are most valid. Both experimentally-measured and estimated data that are considered reliable have been used in determining the constants.An example is the table of constants and their valid temperature range for the Gibbs (Free) Energy of Formation, delta Gf, specifically for organic compounds as gases. It is based on a correlation equation that is a series expansion in temperature. A table row gives the organic's name and formula, values for the three constants, and the valid temperature range. Just in case you want the delta Gf value at room temperature, the measured value at 298K is listed. If you want to check your calculating ability, the calculated value at 500K is also listed. All temperatures are in Kelvin. The text explains that delta Gf values are used in determining the probability that a proposed chemical reaction, or decomposition, will take place. For a reaction, you select reactants and reaction products that make a balanced equation. Using the table, you add the delta Gf values for all the products and subtract from that total all the delta Gf values of the reactants. If the result is negative, the reaction will probably occur. The more negative the result, the more likely the reaction. If the result is positive a reaction is not expected.The table for inorganics is different. Only values at room temperature are given. However, room temperature values for Helmholtz Energy of Formation (used in estimating the energy of vapor cloud explosions) and Entropy of Formation (also used in explosion estimates) are listed.Other correlation-keyed tables presented are: Heat Capacities of Gases, Liquids and Solids; Enthalpy of Vaporization; Vapor Pressure; Liquid Density; Surface Tension; Enthalpy of Formation of Gases; Solubility of Organic Compounds in Water Containing Salt up to Saturation, at selected temperatures; Solubility of Organic Compounds in Water as a Function of Temperature; Henry's Law Constant for Organic Compounds in Water; Adsorption of Organics on Activated Carbon; Soil Sorption Coefficient for Organics in Water; Viscosity of Gases and Liquids; Thermal Conductivity of Gases, Liquids, and Solids; and Coefficient of Expansion of Liquids.Major data tables presented are: Critical Properties and Acentric Factor; Enthalpy of Fusion; Refractive Index, Dipole Moment, and Radius of Gyration; Entropy and Entropy of Formation of Gases; Solubility Parameter,Liquid Volume, and Van Der Waals Area and Volume; Solubility in Water and Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient for Organic Compounds; Explosive Limits in Air, Flash Point, and Autoignition Temperature; Enthalpy of Combustion of Organic Compounds at 77 deg. F; and Exposure Limits for Safeguarding Health.Note the application of a number of these tables to air and water pollution control and soil remediation projects. Keeping in mind that estimations have played an important part in preparing the tables in the handbook, users must understand that if carefully determined experimental data could be obtained where it does not now exist, such values could vary from values obtained from the tables. However, where the author has checked estimated and correlation data with measured data, the variation was usually no more than several percent.There are helpful appendixes listing: organics by increasing carbon content in the formula, name, and CAS Number; inorganics listed alphabetically by formula, with name and CAS Number; then organics and inorganics by increasing CAS Number; and finally organics and inorganics listed alphabetically by their synonyms that you might see in U.S. industrial or international chemical literature, together with formulas, the name used in the handbook's tables, and the CAS Number.The great advantages of the book are that it provides access to such a large amount of properties data that otherwise would cost the searcher a great amount of time and effort to obtain, and it is in a compact form."},{"Title":"Chemical Properties Handbook: Physical, Thermodynamics, Engironmental Transport, Safety & Health Related Properties for Organic & Inorganic Chemical","review":"This book is a reasonably well ordered compilation of process fluid properties for a remarkably broad range of fluids.

This is all the more unfortunate as there are no other courses in Slovene available. Routledge has published some excellent Colloquial courses on Slavic languages, such as Colloquial Czech, Colloquial Russian and Colloquial Ukrainian. Unfortunately, all the Colloquial courses from the former Yugoslavia leave much to be asked for. Colloquial Slovene, Colloquial Croatian and Colloquial Serbian are all below the usual \\"Colloquial-standard\\".For a total beginner looking for a phrasebook, this course might be of some use. It does include some basic expressions and words. However, if that is all you're looking for, you will be better served the Slovene phrasebook published by Berlitz. Not only is it much cheaper, it also includes a better pronunciation guide and far more vocabulary than this course.If you're interested in acutally learning Slovene, this course won't be able to help you. I have listed the major problems you will facePronunciationSlovene pronunciation is not easy. Stress can fall on any syllable of the word. Get it wrong, and you might say another word than the one you intended. Every phrasebook or course in Slovene I've come across shows the stressed syllable of each new word. Colloquial Slovene does no such thing, you have to guess.Another problem is that the vowel \\"e\\" can be pronounced in different ways in Slovene. Again, phrasebooks such as the one published by Berlitz or courses published in German show the pronunciation of \\"e\\". In short, you cannot know how any word in this course is to be pronounced. The recordings will help you, but it's not always easy for beginners to pick out the right syllable to stress.GrammarThe grammar part is what could set this course aside from a mere phrasebook. Unfortunately, the grammar part is very limited. The concept of aspect is almost totally excluded. If you speak any Slavic language, you will already know how crucial aspects are. If you're a beginner, know that you will never be able to speak a Slavic language without mastering this quite complicated feature. Ignoring the whole thing makes this course easier. It also renders it almost worthless for anyone interested in learning to speak Slovene. The conjugation of nouns is dealt with, but that's almost all there is. If you have access to Colloquial Czech (the grammar is very similar), pick it up and compare it's detailed and user-friendly approach to this course. It is astonishinh that two courses with such a variation in quality are published in the same series.VocaularyComplete Colloquial Czech and you will know well over 2.000 words. Complete Colloquial Slovene, and you will not know even 900 words.In short, this course is too little of everything. Too little help with the pronunciation, too little explanations of the grammar and way too few words.Routledge, the publisher of this course, has also published a very extensive Slovene grammar, written by Peter Herrity. When the time comes for the next edition of Colloquial Slovene, I hope he is given the task of writing it, that he starts from scratch and takes his guidelines from Colloquial Czech rather than from this book."},{"Title":"Colloquial Slovene: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","review":"This book is quite basic and should give the reader a good introduction to the slovene language, but it is only that. The small glossary at the end of the book helps with gender and conjugation, and most of the general rules for grammar are introduced. If you really want to learn Slovene, I suggest you start with this book, then get a dictionary like Komac's (which wont tell you anything about conjugation or gender) and finally an extensive grammar guide like Peter Harrity's book (which fills in the complex gaps left behind by the other two books). I suppose if you don't want to spend so much money, just buy this book, but do get the audio tapes so you can understand the pronunciation and get some good practice in.The book is very readable, but contains exercises at the end of each lesson (with answers at the end of the book). It is set up much like a textbook and includes some penned illustrations to keep the mood light. Don't expect it to take you long to make it entirely through the book, though. Actually this book will get you through all of the essentials for a ski trip or a short holiday. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Colloquial Slovene: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","review":"The book is well organised, well written and accessible. It covers all the basic vocabulary you need as a tourist and provides a good introduction to the language. It is largely jargon-free and you don't need to know any complicated grammatical terminology to use the book. The tapes/CDs are excellent - don't order the book without them if you want to get the most out of this teach-yourself course. The one big weakness - and it is a very big weakness - is that the book does not contain any information about word stress. Since there are no clear rules for word stress, the learner encounters many new words in the text (often not included on the tape) but without knowing how to pronounce them properly. Adding accents to denote the word stress would transform this from a good to an excellent book."},{"Title":"Colloquial Slovene: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","review":"I'm sad to say that this course will be of no use to those wanting to learn Slovene. The aim of this review is to illustrate its shortcomings and suggest improvements that could be made.Problem 1 - no accentsThis problem alone is enough to render the book almost useless. In Slovene, any syllable of a word may be stressed. Get it wrong and you may end up saying a completely different word. This is especially evident in the case of the letter 'e', representing different sounds in Slovene. Apart from being stressed or unstressed, it can be an open e or a closed e. It might also be a schwa sound, the sound found in words such as English 'the'. In other words, how will you pronounce the common word 'vecer' (evening)? There are eight(!) options available... And what about the word 'svet'? Is it the Slovene word for 'holy' or for 'advice'? Almost all courses and books on Slovene make use of accents to indicate the pronunciation, since it is impossible to predict. The only two exceptions are this book and Teach Yourself Slovene by the same author. I never thought I'd say a language course in which you will have to guess the pronunciation of each and every word.Problem 2 - Very limited vocabularyThe reviewer Gwilym mentioned how very limited the vocabulary of this course is compared to Colloquial Czech. The same goes for almost all the Colloquial courses on Slavic languages. Colloquial Czech, Colloquial Ukrainian, Colloquial Bulgarian, Colloquial Slovak, Colloquial Russian are all excellent courses with a well-suited vocabulary. Colloquial Serbian is decent enough. Only Colloquial Polish and Colloquial Croatian are a bit off the mark and then Colloquial Slovene that cannot even be compared to the other courses.So only 1 star to this course, that star is for a decent (but not great) explanation of the grammar. Two stars off for the very limited vocabulary and two more for the lack of accents.I'm glad that Routledge offers many excellent courses in Slavic languages and I can only hope that they will one day publish a Slovene course worhty of their reputation."},{"Title":"Colloquial Slovene: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","review":"I was looking for a beginners language course to try to learn a few phrases and basic vocab for trip to Slovenia. I found few options and finally ordered this one, as it came with CDs so I could hear the language and it was described as a course for beginners. I've used other language programs with good success and was hopeful to add some basic Slovene to my repetoire. This program did not do it for me. For starters, there is no guidance in terms of phonetic pronounciation or syllabic stress. There are a number of exceptions to pronunication rules that would be easier to recognize and learn if there were phonetic pronounciation alongside the words. This is especially true when trying to figure out how to pronouce words with 3 or 4 consonants in a row. I thought listening to the CDs would help, but not for this beginner. Not only are the dialogues read at fast speed, but there is no slowing down to repeat common phrases so you can pick out distinct words and how to properly pronounce them. The CDs are more appropriate for someone who already is famililar with the language. Another thing that bugged me was that the book introduced vocabulary in their exercises that had not yet been presented. And it is very hard as a beginner to look an unknown word up in a dictionary since many parts of speech have different endings depending on gender, case, etc. So it is hard to match the word to a dictionary entry. This undermined the functionality of the exercises. In sum, this whole course is more designed as a Level 2 course. Disappointing for me."},{"Title":"Oliver Stone's USA: Film, History, and Controversy","review":"Since &quot;Salvador&quot; in 1985, Oliver Stone has kept humorless historians, political journalists and right wing reactionaries flinching.&quot;Platoon&quot; (1986) was the first motion picture that actually depicted the lives of the &quot;grunts&quot; fighting in Vietnam, completely oliberating the absolute stupidity of John Wayne's jingositic film of &quot;The Green Berets&quot; in 1968.&quot;Born On The Fourth of July&quot; portrayed the pain and suffering of many Vietnam vets returning home to a society that seemed callous and indifferent.In 1991, Stone became the first commercial filmmaker with any clout to take on the morass of details surrounding the Kennedy assassination.Can a man who makes movies based on historical events actually be classified as an historian?That seems to be the fundamental question surrounding &quot;Oliver Stone's USA,&quot; a fabulous new book, edited by Brent Toplin.The first section of the book is devoted to a series of essays, both pro and con Stone, from writers like David Halberstam and Steven Ambrose (who writes a particularly nasty piece on &quot;Nixon&quot;).The book's second section gives Stone a chance to respond to the critics and that he does eloquently (noting at one point that neither Stephen Ambrose nor John Wayne ever served a minute in combat).The volume of attacks on Stone for &quot;JFK&quot; from political pundits like George Will, Alexander Cockburn, Tom Wicker et al may have been prompted by the knowledge that Stone reaches more people with one showing of his films that they do writing a lifetime of columns.&quot;Oliver Stone's USA&quot; is a book that should be read by anyone who has an interest in both the power of motion pictures and the dark side of recent American history."},{"Title":"Oliver Stone's USA: Film, History, and Controversy","review":"Oliver Stone is one of the most brilliant and provocative filmmakers working today and in this book we get a great taste of the debate over his work from both sides of the field. The book as a whole is very readable and never boring. Stone fans (like myself) and Stone bashers alike will get a good kick out of this book. The essay and responses to critics that Stone writes are fascinating, informative and speak to the free intellectual spirit and as in his great movies, Stone comes out as a man who really is aware of how the world works. I admire his writing here because it is an encouragement to people to educate themselves and read and do their own research and open their eyes. This book can be provocative intellectually and generally. The critics of Stone here also make some points, but not strong enough in my opinion, Stephen Ambrose comes off as a false historian who does not look at historical events from more than one angle or opinion. Stone easily dismisses his weak attacks. There is also a great deal of good dissection of the Stone films mentioned here which range from &quot;Salvador&quot; to &quot;Nixon.&quot; Rock enthusiasts will like the article dealing with Stone's film on Jim Morrison, &quot;The Doors&quot; and Stone's own comments on Morrison and his music. The most provocative articles are those on the two most fiery political films Stone has made, &quot;JFK&quot; and &quot;Nixon.&quot; These are provocative pieces because Stone challenges our views of official history and dares us to look behind the veils of the news, historians and some writings. This is not just a book for film buffs or Stone fans and critics, it is a book for people who enjoy good, smart debating and dissections of intellectual arguments. I enjoyed it because it is a breather for people looking for a really smart book. And yes, film buffs should definately read it because it deals greatly with how movies handle fact and fiction and it has important things to say on the role of the cinema in society and art in general. A fascinating, provocative and enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Oliver Stone's USA: Film, History, and Controversy","review":"I needed it for a class, but probably ordered it a little late.

Chittister incorporates selected examples from the earliest monastic desert traditions as well as modern-day examples from her own life in the cloister to illustrate these Benedictine basics. Unlike many authors on these subjects, Chittister adds an intensely political sensibility, which some readers may find helpful in their search for relevance in this ancient tradition.

From her over 50 years as a nun in the Order of Saint Benedict, she writes in an accessible manner about her understanding and experience with the Rule to show that community, listening, prayer, and stability are required elements to spirituality. She contends that a Gospel life is measured both through the self and one's impact on those around us. Chittister addresses present day misconceptions on humility, hospitality, obedience, work, leisure and charges that they have caused many of our problems today. Though Chittister clearly believes the Rule of St. Benedict is a path to Christian spirituality, she does not believe it is necessarily the only one. She acknowledges that the Rule \\"is simply a guide to the Gospels\\" and presents the Benedictine monastic belief and way through stories and examples to make her arguments and from which the \\"everyday\\" person can reflect and use to develop their own spirituality. For someone investigating Christian spirituality, Chittister's book offers many insights from a Rule that has been practiced, tested, and lasted for approximately 1500 years."},{"Title":"Wisdom distilled from the daily: Living the Rule of St. Benedict today","review":"In the last chapter of her book, Wisdom Distilled from the Daily, Joan Chittister describes the glass doors leading into her monastery's chapel and their affect on the worshiper. She says, \\"From the altar...the foyer is a clear view. From the foyer, the altar makes a magnetic center. Each is to the other a necessity. \\" This picture sums up the Rule of St. Benedict, a way of life that positions everyday people like you and me in a place of attentiveness to the Holy Spirit, even as we live in the real world, outside the doors of the chapel. The way of life Chittister describes is a response to the heavy sigh of generations, translated so well by songwriter Bruce Cockburn in a line that says, \\"Sometimes the best map will not guide you. \\" The Benedictine way of life is not a formula for better living. Rather, it is the product of a life lived together by early Benedictine monks, and reflects a posturing of the heart that is still needed for life lived together today. Some of the Benedictine practices Chittister describes include regular prayer and Scripture reading, with the chief aim of encountering God and being changed in His presence; cultivating balance between rest and work; developing a heart that obediently listens to God and humbly listens to people; and stability, that \\"willingness to grow where I am \\" even when relationships get hard and commitment is no longer romantic. These practices will not provide a quick fix, but for those willing to engage with the Lord through Chittister's literary offering, the \\"Rule of Benedict...takes the dust and clay of everyday and turns it into beauty.\\""},{"Title":"Wisdom distilled from the daily: Living the Rule of St. Benedict today","review":"Wisdom Distilled From the Daily: Living the Rule of St. Benedict Today, by Joan Chittister, seeks to restate the Rule of St. Benedict in language that modern readers can understand.

She sets up four overarching principles to living the Rule well: life balance, a call to follow the gospel, an openness to the wisdom of others, and a focus on community and not only oneself.By discussing key areas of Listening, Prayer, Community, Humility, Monastic Mindfulness, Work, Leisure, Giftedness, Hospitality, Obedience, Stability, Monastic Practices, Peace, and Monastic Vision, Chittister brings a simple, yet powerful perspective on true spirituality.

Using the ancient Rule of St. Benedict as a springboard, Chittister brings the idea of a spiritual life into the contemporary world. Each chapter addresses a different principle found in the Rule of St. Benedict such as prayer, community life, hospitality, obedience, and peace, among others. Her goal is to show that the spiritual life is not above and beyond all but the most pious religious individuals. Spirituality can be practiced every day by everyone in every situation. To Chittister, Christian spirituality is more than prayer and Bible reading. It is hard work and deep rest. It is awareness of others and mindfulness of self. It is the search for peace in a world at war and the gentle care of the planet.A common element throughout the book is life in community. In most every chapter, Chittister spends some time reminding the reader of the importance of living not in an individualistic manner as is common especially in the United States, but in community with each other. This is both a great strength to the book as well as an area of critique. At times there seems to be a slight disconnect between the principle set forth in the beginning of the chapter (i.e. Obedience) and the content of the chapter itself (i.e. life in community). However, this disconnect does not ultimately harm Chittister's message. It merely shows just how important she considers life in community to be."},{"Title":"Wisdom distilled from the daily: Living the Rule of St. Benedict today","review":"\`Daily life is the stuff of which high sanctity can be made.'Near the beginning of Joan Chittister's wonderful treatment of the Rule of St. Benedict, she makes this statement, something that is agreed upon by most who are serious about the spiritual life. The old phrase 'little things mean a lot' is very true with regard to spirituality. After all, it is not the big crises that cause the most problems in life -- in fact, it is often a crisis that brings people together and deepens spiritual feeling and commitment. It is in the day-to-day struggle to maintain sanity and security that the spirit can be ignore most easily, unless paying attention to spiritual things is made intentional.This is part of what Benedict was driving at so many centuries ago. Beyond the specific rules for his community, which are variously applicable and irrelevant toward living in today's world, is the overarching idea that some kind of rule, some kind of daily intentionality, some sort of deliberate pattern that puts us in community with each other and with the divine is very necessary for today's people.\`After years of monastic life I have discovered that unlike spiritual fads, which come and go with the teachers or cultures that spawned them, the Rule of Benedict looks at the world through interior eyes and lasts. Here, regardless of who we are or what we are, life and purpose meet.'Spirituality of this sort is far more than ritual action. It is far more than churchiness or how often one does any particular thing, including prayer. This spirituality calls upon the individual to incorporate a way of life on top of daily life, a defining context of life that puts all things, prayer, church, family, work, play, study, sleep, indeed all parts of life, in connection and community with God.There are interior practices and exterior reflections of these practices. Listening is described as the key virtue toward spiritual growth. Listening has to be more than a passive hearing of what is being said, but an active incorporation into life.Prayer is a central practice, but care must be taken that this not become routine in the sense of being done mindlessly, by rote, but an active listening for the will of God should always be part of this. Also connected to prayer is the practice of lectio, a reading that inspires and feeds the soul, a reading that is different from academic study or informational and entertaining reading.Chittister highlights many monastic practices and shows ways in which these can be incorporated into daily life for anyone. Monastic mindfulness -- the blending of the day together in harmony and balance -- can be a principle applied as easily outside the monastery as within the cloister. Certainly the ideas of obedience (to the will of God, if nothing else), stability (which means more than living in the same place), hospitality, humility, and community all are applicable beyond the monastery walls, and in many ways antithetical to prevailing Western cultural ideas. These have the potential of feeding the soul and enriching the lives of those who practice even without the support of a monastic community. Many have been surprised that their conversion of life, to use Benedictine language, can lead to subtle, and often not-so-subtle, changes in those around them.The seeker asked, 'How does one seek union with God?'The Wise One said, 'The harder you seek, the more distance you create between God and you.''So what does one do about the distance?' the seeker asked.The elder replied simply, 'Just understand that it isn't there.'The Rule of Benedict is not a mystical text. It is not a spiritual catalogue or occult-ic manual. It was intended, and continues to serve, as a simple guide to help make people more conscious of their already present relationship with God. It is realistic, and makes no promises of spiritual gifts accruing to those who follow it. Yet the riches that do become present can be very great to those open to receiving them. And in receiving these gifts, they become a gift themselves to the world.Perhaps this is the meaning of the strange biblical dictum (which often seems unfair upon straight reading)For to those who have, more will be given,and they will have an abundance;but from those who have nothing,even what they have will be taken away.- Matthew 13:12This is a book that definitely fills a need for those seeking a more wholistic way of life."},{"Title":"Wisdom distilled from the daily: Living the Rule of St. Benedict today","review":"Chittister has a gift of explaining St. Benedict's rule in terms moderns and postmoderns can readily understand.

This charming book, though nearly ten years old, is as fresh as the day it was written. &quot;Wisdom Distilled from the Daily&quot; is a timely and welcome guide for all who seek moments of grace and personal spiritual growth in and from their daily lives. Each of the fifteen short chapters is prefaced by a direct citation from the 1500 year old Rule of St. Benedict. Each begins with a description of some physical characteristic of the Mount St. Benedict Monastery in Erie, Pennsylvania, home of her religious community, to whom Chittister dedicates the book. The author uses each of these concrete realities from in daily life in her monastery as a root metaphor which she breaks open in flowing, nearly-musical prose to reveal the timeless wisdom of Benedict on such topics as Listening, Prayer, Work, Humility, and (my personal favorite) &quot;Holy Leisure&quot;. But this is not a book about monasticism. St. Benedict was a layman. While his Rule has been adopted and used by monastic brothers and sisters of various religious orders since the sixth century, it was meant to be a spiritual guide for all -- particularly lay persons. More importantly, its purpose is to help us build our spirituality from the bricks and mortar of the lived experiences of our daily lives. The author reminds us that we can find sanctity in the world around us: &quot;If we are not spiritual where we are and as we are, we are not spiritual at all&quot;. This book is a gem! It is an easy read. If you think highly enough of someone to want them to read it also, buy them a copy. Don't lend them yours. This one is a &quot;keeper&quot; you will want to refer to frequently.

Prayer is not...&quot; and so on. Also, a minor linguistic point: she tends to start each chapter with an image, relate the image to the topic, discuss the topic, and then return to the image. This is fine for occasional use, but grates on repetition. Also, those not familiar with Christianity, especially with monastic communities might want to do some background reading first, as some of the images are quite specific.

SynopsisChittister believes that the everyday life of every person contains wisdom, truth, beauty, potential, and perhaps even God. But it's not her idea, at least originally. The Rule of St. Benedict, penned by a humble 4th century monk, has for centuries served as the corner-stone text and instruction manual for the Benedictine religious order, and now reemerges as the basis of Chittester's \\"Wisdom.\\"In short, the Rule is a guide to Christian spirituality that at its roots emphasizes balance, community and a lifetime of personal conversion. It is simple in that it is for everyone, regardless of education and status. It is comprehensive in that it proposes a complete way of life. Finally, the Rule is realistic: it advances balance between work and leisure, promising only peace at the end of a life of trying yet not necessarily accomplishing.Chittester's frames the highlights of the Rule in an effort to guide 20th century Christians in the ways of ancient monastics. She begins simply with the core skills of Benedictine living: listening, and prayer or lectio. Listening means living with ears attuned to the call of Christ (to Benedictines, this is represented in a Monastery bell), thus creating a spirituality sentient of the presence of God in our lives and also the presence of others. Prayer and lectio, the act of prayerful meditation on scripture, for the listening Christian then becomes the center of life. It is regular, universal, reflective, communal and converting (p. 29) thus cracking open the door and letting God enter daily life. In both disciplines, Chittester begins the introduction of the reader to two fundamental yet often counterintuitive concepts of Benedictine spirituality 1) individual growth out of community investment and 2) the tension of change through pause (the opposite of what U2 might call \\"running to stand still\\").From the here the discussion moves to the characteristics or virtues of Benedictine monasticism. These include humility, community, hospitality, wholeness, work, and holy leisure, and in each, Chittister suggests creative and often radically new definitions. Community is synonymous with love and personal development. Here love (i.e. the community) costs and it demands but without it, man is only half alive. She states profoundly, \\"Alone I am what I am, but in community, I am what I can become (p. 49).\\" Humility is a lost and misunderstood virtue. Contrary to common definition, the Rule says humility allows for people to be happy with what they do well, as long as they don't exalt themselves to positions of power over others. Here the difficulties of both historic Christianity (i.e. grandiose medieval Cathedrals) and the fine-lines of the balance within the Rule are addressed head on, yet not totally resolved.Discussions of harmony, wholeness, work, leisure follow and further underscore the Rule's notion of a balanced life that embraces the small, daily and often picayune opportunities to improve the world and the individual. Finally, hospitality and the importance of recognizing the gifts of individuals, and the need to \\"bloom where planted\\" (i.e. stability) are developed as Benedictine virtues.What has been conspicuously absent from this book up to this point are specific prescriptions, do's and don't's if you will, for Christian living. And it seems somewhat unnecessary, even paltry when Chittister finally devotes a later chapter to monastic practices. Although these practices are consistent with the bulk of the Rule, they do not hold a preeminent place in the text. Meaning, they are examples of what someone committed to the Rule on a daily basis would naturally evince, almost like a virtue ethic. Although this may be frustrating for 20th century readers who are accustomed to 12 step programs and bullet point memorandums, it is wholly instep with the Rule according to Chittester. The book ends with a final promise of peace. At the end of a life that never arrives but is always arriving, that struggles to grow and not conquer, peace comes to the enlightened and faithful.II. CritiqueChittester deals with the vague and nuanced notions of balance and tension in the Rule deftly. She uses approachable language and simple examples, both from her life in the monastery and from secular sources. She artfully structures the chapters in a way consistent with practical application: we are introduced to basic skills, then virtues and finally, big picture results. Moreover, she exhibits a good bit of humor and interesting writing, particularly in the use of ancient axioms, anecdotes and stories straight from the original Rule. Who could forget the John the Dwarf (p. 150), or a senior monk affronted by a withheld fig (p. 123) or the go-ahead-make-my-day monastic who wouldn't bat an eyelash at being \\"run through\\" by a big talking swordsman (p. 184).Where \\"Wisdom\\" perhaps falls short is in Chittister's (at times unconscious) use of a highly evolved sense of perception and spiritual connectedness. The reader feels somewhat left out as Chittister recalls how the stain glass windows in the monastery chapel \\"tear at her soul\\" or how a well-hung crucifix reminders her of so many cosmic reassurances. Truly, these are symbols of a faith and for the lifelong faithful they point to wealth of memories. Yet it is her success as a contemplative and cloistered nun that renders some of her ruminations too sophisticated for the laity."},{"Title":"Wisdom distilled from the daily: Living the Rule of St. Benedict today","review":"As a member of Sr. Joan's community, readers often ask, &quot;Is that really true?

Perhaps Joan's greatest gift is being able to find the beauty, the inspirational, the grace in every day events, places, etc...even in a Benedictine monastery..or ESPECIALLY in a Benedictine monastery. Equally challenging is to take a 1500 year old spiritual document and try to make sense of it at this time in history, in this culture, for us. Joan does a wonderful job, but after all she was a Benedictine prioress for 12 years, so she should know the life and be able to interpret it. And she does."},{"Title":"Wisdom distilled from the daily: Living the Rule of St. Benedict today","review":"In this remarkable book, Sister Joan Chittister filters the wisdom of St. Benedict through her own monastic experience to produce an inspiring guide to centering, focusing, and leading a life of meaning and integrity in today's world. Her message transcends religious and ideological specificity; her writing manages to be direct and luminous at the same time. I, as a non-Christian, was both deeply moved and inspired."},{"Title":"Wisdom distilled from the daily: Living the Rule of St. Benedict today","review":"The Catholic Church has a tradition of conferring the title of \\"doctor,\\" upon people posthumorously, who have contributed much to others' learning of faith. The more I read from Joan Chittister, the greater the impression I have that I am reviewing the work of a living doctor.In regards to one of the reviews that labeled some of the information in the book as slightly dated, I am at a loss for where such a shortcoming occurred. The books deals with the timeles issue of spirituality, and I felt that all of the refferences she made were pertinent to any time, including the present.In regards for a comment made by a reviewer that referred to Chittister as \\"Sr. Issues,\\" which implied that she bemoans the status of women, true she mentions situations in which women's lives have obstacles to spirituality, some of which are institutionally impsoed, but no less often than tshe mentions men, and the poor and the rich. And she would be religiously irresponsible if she neglected to cite examples of where people could implement gospel teachings to address some of the social ills or \\"issues\\" that our confronts our society today.In short, this is a book for everyone, to inspire and uplift all readers and to provide guidance to everyone for how to develop a spiritual life. It is full of lucid observations such as her distinction between praying people and spiritual people \\"There is nothing easier than to lead people down the path of prayer forms without ever asking them what goes on inside them as a result. At the end, consequently it is possible to get a praying person; it is not alwyas possibel to get a spiritual person. Praying people get their prayers in and wait for God somehow miraculously to deliver them from their private deomns. Spiritual people expect the demons. What they look for is a way to find God even there.\\"The book is written in reference to a Christian document, but the guidelines are not exclusive for Christians. Chittister's view, based on her interpretation of the Rule of St. Benedict, is that spirituality can not be developed in a vacuum, only through prayer, or only through attending church, or only through working with people, but that needs to be honed through balancing all aspects of life.Balance is the key. She elaborates on different facets of life that one should listen to and conduct attentively in order to realize enlightenment. She does not offer exact perscriptions for what dosage of each component a person needs, because the requirements depend on a person's individual situation and needs.Among these components are daily spiritual reading (\\"lectio\\") with an attitude of seeking \\"not so much and attempt to know God in history or Jesus in Israel as much as it is an attempt to know God in my life and Jesus in me;\\" contemplation, as \\"not a vacation from life.Contemplation is the pursuit of meaning...Those who find the will of God every where and feel the presence of God any where are the real contemplatives;\\" spiritual prayer; applying the gospel to all decisions in life such as what you buy and how your work; developing a sense of community with your neighbors, your colleagues and your family(a key center piece of which is a family meal).Benedictine spirituality focuses much on interactions of people with each other and their environemt; listening to God's voice and learning to recognize it in every one you meet, and every event that occurs. It is an ideal framework for people today who do not live as hermits because it is based on the idea of a members of a community receiving reinforcement from the group for their weeknesses and sharing their strengths with the group. A community can be found any where.I found the book beautiful and inspiring and would recommend it to any one who is looking for a resource that will help them with spiritual growth and the art of discerning God's voice. The tone is easy and converstional, and provides a flexible blue print for the pursuit of spirituality in any type of life style."},{"Title":"Wisdom distilled from the daily: Living the Rule of St. Benedict today","review":"This is one of them. Every page is filled with peace and wisdom. I found this book, of course, \\"by accident\\" (that is, by the grace of God) just at the time my extraordinarily holy Catholic parish priest and spiritual director was discerning whether or not to become a Benedictine monk. This book will deepen my life, i'm sure of it. A good companion book, at least for me, is Jean-Pierre de Caussade's \\"Abandonment to Divine Providence.\\""},{"Title":"Wisdom distilled from the daily: Living the Rule of St. Benedict today","review":"I had to read this for a summer internship, and I found it very helpful. It made me think on my own and sparked good discussions. Chittister's theme seems always to be &quot;slow down and listen&quot; something I can always hear again."},{"Title":"Wisdom distilled from the daily: Living the Rule of St. Benedict today","review":"Spirituality can be a somewhat ambiguous word that is difficult to put into simple words or phrases. However, this book, based on the ancient decrees of St. Benedict written over fifteen hundred years ago, accomplishes this task by providing a clear and concise description of the components of what spirituality should entail. Chittister highlights all of the significant topics of a healthy spiritual life including prayer, obedience, humility and praxis. She is able to convey, through a seemingly antiquated way of life, a compelling and thought provoking challenge - to live a life with meaning and purpose, just as God had intended for us all. As I was reading this book, there were times when I thought she was describing a situation that had little relevance to today's society. Then she would succinctly tie Benedictine spirituality into the ways of our current lives, whether you were married with children, single, grounded in faith or exploring faith for the first time. She periodically interjects what can be best described as monastic parables to make her point. These parables are highly informative and quite entertaining at the same time. Much to my delight, Chittister grounds many of her thoughts in scripture, calling us to put on the mind of Christ and encouraging us to live our lives in light of the Gospel. Most importantly, by reading this book I was able to shed many of my preconceived ideas of ancient, highly structured religious dogmas as being irrelevant. This book has challenged me to reconsider my presuppositions that all early church doctrine is irrelevant in today's spirituality, what I originally wanted to resist I eventually embraced. I found myself acknowledging content of the book as being beneficial for a heightened spirituality through practical application with respect to Christian Ethics, pastoral care and evangelizing. I hope and pray others who read this book will be enlightened by the people of faith who have dedicated their total being to the Rule of St. Benedict and have the stories of changed lives to show for their faithfulness."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"this will mess with your head. most books are good for the mind.

It builds very rapidly at first, and then the intensity seems to drop off quite a bit. I didn't really care much for the villain, the Jaffe, as he wasn't nearly as interesting as Dowd in Imajica or Shadwell in Weaveworld. Still, any prose by Barker is better than 99% of the crap published these days, and the ending makes finishing the novel worthwhile. One key point to note is that most American readers will find that Clive Barker's commentary on American &quot;pop&quot; or &quot;junk&quot; culture is not as dead on as Stephen King's endeavors."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This is definitley one book they should make into a movie!!"},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I have read, almost, the whole Clive Barker collection and in my opinion, this is his BEST!

This would have to be the best piece of literature I have ever read. Clive Barker can truly paint a picture with words. I love the erotic mystery and the struggle that evolves as the story unfolds. I could not put the book down, it is definitely a book that you only read when you don't have to go to work next day. After reading Great and Secret Show, I was addicted to Barker.

This book takes you on a ride through the lives of numerous deeply developed characters and the hauntingly chilling (and thrilling) ways that their lives are entangled through the &quot;art&quot;. Although is may seem starnge that you haven't heard of his work, Barker is arguably the best storyteller that this generation has had access to. His stories are beautiful, horrifying, erotic, suspenseful, and believable at the same time. This is also, most likely, his best work. This book can easily consume your life, and when it is finished, it feels as though you have been in another place living another life. That is the work of a great story teller, which Barker certainly is. &quot;The Great and Secret Show&quot; is the best of his stories."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I passed this book on to my dentist, an avid and discriminating reader to whom I always bring my finished novels at check-up time. His first remark was, &quot;I don't read horror novels.&quot; Before he could get his hands in my mouth, I made my case for this book...Forget the generic classification. This is a story from the most original and creative novelist I have encountered in many years. Just start reading with an open mind. Soon you will not put it down.Other reviewers have described what they can of it, so I will only mention my reaction upon finishing it. Remember how you felt after certain original Star Trek episodes - a kind of hope against hope in the seemingly impossible? That is what I felt, however fleetingly - I wished it were true, that I could explore these places and meet these beings. And it started me wondering about this and that...and I can't find higher praise for a novel or novelist than that fact.My dentist, though still sceptical, did accept the book and I hope he takes the plunge and enjoys it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"First of all I'd like to say that I am absolutely fascinated by Clive Barker, his writings and his images. Once I saw a documentary about him, in which his drawings of various monsters were shown, they were awesome. What's more, he said he just saw these images in his mind; he didn't think them up, he just saw them! After I read Imajica and saw Clive in the flesh when he was visiting the premiere of 'Lord of Illusions' here in Amsterdam, I just knew I would always try to keep track of whatever he's doing. Now, about the book. It's the second Clive Barker I've read, and although I liked Imajica better, I was again anxious to finish the book as well as 'scared' of finishing it and returning from this dreamlike world to my everyday world. I love Barker's sense of humour, and he writes in such a way that the occurring events aren't as unthinkable as they were before you started reading the book. My favourite part of the book is probably the shaping of the Jaffe's terata, and the dreaming up of the town's people favourite people, from tv or real life. I especially liked the idea of William Witt's house full of copulating pornstars, entertaining themselves with his huge collection of bow ties. Anyway, I would have given this book 5 stars if it wasn't for Imajica which I liked better. And if you somehow get to read this Clive, come visit Amsterdam again sometime soon."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"My first foray into the world of clive barker was this 600+ page passage that, I feel, could have said as much in half the space. The story was very fresh, unique and interesting, as well as dark and twisted. I enjoyed plunging into the corruptness of souls and their covetous desires. Sometimes character development lagged for major the characters. The first 1/3 of the book read like a nascar race, the remainder, a rush-hour traffic jam! Anyway, it was entertaining enough to read cover to cover, as well as peek my desire for number two. To his credit, Mr. Barker has created his own genre."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"_Randolph Jaffe was a man at the end of his rope. He hungered to be a big man, a king, yet all his life he had never managed to rise higher than a private in the ranks as he passed from job to job. At 37 he felt that time was running out. Now he had a dead end job in the central Dead Letter Office of the U.S. Postal Service. Yet, even here his brutal, vulgar coworkers and supervisor left him no peace. He found himself forced to participate in systematic looting of unclaimed mail for money and valuables. As he did this day after day he seriously began to contemplate suicide._Then, as he started to read the letters that he was opening he discovered, slowly, that the world was not what it seemed- not even remotely. Here and there, certain people hinted at a world behind the world, a Sea of Seas, the Shoal, Quiddity- and the Art._One day, Jaffe found a medallion in the mail- and everything changed. What had first been synchronicity in his life as he deciphered the mystery, now turned to direct supernatural power. This was a power that Jaffe never should have possessed. He was a petty, unworthy, little man that had learned nothing from his own maltreatment by others. He used the power from the start to murder and exploit. Yet, he hungered for even more power to remake the world to serve his ego._Unfortunately, this would create all sorts of problems for the guardians who were worthy of the secrets of the Art...."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"\\"The Great And Secret Show\\" is a novel that is at turns fascinating, horrifying, and (unfortunately) disappointing.The first part of the novel is great, with Randolph Jaffe slowly unravelling the mysteries of the secret society called the Shoal and the pathway to the Art, a type of magic that can allow one to enter the dreams of humanity.After discovering the power of the Nuncio and being changed (along with Fletcher) we get some great scenes showing the scope of their battle through time and space, culminating in the Society of Virgins' fateful swim in the lake above the caverns.After that point, however, things slow to a crawl. The final showdown between Jaffe (now \\"the Jaff\\") and Fletcher never materializes, and the terata and hallucigenia - their fevered creations - never really battle either.The plot involving Howie, Tommy-Ray, and Jo-Beth fizzles without much resolution. In fact the whole last third of the novel is thrown into chaos by the arrival of new characters (Tesla, Grillo, Vance, Harry D'Amour) where none was necessary. Also, Barker inserts a twist which puts the Jaff on the side of \\"good\\" just as he was about to achieve his evil aims. This bizarre and unnecessary contortion of the story wrecks any suspense or momentum that had been building.Barker introduces a new threat when his orginal baddie (Jaffe) would have been more than adequate. Tommy-Ray's plot also goes off the rails...it seems as though Barker completely lost control of the sub-plot and then just cobbled something together as best he could at the end.The Art, when it does make its appearance, is quite anti-climatic. Quiddity is interesting, but Ephemeris turns out to be bland and unexciting, instead of the promised center of \\"the great and secret show\\". By that point, most readers will probably be daydreaming about other shows...network TV ones.Brilliant premise, exciting start, but a last third which reminds one of a train running out of steam a long, long way from the station."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"If you enjoy books by Stephen King, you should experience a book by Clive Barker. The Great and Secret Show by all means is my favorite books of his all time. It really entraps you!"},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I have always enjoyed Clive Barker's writing. His writing is not necessarily \\"horror\\" in the Lovecraft sense of things. He is more mythical in his writings, and the horror that does come comes subtle and sublime. The Great and Secret Show is just that, all the myths and whispers that underline the American facade. It, and its sequel, work together to present the ideas that would happen if Carl Jung's writings became physical and tied intuitively with the United States across the decades and the peoples. The characters are not so black and white that you know exactly how they will react in the next scene, though there are some that could be classified as good and evil. If you want horror, pure horror, go for Stephen King. He is as good as it gets, when he hits the right book (such as The Stand, Salem's Lot, and the Dark Tower series). Clive Barker is more dark fairytale, tied together with the mythos of the United States. That is really what the Art series is about, in my opinion. There is only one problem with the Clive Barker books I've read, especially those proposed to be series. He doesn't seem to know how to finish his series. The Art series has been around for more than a decade and a half, and he still hasn't written book three, the final book in the trilogy. Same thing with the Galilee series, book two hasn't even hit drawing board from what I can tell...then there are several other series that he's started that don't seem to be completed. I think that it isn't that Clive Barker doesn't know how to finish, I think that his problem is that he has too good of an intelligence and imagination and he has trouble fitting the puzzle pieces together. Still. I highly suggest that the bright person out there read most of Clive's books. They are well worth the time and effort. I have to say that if I had to nail five books that have influenced my thoughts and considerations over the years, Great and Secret Show will be one of them."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This is not a precision-crafted novel. It rambles on for an extra 200 pages, and it should have been compacted before publication. To enjoy it, think H. P. Lovecraft reincarnated in the eighties, and remember that this is essentially a comic novel that ends with a hundred-page trip-out sequence.In spite of these defects, it was a low-stress read without the onslaught of cheesy cliffhangers that are so common in pulp fiction, and I held out to the end, not without a certain guilty pleasure."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I read this one about 11 years ago, along with the second book of the art, Everville, I have remembered these well all these years, these are stories and characters that are hard to forget. I just read them again, wanting to see if they were as good as I remembered, and they were even better! Clive Barker is one of my favorite Authors ever, and these stand the test of time as some of the best books ever written by him or any other person. Along with both books of Imajica, these are some of the best books you could ever read. I wish I could give them more than five stars!"},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"According to wiki, Barker admitted that this was the hardest book he'd ever written. I do think a times it shows as the narrative is sometimes disorganized, though it's obvious there was a hell of a lot to keep up with in this book. Only because of some of the story felt disjointed did I give four stars...Which means it's still a very good book. I'll do the best I can explaining the plot: Nearly twenty years before most of the story takes place, a man working in a \\"dead-letter office,\\" at the crossroads of America, starts to discover hints and clues in these letters to something called \\"The Art\\". This man, Randolph Jaffe, enlists the help of a highly intelligent man(named Fletcher) who specializes in evolutionary studies. Flecther is also addictied to mescaline, and Jaffe is always there to suply the habit. They set off to create \\"The Nuncio\\", basically something that will take the human mind to levels further than ever possible. Once it is created, Fletcher seeks destroy it, knowing it's evil, Jaffe seeks to prevent him from doing so. This begins a long power sruggle between the two that last two decades and affects very many people along the way.Barker has one of, if not the most, profound imaginations I've ever read. His stories which blend horror and fantasy are incredibly imaginative and always welll written. In addition, you can always expect a few scenes that will make your stomach turn and blow your mind.

His books not only capativate your imagination, they take a life of their own, demanding your all and nothing less."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"There are few writers who can create the utterly horrifying sequences that Barker creates on a regular basis in his writing. But his unerring ability to find just the right combination of repulsion and terror is often undermined by his meandering plots and the ridiculous themes often found in his work. This novel is just that combination of suspense and horror coupled with an unfathomable story that makes Barker such an infuriating writer for me. I keep reading his work because I am fascinated by this dichotomy. Explaining where this novel goes is rather pointless; starting with a deranged postal worker and a scientist who has partaken a bit too often from his collection of hallucinogenic pharmaceuticals leading to the ultimate battle of good where shadow monsters fight old TV characters...I think you get the picture. It's hard to take things too seriously when the characters start to talk about the metaphysical aspects of what faces them: \\"The Quiddity is not really a sea, the Ephemeris is not really an island,\\" among other shining examples of meta-philosophical babble.(Yes I know it's out of context, but it doesn't work much better when you're reading it.) Look, I get it, but it just doesn't hold together. I'll keep reading Barker; his writing is often stunning and some of his sequences will stick with you for a long time; I'll just keep hoping for a more coherent story."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"Barker provides us with an electrifying and engrossing tale.This is not science fiction and is barely a fantasy. Its roots seem closer to surrealism and to the drawings of H.R. Giger. Barker wrote the introduction for Giger's Necronomicon, and in doing so revealed his own values, which are central to the narration of The Great and Secret Show.It may seem flippant, but The Great and Secret Show is a unique fantasy that seems close in its architecture to Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind. Mitchell wrote a masterpiece of human characterization. We all know people like the characters she drew, and we can accurately predict how they will respond in the situations they find themselves. What Barker has done is give us attitudes, moods, and powerful feelings, especially jealousy and resentment, which are personified by the characters in a way that engages our minds almost obsessively.There's a Shakespearean strength and mastery of human personality in The Great and Secret Show. It even hints and warns us, with an almost humorous wisdom, about the critical differences between the gods and mortals. He lectures us, very convincingly, that the isles of Ephemeris and the far side of the Sea of Quiddity are and should be beyond us."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"As I said I loved it 20 yrs ago & still love it now.

If you are looking for something creepy, fun and smart then look no further. Everybody I know who read this, loved it. Barker does an absolutely perfect job of baiting our curiosity. He hones in on the sense we all have, that there is more to our daily lives- something bigger. He uses that basic premise to lure us into learning more about his secret dimension lurking close by. Its addictive."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I don't believe words alone can do justice to not only this novel, but the man responsible for its making. I read a Clive Barker interview several years ago where he says he loves working with big canvases- the bigger the canvas, the more possibilities there are to create, and create he does!There is a big, sprawling canvas set out before you here when you read this book. The characters pull you in with them, making you feel what they feel, see what they see, hear what they hear. The description of the other worlds, and the mysterious sea of Quiddity really hooked me.Perhaps its most redeeming value is the fact that so many different strands of ideas are tossed in and jumbled up that you think he will screw up, you think there is no possible way of ending this, not without calling for a Deus Ex Machina- but he has an ace up his sleeve that he lets slide out at the perfect moment, bringing the First Book of the Art to a close.What is very upsetting, though, is to know that Everville, the second book, is no longer in print. Which is why I am thankful I have found it through a used book dealer. The only other negative aspect of all this is to wait for the third installment to come out...and when it comes out, knowing that there won't be anymore of it."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I own all of Mr. Barker's works. I have read his books in days as well as weeks. I have read King, Lumley, Koontz, and others. But none of them can compare with the tapestry that Mr. Barker was woven in this novel. The characters have been so fleshed that you can also most smell them sweat. The mythology that he has created seems real. You WILL lose yourself in the myth. The plot twists are monumental and breathtaking. The worlds that he takes us to are the stuff of dreams and nightmares. This book held me from begining to end. I have since read it three more times. No small feat. Each time the novel becomes more my favorite work of his. I was so taken with this book that when Everville came out I stood in line to purchase one of the first copies. I only wish that I could say the same for that novel that I have said for this one. I can only hope that the third book of the Art is better. That the third book is of the same caliber as this masterpiece. I truly believe that this work is his apex. His later books, with the exception of his published plays, pale in comparison.

The two characters comeface to face in a confrontation unequalled in a story of thisgenre.If you hate picking up a book and reading, only to realize thatyou're late for work because you were up all night reading it,this book is not for you; but if you enjoy the twisted plotsthat Barker is so famous for, a story line that presses on untilthe end...then you will enjoy a Great and Secret Show."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I'm a big fan of Clive Barker. His imagination is abstract enough to make some people dismiss him with contept, while others like me take pleasure in the ability to wander through his world and explore whats on offer.The aspects Clive puts in his books run through theologys religions and belief systems across the world, and in a way the reader can get under there skin in a world of fiction which can then be left as the book shuts, giving the experience without the complications which adhering to the systems that flow through his writting demand if you choose that way of life. Its escapism, in its best form. Alternative realities, normal people becoming... well, just Becoming.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I am really enjoying this book, read some of the reviews, it's just as I expected."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"while the book is great for it's epic capacity & fine writing, i found the book to be very deep & philosophical dealing with the myriad corridors of the human mind. this book is not a gruseome horror novel but it keeps you coming back for more & it keeps you engaged while you read it. however, it may be a bit too deep for some people but you won't know unless you dive in."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This is the first Clive Barker book I have ever read &amp; I can say it won't be the last. This is a excellent &amp; different story with great character &amp; plot development. This book is unpredictable and moves smoothly making it difficult to put down. This is a must read book."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"My first impression of Clive Barker was that he was just a plain old horror writer. That label kind of kept me away from his books. But, for a lack of anything else to read, I picked up The Great and Secret Show. That was the best decision I could have ever made in choosing a book. Clive's style of writing is so amazing. He makes Dean Koontz and Stephen King look like children's book authors. Barker's a very literate man, and it shows in his writing. The flowing dialogue and beautifully described worlds captured me from the get go. The character development, fantastic storyline, and just the overall feeling of this book makes it one of Clive's finest. I recommend this book to anyone in need of a story that will completely shock you, seduce you, scare you, and just completely envelop you!!!! Totally amazing!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"After reading Weaveworld, I thought Clive Barker would be my fantasy novelist of preference. The Great and Secret Show had its moments of ephiphany like WW, but not enough for its hundreds and hundreds of pages. Maybe I just didn't get it, but at the same time, you should not have to read three hundred pages into any book to realize you are wasting your time. But committed, I read on and in the end enjoyed the epic, vowing never to read Barker again"},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"Considering I love Barkers style, imagination, ability... (hmmm, obsessed fan I am not, I promise) and The Great and Secret Show definately showcased his talents (and fairly early in his career...)However, there is a good bit of gratuitous sex. I first read this book when I was 11... and I wouldn't let my 11-year old read it (if I had an 11-yr old!).If you are looking for something different, here's where you should start looking. This book is strange, imaginative, different...Just read it!!"},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ (the only books that come close are other Barker novels.) Don't let the other bad reviews fool you (they just bring down the review average from 5 stars to 4 and half) This book does take some serious thought, but it's well worth it and if you've spent most of your time reading Stephen, Dean and Anne, you'll never want to go back. By the way, if you decide to order this, you'd better order Everville because Everville isn't really a sequel, it's the middle of this great story (and Clive says the end will be put out soon and it will be huge.)"},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"barker's writing style is every bit as laudable as his imagination. \\"the great and secret show\\" stands among his finest achievements, with \\"imajica\\" and \\"the books of blood\\" trailing shortly behind. for anyone who's a fan of weird fiction or dark fantasy this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"In the Omaha\\"Dead Letter\\" office sits Jaffe. In America's lost letters he stumbles across a secret world and learns of the Art. He begins journy to learn the Art and the key to Quiddity, the dreamland that inspires all man kind. Jaffe finds a man named Fletcher to help him create the Nuncio, a mix of science and magic that forever changes both men and starts a war between good and evil that will threaten Quiddity's dreamshore and unleash the nightmares that lie beyond. This book is epic from beginning to end and is full of great characters (Tesla Bombeck is my favorite). And it's amazingly imaginative... Clive Barker's imagination gives horrors from snakes made out of a crazy man's feces and seamen to holes torn in reality to reveal the hidden dreamworld and the apocolypes beyond. I can't recommend this book more."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I have been a Clive Barker fan for a long time now and i've never read one of his books and not enjoyed it. The great and secret show is less old fashioned horror and more fantasy although it still has some quality scares in it. The imagination and concepts Barker has in this book are almost theological in scope and will definately absorb a thinking reader. The story worked well and kept me involved till the end. I am looking forward to reading Everville now as a sequal to this book. You will not be dissapointed with this book or with any Clive Barker book."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I keep coming back to this novel every few years. It is a stunning story that is incredibly unique and immersive. Even after several readings it keeps me on the edge of my chair eager for what will happen."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I've been a huge fan of Clive Barker since I was in middle school, but it had been a long time since I'd revisited his books. I picked up a copy of \\"The Great and Secret Show\\" recently to re-read, and was amazed at how well this book hold up. The imagination on display is simply astounding, and I love how epic this novel is. I can't wait to finish this again, and take a journey back to \\"Everville.\\" A must read for Barker fans!"},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"In The Great and Secret Show, one of the great storytellers brings us the first volume of the Art Trilogy, taking readers to a place they've never been before. This book is not a fantasy book, not a horror novel, or a science fiction story; and at the same time it's all these and much more. Barker takes you to a new plane of existence in The Great and Secret Show where you'll laugh and cry, smile and scream; where unimaginable horrors and triumphs await!Randolphe Jaffe is a loser who's going nowhere fast, that is until he gets a job for the post office working in the dead letter room in Omaha, Nebraska - the nexus of the country where all lost and undeliverable mail ends up. Going through thousands of pieces of undelivered mail per day - money and everything of value is surrendered to his boss - he begins finding clues of an undiscovered power in existence beneath the realm of society. It takes time, but he puts the pieces together until he has a good idea of this power known as the Art, where he then receives a medallion, the very symbol of the Art. While it means little to him at first, he knows it is an important piece of the puzzle. Naturally, his boss wants the item and it is then that Jaffe takes the first step down his new path and kills the man in cold blood.Collecting the important evidence together, with the medallion, he travels across America, living on the whim of the Art, letting it guide him where it will. Innocent bystanders are used by him, sensing the power of the Art and agreeing to whatever Jaffe tells them. It is in an alcohol- and drug-infused stupor that Jaffe conducts his pilgrimage into the desert and finds the Loop: a place out of time, and meets Kissoon, the last member of the Shoal. The Shoal was the group appointed to protect the Art. For the world is part of the Cosm, and beyond this is the Metacosm where the sea of Quiddity lies - a place visited by all when they are born, the night with their first love, and when they die - and within Quiddity lies the island of Ephemeris, the dream land. More importantly at the far edge of the Metacosm lie the Iad Uroborus, a great evil that is always looking to consume the Cosm. The Art is a way of getting to Quiddity. Kissoon tells Jaffe that he must occupy his body so he can leave the Loop and defend the Cosm. Jaffe suspects otherwise and flees, embarking on his own mission of discovery with Richard Wesley Fletcher as they research the Art in its entirety. Fletcher soon discovers a liquid form of the Art known as nuncio, testing it first on a chimpanzee who becomes a human with the ability of speech and thought, known as Raul. The nuncio will force the being to the next evolutionary step, but Richard also knows if Jaffe were to use it, it would focus on his urges of murder and revenge, making him into a serial killer. But it is too late, for Jaffe discovers the existence of the nuncio and in a fight both are infected by it and become higher beings - The Jaff and Fletcher.And then a great war is fought in the skies of America between these two gods of power until they are spent and plunge into a lake in Palomo Grove, California. There they both rest until four unsuspecting girls go swimming and are inseminated by The Jaff and Fletcher to create subjects to regain their power. And so the town is irrevocably changed forever as the four girls are all changed, becoming pregnant, giving birth to the offspring of these deities. Only three survive: a son of Fletcher and twins of The Jaff, and it is when, years later, that Fletcher's son and The Jaff's daughter meet and fall in love at first sight that the gods are awakened and the town takes a turn for the worst. Using the life-force of a recent victim, The Jaff is able to regain his power and begins collecting minions that he calls terrata from the people of Palomo Grove, sucking out their souls and using their rage, evil and anger to fuel his creatures. Fletcher is left with the dregs and is barely able to leave the crevasse where the lake used to be and find out what has happened to his son; then in a heroic effort, he gives up his life, spreading his power through the minds of the people of the town, who then have their dreams of meeting celebrities come true. These are the allies who must battle against the terrata in the mansion on the hill.With help from a pulp reporter, Grillo, and his friend, Tesla, Fletcher's son Howard with The Jaff's daughter - who despises her creator - confront The Jaff and his son in the big showdown. Only the evil god takes it all to a whole new level when he rips a hole in the fabric of reality with the power of the Art, opening a widening doorway to Quiddity. Soon everything in the room is being sucked into this other realm, with only The Jaff, Grillo and Tesla making it out of the room alive. As the rest of the world comes to comprehend the catastrophic events taking place in Palomo Grove and take notice, a decision must now be made with how to solve this whole horrible mess, as the Iad Uroborus are on their way at high speed to pass through this rip and take over the world.Time is of the essence, and Tesla - who has visited Kissoon herself - puts it all together and manages to move this trans-dimensional hole to the land of the Loop where time is stuck. Realizing that Kissoon chose Trinity, New Mexico - the location of the first detonation of the atomic bomb, where no one would think to check - she must kill Kissoon, who has already broken free due to his taking over of Raul's (yes the evolved monkey) body, and with Kissoon gone, all that remains in the Loop is Raul's body. The only solution, which Tesla goes forward with, is for Raul to occupy her body: two spirits, two consciences in one body, but it works. The Loop collapses, time starts moving again and just as the Iad Uroborus begin spilling into this world, there is the bright light and giant mushroom cloud, and the world is saved this time, but the power of the Art is not over. The adventures of Grillo, Tesla and this crazy wacky and incredible world Barker has created continue on in the Second Book of the Art, Everville.Originally written on February 13th, 2007 Alex C.

However, I wanted everyone to know that this is a Trilogy but this book does stand on its own. If it had just ended without a second book I would have been a little bit unsatisfied because it leaves unanswered questions, but ones that you can wait on for the next book to answer - not a cliff hanger. Also, it does tend to resolve all of the big outstanding issues.Luckily, I have been continuing to read all of his books just recently, so I won't have to wait for the second book (Everville). However it appears the third book is not out yet and will not neccessarily be out any time soon. Please see the following link for his reasoning for this http://www.clivebarker.dial.pipex.com/newbooksb.htmlIn a nutshell he says that the last book will be a monster and that it takes time to prepare to write this type of book. It also says that he has other series going on as well that take time. Too many ideas running through his head and that he needs to clone himself. Anyway - take a look at the link if you are interested but he says that he promises it will be out before the end of this century.....Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"_Randolph Jaffe was a man at the end of his rope. He hungered to be a big man, a king, yet all his life he had never managed to rise higher than a private in the ranks as he passed from job to job. At 37 he felt that time was running out. Now he had a dead end job in the central Dead Letter Office of the U.S. Postal Service. Yet, even here his brutal, vulgar coworkers and supervisor left him no peace. He found himself forced to participate in systematic looting of unclaimed mail for money and valuables. As he did this day after day he seriously began to contemplate suicide._Then, as he started to read the letters that he was opening he discovered, slowly, that the world was not what it seemed- not even remotely. Here and there, certain people hinted at a world behind the world, a Sea of Seas, the Shoal, Quiddity- and the Art._One day, Jaffe found a medallion in the mail- and everything changed. What had first been synchronicity in his life as he deciphered the mystery, now turned to direct supernatural power. This was a power that Jaffe never should have possessed. He was a petty, unworthy, little man that had learned nothing from his own maltreatment by others. He used the power from the start to murder and exploit. Yet, he hungered for even more power to remake the world to serve his ego._Unfortunately, this would create all sorts of problems for the guardians who were worthy of the secrets of the Art...."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I consider myself a fairly slow reader, but I finished this book in about a week. It was not at all hard to read or understand. I could not put it down!! I almost called off work just to be able to finish the last chapter! It's a huge mix of everything possible (love, war - not your typical war either!, murder, sex, insanity, imagination, monsters, fears, dreams) and you never know what to expect! I really enjoyed this book. \\"Everville\\" is on my bookshelf waiting it's turn to be read."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"GSS is a compelling mixture of stories that only a master like Clive Barker could pull together.Among the many stories a lucky ready will find in this book are star-crossed lovers (ala Romeo&amp;Juliet), clashing forces of magic vs. technology, believeable characters with everyday concerns overcome by extraordinary events, &quot;sins of the fathers&quot;, self-immolation, visits from ethereal porn stars and just to finish things off in style, a minor apocalypse that destroys the sunny California suburb of Palomo Grove. (By the way, this brief synopsis doesn't begin to cover a fraction of the characters and events in this book!)GSS is a challenging, thought-provoking book that will definitely appeal to people who love horror stories with substance."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This is the third book I've read by Barker. The last one, Damanation game I really did not care for, But the Thief of Always I loved. This falls somewhwere in the middle. The imagery and fable like quality of storytelling work well here. Just like almost every other Barker book, it has a healthy dose of sexuality mixed in with gore. Barker fans know what I'm talking about. First timers may find it a bit much.Creating your own mythology is hard to pull off. Barker manages better than most who have attempted it. He slowly explains his concepts letting the reader digest what he is trying to get across one small portion at a time.However, the characterization is hit and miss. Jaffe, the antagonist is fully developed and Barker really makes the ambiguity of the character tangible and you feel for him. But you don't realize the \\"true\\" protagonist until a good third into the book because they do not show up until then. When it does happen, the revelation seems whimsical and I found it difficult to accept. Especially when he does such a great job with Jaffe.There is a Shakespearian element to this book that works very well and should have been the dominating element to this story. I think readers would have been satisfied with that. The love triangle and the events that led up to it are fully realized. He had enough to propel his grand scheme with just that. But the additional characters, such as the reporter and his friend were gratuitous. Maybe they play a bigger part in the sequel called \\"Everville.\\"I can see why people love this book and I can see why people hate it. Some great stuff but it's unbalanced."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This book drones on for a while. But, it's not bad. And if I look back I suppose it was all needed to make the reader feel closer to the characters. A good read on a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG plane ride, and I mean long, like to China, then back to America."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I couldn't really get into this book, although the concept was original, this was not a nail biter nor was I looking forward to picking up this book to want to finish it. For great horror/thriller reading, I would recommend Robert McMammon."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This is the fourth book I've read by barker and I think I've figured out why I haven't turned into a fan. But before I get into that, let me say that \\"The Show\\" is so far the best clive barker Book I've read (out of Imajica,Damnation game,Inhuman Condition). It is NOT the best book ever as some people on the site claim but it is good. I admit ,the simple parts of the story keeps you interested and makes you beg for more . (Good Vs.evil) (dreams vs. fears), but clive complicates things to the ninth degree with useless Sci-fi, fantasy imagery. This story like Imajica , is full of complex but underdeveloped themes. That's when I figured out why I'm not a fan.I truly feel that great forms of art are born from simple, basic and minimal ideas that have room to grow and develop. I personally get more involved with characters and plots that develop through-out the book. The books I've read so far by Barker have themes that seemed to be complete and complex before you start reading. They don't develop, they just simply exist and you are force to accept them. Both Imajica and The Show are identical is this way. I would love for barker to take a simple premise like \\"envy\\" and develop it into a complete and concise novel. But from past experience I now know that barker would rather take \\"Envy\\" and match it up with the 4 dimensions, the end of the world and a land called Rezirdan that you can reach through sex. Lol.With that said. I will still probably read everville but maybe not until next year sometime. I just need some simple depth out of my novels for a change."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"Two men come into contact with some arcane information, and end up on opposite sides of a battle to gain control and power. The battle continues through the next generation, when their children and others become involved. It is just not as interesting as some of his other work, I think, despite the horror and magic themes that abound."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This is a very good plot: twisted, dramatic, and memorable. Be forewarned, though: this book is riddled with gratuitous sex, gratuitous sex, and more gratuitous sex. I challenge anyone to find a reasonable explanation as to the purpose of the scene with the dog, the Death Boy and the dirty dancer. Also, the book would have been none the worse without the excremental references and some even worse scenes that I won't go into here. The same goes for Everville. Tesla rules."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"Without a doubt the weirdest book I have ever read. I loathed it and loved it. It entertained and revolted me. Full of originality yet swarming with cliche.My dream-life has been somewhat more complicated since reading this book. The waters of Quiddity must be getting choppy."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I do not honestly know what to say. This book, and the sequel &quot;Everville,&quot; (yes I actually read the second book after the first was so horrible; I was very bored) are disgusting and stupid. Usually Clive Barker puts a lot of style into his version of disgusting, but this garbage is simply shock horror. There are a few interesting ideas, but they are definately not worth wading through hundreds of dull pages for. I read Imajica after reading these, and I almost don't believe that he wrote it. So skip The Great and Secret Show, and pick up a copy of Imajica. IT gets 5 stars for sure."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This book is based upon the great idea that there is a hidden pattern/world within this one that points to sinister characters. The best part is the anti-hero, working in the dead letter office, who discovers hidden and terrible knowledge about the world through reading scraps and pieces of letters. Finding this loose thread, he follows it almost unravels the world.Unfortunately, like most Barker fiction, the book is heavily laced with homo-erotic imagery, which the reader soon tires of. The sequel is much worse at this and probably ultimately condemns Barker to classification as a &quot;gay&quot; writer, instead of a horror writer."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"To me this book just went from bad to worse. I didn't care if good or evil won, so long as the book ended. I kept reading though in hopes that it would pick up or get better. For me, it got worse, it got boring, and the climax was almost non existant. by the end, I actually started to skip paragraphs because 1/2 of what was written really wasnt necessary. I was disppointed."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This was the first (and so far the last) Clive Barker book that I've read. I was so disappointed that I had spent time reading this book that I considered throwing it away. Although promising at the beginning it became a true drudgery to complete. The story started out well but degenerated into ridiculous situations made worse by asinine dialogue. Avoid this book."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"Simply a horrible book.

He is also an acclaimed artist, film producer, and director. For four years Mr, Barker has been working on a vast array of paintings to illuminate the text of The Books Of Abarat, over one hundred of which can be found within this first volume.Mr. Barker lives in California with his partner, the photographer David Armstrong, and their daughter, Nicole. They share their house with four dogs, five goldfish, a parrot and a large number of other pets of all shapes and sizes.This book is a fantasy novel and describes a race against time to try to find the secret of \\"The Art\\" - a state of being or consciousness which allows its owner to transcend their humanity and enter into a heightened spiritual state - between Fletcher and the evil-intentioned Jaffe.I had heard such good things about this author that I felt I really ought to get round to reading one of his books. I can understand the attraction of the book, but it was not really my kind of thing. That is not to say that someone interested in this type of book would not find it a page turner and I am certainly not going to start to criticise the book until I have read other offerings from the author. Suffice to say it just did not do it for me."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I read some good reviews of Clive Barker, and thought this book would be a good start to reading horror. I was very dissapointed. I read the first part of the book, the Messenger, the concept of &quot;the Art&quot; made no sense to me whatsoever, and i decided this was a waste of my time."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This was the first Clive Barker book I've read. I was not impressed by anything - characters, plot, or writing style. It was laborious to read and would never be a reading recommendation I would make. The story is not especially suspenseful or compelling and there was no real empathy established with the characters though horrific things happen to them."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"&quot;The Great and Secret Show&quot; is one of the best books I have ever read. I've read many Barker books and while all of them are fantastic, this one is unbelievable. Barker intwertwines his magnificent use of prose with his uncanny knack for details. This book will not dissapoint!Barker is superior not only to other horror novelists, but most writers in general. He writes, but at heart he's an artist. &quot;Show&quot; is his finest work yet. It combines unforgettable characters, magic, the apocalypse, horror, and a disgruntled mailworker in a fantastic adventure story that will surely stick with you forever."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"It is difficult to review this book without reviewing Everville as well...so I won't. This is an Grand scale guide through the world of the spirit that spares nothing in it's quest to convey the vastness and rich heart of that which is both within and beyond the mortal realm.Here the reader finds the Kabbalah (Mem b'Kether Sabbat), Thoth, Jungian Archetypes, and an all consuming world/story unparalleled in scope and ambition.What Imajica did in one book (albiet large) Barker, here, attempts to do in three (GOD...how long must I wait for the third book Clive?!). Barker even claims that he will eventually combine all three Books of the Art into one massive tome.Breathe deeply from the Tree of Life, swim in Quiddity...and come inside."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"In The Great and Secret Show: The first book of the Art, Clive Barker demonstrated amazing talent, from the paradoxical love between Jo-Beth and Howie, to Tesla's seeming Shaman qualities and the entirely separate meanings of Trinity. I found the book impossible to put down once I got past the first section, concentrating on the nation-wide battle between the Jaff and the Good Man Fletcher. Barker held my attention, as undevided as it could be, in the palm of his hand through the tragedy of the League of Virgins, the meeting and uniting of two people born for the purpose of continuing their fathers' life-long hate, and all the catastrophic events stemming from their meeting, until the final Show at the home of a famous comedian. I can't wait to read Everville, and greatly anticipate the publication of a third book."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This is by far my all time favorite Clive Barker. It is a book that just blows you away! Epic fantasy/horror/love story/adventure, this book has everything and more. I was swept away into the imagination and mind of Barker and the characters were so real to me that they became a part of my life. I Love this book! This is an &quot;involved&quot; book; you become &quot;involved&quot;, and it stays with you for a long, long time. I was eagerly awaiting the second book of the Art, Everville, but, I hate to say, that was a dissappointment. It was readable, but did not hold a candle to The Great and Secret Show"},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This was a TERRIFIC read - and I MEAN terrific. It's a read page-turner of a book (all 700 pages). Well-written, well thought out and a super story. If it's not already on your bookshelf, it should be."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This was the first Clive Barker novel I read and I could not put it down. I followed it up with Everville, which I found equally amazing.This is the type of horror writting I have been looking for. The concept of &quot;the Art&quot; is brilliant. I especially love the tie-in between our world, as we know it, and alternate worlds of pure evil.I have read most of Barker's novels by now, with special likings to Imajica and Weaveworld. I am now looking for more authors that can give me more to read. Suggestions are welcome.If you are looking for a brilliant horror novelist and have not read Clive Barker's works before, I strongly recommend The Great and Secret Show as a starting point."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"If you're reading this review, I assume you haven't read the story...please read it, because it is begging to be read, and you should, at least, take pity on it. The book is long because its intended purpose (as I assume) was to have immense impact on its readers. It barely missed the mark in my case. The story drew me in with every chapter. I'm not much of a reader, but I read it all in three days (after work and all.) I'm not sure of its intended audience, but I'm sure it will touch the most skeptic of them all... I won't say much about the actual story, but its fault lies in its abundance of purpose...Barker seems to be coming to some realization, when in fact....well, this is me extrapolating on the author's vision. I suggest you see for yourself."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"OK I am a Clive Barker fan now! I don't know what took me so long to discover Clive, but now I am motivated to read a lot more of his stuff. The Great and Secret Show was a fantastic story that had everthing. Fantasy, Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi and at times some beautifully written prose. Some of the scenes are beautiful, some haunting, and some incredibly disgusting! All in all this is one worth reading!"},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"Clive Barker has the gift; that much is evident. The way he weaves together seemingly distant threads of story is masterful; characters all too human, pitted against the miraculous - the imagery invoked by Barker simply has no peers.I thought about rating this book considerably lower, since its direct sequel &quot;Everville&quot; was, to me, something of a disappointment. After some internal struggle, I decided to review the book at face value; this book deserves every single star, even if further work on the subject doesn't.In spite of all the above, I still deem Barker's earlier work superior to this. Other readers probably find in it more depth than I did, and I found depth enough."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I've read many horror/fantasy/mystery novels in my time, some by Clive Barker, Stephen King, V.C. Andrews.. I have to say the way this was constructed, the imensity of thoughts/dreams it provokes, the normal turned insane characters, the way the illusions are described.. to give a glimpse at a reality beyond all our understanding just makes me want to scream its so WONDERFUL yet scary!!! i could not stop reading.. (even while i was driving i probably risked my life to read a few lines!!) i cant wait to read the next in the series... PLEASE READ IT!! I want as many people as possible to share my experience!"},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This, simply put, is one of the best books ever written. The characters are well drawn out, the plot never stops twisting, and there is more imagination put into the inventions in this book than in any other two. It is not a hardcore horror novel but there are some interesting, cerebral scares nonetheless. Clive is able to create other worlds and conventions so efforlessly that concepts like The Art, The Shoal, and Quiddity seem commonplace once you are done the book. The characters got to be so familiar that I couldn't wait to read Everville (also mind-bogglingly amazing) so I could revisit old friends and places. If you want to introduce yourself to Barker or are already familiar with his work and haven't read this novel, you WILL buy this book."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"Quite simply the best book I've ever read. Admittedly, it's my first Barker book, but as a huge literary horror fan (lovecraft, matheson, young koontz, etc), I found myself absolutely redefining my expectations of what the genre of horror fantasy can be. Clive paints uniquely searing, vivid, and psychedelic events and unforgettable characters, combined with a relentless pace that kept me absolutely obsessed for 658 pages. Clive's ability to tell a sweeping, encompassing horror-fantasy epic in such an easily readable, yet profoundly moving and contemplative way, is testimony to the fact that he is eons ahead of any other horror and/or fantasy writer today, and has truly earned the title the back of the book praises him with, a master storyteller. The only drawback to this book is for those unfamiliar and uncomfortable with Clive's style of unapologetic in-your-face descriptions, including: erotica, love, horror, incest, murder, bestiality, gore, dreams, nightmares, etc. If, however, you are ready to hear one of the greatest stories of good and evil ever told without averting your eyes, it's a crime not to read this book. A timeless classic that trumps any other story I've ever read. On to Everville!"},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This is a masterpiece of imagination from Barker. Randolph Jaffe was a failure post office employee who wanted to be big, but ended up small. Along with his co-workers he started opening mail and, in doing so, found a secret that another world existed besides ours. Thus, he went to find this world and with it the power to rule. Not learning anything from his own miserable life, he mistreated the power to create evil. Thus he opened the gates to our own world and created a battle of chaos. Superb."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"Like an old friend you will want to see this novel again and again and again even if it is only to rehash old stories. this book is truly exceptional. Not many writers can actually make you visualize settings with only words. the story, the plot or your own desire to read the novel will compel you to stay with it. Not this novel, the magic Clive barker performs by actually letting you be in the novel and feel for these characters will drag you through to the end. when you do finally complete this book you will wish that it goes on for another 1000 pages. It is truly a wonderful novel and something that will stay with you for years after you read it.I read this book when I was in High School and I never will forget it.READ IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN!!! You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This story is truly brilliant in so many parts, and I've read a lot of stuff-Thomas Hardy, Margaret Atwood, Mary Shelley, yadda yadda. I've read a lot of crap too. But The Great and Secret Show stands out in ways that have stayed with me ever since I read it. He's no Lord Byron (duh, who the hell is) but he's a damn fine writer, and his works are rarely boring. The man has ways of conjuring up images and elements and ideas that, no matter how bizarre or trivial, flow together seamlessly with all the horror and the macabre. The ideas of the dead-letter office, the deserted crossroads, the hole beneath the lake where this inhuman battle is raging (and where the young girls go to swim, being watched by the boy) are all mysterious and give rise to these inexplicable feelings of lonliness, poignancy, and a violent clash of nature's beauty, innocence, and mankind's potential for unimaginable violence and destruction. I loved the way it all came together. I really loved the idea that a \\"loop of time\\" had been created in the desert through an old atomic bomb test, and this, along with certain other elements, were only available to certain souls with certain ways of seeing. The pastoral and quiet suburban subdivisions that are teeming with evil and violence underneath almost bring elements of David Lynch's Eraserhead and Blue Velvet to mind. And last but not least, with evil being represented by \\"mountains and flies\\"...and the way that this all is described in a way only Barker can think up...it's all simply beautiful.As a side note: Barker sometimes gets criticized for having homosexual characters in his books, a large portion of which TGASS's are-but that's not the problem. What is: well, events like Tess' incident with the gun at the mall, for example (borderline \\"Resident Evil\\", for crying out loud), and the stuff with the evil Kissoon and his bodily fluids (just overblown). He was creepy and inhuman enough without all that.I guess the bottom line is that if you're able to get past some of that cheesy crap, you'll find these aforementioned gems more than worth it. It's a great read and very hard to put down."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This is definitely an interesting book but, then again, that probably depends on what interests you. For Clive Barker fans, the story largely fits into the thematic structures he often puts to writing (notably in works like \\"Weaveworld\\" and \\"Imajica\\"). For those new to Clive Barker, his are books that you have to give a chance. Go along for the ride and realize that if you are confused by what is happening, so often are the main characters. In fact, that is often the point. Everything is not wrapped up into a nice little bundle, certainly not right away. You are given hints. You are given threads of the story along with the characters and, along with them, you will unravel those threads to get at the core elements.The overall story uses fantastical elements (the dream-sea, called Quiddity; loops in time; a mysterious cult that worships something called the Art) but in doing so what the story is really highlighting is the secret lives that people lead and how ephemeral those lives can be, particularly when those lives are based on the superficial and fleeting pleasures (whether that be fame, money, or sex). The events in the book speak to people's deepest fears and their secret desires and how those fuel an odd melange of dreams and nightmares and how those dreams and those nightmares can define who we are and who we become. The ideas in this book flow pretty fast and furious and yet all are logically connected in my opinion. While the concepts are fantastical, the mundane setting they are placed in serves as a wonderful contrast to the events that eventually take place. The ideas behind the Quiddity and the Art that allows access to it may not satisfy fans of more science-fiction novels but, on the other hand, the elements of an odd cult, an ancient enemy and the means by which tears in the fabric of reality can bring those things together are not really in the true horror genre either. So the book sort of straddles a few elements from various literary genres and weaves what I think is a very compelling story.If you decide to give this book a try, understand that you are getting into what is (at the time of writing this review) a two-book series. (The second book is \\"Everville\\" and a third book is ostensibly planned, although there is some debate on that, most notably from the author.) However, do not let that daunt you. The current book actually can stand on its own quite well if you decide to venture no further into Clive Barker's portrait of humanity and what might lie at right angles to reality and just beyond the veil of our dreams."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"When Randolph Jaffe applies for a job in the \\"Dead Letter Office\\" in Omaha, Nebraska he has no clue of what kind of world he is about to enter. Most of the lost letters that are brought to his office are of no importance - unless they contain money, of course. But once in a while the content of a letter suggest more than a common human will ever be able to understand. They talk about crossroads between worlds - thin spots in the fabric of reality. It doesn't take long before Randolph is totally hooked. But when he is about to be fired, a murder changes his plans completely: he now must find a crossroads - even if this means losing his life.There is only one word strong enough to describe this book: masterpiece. Clive Barker is admired for his fantastic stories, interwoven with ... suspense, darkness and pure horror. This book is certainly no exception. But what makes this one so special is its vastness. Even when you only read the first pages, you know for sure that this is story huge - nothing less than epic; you realise immediately that you are on the verge of a mind-blowing experience.This book is the first part of three. The second book - or The Second Book of The Art - is already available: Everville. As with The Great and Secret Show, it is an absolute treasure. Sadly enough, the third volume is not planned for the near future. Clive has explained in an interview that the third part is a real struggle: it has a tendency of growing bigger that part one and two together. This could only mean more joy, of course! So, please Clive, don't let us wait any longer!This book should be on the shelf of every fantasy and horror lover."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"Like most of Barker's works, &quot;The Great and Secret Show&quot; is not an easy read, and is not recommended as an introduction to the fantasy/horror genre. For those who have the requisite mindset, though, this book is a jewel.Randolph Jaffe's corruption by the Nuncio, Fletcher's pitiful attempts to stop him, Jo-Beth and Howie's ultimate star-crossed love, Tesla, Raul, Kissoon, the terata and Lix... they're all burned into the reader's mind by the force of Barker's writing. The concepts embodied in TGaSS are mind-blowing: more than once since my first reading of this book and Everville, I've found myself thinking of &quot;the past, the future, and the dreaming moment between, all one country living one immortal day.&quot;Barker's unconventional treatment of Christianity and homosexuality will doubtless offend some. For the more open-minded, and those with a bent for truly fantastic writing, &quot;The Great and Secret Show&quot; is an absolute treasure."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I finished reading &quot;The Great and Secret Show&quot; last night, (Actually it was this morning because I couldn't stop) and I just can't take my mind off of it! I thought the Damnation Game and the Books of Blood trilogy were fabulous, but nothing could have ever prepared me for the brilliance of this book. Never have I had my breath taken away on such a regular basis or cared so much about any novel. I felt so sick and restless everyday at work because I could only think of getting home to continue this masterpiece! The Great and Secret Show is an experience I'll never forget, and it's visions of extreme beauty and dread will always haunt me and play in my dreams. I'll be buying Everville tonight!"},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"Read this book for the third time. Just so crazy and imaginative. Fan of Barker ever since Hellraiser. Although I like this book, it's not his best writing - it's just a story that I really enjoy to explore over and over again. Good escape novel."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This was a great book but this is an AWFUL abridgement. Literally, the tapes (672 pages boiled down to two audio cassettes) should be call THEGTW as that is how boiled down it is. Whole characters are gone. Whole story lines are discarded. Stephen King once said that he won't ever allow abridgements and now I understand why. Clive, if you are reading this...did you actually ok there tapes. They are really bad.DO read the novel. DO NOT buy, rent or borrow this horrific abridgement."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"Having read Clive Barker's (Amazingly Written) The Books of Blood, I choose The G&amp;SS largely based on my read and these Amazon reader reviews. I am generally a fan of the SciFi Fantasy genre and have on occasion read some Stephen King. My expectations for this book may have been too high and that may be part of the problem here.To start with, the developemnt of The Jaffe character and his acquisition of the ART, was surprissing brief. This is a 700 page book and for my tastes I would of preferred more development. On the contrary, I thought the story of the League of Virgins to be the best part of the book and it was at that point that I was drawn into the story.After that however, I became bored and had a REAL hard time finishing The G&amp;SS. I always finish a book and found myself not picking up the book for weeks on end until I could muster enough strength to finish it. I am not saying that the whole book was boring. There are some parts of it that I did find fascinating to read. The whole Tommy Ray thing was great but for my money didn't go anywhere and was left on the clothesline like a pair of dirty underwear never properly washed so you really aren't sure whether or not you want to wear them again.In a nutshell, take the middle of this book (after the League of Virgins), send it to the recycling plant and do some good for the environment."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"Clive Barker is the most innovative as well as the most vivid imaginitive fiction writer i know of. His characters spring to life and stay with youeven after youve set the book aside. Ive read over a hundred books and this is still in the top 5. You can tell Clive cares about his characters and that he is sharing his personal Visions with us. The best writers and writings come from the heart and clive barker has the most unique perspective of most any other writers ive read.I Have enjoyed this book each of the 3 times i have read it since its first release. This book is a classic and is part of what propelled clive barker into being noticed, i think it was the 2nd bestseller he ever had. This book actually changed and inspired the direction of my life thanks to the vivid visions of clive barker, they were so compelling, hinting at something else that it came to grow in my own philosophy for a long while.I will read it again i know and still not be able to believe all the things he brought to life through that book and is now alive and in my like a runawaydream with wonderfull creatures with fantastic powers, unheard of rivalries. Clive barker was still hand writing his books at this point i believe. I love everything this guy does i feel a sort of brotherhood with him."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I started reading this novel because I was intrigued by its premise---the idea of delving into the vast, secret netherworld of our hearts and minds. But for some reason, I finished it feeling a little disappointed. I enjoyed parts of the novel, but I think the weakness of this work is that Barker spends more time building up the idea of Quiddity than he does actually immersing us in it. I was expecting more of a fantasy ride."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I read it years ago and rebought it because I saw the movie The Virgin Suicides. There is a part of this book that I was reminded of in the movie and truth be told, the book is better than I rememebered."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"I actually bought this book because of the great reviews. I was hoping for a gem. I had to actually force myself to continue to read it. I just couldn't find myself attached to any of the characters. I had absolutely no bond with the characters. Clive Barker is an excellent, beautiful writer. He is definitely gifted. I loved the concept of the book, but I just wish that the story was more developed. Mostly about what EXACTLY is the Art. I needed to know more about Quiddity, it's history, the Shoal, Kissoon. What exactly did Jaffe read in those letters to drive his ambition. Why did he believe those letters? I tried to get attached to the characters. Even the Good Man Fletcher. But something was missing from the characters. They lacked depth. Death boy was overboard. It's as if Barker is writing specifically for a movie. A \\"B\\" horror flick at that."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"This was my first (and so far sole) attempt to read Clive Barker. I thought overall the concept was intriguing, however, I felt that neither the premise was explained very well nor were there any characters I truly cared about. Half of my reaction to the book can be summed up in one word, &quot;Huh?&quot; The constant shifts in perspective never let me identify with any character, so I didn't care about any of them one way or another. I was simply indifferent. My own preference lies towards stories with very believable characters and unfortunately this one didn't fulfill that for me."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"Pros:Excellent imagination.Excellent story.Cons:Poor storytelling.I wanted to finish off this book and be done with it so many times. The writing style did not keep me hooked on to the story. Appeared as if written while the story was prematurely conceived. Otherwise, the imagination of the author is top class. I would have preferred to read an abridged version, which I strictly don't."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"Although this book had a good story content I felt as though it lagged and had to push myself to finish it. However, It setts up the reader wonderfully for Everville which continues on with the story at a quicker pace with a more entertaining storyline. If you want to read Barkers best check out the Imajica books, The Theif of Always (has get illustations), or Weaveworld."},{"Title":"Master Chorus Book","review":"Randolf Jaffe works in the Dead Letter Office in Omaha, Nebraska where he stumbles across people talking about the Art, which is something that exists in another plane of existence. He learns about Quiddity, which is called a dream sea where people float in their minds when they are born, when they fall in love for the first time and when they die. He wants to find out about this Art, so he leaves to find out more about. This leads to a huge battle between good and evil in a tiny California town where the residents do not know what to make of bizarre creatures that impregnate virgins, feed off of people's fears and dreams, and the threat of huge creatures trying to break through the plane of existence to bring hell on Earth.I tried to read this book many years ago, but didn't enjoy it back then. I think a lot of it had to do with that I loved when Clive Barker wrote about England in so many other stories. I was put off with almost all of it taking place in California since I did not view that as some exotic place and I became bored. I don't have that issue any longer, so I gave it another show in reading it.I loved it this time. It is a very big book, but it is an epic story and it needs to be long. I love how when other authors write fantasy and they create an entire different world that does not take place in any sense of the real world, but Clive Barker created this world in the middle of the real world. There were extraordinary beings interacting with ordinary people, and I enjoyed reading their reactions.My only complaint about it was after building up to what would be the final climax, there wasn't a great sense of urgency towards the end of the book. I didn't have my usual sense of trying to find out what was going to happen next, skimming over lines, forcing myself to go back and read slower so I wouldn't miss anything, but then going back to skimming so I could find out what happens next. Also, Barker has been very descriptive in other stories about horrors, but when he was trying to describe the huge, big baddies that were trying to break through, they didn't sound very gross or horrific.Even with those complaints, it wasn't enough to destroy my overall enjoyment of the book. Also, the very ending gave hope to the sequel (Everville) and another epic adventure."},{"Title":"Leaving Winter","review":"Heroine: plump/voluptuousCordelia Brown is certain she is having the worst Christmas ever. Her loving parents have passed away and her beautiful but unkind sisters can't forgive her for inheriting the family home. So she escapes to Rome as per her father's final wishes in the hopes that she'll find some happiness there. Perhaps while in Italy, away from the glares of her sisters, her plumpness will magically transform into voluptuousness and she'll be able to hold her head up high and even appear graceful now and then.But Cordelia's lack of self-confidence and grief over the loss of her parents follow her to Rome, as do hurtful emails from her sisters. The distraught young woman wanders around the city and happens across a tiny, ancient church that looks like the perfect place to lick her wounds. While weeping in one of the pews she meets a kind but mysterious stranger, an attractive man who hides half his face from her, but she catches a glimpse of it and sees that it is horribly disfigured.Suddenly Cordelia finds she is not as alone in the world as she thought, or as unattractive as her sisters insisted. But her new friend's scars are more than skin deep and threaten to keep Cordelia from ever growing closer to him.Can Cordelia win the trust and love of this lonely kindred spirit and turn her worst Christmas into one she'll cherish forever?What worked for me:The author described Rome so beautifully that I find I want to go there and see it for myself now.Aside from a spot or two which could have been polished to an even higher sheen, this story just sang for me! Such wonderful attention paid to minutiae, and what beautiful dialogue was shared between the struggling lovers.The jump from the narrative about Cordelia and Frank to letters written by their relatives was a bit of a shock, but the e-mail exchanges certainly were a unique way to paint the family portraits.Size-wise Cordelia thought she was large and ungainly but Frank didn't agree in the least.What didn't work for me:Those sisters! Thank heavens I was blessed with a brother instead. (I could go for having a niece like Pam, though.)Overall:\\"Leaving Winter\\" is a delightful, darling story. Don't miss it!Warning: This book has some sensual moments and coarse language within its pages. Also, you'll want to have a box of tissues handy.If you liked \\"Leaving Winter\\" you might also enjoy \\"Lady Blue\\", \\"Teacher's Pet\\",\\"Etta Mae's Little Theory\\", \\"A Worthy Heir\\", \\"The Legacy Tree\\", \\"The Bridesmaid's Reward\\", \\"More to Love\\", \\"His Seductive Revenge\\", \\"Truth and Lies\\", \\"Carried Away\\", \\"The Independent Bride\\", \\"His Email-Order Wife\\", or \\"The Librarian's Passionate Knight\\"."},{"Title":"Leaving Winter","review":"This book was a bit of a surprise to me.

She took care of her sick mother before cancer took her as well as cared for her father before he passed. Before he died, her father gifted her with a trip to Rome; something he had wanted to do with her mother but never got the chance. Now, Cordelia was off to take a break from life not sure what she was going to do next. She prayed for a dream, having not a clue that it was just a few yards from where she was standing. But would she be able to accept it?Frank McCarthy also lived a life filled with hardships. Frank had to suffer the loss of a brother with no one to help him get through his darkness. His face scared for life. He prayed for a miracle, also not knowing how close it was to him. Would he be able to thaw out his heart for another?Kathleen Quinn is an amazing story weaver. I found this story to be heart warming, letting you know that there is still true love out there. Quinn's writing flowed naturally, no matter what characters voice she was using. I loved how the book went between Cordelia, her niece Pam, Frank, and his sister Claire, whether it was seen through their eyes or written down like reading a journal. The voice changes in the storyline kept the book flowing, giving the reader a taste of all the characters involved in the story. I really felt like I knew these characters and hated seeing the end of the book. Even though I loved the ending and was very happy with it. I was unhappy to see the characters be done and no more to tell.I loved Cordelia most of all cause she was of plus size. She was never able to accept her size around her sisters until Frank entered the picture and showed her the beauty within herself. Once she became confident with herself, nothing stood in her way. She was no longer intimidated by her sisters' rude and childish comments. The only thing that mattered to her was how Frank felt about her.The other character I liked was Pam, Cordelia's niece. Now I don't believe she was plus sized but she was Cordelia's cheerleader, always there for Cordelia even before she met Frank. Pam loved her aunt and stood up to her mom. Pam was a true free spirit. It was heartwarming to see the change in Pam throughout the story and to see how Frank and Cordelia's relationship made her realize what she needed to hold out for.This book reflected that it doesn't matter what you look like as long as you believe in who you are as a human being, the inside is truly what counts. There should be more books that reflect this. Kathleen A. Quinn is an author I hope to read more of and hope others come to know her work. It is really good and clean. The love story is pure and should be an example of what people should wait for.Reviewed by Kristafor BBW Reviews"},{"Title":"Leaving Winter","review":"Powerful, moving, funny and heart-rending, Kathleen Quinn's wonderfully written Leaving Winter held me enthralled to the very last word. This is a writer of substance, with much to say about the human condition. The story is that of the finely-drawn Cordelia and Frank, who find each other in the face of the injuries life has inflicted on them. A journey into the heart, that left me feeling uplifted and deeply moved. Can't wait for her next book!"},{"Title":"Leaving Winter","review":"Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. The winter of the characters' isolation fades to the warmth of spring when Cordelia, overweight and painfully shy, meets Frank, who is severely scarred from a childhood accident.The setting of Rome added to my interest. I felt as though I, too, were walking past the Trevi Fountain, seeing the Christmas Fair in Piazza Navona, or watching the rain fall through the roof opening in the Pantheon.A lovely little book!"},{"Title":"Leaving Winter","review":"I love this story so much that I've read it multiple times. I just wish it was longer. Love all the characters and the emotions they go through. Believable pain, believable friendship, believable awakening of love. I want a friend like Chordelia, and I already have a funny, sweet, hungry husband like Frank. Like I said, the only downside is that the story isn't longer."},{"Title":"Leaving Winter","review":"This book starts from an excellent premise, that regardless of size or other physical conditions people need love and affection just as much as anyone else and that emotional wounds of the past can keep us from responding positively to overtures of caring in the present no matter how sincere and honest they may be. But in my opinion Leaving Winter is very amateurishly written.It spends too much time telling when it should be showing. It wanders a lot rather than having a direction. The premise that an essentially homebody would go off and spend weeks in one city in Italy (rather than touring the entire country) just because her deceased parents would have wanted her to does not seem plausible to me. The other side characters who narrate their own little sections merely to provide background information that would have been much better handled in flashbacks are annoying. The character of the niece who is described as being a very modern teen and yet who likes old fashioned things seems too great a contradiction and her nearly equal confidante relationship with her aunt needs a lot more support to be believable.All that said it was an enjoyable book and it did have some very nice, poignant moments. But I found myself spending too much time thinking how I could have written it better to really endorse it."},{"Title":"Leaving Winter","review":"I loved this book. It tells a great story.

The idea that a person's physical appearance doesn't deter them from wanting and finding a \\"soul connection\\" in our superficial world. And I enjoyed the author's narrative style of interjecting journal-like monologues from other character's point-of-view throughout the book. What I didn't like was the length of the story...around 100 pages...which I blame for the second disappointment, lack of character development and plot. There was a great plot outline in the story, but the actual tale was so linear and boring. It was like the framework of a great book was present, but wasn't \\"fleshed\\" out to my liking. The dialogue was a bit trite as well. No momentus revelations here folks. Nope, it's your plain and simple: \\"I like you\\" and \\"I like you too Frank\\" all the way to the end."},{"Title":"Leaving Winter","review":"Leaving Winter is a wonderful little story. However, it lacks character and plot development. Would have been much better in an anthology rather than a book of its own. I felt quite cheated by the brevity of it. Also, fellow readers, if you are looking for any descriptive narration of the love scenes...don't bother with this book. If you can find the book in the library, which I couldn't, get it there. If you are a fast reader, you will be able to complete this book in an hour or less. Not worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"Children of the Wild West","review":"Children of the Wild West follows the daily lives of children on the trails of the old west. From migrating to building, this book covers everything you might want to know about children in the west.In this book several stories are created to give a feel for what it was like to live as a child during the times when the West was still \\"Wild\\". These stories, sometimes, makes you feel like you're right there on the dusty trail hunting down a pack of escaped cattle. It also gives you the chance to judge the right and wrongs of these times on your own.It was interesting that the book also covered Native Americans in the West. It was enthralling to read about the boarding schools which Native Americans had to go to, and the harsh treatment in which they were forced to endure. This gives the book a more well rounded feel and makes it much more interesting.Overall Children of the Wild West is a very good book about the lives of growing children in the West. I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a light read on the subject."},{"Title":"Early American Locomotives","review":"This book is a collection of engravings from the 19th Century, each with minimal history.

Engravings were used as illustration in sales literature and publicity material, and so a wide variety of locomotive types are depicted covering more or less 1800-1900.

The story of the complicated, centuries-long battle against the disease that kills about a million people a year in Africa alone is well told in _The Fever Trail: In Search of the Cure for Malaria_ by Mark Honigsbaum. It is a story of astonishing human hardship in the effort (not always inspired by riches) to get understanding and control of the disease, but it is sadly clear by the end of the tale that despite the optimism of individual researchers, the tiny parasites borne by mosquitoes all over the world are simply too complicated for us to control any time soon.Much of the effort to cure malaria was sparked as Europeans spread over the world and found their lives in jeopardy from it. The Jesuits learned (perhaps from the Indians) about the bark from the cinchona tree, and the church recommended its use. Physicians in northern Europe, however, were deeply suspicious of such a papist and Jesuitical drug; Cromwell, according to legend, refused the \\"Popish remedy,\\" and died. Even-tually the efficacy of the drug triumphed over religious bigotry. Much of The Fever Trail has to do with the nineteenth century race to steal specimens and get them to plantations owned by Europeans. In particu-lar, the efforts of three Englishmen, who in independent efforts, suffered unbelievable deprivations on the trail which are well described here. Strangely, the British efforts amounted to little. The Dutch bought seeds for 20 from one of the explorers, and they happened to be the very best specimens. They went to Java, grown in scientifically designed plantations, and the Dutch cornered the market on quinine.If quinine were a real cure, malaria might now be as dead as smallpox. However, the parasite that causes the disease has a complicated life cycle within mosquitoes and humans, and is not so easily banished. It has become resistant to quinine and the other antimalarial drugs derived from quinine. The attempt by the World Health Organization to use DDT to blitz the mosquito forever from the Earth was a failure that showed just how resourceful evolution could be in making mosquitoes resistant as well. What is needed is a foolproof vaccine, but although we have vaccines against various viral illnesses, no one has been able to invent one that works against a parasite. The attempts to develop a vaccine, the complicated finances of making drugs that can be used in impoverished countries, and the advantages of the mosquito net (whose inventor, David Livingstone said, deserved a statue in Westminster Abbey) are all covered in a fascinating book that reads like dispatches from a long, losing war. With the prospect of global warming extending the reach of the mosquitoes, it may be that the worst of the war is yet to come."},{"Title":"The Fever Trail, In Search of the Cure for Malaria.","review":"Good God, when I consider the melancholy fate of so many of botany's votaries, I am tempted to ask whether men are in their right mindwho so desperately risk life and everything else through the love of collecting plants.-Carolus Linnaeus, Glory of the ScientistIf you've ever read James Clavell's great novel, Tai-Pan--and if you haven't, shame on you--you'll recall that when Dirk Struan's beloved Chinese mistress, May-may, comes down with malaria, the proud Protestant trader is forced to go hat in hands to the Catholic bishop to secure a cure for her : cinchona bark. As Clavell renders the tale, only the Catholics, thanks to the presence of their missionaries in South America have access and no the secrets of this marvelous remedy.Well, comes now Mark Honigsbaum to reveal the remarkable true story behind cinchona bark, of its discovery, of the realization that the quinine that can be derived from the bark can cure malaria (though certain trees produce more quinine), of the attempts of the natives to maintain a monopoly on it, and of the colonial adventurers who set out to steal it from them. The bulk of the book is taken up with exciting expeditions into the Andes in search of the bark, led by men like Richard Spruce, Charles Ledger, and Clements Markham. But these stories eventually begin to run together and as they pile atop one another the feats performed no longer seem so remarkable. The author also has something of an axe to grind, referring to the eventual illicit exportation of the cinchona trees to Java and India which broke the South American monopoly as one of history's greatest robberies. this has the unfortunate effect of making the heroes of the book come across simultaneously as villains. Moreover, it seems a debatable point whether the \\"robbery\\" was justified, since the original bark exporters proved unable to meet demand and since for those with malaria access to the medicine it produces can be a matter of life and death.Even today malaria still kills as many from one and a half to three million people a year and Mr. Honigsbaum ends with a section on the current science and the ongoing search for a cure. One of the more promising lines of research appears to involve a DNA vaccine, taking DNA from the mosquito-born parasite that causes malaria and injecting it into muscle in order to get the immune system to produce T cells that will attack the parasite when it appears in the body. this is all interesting enough, but has the feel of having been tacked on to flesh out the book.Ultimately this seems a case where less would have been better. For instance, had Mr. Honigsbaum just told the story of one of the cinchona hunters. Or perhaps he might have gone the historical novel route and combined some of the characters. As it stands, while much of the background on malaria is fascinating and the various searches for cinchona are exciting, the narrative ends up being a bit too diffused. One never really has a sense that the author had a necessary end point he was trying to reach, and so he seems to be meandering. Some of the meanders prove worthwhile in their own rights, but the attention does begin to wander. It's a book worth reading but it's frustrating in that one suspects a better book lurks within.GRADE : C+"},{"Title":"The Fever Trail, In Search of the Cure for Malaria.","review":"\\"The Fever Trail\\" is a remarkable tale of the quest for a cure for malaria. Unfortunately the early and hard won triumphs of quinine have been somewhat short lived. Now malaria threatens us again throughout the warmer parts of the planet, but the quinine story is none the less riveting for that. Quinine is no longer the preferred treatment for the disease, but it made exploration of the tropics by Europeans possible, as well as making parts of Europe and North America more habitable. The difficulties and missteps involved in the development of quinine are echoed in just about every drug, food or other product that we now take for granted. Such items as honey, sugar, antibiotics, nuclear power, crop varieties, domestic animals, plastics, computers, etc., each have their own stories and at least some of these need to be more emphasized to make us all less complacent. The message is that knowledge is often hard won and needs to be respected. It can also (as in nuclear power) be a double-edged sword.While the author often rambles, I did not find this too much of a distraction. Instead I was (as I say above) impressed by how human perseverance and even deviousness had managed to overcome huge obstacles to deliver the miracle drug quinine to the outside world. This part of the malaria story has been seldom told in a popular book until now and \\"The Fever Trail\\" is very noteworthy for this reason.The later chapters cover discovery of the malarial parasite, the modern era of anti-malarial drugs, and the attempts to develop a vaccine, parts of the malaria story that several other authors have dealt with as well. The complexities of developing a vaccine are now more appreciated than they were when various researchers started working on the problem and made unsubstantiated and very rosy predictions which proved overblown. Malaria still threatens us and the long battle with this \\"tropical\\" disease is far from over. If nothing else, Mark Honigsbaum has reminded of this."},{"Title":"The Fever Trail, In Search of the Cure for Malaria.","review":"The Fever Trail: In Search of the Cure for Malaria.Malaria is a huge worldwide problem. And it's getting worse. More countries are reporting cases of Malaria. Resistance to the standard drugs is growing. This book gives a good overview of the history of Malaria and provides a complete discussion of the discovery and search for Quinine. For me, the most interesting part of the book are the last chapters which cover the new drugs for Malaria and the direction of research on vaccines against Malaria. Since I am involved in Malaria vaccine research, I was most interested in that aspect and this book does not have as much detail about vaccines as I would like. If you are looking to learn more about the history of Malaria this is a great book."},{"Title":"Basil of Baker Street (Basil of Baker Street ): Basil of Baker Street","review":"Basil is the Sherlock Holmes of the Mouse World.

In this story, Basil and his comrade, \\"Dr. Dawson\\", are presented with The Mystery of the Missing Twins---a quaint storyline that all little children will love---and adults will too. The author, Eve Titus, so clearly depicts the true Holmes through Basil's demeanor, thinking patterns, and mindset. A story just can't get any better than a mouse who learned his skill of deducting by listening at the very feet of Sherlock Holmes!Along with Basil and Dr. Dawson, there is also their \\"mousekeeper\\" who's name is \\"Mrs. Judson\\". They live in a mouse village called---well, the village name is so cute and Holmes related, but I'll let you find out the name for yourself.This is a book I wish I would have known about years ago, so that it could have been a childhood favorite growing up. At least I have found it now. The lovely story and the delightful illustrations of this vintage book create something to cherish. If you feel silly reading the book by yourself, then just grab a youngster and read it to them. Besides, you never know what little ones you may be able to start on the trail of Mr. Holmes himself.Basil of Baker Street is the most adorable detective story... I mean, what other detective could console a distressed mother whose children are lost, by saying: \\"I can offer you only crumbs of comfort.\\" {Yes, just what a mouse should say!}The book was first published in 1958 and has gone through many editions since then. If you like old vintage books, with charming illustrations, I'm pretty sure you'd like this one.The Author: Eve Titus was an American children's author, born in 1922. She wrote at least twenty books in her lifetime---five of which are about Basil, the mouse."},{"Title":"A Bibliography of the Works of Samuel Johnson, 1731-1759 : Treating His Published Works from the Beginnings to 1984","review":"Scholarly books have become absurdly and prohibitively expensive. This volume, and its companion, vol. 2, covering the years 1760 to 1816, exemplify this unfortunate trend. However, occasionally, a book comes along that warrants, if not justifies, the expense. Such is the case here. Johnson studies has been blessed with excellent scholars and editors, commencing in its modern phase with the efforts of the Victorian GB Hill (whose 1905 edition of the Lives of the Poets still holds sway), and continuing majestically through he 20th century with the excellent Yale Johnson, the Yale treatment of the Boswell papers, Redford's splendid edition of Johnson's letters, and so on. Fleeman's magnificent contribution, however, stands forth even from this rich tradition.The meticulous care that Fleeman has introduced into each entry is matched only by the monumental largeness of his his scope. These 2 volumes, which Fleeman's premature death unfortunately prevented his seeing through to publication, exemplify textual scholarship--an art undervalued in modern literary studies--at its Olympian height, and will remain a mainstay of reference for Johnson scholars for a very long time. Yes, they are absurdly and prohibitively expensive, but they are a must-have for the serious Johnson scholar."},{"Title":"A Bibliography of the Works of Samuel Johnson, 1731-1759 : Treating His Published Works from the Beginnings to 1984","review":"J. D. Fleeman has left us a hefty 2-volume set of incredible value to some people, but perhaps not to many. It's an extremely comprehensive listing of various editions of Johnson's works, both as sets and isolated volumes. The date range is from original editions when Johnson lived (18th C), up to recent times. Some of what is here is surprising - - such listings of Johnson's Dictionary in foreign languages, which initially caused me surprise (but were understandable with more thought).I have used it on occasion in placing bids on eBay (it has helped me understand editions such as a 1970's facsimile reprint of the 1st edition of Johnson's Dictionary), as well as when buying 19th C editions of his books over the Internet, and helped take some of the guesswork out of what I was purchasing. It's told me more about some of the editions I already own. It has also helped me anser questions from visitors to my Johnson website.I imagine that this set is very valuable to the specialist, but I imagine that even the specialists would prefer to borrow it from their local library than to buy it. While this is a monumental achievement, and deserves all five of the stars I've given it, at $460 for the 2 volumes together, I think most people's uses for this would be limited."},{"Title":"The Museum of the Yellow Ribbon","review":"I enjoyed this book on many levels for its mystery, its action and the way it leaves the reader to decide for themselves how America's history of war and conflicts has shaped the country and our lives.The narrator is, in a way, an Every Person, and his resolve is tested and eventually reshaped by the circumstances he finds himself in as well as the people he meets along the way. There is a wierd similarity to The Five People You Meet in Heaven, but I found the way this book was presented to be more thought provoking.As for the story and plot itself, it is difficult to review line by line without giving away some of the books more interesting items. There are many characters in this book, but if I had to pick a favorite, it would be the unnamed ancient man.I recommend this book. It's worth the while and you can pick up some interesting historical tidbits along the way."},{"Title":"The Museum of the Yellow Ribbon","review":"I loved this book! I was deeply touched by all of the stories inside the Museum, but I liked Pocket Gus's story the most.

All of the stories were interesting and affecting, but the Medic's story really drew me in the most. I have found myself pondering these same questions about life, faith and humanity from time to time, and I found his writings from the trenches very real and thought-provoking.

We all know to get our books from Wasteland Press."},{"Title":"Roll Call at Old Camp Floyd, Utah Territory","review":"This book, laboriously and lovingly researched, written, and self-published by the author, will never have a large audience. I ordered a copy because I'm working on a biography of someone who spent some time at Camp Floyd during the so-called Mormon War of 1857-8. But anyone who has no immediate interest in Utah history or frontier life of the U.S. military in the mid-nineteenth century isn't likely to be interested in Nielson's book.But the book itself is noteworthy for two reasons. The first is that it really is excellently researched. The \\"old Camp Floyd\\" of the title was a temporary one in which General Sidney Johnston and his army sojourned for a few months in 1858 before moving on to the permanent site of Camp Floyd, some 40 miles south of Salt Lake City. Nielson has dug up as much information about the old camp and its inhabitants as a human possibly can: muster lists of the infantry and dragoon regiments and light and heavy artillery batteries as well as information about individual members of each. He also managed to find a bit of information about the hundreds of civilian teamsters, subcontracted by the famous Russell and Waddell Freighting Company (founders of the Pony Express), who worked for the army. All in all, pretty darn impressive.The second noteworthy feature of the book is that it's a wonderful example of what \\"amateur\\" scholars can achieve. Dilettantes, lovers of history, philosophy, art, etc. who dig deeply but not \\"professionally\\" into their subjects, were once not only respected but recognized for making great contributions. One has only to remember the amateur British naturalists of the 18th and 19th centuries, many of whom were clergymen, to appreciate this point. In our age of academic professionalism, dilettantism has become a term of reproach. People like author and historian Roger Nielson remind us that it's anything but. Books like his should be celebrated."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"I totally agree with Michael's review. If you are a hard-core Christian, do yourself and everyone else a favor and pass on this book. It's not for you. No, I'm not saying it's better than you, it's just not your style. That's okay. We all have our preferences, and any way we can get closer to God is good stuff. However, I would like to point out that the reviewer before me accuses others of being \\"angry\\" and \\"close-minded\\" when she wrote quite a hostile and judjmental review herself. In fact, Ms. Paige attacked the reviewer for claiming to be \\"so enlightened\\" when actually he confessed that none of us really know the answers, but we're all doing our best. Hypocritical people calling others hypocrytical is one of the more pathetic sicknesses of our time, but I digress.If you're tired of all the old hateful and fearful rhetoric of the church and the bible and the people driving our wars, I strongly encourage you to give the ideas in this book a try. But please, if you still hang on to every word the bible and \\"W\\" have to say, just go read your bible, go to church, be happy (or tell yourself you are), and leave the rest of us alone."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"Firstly, I've read all the reviews for this book and I have to say that in my opinion anyone reaching out to help us change who we are can only be an example of a first class human being. If we want to be honest we will realize that Religions have been around for thousands of years and if you really look at our planet you'd have to wonder how it could possibly be in the state it is in while we have all of these religions. Is it because of what some would call \\"the devil\\"? Well, what about us? Where is our responsibility? We are the ones being greedy. We are the ones dropping bombs. We are the ones polluting the earth. We don't want to take responsibility for the ugliness of who we are, which is sad because it's so easy to not be this way, there is plenty for all of us, if we would just stop and realize it, just stop racing around like we constantly \\"need\\" something else to \\"be happy.\\" One idea we really need to consider when we address others as \\"new agers\\" is that when Christ walked the earth HE WAS DIFFERENT, in fact, HE SPOKE OUT AGAINST THE TEACHINGS OF THE CHURCH AND IT WAS THE CHURCH THAT CRUCIFIED HIM!!! My wish is that we will get to the place where we love ourselves and love each other as God loves us."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"In \\"The Gift of Change\\", Marianne Williamson, as always, gives us a nice book. But this nice book demonstrates, even to the intermediate student, Ms. Williamson's poor understanding of the modern spiritual masterpiece (a real masterpiece, as opposed to this book) called \\"A Course in Miracles\\", which her book purports to be about. It should not be a mystery, considering the content of A Course in Miracles (usually just referrred to as \\"the Course\\"), that it is not about changing the world but is instead about changing one's mind about the world. The Gift of Change at times says it's about changing your thoughts, but then always compromises on the Course's teachings and brings the reader right back to politics and the idea of improving the world. Yet the Course says, \\"....seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world.\\" (Text, p.445) It is not about outer peace, it's about inner peace. This inner peace is brought about by forgiving what appears to be on the outside. That brings one's attention to where the problem really is, in the mind, (cause) instead of in the world (effect). The Course says, \\"This is a course in cause and not effect,\\" (Text, p.463) and it's about, \\"...giving back to cause the function of causation...\\" (Text, p.595) Yet time and time again, in The Gift of Change, Ms. Williamson talks about fixing the outer picture, thus dwelling on the effect, which is futile and can have no lasting impact, instead of on the cause, which is the focus of the Course. Marianne, on page 59 of \\"Change\\" talks about how the Course says, \\"the world must become a happy dream before we can awaken from it\\", ignoring that the happy dream is brought about by how one looks at the world, not about ending famine and war first as a pre-requisite to waking up, as Ms. Williamson clearly contends in her misguided interpretation. She says, \\"the world must be transformed before it can be transcended\\". Once again the focus is on effects (the world) rather than on the cause of the problem (the way of looking at it in the mind). There is much more, but suffice here to say that after reading \\"The Gift of Change\\" the student will not understand, but instead will misunderstand, A Course in Miracles if he or she trys to read it on their own later. This leads to confusion, frustration and an eventual lack of interest. On the other hand, there has been a reinvigoration of interest in A Course in Miracles by another book in the last year or so. That book COMPLETELY explains the Course and doesn't compromise on its vital and radical message. Nor does the author sell out in order to be more popular. One can only hope that \\"The Gift of Change\\" doesn't distract people from the progress that is being made through the excitement that is generated when seekers are genuinely empowered to understand and apply A Course in Miracles for themselves. No doubt Marianne's apologists will label anyone a \\"Course fundamentalist\\" if they call her on her poor understanding of the Course and the confusion she perpetuates. So let's make one thing very clear: calling people names like \\"fundamentalist\\" because they think you should not compromise and actually go by what the Course says is bull. False name calling is not an answer to the questions raised in this revue. There are a lot of sincere people who know it makes common sense to go by what the Course really teaches, instead of going by what people like Ms. Williamson make up. That's not fundamentalism; it's a love for a genuine spiritual masterpiece that deserves to be quoted accurately and reported on with respect for the material, not an ignoring of it."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"There is only one God.

I think Ms.Williamson is only offering one entry point. It may work for some and offend others.It is not traditional and yet there are many cross referances to traditional eastern and weatern religion.My suggestion is simple.

Granted, Marianne does not state the above. She glorifies the body, time, and the \\"toys of earth\\" instead.So why did I give her 5 stars? Oh that's easy,I like to open her books and use them to remind me of the Course.

With subject matter in regards to change, I would rather prefer cold hard facts.Williamson's voice in this recording is soothing as she addresses the audience. However, the over-flowery content in this book leads me to sleep rather than pay attention. Williamson sounds more like a meditation instructor than an expert of metaphysical studies.

Her recommendations to embrace love and get rid of fear is something I know I certainly want. However, I began to wonder. Are there things I shouldn't love? Likewise, are there things I should be afraid of? If so, it would have been helpful if Williamson had identified some examples.She also suggests we're not responsible for bad things that happen to us. However, is that always the case? Am I responsible for the choices I make? I wish Williamson had explained her claim further.Additionally, Williamson says there are many turns we take in life that make us feel regret, guilt, sorrow, or pain. And then suggests we must learn to 'push past' those things. I wonder, are there things in my life I really should feel regret and guilt for? If so, what does 'pushing past' those things mean?On another note, Williamson suggests we must not give into our egos, which tell us we are separate from God, but instead surrender to God, 'of whom we are all a part'. Shortly thereafter she writes that we must go \\"from asking God to change the world to praying that He change us\\". If I need to be changed by God, then is that change intellectual, moral, or something else? Furthermore, does asking imply God is a disctinct person? I wanted her to be more specific.I hope the questions I've raised will be of benefit to readers. They've risen from my desire to know rightly and to be true to the truth."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"In a clear and succint voice, your book shines a spotlight on a path which seems to have gotten so much darker in the past few of years.

She is careful not to present herself as a 'guru', but rather as another seeker on the journey who does not always get things right.Using personal anecdotes as illustrations, she largely succeeds in bringing home to us the notion that God accomplishes his purposes for our individual lives and for the whole world through both our strengths and vulnerabilities.

I am student of Silence but my path is that of Love. Based on this book I have chosen to order copies of \\"A Course in Miracles\\". I believe that this author is practicing what she preaches. I am a meditator, and being human I goof up all the time. I can relate to her anecdotes and observations because they are things that happen in my own life. There are people who will nit pick this book and give it less than five stars but they will be in the minority, this is my guess. My challenge to them is simple: if you are so good then why don't you write a book. Let the free market determine the value or utility of your ideas. Have the courage to contribute instead of needlessly criticizing the work of others. If your path is the Path of Love, then this book is a must have for your library. Marianne is an inspired human being, a person who is living her ideals, a rare leader in these times. God Bless You Marianne. I love you!"},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"A very inspiring book which makes you believe in this subject.

I am presently doing a program called \\"A Course in Miracles\\" and this book relates directly to it. The Author brings it to life in a down to earth way. I have already read the book once and I am halfway through it again. It is deep but very meaningfull while the Course in Miracles is very difficult to wade through. This puts it in a very practical way that I can relate to in my life.

Her book has made me open to spirituality after a lifetime of apprehension. I feel the truth in her writing and I can't get enough."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"Marianne Williamson began my journey many years ago into spiritual enlightenment. I am an avid Dr. Dyer fan, but she led the way to my having a mind that is open to everything. I really enjoyed The Gift of Change. Marianne shows her maturity and speaks to the world about evolving to our own maturity, embracing it and saving the world through owning it, instead of sticking our heads in the sand, acting like we are still in our 20's when actually, we have left that scene long ago. So many today are not growing up because they are afraid of aging - thus the crisis that we are in. Great stocking stuffer for Christmas gifts!"},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"I am re-reading this book because the ideas in it are so helpful for remembering the requirements for changes in our lives that we all face all the time.

Very similar to books likeConversations With God : An Uncommon Dialogue (Book 1)by Neale Donald Walsch andThe Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenmentby Eckhart Toole.If you dealt with serious crisuses with family, life, financial issues, etc., this book is for you. I know all of us dealt with so many enemies and obstacles that come our way. Thankfully God is the key and he's our Real Being within our minds and bodies. When I begin reading this book clearly, I was deeply satisfied and understood the fact what this lady is saying from the heart. This is no hype, it's all through life experience and humility.There's a few books I recommend likeBecome a Better You: 7 Keys to Improving Your Life Every Day,The Alchemist, andDo You!: 12 Laws to Access the Power in You to Achieve Happiness and Success, to help you get started."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"The author has a unique way of putting out thoughts so the reader can think about them.

Pay no attention, let them swallow their own venom. This book is exquisite. It follows the Course's teachings about changing your state of mind and forgiving what seems to be around you, but also shows us that it's okay to improve the physical world at the same time. The two are not mutually exclusive. You CAN have both inner and outer peace. Sometimes a loving action is just what we need to bring the mind into alignment. Isn't it odd that Renard's group is constantly judging and attacking, when that is the very thing the Course implores us to release? Anyway, enjoy Marianne's book. It is truly a blessing."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"I believe that Marianne Williamson has more understanding of what our world needs than most of today's leaders....I believe that this book is just yet another one of her amazing pieces of writing that will have you in deep contemplation of what we are here for....she articulates beautifully, so much so that after I completed the book I was brought to tears...tears from a realization that the life I have been leading is not healing nor does it heal the world....maybe this was the \\"icing on the cake\\" for me as I have read most all of her publications....this book just struck a cord...a deep, spirtual understanding was brought out...once again Marianne has so effortlessly written down what is in her heart and speaks to our nation.....words so important, so enlightening, and so powerful, that I PRAY this reaches the hands it is meant to for the hands it reaches will turn into the hands of a healer..."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"I have been listening, learning, growing and resonating with Marrianne Williamson's words for about 4 years now.

I am a student of a \\"Course In Miracles,\\" and have found her work to be an essential tool to helping me gain clarity throughout the course. The Gift of Change is the best to date.

We are all changing all of the time and I am thrilled to have had her work to help me transition through change without fear."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"First of all, let me say that if you are a religious fundamentalist, don't even bother reading this book. You simply won't get it, and you'll end up getting very upset and writing nasty reviews. Instead, read the gospels and the carpenter book and all the other narrow-mined, fear-based propaganda that people like John Accomando would recommend.Now for the rest of us who ask for more, who have the capacity to question organized religion and the dogma of our time, Marianne's book is a jewel. Unlike traditional Christianity, she doesn't dare proclaim that she has the monopoly on \\"absolute truth.\\" The truth is that not a single person alive knows what the heck is going on or where we're going, although many of them would have you believe otherwise. Marianne does her human best to give us hope, to help us to love one another in a time of war and hate and gossip and fear. No, the book isn't perfect, nothing is. We're all doing our best to figure out what the universe has in store for us. But to attack Marianne for her offering of love is just shameful. If you want to be told what to do to go to \\"heaven,\\" read the gospels. But if you want to think for yourself, heal your mind and your world, and truly learn how to love your neighbors, then read \\"The Gift of Change.\\""},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"Marianne Williamson says, \\"Every change is a challenge to become who we really are.\\" She is so right! I recently lost my Mother who turned 89 years of age one month before she went to heaven. Regardless of the age, or how sick they may be, we are never prepared for the loss of our Mother who brought us into this world. Once they are gone, there is an emptiness that no one, except God, can fulfill.Upon the death of a loved one, there are members of a family with whom we had a close relationship suddenly change -- especially when a settlement of an estate is involved. We are startled to find out that same person we thought was our friend, and loving relative becomes a compete stranger overnight.The love once shared turns to bitterness, misunderstanding, and we begin to harbor unforgiveness in our heart toward this estranged person that we once held dear. Not only that, we lose sight of the person we really are, and become someone we no longer recognize in the mirror. The ugly thoughts that creep in are foreign to our personality -- we ask ourselves where did they come from?This book offers us ways in which to handle dramatic and emotional changes that present themselves in our daily life. Marianne has a gift of words that reaches the depth of our very soul -- words guiding us into peace, joy, and a new hope for a better tomorrow through the Holy Spirit.Marianne Williamson radiates peace when she speaks, and it comes across in her books as well. In the chapter on \\"From Fear To Love\\" she teaches a way to achieve or embrace a more spiritual perspective to the challenges we face in order to resolve the discontment that lies within our heart toward another person.The turn of each page causes the reader to search within themselves and seek the abundant peace that will allow us to dismiss the turmoil and unhappiness that is destroying our spirit, and find true forgiveness for those who are trying to harm us. Should we expect to have a better and happier life, we must indeed seek \\"The Gift of Change\\" which can come only through the prayer and by the grace of God.Thank you Marianne, for writing this excellent book to challenge our minds and direct our pathway to a higher level on this life's journey. If we endeavor to seek change -- we will find it through reading this book."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"Reading \\"Gift of Change\\" brings me right back to that raw, excited feeling I had a decade ago when I first read \\"A Return to Love.\\" It's so exciting to get that beautiful, innocent feeling again.

What a gift this book is indeed!"},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"Marianne has a gracous, beautiful way of presenting some basic truths as outlined in the Course of Miracles. Her perspective is inspiring!"},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"Marianne Williamson's latest book, \\"The Gift of Change,\\" is the elixir our damaged and marred souls need at this time. It is a combination of A Return to Love and Everyday Grace, but more profound and intense. In this endeavor, Ms. Williamson shows a lot of spiritual and emotional growth since A Return to Love. She beckons us to do more than just \\"know\\" the principles of love, but challenges us to \\"do\\" more and act on what we know. This is not a \\"feel good\\" book, but is filled with realistic and practical daily spiritual practices that can help us heal ourselves individually and heal the world collectively. If anyone is serious about having a radically new life and genuine spiritual guidance, \\"The Gift of Change\\" is a must read."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"The Gift Of Change is an incredible book. I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I was so inspired to confront changes in my own life after reading it. This book is a real winner. The universal themes are wonderful. Ms. Williamson's use of the Bible, ACIM are utterly brilliant. Of course her own experiences are witty, provocative and at times funny. This book IS a gift of change. I am thankful for the gift and about to embrace the change. Yeah!!! LOVE IT!!!"},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"\\"The Gift of Change\\" is in some ways like an updated version of her 1992 best-selling debut \\"A Return to Love,\\" as it references many quotes and principle teachings from \\"A Course In Miracles,\\" a spiritual pyschotherapy course that inspired Williamson to write her first book. Marianne still has an unmatched quality within her writing as she shares what she has learned through her own work and personal life about the power of applying spiritual logic to daily living. With this book coming out after September 11th and the current state of the world, \\"The Gift of Change\\" is not only like a spiritual bible to find healing on a personal level, but how we come to understand and make changes on a global level with the use of spiritual awareness and practice. After two years since it's release, the insights on human consciousness, the meanings of love, the examples of fear that keep love at bay, are still fresh and honest, and the appliance of spirituality in our lives as Williamson tells it will likely remain a timeless concept that can be applied to future generations."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"This is yet another incredible book from Marianne Williamson. The same author who gave us the delightful and inspiring, 'A Return To Love'.I think that for the most part change is very scary; that nobody really embraces change when we are first confronted with it because when things change, we change and of course the reverse of this is true.But we must realize with Marianne that despite everything we may be going through, there is another way of looking at things in our lives and if we are open to it, God will show it to us as well as through us. When we look at it, the only constant in our finite lives is change so we might as well learn how not only to accept it, but how to embrace it, love it, and truly welcome it into our lives.I know that there are those people who want to claim that their way to God is the right way and they can back it up with all kinds of scripture, but the really sad thing that most of us have done without even fully realizing it is that we have \\"made\\" God small by being small ourselves. Not that you really can make God small, mind you, but our ideas, our beliefs, our opinions can be small and limited and to me life is too expansive, too incredible, too wondrous to put God in a box and say, \\"This is the Truth.\\"We all have ideas that \\"ring true\\" but we must not say that ours is better than others, we must simply say that it's just another way of looking at things.One day, and I don't know when, we will harness the energies of Love, Compassion, Peace, Forgiveness, and Truth and our world will burn in the purifying fires of Spirit and we will come to know that all is God and God is all."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"Loyal fans of Marianne will no doubt be ga ga over this book, which probably accomplishes its purpose: to make them feel good. That however, is not the purpose of A Course in Miracles, which this book purports to be about. It is not being A Course \\"fundamentalist\\" to point out that Jesus is telling us something unique in the Course, something that is not necessarily what everything else is saying. He is not merely trying to make us feel good in the dream (which he describes this world as) but to get us to choose between the dream and reality, which he bids us to awaken to with Him. \\"The Gift of Change\\" totally misses the point. There's nothing wrong with feeling good, but there are plenty of other spiritual paths available that can accomplish that. A Course in Miracles is a lifelong spiritual path for those who are determined to go home, and \\"The Gift of Change\\" is for people who want to feel better about, and stay in, a dream that doesn't really exist."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"I understand that a world in which only Love is real and hate, anger, and anything else that is not \\"good\\" does not exist, sounds wonderful. But the teachings contained in this book are not Christian teachings.This is a separate new Religion called \\"The Course\\" and it's teachings attempt to combine many different religious principles. Unfortunately, most religious thought is exclusive to itself. Some examples are the Muslim belief \\"There is only one God, and his messenger is Mohammed\\". Any statements or philosophies that differ from this statement would no longer be Muslim. For Example, if someone states that Mohammed is not really a prophet, but a great teacher of values. This is a perfectly fine statement to make, but disqualifies as encompassing Muslim beliefs. The same is said for Christianity John 14:6 states that \\"Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.'.By releasing a book which claims that followers of this new religion should be OK with a belief system that does not coincide with what Jesus, Mohammed, or Buddha taught, we should then realize that this book is not for Christians, Muslims, or true followers of other religions. For Christians, I would recommend reading The Bible to get a good understanding of Jesus Christ and what he taught.I rate this Book with 1 star because I feel it is misleading to trick readers into thinking they are following a certain religion, when in fact, they are following something completely NOT of that religion. I don't appreciate literature that misleads people this way."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"In this book Marianne Williamson picks up where she left off with the 1992 book, \\"A Return To Love\\" in which she took \\"A Course in Mircles\\", (ACIM) which is a lifelong spiritual path with a message the world needs to hear, and distorted it into just another watered-down, New Age feel good philosophy. Marianne's idea of prayer, as related in \\"The Gift of Change\\" is totally foreign to the concepts of the Course. She mixes in the Bible and general spiritual platitudes which any beginner might agree with, but which are not up to the Course's standards. There are other exciting books available, for example by Gary Renard, that don't compromise of the Course's astounding message. Marianne compromises habitually. For example, she says on page 85 of The Gift of Change that we must go \\"from asking God to change the world to praying that He change us\\". According to ACIM, only our OWN change of mind can do this, and God, Who is perfect Oneness, does not interact with this dualistic insane world, or else He would be just as crazy as we are. This book does not do justice to the Course and serves to muddy the picture, not clarify it. Move over Marianne; give someone else a chance."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"It is suggested that we recreate our lives from negative thinking to positive love. The only problem is that some people will not accept your love, acting as if your status as a decent human being is beneath them because you are poor in finances, not abilities nor intelligence. They are afraid of you because of social status, or lack of. Only the rich and powerful are worth anything in America.She states that God will help us to change the world. What if parts of the world don't want to be changed? Spiritual giants have humility in abundance, minus the ego. According to a verse in the Bible, ICor. 15-51, \\"we shall all be changed -- in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound...\\" She obviously is talking about the end of the earth, or as some call it the Rapture. Most of us won't be around to hear that trumpet. Custer heard his! And what good did it do -- he still died.When you are upset or in pain over a larger social reality (a public agency), it's impossible to know who you should trust. So many gloss over the problem (which is very real to the person harmed or abused), and try to suppress it. They ignore what is happening, hoping it will go away, but it never does. It continues to fester until the boil it causes bursts open and a 'can of worms' is opened for all to see. That way, no one ever wins.Remember how your mom always told you not to gulp your food or you'd choke? That's great advice to apply to all areas of your life right now. You might be in such a rush that you're missing all the things that actually make life worth living: good conversations, long walks outside, seeing the funny faces people make when they're waiting for the bus, and, yes, good food. Learn to appreciate all the wonders, big and small, that make up your everyday life.One of her 'key bridges of transformation' is to live in the present, not the past or future (who knows if we or our world will have a future), to go from forgetting who we are to remembering who we are. I say, we should never forget who we were, as our experiences have made us who we are now.She preaches that we should go from \\"who we were\\" to \\"who we are becoming.\\" When she ages twenty more years, she will hold onto the good memories of who she was as opposed to being old, isolated, ignored, abused mentally, and be glad that she still has the wits left to remember that 'once upon a time' she was somebody. Like we all are at certain periods in our lives. It is not good to bury that in your subconscious.Other books, Ms. Williamson has had published include A WOMAN'S WORTH, EVERYDAY GRACE, and HEALING THE SOUL OF AMERICA. As far as my reading goes, I feel that America has no soul."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"How pathetically ironic and hypocritical to have such a stereotypic, insult-spewing, close-minded, angry \\"review\\" of a book that is supposed to be about love. It only adds insult to injury for it to be titled \\"Go In Peace\\".The chapter available on this site was more than enough to demonstrate that this book is, indeed, another contribution to the slew of dangerous New Age rhetoric that is so readily available these days. But, to have a 5-star reviewer claim to be so enlightened while demonstrating such negativity is case-in-point to those of us who have truly gained the ability to carefully formulate our thoughts before they hit our mouths. The \\"narrow-minded, fear-based propaganda\\" I read, namely The Bible, addresses taming the tongue (James 3:6-8), as well as false prophets (2 Peter 2:1-3). I suspect Ms. Williamson would find the \\"Go In Peace\\" review to be quite counterproductive to her cause.This mindset is much more than the 21st-century version of the \\"make love, not war\\" scene of the 1960's and \`70's. We can try to fool ourselves into thinking that everything will be alright if we just change the way we look at things, but that smacks of the very definition of living in a state of delusion! Beyond that, this mindset is even more sinister. I referred to it as \\"dangerous\\" because of the seductive attempts such authors use to mislead readers, particularly the impressionable immature thinker, into believing that Christianity and secular humanism can coexist. The things we value most in life become our gods, and the one true God commands us not to have strange gods before Him (Exodus 20:2-3). I strongly warn Christians, as well as those who are truly seeking the Truth, to refrain from opening the door of their minds to this false \\"wisdom\\"."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"I loved the book because of the uplifting, loving approach Marianne Williamson gives to her writing.

This is a human tendency that usually sets us up for suffering. Here, we are invited to make use of the moments of change. For those who appreciate The Course In Miracles, or tried it and were confused by the language, there are inherent benefits to reading Marianne Williamson's The Gift of Change. As is often the case, another author can often illuminate principles in an important text by illustrations from real life and actual experiences. I do love the way Ms. Williamson writes. She has an illumined Heart that comes through clearly in her writing. So, when you find yourself going through changes, and challenged to feel good about it, it can be a life saver to curl up with a book like this. In particular, the instruction to stop judgements, and move into forgiveness may be difficult to enact without some moving examples of situations and feelings that demonstrate the value of non-judgement. As always, her illuminations regarding relationships give us strength to overcome and be renewed. It helps to know that good relationships are meant to challenge us. It is spiritually meaningful to recognize that relationship is a way to serve Holy Spirit, and to recognize the ego's contrasting tendency to separate & avoid Love; then, one may be willing to grow when the going gets rough. Within the covers of this book, we are invited to examine our most cherished thoughts and beliefs, and rediscover a Faith that is unshakable, even given inevitable change."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"I love Marianne Williamson and this book is well written.

That statement is absurd. I see none of that at the on-line discussion group, which has a high membership. What we talk about is The Disappearance of the Universe and A Course in Miracles. If a student wants to point out the difference in focus between A Course in Miracles and Marianne's work then he or she is certainly entitled to do so, but that hardly qualifies as being hell bent on crucifying somebody.

Some scoff at the notion that \\"love is the answer\\", but Williamson answers them by saying: \\"It's amazing how much ridicule the topic of love can attract when it does anything other than support the status quo.\\" Make no mistake: Williamson does not advocate what I call \\"sloppy agape\\". Rather, she boldly challenges humanity to start getting with the Divine program and begin to change from the inside out.In her new book The Gift Of Change - Spiritual Guidance For A Radically New Life , Williamson sounds a clarion call that now is the time to begin to look within for change. Attempting to change the external world, she asserts, is akin to trying to change a movie by altering the screen when dealing with the projector is what's needed. Saying \\"hidden beliefs are dangerous beliefs\\", the reader is challenged to examine personal beliefs and the attitudes they engender. Tracing defensiveness--a form of \\"passive violence\\"--to the root of war, Williamson demonstrates how our resistance to love and vulnerability keep us enslaved to the ego. She writes:\\"Whenever our outer world remains stuck, it is incumbent upon us to look, not outward, but inward. It is a call to find the places in ourselves where we are holding on to old ways--places where we blame others rather than taking personal responsibility for our woes; where we judge others instead of blessing them; where we are hard rather than vulnerable and open and kind. These issues hold the hidden keys to unlocking our unsolved personal mysteries.\\"Williamson outlines ten bridges of transformation that can be crossed when we fix our eyes and hearts on that which is unchanging--an eternal compass of spiritual principles which can guide us on the personal and global path to wholeness:*From Forgetting Who We Are to Remembering Who We Are*From Negative Thinking to Positive Love*From Anxiety to Atonement*From Asking God to Change the World to Praying That He Changes Us*From Living in the Past and Future to Living in the Present*From Focus on Guilt to Focus on Innocence*From Separation to Relationship*From Spiritual Death to Rebirth*From Your Plan to God's Plan*From Who We Were to Who We Are BecomingUsing personal anecdotes, Williamson delves into various life transitions such as menopause, adolescence, and parenting--and how seasons of change are amazing opportunities for not only growth and change, but also global transformation. Saying that \\"our greatest contribution to the world at this time is not just what we do but who we are becoming\\", she shows the reader that no matter where we find ourselves, we can be a conduit for miracles. In fact, she says that sometimes \\"being about our Father's business\\" is as much what we're not doing, than what we are. That is, chasing a future dream of spiritual ambition, we ignore life in the Present--which is the only place that \\"I Am\\", and miracles, dwell:\\"If I had simply allowed myself to enjoy my life more, I would have ended up better off later on. And when I allow myself to simply enjoy my life right now, I'm giving myself the biggest boost for the future. Every point in life's journey is inherently preparing us for our future in ways the rational mind cannot possibly comprehend.\\"As an example, Williamson poignantly explains that she resisted some aspects of motherhood when her daughter was a baby--often distracting herself from the overwhelming insistent, needy demands of her daughter. Williamson recalls: \\"I see now that the fact it was happening meant it was exactly what I was supposed to be doing, and I wasn't losing out on anything by giving most of my attention to her.\\" As one who has had a similar experience with motherhood versus aspirations for a \\"real life\\" (i.e., a spiritually fulfilling vocation), I resonated with the truth that wherever we find ourselves, that is exactly where we need to be. Our limitless and brightness can shine no matter where we are at; in fact, when we shine, we can literally change the world--for all minds are joined in the Mind of Christ.The Gift Of Change provides us with a powerful blueprint on transforming our lives--and the world--through transforming our thoughts. Through the spiritual compass of the ten principles, we can at last find our way to inner peace and miracles--which results in a world that is healed and whole.If you're disheartened at the state of global affairs--including war--this book can show you how to replace thoughtforms of fear with those of love. If you're desperately searching for your soulmate or the perfect job, The Gift of Change lights the path to the miraculous Now. If you're experiencing existential angst--free-floating anxiety that doesn't seem to have a cause-- Williamson says you are not alone...but there is a way through it by choosing love over fear and trusting the Holy Spirit for a miracle."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"The world is as it is be because of the belief systems \\"hosted\\". Marianne maps out a new approach to formulating a new system of belief and by that I mean a change in the choice of perception, interpretation, understanding and response to our worldly experience.The book contains great insight and is comprehensive and potent in a real world sort of way. It is not a \\"feel good\\" book which results in positive feelings evaporating when faced with real world experience. The \\"feel good\\" comes after the fact if you actually apply the principles in the real world. The book will transform you as you read it, there is no turning back once exposed and it will flip the light switch on in any mind that consumes it.No doubt that the few that benefit from the current \\"system of things\\" based on fear and ignorance will be faced with major issues as the contents of this book reaches critical mass.It is becoming more apparent Marianne is one of the world's great spiritual leaders not afraid to confront politics and infuse them with spirit and wisdom, and that is what this world needs spiritual leaders given a voice to rise above the ego chatter and as she mentions in the book the \\"audacity\\" to do so.I had read about a 100 pages before I went into a business meeting where egos were just waiting to escalate into conflict, I had resolved myself to remaining quiet and peaceful and seeing all as being right from their point of view and as my self. Try as they might they could not create a conflict with me in the room, for from some where the right words came dissolving the ego's fabrications and reframing perceptions.Oh and if you want to see a miracle in your neighborhood or at work buy copies for everyone on your street and leave them at their door steps. Leave a copy on all your coworkers desks and let the source remain a secret. Remember to give yourself a copy and act surprised. The results will be exponential.Love & Blessings To All"},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"This book is a miracle in and of itself. It really shifted my mind and, as other's here have said, returned my thinking back to Love. As I read this book, I realized how hungry I was for Marianne's special brand of wisom and inspiration in my life. I found myself immersing myself in it, the way I did with A Return to Love. and Illuminata.The one star review here, made my heart sink. Casting guilt is not exactly what A Course in Miracles had in mind. There is the letter of the law. And the Spirit of the Law. A Gift of Change stands on its own merits. Marianne is a magnificent teacher of that material. And this book is a culmination of her many years of experience and genius. Like fine wine she just gets better and better with age. I really urge you to read this book. In this day and age, with all that's going on, we could all use a very healthy dose of The Gift of Change. For me, personally, reading it reallly uplifted me and gave me hope again."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"I feel that Marianne Williamson is one of the best inspirational authors and thinkers of our time. Her eloquence in her writing and her insight is amazing and it has changed my life in more ways than one. I want to thank her for her work and for this book, which is just one more gift on top of everything she has done for me. This book can chage your life."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"This book has made me think about everything: my relationships with friends and family, my relationship with God (which basically has been non-existent over the years) and my relationship with the English language and how I communicate. For someone who is struggling with God issues: who is God? etc. this is an excellent book to crack open and travel down the road of revelation. I highlighted the heck out of this book. Almost every sentence packs a wallop. One night while reading a page, I was overwhelmed with the message. Got chills, tears....it was so inspiring. When a book does that, it deserves five stars."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"Marianne Williamson is a champion of the transformative process, providing us with the springboard from which we may catapult our lives to the next dimension, where love prevails over the fears and guilts and remorse which have kept us chained to lives of limit and lack.Though it may take courage to strip ourselves free from the patterns which have taken hold over all these many years, integration of Ms. Williamson's concepts into our lives and Spirits truly enables emancipation from the disappointments and limits from which we have claimed we have desperately sought release, yet haven't had the set of tools, nor courage, to construct for ourselves a better way. TGOC provides us with those tools, and coaxes us gently and lovingly, serving as our wellspring of courage, until the new awareness enables our own courage to move us forward toward liberation.This book is a must read - pick it up and don't put it down till you've turned the last page...it will change your life forever."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"It is clear--Marianne Williamson is most interested in creating miracles in this world and not just short-term gains.As a new reader to this author, The Gift of Change for me started a bit slow, perhaps even somewhat negative and hardly what I considered uplifting: \\"I think, there is a collective depression among us, not so much dealt with as glossed over and suppressed. Each of us, as individual actors in a larger drama, carries an imprint of a larger despair.\\"But I encourage you to keep reading. After the doom and gloom the author makes this profound point: \\"Only when we have faced the limits of what we can do, does it begin to dawn on us the limitlessness of what God can do. It is in the depth of the darkness now confronting our world that will reveal to us the magic of who we truly are. We are spirit, and thus we are more than the world. When we remember that, the world itself will bow to our remembrance.\\"As a student and lecturer of the principles taught in the heavily Christian \\"spiritual psychotherapy\\" called A Course In Miracles (Foundation for Inner Peace), Ms. Williamson liberally borrows many of her reflections and passages found in AGOC from the Course and makes no bones about it. So steeped in these teachings, she comes off as genuine and her approach to living life the best way possible is not only believable, but really hits home.Her honesty is refreshing. She looks back on her life, as we so often do, and wonders how she could have thought the things she did. Now in her 50's, she muses over a picture she saw of herself taken when she was in her 30's and wonders how she could have ever thought that that was inadequate? She says what most of us are thinking and feeling: that somehow we will never muster up to anything close to good enough. We are extrememly hard on ourselves and left to the ramblings of our own puny egos, we will always think of ourselves as lacking...But we are not our egos, as the author points out time and again throughout the Gift of Change. We belong to God. \\"It's not humble to think you can't do what God is asking you to do; it's arrogant to think you know yourself better than the One who thought you up.\\" \\"I am not here to design God's universe but to allow Him to show me the design He has already created. It was created in total love, for me and all living things. My mission is to trust that.\\"In the end, I feel Ms. Williamson's point was not so much about the benefits of change, but more so about asking God for guidance and then acting on the advice we know to be true in our hearts which is that of love, compassion, joy, and kindness. This is the way we create lasting change in us and the world. This is the way we create miracles.I enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"Don't let those critical people from Gary Renard's camp dissuade you from buying this beautiful book. Marianne Williamson stays true to the most important principles of A Course in Miracles, like oneness and forgiveness, and makes them readily accessible to us in today's world. Although Course fundamentalists would have you throw the world away because it's ultimately an illusion, Ms. Williamson shows us how to heal the illusion and make it a profoundly loving and joyful place while we're here. Even the Course itself teaches us to first make life a \\"happy dream,\\" until we can eventually release it altogether. Thank you, Marianne, for your offering of peace to an insane world."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"In these times, when the world seems to be boiling over with volatility, it is nice to have a book about the tremendous good that can come from change. It might not be something we like to hear, but it's true.This generous, warm book has all the impact and momentum of \\"A Return to Love.\\" It highlights the ongoing effort we must all make to realize our highest and best self. There are so many turns we take in life that make us feel regret, guilt, sorrow, or pain, but this book has specific ways to learn to push past it. I was especially reminded of what in me is ego-driven and how to convert that so that I can live in my true self.In this book, Marianne Williamson reminds us of a new way to live: we are not separated from God; there's no honor in being \\"small\\"; and any great thing that will happen to us collectively will start with each of us individually.It's not all feel-good psychology, some of it comes from lessons to be learned. The idea of \\"atonement\\" may not be popular with some. But this isn't the atonement of your grandmother's fundamentalist church. It's a surrender that brings empowerment. It helps you take a whole new direction in life on a better path. Like \\"A Return to Love,\\" I will probably re-read this a few times."},{"Title":"The Gift of Change : Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life","review":"I was drawn towards Marriane's work recently through the quote that Nelson Mandela used from her work in his inauguration speech:\\"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. ...\\"I purchased the gift of change shortly after, and ever since have become a great fan of Marianne. I have recently attended one of her lectures, and I was amazed by her genuineness. She is manifestation of a true lady, and she is love in action.I highly recommend this book to those who are facing inevitable change."},{"Title":"Choosing Simplicity: Real People Finding Peace and Fulfillment in a Complex World","review":"I think Linda has done a great job with this book. She was obviously curious about the whole simplification thing, and wanted to know if real people had made it work. She gives lots of examples of how people with a range of backgrounds made choices to live differently to give themselves more freedom. Her story hit home for me as I have also spent a lot of time in the law. There is no magic wand however; that much is clear from the examples. As Linda points out, it is about balance. Working 3 days a week might be a great middle ground for many people. Of course, this will only increase your pleasure in life if you know what to do with the 2 days off. If you only gain pleasure through consumption or watching TV like a vegetable then that wouldn't work for you. But if you can enjoy simple pleasures - often offered by nature - then this book is food for thought. I would love a followup reporting back on how everyone's lives worked out as simple does not mean easy (a point Linda makes a few times)."},{"Title":"Choosing Simplicity: Real People Finding Peace and Fulfillment in a Complex World","review":"I liked this book and found it inspiring and worth reading - it gave me some good ideas, especially when I read how other people went through with their decisions to live a simpler, more satisfying life.

It can be done anywhere. It can be done by making small lifestyle changes or radical ones such as living in a homeless shelter. No specific roadmaps are provided since what is right and the process of finding it is unique to each person.The book includes the author's personal experience as well as experiences of others who have made lifestyle changes to make their lives more meaningful. Some people were successful with their first change, some had to make several attempts before finding the right life.There is a strong resource guide that includes books, seminars, newsletters and organizations that encourage simplicity.There is a lot of food for thought in this book.

This is the by-product of an amateur survey that the author conducted some time ago.The author tried to squeeze so many testimonies in the book, that all of them end up being superficial. You are presented with stories of people who live on US$ 1000 a month, but you never see a budget, for example, just to know how such a wonder is possible. It would be nice to see an example of normal people who tried to ease their lives, and an effective explanation of how they did it, with numbers, explanations, etc.Neither the book is poetic, since there is a lack of a literary tone (remember, this comes from a survey report). This way, it is hard to swallow all the stories of Zen and new age people. It seems that everybody in the book meditates and does tai chi. Sounds more like religious propaganda than anything else, since simplicity and oriental religions are very different things. Same thing with weird characters like one who calls himself officially \\"Q\\" and a couple who think we living on this Earth are like flies on a dog.The breaks the author makes in the text, in the form of boxes where she puts her thoughts, are the worst part. They are a kind of \\"Seven Habits for Effective People\\" texts on a simple life, like planning to wake up one hour earlier so you can meditate and spend an afternoon recycling trash. This would be for me the opposite of simple living. It would be better to join a Buddhist monastery, with a vow of poverty and fixed hours for everything.The bottom line is: if you are a person who lives a normal life, has kids, works, and just wants to simplify your life because you are too stressed and not enjoying the rat race, you will not get much inspiration or practical advice from this book."},{"Title":"Choosing Simplicity: Real People Finding Peace and Fulfillment in a Complex World","review":"Many of us talk about it, but few of us act on it - living simpler, de-stressing our lives, and enjoying life's &quot;little pleasures&quot;.

If you want some inspiration on how you can make your life richer (figuratively) and more fulfilling, this is the book for you. I've never considered myself a big fan of &quot;touchy-feely&quot; books, but the many personal accounts of how people simplified their lives is what makes this book so interesting.

The incongruity of the pricey canoe, and the message the book was trying to convey seemed disingenuous to me.Having never read a single word of the book, I couldn't say whether the book would have inspired me or not, but the choice of the cover just turned me off, and I continued my search else where.Now having read J.

Read this book and you'll find personal stories of many people like you, like me, who have found ways to continue living in the world while bringing more meaning into their everyday lives. Not an instruction manual, not helpful hints for practical savings, it's an inspirational boost for those of us who know, in the back of our minds, that we are speeding PAST life at breakneck speed - while realizing that life is too precious and too short to live like we do."},{"Title":"Choosing Simplicity: Real People Finding Peace and Fulfillment in a Complex World","review":"I have been a fan of &quot;Your Money Or Your Life&quot; since it was first published, along with the New Road Map Foundation. I've given several copies of that book to friends and family.However, many people will find that, while they can support and agree with the principles that Dominguez and Robin publish, the practice of those principles as laid out in the book don't fit their chosen way of life.That's where this book comes in. It is a gentler illustration of many of &quot;Life's&quot; principles. Its value is in the narration of families' applications to different ways of life. As other reviewers have noted, choosing simplicity need not be a 'return to nature' movement or the adoption of practices impractical for so many families. Many of us earn our living doing things we already love, with no need to 'retire' to voluntarism. Plus, it should be remembered that choices available to single people are not necessarily proper for those with family responsibilities.This book is indeed the proper followup to the Dominguez/Robin book.

I mean, get real, anyone can find an environmental awareness when you're living in one of the most beautiful places on earth, you're financially supported by your husband (marketing to those buying large, expensive oceanfront homes), and you're not worried about raising kids, driving carpool, working, or doing anything resembling the life that many of the rest of us have.The stories presented of those who have made the leap to simplicity did not inspire me. They thought about it, quit their jobs, moved, started new jobs, wow, life is great. Again, having some financial freedom from periods of unemployment, money for downpayments on new apartments, money to relocate, money to eat, yea, it's easy to relocate across the country (or across the ocean) when you have no family and no dire financial considerations.Save your money, unless reading about the wonderful lives of others makes you feel good. You will not receive any advice on how to live simpler. If you have a big bank account, no kids, and a working partner, then maybe this book might inspire you.

Many people are under the impression that living simply involves giving up all worldly goods and going to live in a one-room dwelling without electricity or running water. Linda Breen Pierce introduces us to mainstream Americans who have found a variety of ways to simplify their lives in order to have a more meaningful existence. Because of this her work has the potential of having more impact on those who read it than stories of people who take a more radical approach to simplicity. For those of us who have already decided to simplify our lives, she lends encouragement and comfort in the fact that we are not alone in our decision.

Written with an easy-to-read tone, Choosing Simplicity introduces you to over 200 people who have decided that life has more to offer than commuting and paying credit card bills. Their stories will inspire you, as they did me, to prioritize and &quot;clean house.&quot; The best thing about this book is that it gives you so many different ways to make your life simple. There isn't just one plan. The various stories allow you to pick and choose what works for you. I enjoyed this book so much that I've purchased it for 3 different people."},{"Title":"Choosing Simplicity: Real People Finding Peace and Fulfillment in a Complex World","review":"I choose a simple lifestyle and I care deeply about living a nonconsumer-y, peaceful life. Not so easy, as I live in New York City. Maybe it's because I live here, but I desperately need to hear about people choosing the same path I have. It helped me so much to read about their setbacks and triumphs and to read the author's nonjudgmental statements about the message she's pulled from each of her interviewee's stories. You need to clarify your values, then get your life in line with those values--whether you chose to live in an urban or a rural setting. This clear written, thoughtful book connected me with others out there who chose simplicity for the same or other reasons as I have. It helps to read other's journeys to feel not quite so much like a freak on a daily basis. Very thought provoking and thoughful."},{"Title":"Choosing Simplicity: Real People Finding Peace and Fulfillment in a Complex World","review":"This book really resonated with me. I had a hard time putting it down. When I purchased it, I was a bit worried that it would be filled with trite or preachy suggestions about going back to the land &amp; living in a tent, making your own jam &amp; clothes, and helping out at the soup kitchen every Christmas in order to discover what's truly valuable in life. I don't in any way mean to knock jam-making, homesteading, or volunteer work - but I think we've all heard those kind of suggestions enough times already, thank you.Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised to see how many different paths the study participants profiled in this book take in order to simplify their lives. There are as many potential paths as there are individuals on the planet. Although most simplicity-seekers (myself included) tend to value the same things (e.g. nature, spirituality, and a rich inner life), there is no formula for attaining a life that privileges what you value. The stories here confirm that mental and physical uncluttering tend to go hand in hand. More importantly, however, the book addresses a broader, deeper, spiritual kind of unburdening that derives from simple living. In other words, simplicity is portrayed as a means to attain greater peace of mind and mindfulness; it isn't necessarily about ascetic living (although some persons choose that option). It most certainly is not about deprivation.Naturally, I related more to some profiles in the book than to others, but all were valuable to me in some way. I haven't read any of the other simplicity books, but now that I've read this one, I somehow don't feel the need to. This was enough to get me started on my own way. I really liked reading about these folks and think it was more helpful for me than any \\"how to simplify\\" guide, although those may be good too.One other feature I liked: the author interjects her own remarks into each section as she presents the views &amp; experiences of various study participants. Her own remarks are set apart in boxes. Maybe it's because I teach, but I really enjoyed how these comments served to underscore salient meanings in the preceding narratives. These remarks helped synthesize the book - it became much more than a disjointed collection of individual lives and opinions. The author does this skillfully; she doesn't destroy the integrity of any participant's perspective by hogging the spotlight and filtering every remark made through her own lens. In other words, she doesn't demean the subjects by \\"interpreting\\" them for us. Instead, she just offers a thoughtful commentary now and then that this reader found \\"just right.\\""},{"Title":"Choosing Simplicity: Real People Finding Peace and Fulfillment in a Complex World","review":"I find Linda's book very interesting and informative. The book is predominantly stories of people who have made changes towards a simpler (and hopefully more HAPPY) life.The only thing I found sometimes quite frustrating is that often her examples are those who are from high-paying jobs to start with. For many of us who are less than doctors, lawyers, etc... it is hard to identify with those examples that Linda presents. The book is more about extremes - a highly paid doctor making the decision to cut back... etc....I would have liked to see more stories of those who are customer service reps, retail workers, waiters/waitresses, etc who made the transition to a more simple and less material lifestyle.Otherwise, the book is great! Lots of encouraging words to those of us who are realizing that life is not about the car you drive, the title of your job position, or the square footage of our McMansions...."},{"Title":"Choosing Simplicity: Real People Finding Peace and Fulfillment in a Complex World","review":"This book is a wonderful companion to &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot; by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin.

Several months pass uneventfully, then Campion is called upon by an old friend, Sir Leo Pursuivant, to investigate a death at the local country club. To his surprise, Campion finds not only that the corpse is none other than 'Pig' Peters, whom he had believed dead, but that the cast of the funeral from months before have returned to the stage, all with parts to play. As the death toll begins to climb, Campion must sort truth from fiction, not to mention determine the identity of a mysterious mole...Some readers consider 'the Late Pig' to be one of Margery Allingham's least successful Campion novels. I cannot agree with this opinion. To my mind, this is one of the most amusing and clever of the Campion books, and well worth the time of anyone who has enjoyed any of the other pre-war stories."},{"Title":"The case of the late pig","review":"The Case of the Late Pig was originally part of the Mr. Campion Criminologist collection. The novelette took on a life of it's own, however. Quite short, it is ideal for audiotapes, large print novels, and even the telly.What is most unusual about the Late Pig is that it is told by Campion in the first person. If anything, Mr. Campion's version of the crime outdoes Margery Allingham, herself. The shift is viewpoint is refreshing, and it is a shame Allingham did not try this more often.Invited via an anonymous letter Campion attends the funeral of Pig Peters, his school bully, only to find himself invited six months later to assist in a murder case - and the victim is the very same Pig Peters.The dead Mr. Peters has shown up under another identity in a Suffolk Village. His efforts to turn a charming country house into the 30's version of a strip mall earns him the enmity of the owner, Poppy, and all the residents of the local village. So it is no surprise when someone siezes the opportunity and drops a 300 pound flowerpot on him. Campion is called in to assist the chief constable in saving the day (and to defend the innocent).What follows is a classic Allingham comedy of manners, full of delightful characters and unpredictable events. We have two estranged lady friends (Campion's and Pig's), the overly amorous vicar, the bored physician, the mild mannered whippet, and the mysterious mole. And there is the inevitable climax, in which Campion hares over the fields of Suffolk in an effort to save the indomitable Lugg.All of this action helps to distract us from the somewhat thinly disguised murderer. The relative shortness of the book prevents Allingham from throwing up enough confusing red herrings, so you should be able to make a good guess in the first forty or so pages. Don't let this stop you from reading the book, though. It certainly doesn't detract from the overall fun of the novel."},{"Title":"The case of the late pig","review":"This book is quite different from the others in the Campion series. For one thing it is written in the first person (as if AC is writing his account for a book or a narrative). Secondly, it's a mystery more than a thriller. Most of the books in this series are thrillers, but this one has a genuine mystery to it. As with other Campion stories, the plot has many twists and turns, but with this one the plot really hurries along. Campion attends a funeral of an old school chum at the beginning of the book, but then five months later he hears that this same person has just been recently murdered. He has to go down to East Anglia to investigate this one! How could old \\"Pig\\" Peters be dead twice? While he and Lugg are trying to unravel the mystery, they find they are both in grave danger. Although the book is a short one, it still has Margery Allingham's wonderful style and prose. These are really \\"thinking man's mysteries\\"."},{"Title":"The case of the late pig","review":"Albert Campion is a gentleman inspector in the style of Dorothy Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey. Here Campion finds himself investigating the death of a former classmate. Pig Peters was a nasty child who grew into a nasty adult. Few people are sorry to see him die, even if he does appear to die twice. Campion attends Peters's funeral after reading a notice in the newspaper. Months later he happens upon a second funeral, also purported to be that of Pig Peters. The second time around Campion views the body in the morgue. It is unmistakably Peters. Who was buried at the first funeral? How did one or two people meet their death? These are the questions Campion sets out to answer.While reading this I was struck by the many similarities between Campion and Lord Peter Wimsey. Both are sons of minor gentry waiting to inherit. Both are dilettantes assisted by faithful valets. I found Campion's valet, Lugg, somewhat difficult tocomprehend. He is presented as a large, hulking, almost ogre-like man who dons aprons and makes tea. I was unable to figure out how and why he is with Campion. Presumably this is explained earlier in the series. Jumping into the middle of the series made it somewhat difficult to understand all of the characters' quirks.This book is notable among recent mysteries I've read in that its ending is wholly satisfying. Generally when I read mysteries I enjoy the build-up and then find the ending to be a disappointment. With this book I had the opposite reaction. There were points where I got bored with the build-up, but the ending was full of suspense and intrigue."},{"Title":"The case of the late pig","review":"Margery Allingham takes a turn away from her increasingly complex psycho-dramas in this slight (127 pages), black comedy. Campion attends the funeral of a bully who made his childhood miserable, then six months later stumbles across the fresh corpse of the man he thought was dead and buried. This is the only Campion mystery that the detective-hero narrates in the first person.It was fun to get behind those horn-rimmed spectacles, suffer the pangs of unrequited love, and work on the mystery of the reanimated Piggy Peters. I thought the villain was fairly obvious, but maybe he wouldn't stick out quite so obviously to a 1930s audience. Lugg's Cockney non sequiturs spice this minor mystery, and he obviously doesn't guess the identity of the villain, since he almost ends up substituting for Piggy when the bad guy needs an extra corpse.Here is a complete list of the Campion novels that Allingham wrote (\\"Cargo of Eagles\\" was completed by her husband after her death in 1966). There are also short story collections and Campion novels that were written by her husband, Youngman Carter, which I didn't include in this list.1.

I enjoyed this entry in the Albert Campion series, which began in 1929,The Crime at Black Dudley (Felony & Mayhem Mysteries). Although it's a little later here, 1937, it's action is still in that interval between WWI and WWII that saw society making vast changes and accommodations necessary after the horrors of The Great War and it's staggering loss of life and fortune. There is a great attempt to keep to the culture of the \\"good old days,\\" but things are obviously changing everywhere, and Campion is illustrative of the trends. His \\"true\\" identity is only occasionally referred to and his involvement with the criminal world is in direct opposition to the \\"norms\\" of his social set, as indicated by the disapproval exhibited by his factotum, Lugg, who has become an inveterate snob.The characters continue in their light hearted vein, but they're older now. Although Albert's off-the-wall witticisms are still in evidence, in his mid thirties now he is more serious than he was in the earlier episodes. The author's focus seems to be more on the actual solution of the crime than upon stressing Campion's \\"fatuous,\\" \\"vacant,\\" slightly \\"stupid,\\" \\"affable\\" and non-threatening appearance as viewed by those around him. Perhaps as he has aged, others are less likely to cooperate with his endeavors if he continues to be the slightly idiotic \\"uncle\\" to all and sundry. Lugg has become less of the savvy burglar and more of an above stairs wannabe. He still engages in verbal fisticuffs with his employer, but it's now over \\"appearances\\" rather than over the dangers of an undertaking or over the viciousness of an opponent.Although I've read most of the Allingham mysteries almost 20 years ago, I had not noticed the degree to which they refer to earlier episodes, places and characters. There is a sense of the sequal about them that gives them a more charming almost \\"family\\" feel, much like the sequence of novels about Barsetshire by Angela Thirkell,High Rising (Angela Thirkell Barsetshire Series). One has heard of Kepesake before in passing during earlier works, but now one learns more about the character and details of the village and becomes more intimately acquainted with the people living there.The plot is well constructed, though I found the method of the murder somewhat doubtful; not because I know it wouldn't work, so much as because I suspect that it wouldn't based upon at least a rudimentary understanding of physics. The introductory pages hook one into the story right away, leaving one to wonder whether a murder has occurred or not. By the time it is irrefutable, the entire thing has been confused by the introduction of what appear to be impossibilities.The story is a very active one, with the hero and his associates traveling throughout the area to find clues and confront the guilty, which gives the author the opportunity to exhibit her rich vocabulary and narrative skills. The country, emotional ambiance, and social environment are all richly described. For those more used to the almost purely dialogue character of many modern mysteries, these may feel \\"slow.\\" It is the tale of young, active people with enough experience in living life to be wise to the world, but not so much of youth having passed to turn them into more arm chair sleuths or even spectators as in later entries in the series.The clues are there to be discovered by the reader, though there is a large red herring that borders on the \\"unfair\\" that doesn't so much divert the reader's attention as withhold information until 2/3 through the story. Still it's not enough to prevent the reader from guessing the identity of the villain, the clues to whose identity are always there.For those who've seen the televised series starring Peter Davison, the cinematic version follows the book very closely, even to much of the dialogue. For those who've not seen the PBS/BBC productions of these works,Campion - The Complete First Season,they're well worth the viewing. The series capture the allure and visual texture and richness of the 1930s Art Deco period. For those who've enjoyed the many Poirot mysteries,Agatha Christie's Poirot: Collector's Set Volume 1, by the same producers, these are similar in quality.A wonderful example of Allingham's work."},{"Title":"The case of the late pig","review":"This book was originally published as part of a collection of short stories, but is really too long for a short story - hence its publication as a stand-alone. Unfortunately, at about two thirds the length of a standard Allingham novel, it is too short to compete on price with its peers. However, because of the quality of the story, its brevity means that it transfers particularly well to the television series!Unusually, the story is told by Campion himself, and Allingham cleverly exploits this to give insights into his insecurities when solving a particularly difficult case - unlike, for example, the ridiculously boastful and unjustifiably confident Poirot. Use of the first person also allows for a funny and endearing examination of the relationship between Lugg and Campion.The plot involves uncertainty about \\"Pig\\" Peters - is he dead? when did he die? did he have a brother? who died? how was \\"he\\" killed when all suspects alibi each other? With some rather gruesome imagery, the story progresses apace to a very tense conclusion threatening the lives of both Campion and Lugg. I agree with the person who said that this book is not the ideal introduction to the Campion series, you need to understand a bit about where the main characters are coming from. But, seasoned fans will enjoy it immensely, and newcomers should take my word for it and try one or two more - preferably after reading reviews on Amazon!"},{"Title":"The case of the late pig","review":"For me this one and \\"Police at the Funeral\\" are the best Allinghams.Which one is best is a moot point. I believe the \\"Pig\\" has stillmore originality, pace and fine irony.It's a delightfully \\"lean\\" book,everything she put in it is important for the story (and for the fun).She manages to create a story and an ambience that are both surreal (the odd aproach) and plausible at the same time.This was also the Allingham where I found Lugg to be genuinelyamusing."},{"Title":"The case of the late pig","review":"First published over 65 years ago, this entry in Allingham's long-running Campion series didn't do much to enthuse me to investigate other of Campion's adventures. It starts with the detective attending the funeral of an old schoolmate, who was rather widely despised. Several months later, Campion is called to the country to investigate a suspicious death, and the victim appears to be the same schoolmate. Wacky antics and murky mystery ensue. A kind of unsatisfying blend of P.G. Wodehouse and Agatha Christie which is unlikely to interest those who aren't already fans of the series. The one bright spot is Campion's valet, who is kind of a rough \\"anti-Jeeves\\"."},{"Title":"Kissing Velvet","review":"Kissing Velvet is a marvelous compilation of brief erotica tales with an accent on sensuality, spanking and whip-play. Written with style and flair, the author understands titillation is the key as much as the sexual acts themselves in creating sensuous stories that the reader will find both naughty and delicious.Story one, 'Two To Tango' takes you into the world of Tango dancing and a woman who meets a mysterious stranger who teaches her more than just dancing.Next is 'Cars' about a young woman's misfortune in backing into the wrong car in a parking lot.Then 'The Watcher' delves into voyeurism and exhibitionism as Marla enters into a bargain with a demanding stranger.'Eating Out' brings new meaning to the word 'office romance,' as Gemma discovers her boss in an embarrassing situation and is made to pay.'Friend or Foe' is mild bondage with a twist.'She's the One' is a poignant tale of love lost. A man finds his perfect lover who shareshis taste for pain and pleasure but he loses the privilege through his sexual selfishness.'My Pleasure' is a tax accountant with a whip fetish and a new client who has no idea what she is getting into.Next is the tale of a stranger on the commute train that teaches Kym the joys of submission and 'Kissing Velvet.'A magician with a few tricks up his sleeve teaches Miranda that 'Nice Girls Don't Write Porn.'The volatile relationship of Mike and Penny takes a bondage turn when Mike has had enough of Penny in, 'Turning the Tables'.When Alison arrives at her boyfriend's house she is shocked to find he has also invited a friend in, 'Initiation.''No Smoking' is a stop smoking clinic that uses unorthodox means to obtain results.When Tia dumps Gil for being unfaithful he plots to get her back by exploiting her weakness for the whip in, 'The Photographer.'An unsuspecting Jen arrives at 'Tom's Party' to forget an old flame.

Dick is 'The Right Fit' in every way...but one. Dick has another lover and sets out to prove to Kara a threesome can also be the right fit.Kissing Velvet is a dynamic collection of ambitiously arousing tales, entertaining both the psyche as well as the erogenous zones It will not disappoint in its delivery as each story has its own unique flavor and creative zest."},{"Title":"Kissing Velvet","review":"A lovely collection of stories, with concentration on bondage, whipping which I like a lot, and it makes the scene clear to you to imagine.Highly recommended to read."},{"Title":"Pagan Scandinavia (Ancient peoples and places)","review":"In this book, Prof. Davidson puts forth a tentative picture of the development of Scandinavian pagan religion, from neolithic through Viking times. She draws on a variety of disciplines from history of religions to archaeology and textual studies. The thesis is necessarily tentative as she reminds us in the introduction, and since she is attempting something somewhat new, the theoretical basis is somewhat shakey. Moreover, archaeology of the area has advanced considerably since the work was written and so much of the book, particularly regarding early material, must be considered somewhat dated.Nonetheless, the book provides a wealth of information about religious objects from the stone age through the Viking ages. She discusses the artifacts in astounding detail, putting the pieces together into a picture which is, if not compelling, at least provocative. That this is a tentative picture, she never lets us forget (to her credit), and while I disagree with her on a number of points, she makes her points well.At the end of the book is a large section of black and white plates, depicting various archaeological finds, from Tollund Man to various Thorr's Hammer pendents. This section of the book makes it particularly valuable as well.On the whole, this goes in my \\"highly recommended\\" category."},{"Title":"The Unwound Way","review":"The complexity, depth of character development, and plot twists make this one of the better science fiction novels I have ever ready, and I have read many.If you like Niven's novels, but without Niven's &quot;cute&quot; moments, you will love this work."},{"Title":"Inside Music - How To Understand, Listen To, And Enjoy Good Music","review":"Those of us serious about classical music probably own, in addition to hundreds of recordings, such necessary references as the &quot;Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians,&quot; &quot;The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music,&quot; &quot;The New Harvard Dictionary of Music,&quot; and/or (for the ultimate reference) the multi-volume &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music.&quot; For us, this book may seem like an unnecessary addition. However, that is not the case.Karl Haas is to classical music what Carl Sagan was to astronomy--he brings it to the people. Every day, thousands of listeners tune in to hear Karl Haas's radio show, &quot;Adventures in Good Music,&quot; and this book serves as much more than a program companion. If you are new to classical music, use this book as an excellent introductory manual and reference (second only to Roger Kamien's &quot;Music: An Introduction&quot;). And if you are well-versed in the classical music tradition, this book is still a must-have because you will find a more enthusiastic and knowledgable account of the joys of music nowhere else.

Dr. Karl Haas was a genius at teaching how to understand classical music. Every musician should read this book."},{"Title":"Inside Music - How To Understand, Listen To, And Enjoy Good Music","review":"I wouldn't call myself any sort of aficionado of classical music, but Karl Haas' 'Inside Music' has always been a favourite of mine. Although at first glance the book seems targeted towards a serious classical music audience, the book is in fact a fantastic reference for anyone who is interested in music theory, music history, or simply music for its own sake. Haas doesn't care if you're a classically trained virtuoso or just love whistling in the shower, and 'Inside Music' encourages everyone to explore and develop their interest in Haas' favourite subject.Part One introduces the basics of music, instrumentation, and orchestration. Following a brief discussion of the music's \\"building blocks\\" (Chapter 2), we are given an overview of many different musical instruments (Chapter 3), the orchestra (Chapter 4), and conducting (Chapter 6). This part of the book is fascinating for music lovers of all stripes....Chapter 3 especially provides some fascinating detail on the history and usage of a whole range of instruments from many eras and cultures. And Haas is one of those writers who can mix impressive technical detail with readability. He draws on his own experiences in orchestra to give the descriptions a personal touch, throwing in some witty anecdotes and discussion of the quaint rituals and habits of the orchestra.Part Two is more focussed specifically on classical music. Chapter 8 introduces the different catagories of music, covering everything from Sonatas and Symphonies to Liturgical Music and Opera. Chapter 9 discusses music through the course of history, both for its own sake and in the context of other arts, while Chapter 10 provides a similar overview of classical music in the US. This is interesting enough in its own right, although I think the true classical music lovers will get the most benefit out of this section. The Appendix provides a glossary of common musical terms as well as Haas' suggestions for building a classical music library.In all, this is a very detailed but readable book that works equally well as a reference or as something to read through from start to finish. Although it does focus heavily on classical music, pretty much anyone who enjoys music will find plenty of interest here, especially in much of Part One.Recommended for all those who simply love music."},{"Title":"Inside Music - How To Understand, Listen To, And Enjoy Good Music","review":"Looking for a book that might possibly give me a better insight into the aesthetic value of music, I bought this with high hopes. Having previously studied music, I was also hoping for a unique perspective and a broader education in classical music, but found this book to be nothing more than a college level textbook. It is arranged nicely and has great appendix on creating a music library. But the author is often long winded, using musical terms that aren't clearly defined and over descriptive and opinionated explanations of composers and their works. This might be nice for someone who has a beginning interest in classical music, but not for someone who has a working knowledge of the field."},{"Title":"\\"Proceed with Confidence\\" lessons learned from a serial entrepreneur","review":"This is a very quick read about the life of a successful entrepreneur, from rags to riches.

He is able to embed the history of disco in a detailed examination of US society and politics-- something some other authors have tried but not succeeded at.*Turn The Beat Around* thus comes across as a serious examination of disco-- both the genre of music and the style of nightclubbing. It is able to recognize the different subsets of disco that emerged over time (electronic, Eurodisco, Hi-NRG, soul-based, etc), to describe these subsets in meaningful ways, and to link 70s disco with the R&B-based; dance musics that followed in the 1980s.Shapiro is able to view the discotheque scene from various angles-- from the perspective of serious clubbers who started off in the late 60s, of the singles who took to the trend in the mid-70s, of the US citizens who did not join in and might have been benignly accepting of what they heard on the radio in the late 70s or were dismayed by the sounds of this Sodom-and-Gomorrah of race, gender, and sexuality upheaval.His book is not as first-hand as the memoir *Keep On Dancin'* or the research piece *Love Saves The Day.* It is not as much a valentine as *Saturday Night Forever.* It is less academic than *You Better Work* but less accessible than *Last Night A DJ Saved My Life.* Shapiro provides a good balance of journalism and criticism, and this above all marks *Turn The Beat Around* as a good volume on the subject. Unfortunately, it comes on the heels, at least to US readers, of these other books that have pretty much covered the territory."},{"Title":"Turn the Beat Around: The Secret History of Disco","review":"Who knew that disco would ever become respectable enough for a wave of books about it? By the time disco had transitioned from minor club scene to worldwide phenomenon in the late \`70s, punk had also arrived, and the two styles were like armed camps, with disco dissed as \\"gay music\\" (like that's a bad thing) and punk extolled as raw and real. I guess those sad, grim, grungy straight punks couldn't stand the image of all those queer party boys, mindlessly writhing on the dance floors of every major urban center with their black brothers and sisters, dressed in chiana and sequins and waving fans and feathers while the fog machines cranked and huge speakers thumped out trancelike beats and diva shrieks at earsplitting levels. Punks declared \\"death to disco\\" and mounted record-burning campaigns but could do little to stop their least favorite musical form.Author Peter Shapiro, who appears to be straight, seems to know more than any non-queer should about disco, and says it with panache in what is probably the best of the recent slew of books on the subject. Shapiro expertly ties the emergence of the form to the new gay freedom mixed with an increasingly empowered African-American community - the perfect musical marriage between queers and blacks as both consumers and creators of the joyous soundtrack to liberation. The author has obviously done deep research to uncover the personalities behind all those obscure sounds. The dates, personnel, even studio locations are all here. This was no small task; no musical genre has ever been as faceless as disco, with many of the \\"groups\\" simply studio musicians hired for a session or two by the real creator, the producer. But Shapiro casts his net much wider, weaving such elements as DJ culture and its superstars, disco's influence on hip hop, legendary venues like Studio 54 and the Paradise Garage and even gay bathhouses, and much more into this rich portrait of a music-based culture pulsing with creativity. A detailed discography, an amusing photo section of period disco performers and fashions, a useful song index, and a notes section round out this wonderful read."},{"Title":"Turn the Beat Around: The Secret History of Disco","review":"Turn The Beat Around: The Secret History Of Disco is the story of a music genre born from the social and economic turmoil of the 1970's.

Not only does the author go into analyzing songs, djs, and nightclubs, he also explains what was going on in daily life that caused people to search for \\"something\\" outside of themselves.I found the book exciting and informative. However, if you are looking for a book that focuses specifically on the disco superstars of the day (i.e. Donna Summer, The Bee Gees etc.), this might not be the book for you. Although they are mentioned, TURN THE BEAT AROUND... concentrates on the djs/producers and nightclubs that created disco and not the commercialization of it."},{"Title":"Turn the Beat Around: The Secret History of Disco","review":"Mr. Shapiro places the 1970s disco craze in a social-political-economic context and points to its historical precedents. Scholarly, but fun to read . . . I never found it boring. With vivid description and juicy details, the author takes you back to those heady days and makes you feel what it was like to be in the midst of it all. This book will make you rush out and buy a vintage disco box set. Its scope is such that it deserves to be turned into a documentary."},{"Title":"Turn the Beat Around: The Secret History of Disco","review":"I teach a history of popular music class at the college level and am always looking for extra source material to augment my own notes. Thanks to Shapiro's book, I learned more about disco in the first chapter than I have since I started teaching the class. His research is thorough, including specific names of pioneering individuals, groups, and songs, along with vivid descriptions of related places and events. I appreciate the documentation, which includes at the back of the book, insightful end notes, a bibliography of interesting sources, as well as what every history teacher loves - a time line! I will admit, with so many names I actually took notes so I could keep up with all the personalities. I'm glad I did; I also purchased the DVD Disco: Spinning the Story [[ASIN: B0007X1NVU]] and my list helped me recognize and realize the significance of the interviewees. I wish this book had a soundtrack, but since it doesn't, the DVD is the next best thing."},{"Title":"Turn the Beat Around: The Secret History of Disco","review":"\\"Turn The Beat Around\\" is a compelling read; Shapiro has knocked himself out compiling facts and figures to tell the history of a genre of music that is considered fluff in a way that is decidedly NOT fluffy, and therein lies a bit of the problem. It's something akin to describing at length the adventures of Spongebob Squarepants in terms of the number of pixels the character takes up on screen, or his place in the social context of the current recession (cough, depression) the US is facing. While the book can't help but nod to all the sex and drugs and goings-on that accompanied the disco scene that ran literally from the last day of the 1960's to the first day of the 1980's (one of many points Shapiro, oddly, does NOT address despite his verbose handling of the subject), the one thing strangely missing is a sense of the joy that went with the era. It must have been fun...why else would it have lasted as long as it did?Shapiro treats the subject reverentially, and this work would fit in well in a college curriculum. It is very much of the ilk of the college study tome, and reminds me of the sense of dread I felt when I took an elective on the history of rock and roll, only to find we'd be studying it with the clinical eye of a chemist more than the appreciative angle of someone who enjoys the medium of music. Depending on your views this will be a good thing or a bad thing. If you want an intense, politically-charged, historically in-depth (nearly 300 dense pages) analysis of a period in time when a certain style of music was in favor this is your book. You will definitely learn WHAT happened, and more WHY than you ever wanted to know (by the middle of the book I began to dread the appearance of a new name or subject--it meant we'd have to go all the way back to the Civil War to find the roots of what led up to, say, \\"Le Freak,\\" before getting to the point of how popular it was). However, if you want to get a sense of what life was like for those that lived during the era, how they felt about things then and how they feel now in retrospect, this isn't your book. I was also surprised by a number of omissions (no mention of D. Summer's \\"Bad Girls\\" and how a disco-rock crossover managed to be one of the biggest hits of the era the same summer disco supposedly \\"died?\\") and rearrangements of facts (Shapiro bounces around in time a lot, until you get quite dizzy). It is also a little skewed in balance, whole sections concentrating on subjects better suited to another book on black rights, Northern soul or America's place in the world of industry. However, the earliest chapters documenting the birth of the disco \\"scene,\\" and the chapters that analyze recordings, are highly addictive, fun and satisfying.Frequently funny, remarkably researched and thought out, the book is very readable and entertaining, but it begs for an edit and leaves one scratching one's head; it's a rather \\"un-fun\\" book about a fun subject.********I actually went back and decided to bump this up a star, as I've been thinking about this book ever since I read it, and will keep it for the incredible amount of reference material enclosed--I bought a lot of music listed after reading it and researching. I can't say that for any other book I've read of late. This is good stuff."},{"Title":"Turn the Beat Around: The Secret History of Disco","review":"Turn The Beat Around: The Secret History Of Disco is the story of a music genre born from the social and economic turmoil of the 1970's.

Published in September/October 1939(overshadowed by the start of War) it came out almost a year before Ernest Hemingway's Spanish Civil War novel was published in July 1940.Partly autobiographical, Monsarrat graduated with a honors degree in law in 1931 from Trinity College Cambridge and worked in a Nottingham solicitor's office for two years before moving to London to become a freelance writer. Some of his 1930's terminology and slang may be unfamiliar, particularly with non-UK readers but wikipedia and google are useful resources which may be helpful. His description of the Cotswolds is beautiful, and there are some rather clever phrases like: \\"And though of course one must guard against too high a degree of specialization-you remember the definition of a specialist? 'A man who learns more and more about less and less, until finally he knows everything about nothing.'\\"The Social Realism and Class Division Themes of this novel is a precursor to the Angry Young Men writers which followed. These include John Osborne's, Look Back In Anger(1956); John Braine's, Room At The Top(1957) and Life At The Top(1962); Alan Sillitoe's, Saturday Night And Sunday Morning(1958) and The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner(1959); and David Storey's, This Sporting Life(1960.)

My first introduction to Somerset Maugham was through the movie \\"The Razor's Edge\\" (1946) staring Tyrone Power as Larry Darrell. I have no idea as to how much it was adapted from the book. Then in 1984 we watched Bill Murray as Larry Darrell. This film lost what magic the 1946 film had. So it was time to read the book. Yes I know very few films can do more than present the essence of a book. Turns out that even the older film wrote Summerset out of some of the scenes.Larry is back from the war (WWI). As with many of us he is left with nagging questions about why one person lives and another must die. This problem leads Larry to search for the answers. He turns down opportunities and takes up a lifestyle to help him find answers. This story is told or narrated by Somerset Maugham himself. In the book Somerset takes more of an active part in the story. Larry came as close as any of us to the answer, he seeks and we leave him much the same way one enters and leaves your life.The Razor's EdgeRazor's Edge [VHS]"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"As a loosely written account of a young man's coming of age this book has a lot going for it. It's got humour, sensitivity, satire, and wit. The book tells the story of a young Irish Catholic working class youth who gains self esteem and a sense of who he is by playing basketball. But he blows it all with heroin addiction. Though it's a good look at the dark side of the macho sports culture the book is not aging well and to a contemporary reader might come across as too linked to the Vietman era."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"This book not only shows the naivity of ourselves, but it shows the strength of a kid living on the streets in New York.

Jim is my favorite author and is quite hypnotizing in his words. As wonderful as &quot;Basketball Diaries&quot; is, his poetry is much better! His words are like a potent elixer, once your addicted, that's it, you become a Jim fanatic. Jim also has a band, that music is ok, it's basicly 80s punk-rock, it's a little synical with titles such as &quot;People Who Died&quot;, &quot;Wicked Gravity&quot;, etc. You deffinetly have to have a taste for that type of music.

Carroll shows that he had talent in writing at a young age through this book. I suggest it to all readers."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"For a teenage diary, this is extremely well written. Jim Carroll was clearly a gifted writer, and his diary brings the New York City streets of the mid-60's to life. His vivid descriptions of growing up as a street wise kid on the mean streets of the city clearly paint a picture of the period.That said, this is was NOT a fun book to read. There is much about Carroll's life in this period that is not pretty. His growing dependency on drugs is readily apparent as the book progresses, as is his willingness to do almost anything to pay for his next fix. There are graphic descriptions of both the drug use and his sexual encounters, but even so there is a sense of honesty in the account that somehow seems to be redeeming. In the end, this is a powerful glimpse into a life on the streets."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I saw the movie before it came out and I liked it. I didn't know what I was missing. Now that I read the original source I know what a load of Disney-fied garbage I was watching. Instead of a tale about &quot;the loss of innocence&quot; this is a horrifying and hilarilious trip through Hell as Jim Carroll gets more and more into the hustling junkie lifestyle. While Catholic Boy is a great CD, Carroll would never write anything so raw and crazy again.Most of my perspective comes from the movie so bear with me. In the movie, Leonardo tries heroin as part of his downward spiral and it really turns the movie dark. In the book, he tries heroin almost at the beginning and complains because he always thought that pot got you high. In the movie Leonardo is hitching rides on buses at the beginning and turning to nastier crimes later on. In the book Carroll is describing the best methods for purse snatching. In the movie, Leonardo hustles for tricks as one of the last signs that he's fallen from grace. In the book, Carroll complains about the gay johns who make him go to baseball games or want him to whip cats to death (&quot;unfortunately for him I was in a cat-loving mood that day and whipped him instead&quot;). In the movie there is a helpful friend who tries to get him off of drugs. That guy is fortunately absent in the book. In the movie there is a long sequence about the best friend with cancer. In the book, he's creeped out by the corpse but that's about it.In essence, the movie serves up a rough-around-the-edges kid who gets into a bad situation that only gets worse. The book by contrast has Jim Carroll pure and malignant, snatching purses and shooting up without a care as to the consequences. He's a nasty little punk and he deserves most of what happens to him. This is probably why Carroll's later stuff isn't as popular. Much of what makes this book great is how repulsed and intrigued you are with the narrator. When Jim Carroll grew up, kicked the addiction and stopped being such a creep, it was great for him and anyone around him, but he lost the main voice and never replaced it with anything quite so compelling.After you read this book you should check out with Patti Smith's early book of poetry, Please Kill Me about the New York punk scene in which Carroll featured prominently and Catholic Boy. YOu might also want to watch the movie as it isn't bad by DiCaprio standards, although pretty awful by the standards of the book."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"This is a complete arc of drug use - from the narrator's first sniff of glue on a ferry as a thirteen year old to a late teenager in an apartment in one very bad state. At first humorous, the narrative increasingly becomes the story of a young adult's miserable descent into addiction. Though Carroll yearns to be pure and real, his writing is fluid from the first page through its deeply vivid, sensual and emotive descriptions. Frustration, fear, annoyance, contempt, and euphoria are all communicated through but a few phrases, and often the accounts require no commentary whatsoever.Having seen and loved the film I was naturally comparing and contrasting the two throughout - unlike the film, however, there are no guardian angels in real life. Instead by the last pages of Basketball Diaries we see Carroll consciously having hit rock bottom. When I first saw the film I felt frustration because it seemed that to comment on the world of heroine-use one must be a heroine user. No other way seems to exist to enter that world deep enough and gain its inhabitant's trust. However, reading the book it became apparent that Carroll is simply one who likes looking into the things and people around him with more depth than most - and has the passion to put those insights onto paper.In reading Basketball Diaries I developed enough contempt for Carroll to convince me never to follow the same path. His wit, intelligence and athleticism - all which he maintains while engaging various habits - meant however that I was also grudgingly admiring of him."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I read it originally when I was 16, and rereading it at 35, I was struck at how different my perspective was. At 16, it didn't feel like a downward spiral - just a progression of growing up. I also highly recommend his book Forced Entries, which is a good continuation. I have to say I enjoy Carroll's prose a bit more than his poetry."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"The Basketball Diaries by New York City Punk Poet Laureate Jim Carroll is a diary of his life between the ages of 12 and 16. The literary level he achieves is stunning given his youth. The subject matter, while serious, is not near as dark as other reviewers have suggested. Although drug usage plays an ever increasing role in Carroll's life to the detriment of his grades, sports, etc., many parts of the diary are laugh-out-loud funny. The \\"anything for a laugh or a high\\" ethic of Carroll and his buddies is something that many of us can relate to as we think back on our youth. Usually with a mixture of regrets and smiles. It is a perilous journey that does end in ultimate tragedy for some. But not Carroll. He has survived (and thrived) for years now as a poet and musician. In light of this knowledge, his diary doesn't seem as desparate and moribund as it could have been. This is in no way an affirmation of drug usage and I'm not trying to minimize its potential dangers. Jim Carroll's account of his descent into mainline heroin addiction is somewhat harrowing. But this book is much more than just a junkie's story. It is wonderfully written and is very effective at conveying not just the trials of youth but some of it's joys as well. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"Carroll's a superb writer who can really capture the mood and voice of the sixties. Who would have thought Carroll actually played with playground legends like &quot;The Goat&quot; and Abdul-Jabbar?! It does read like &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; though it draws from true life experience. Carrol's most famous work is really an impressive book. It is an intriguing mix of humour, skepticism, sadness and excitement. It does not glorify or really condemn drug abuse, it presents it as it is to a junkie. This book is something and can be simply summarized as a book that presents things as it is, nothing more nothing less."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I saw the movie, The Basketball Diaries, years ago, and subsequently kept hearing how awesome the book is. But I never got around to actually reading it. Until, I was in a friend's house recently and perusing her bookshelfs saw it. I borrowed it and within 2 days read the entire book. It's quite disturbing, even more so because I live a few blocks above Inwood - - where Carrol lived and where much of the book took place - - in Kingsbridge . Reading The BD's I felt like, 30 years later, I know a bunch of Jim Carrol's running around playing the same downward spiraling game. Carrol has an amazing ability to capture his own life on paper. I'm just wondering Jim, are you pure yet?"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I must have missed something while reading this book. All of the reviews here made it sound great and I was excited to read it. As the book went on I felt as though I was just waiting for the book to end. For me, the book had no plot and no structure. The summary of the book sounded interesting enough. Diary entries from a boy who was the star of a high school basketball team, became involved in drugs and was kicked off the team and eventually kicked out of his house. First off the title is very misleading, the book has almost nothing to do with basketball so if that is what you are looking for I do not recommend it to you. Secondly the book is not like the summary at all. For one he did not start doing drugs he was already addicted to drugs when the book began. The book is random journal entries from his teenage-hood (ages 13-15) detailing drug use, prostitution, and crime. For someone looking for a gritty book exploiting a life of a teenager on the harsh street of New York than this is for you. Coming into this book I'm not sure what I was expecting but not that. I was however expecting him to fix his life at the end of the book and turn it around which did not happen. This book ended on the same low note that it started. I may have missed a deep and underlying message to this book that I did not see but for now I gained nothing from reading this book except a pity for him because he had such a rough childhood.I may have misunderstood this book. I do not regret reading this but it was certainly not what I thought it would be (the vague idea I thought it would be).I would also not recommend this book to those who are easily offended as I must warn it has quite graphic language, depictions of sex, and drug use.Overall 3/5 stars"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"This is the best book that I have ever read.

I like that this book despite being a novel shows how heroin use doesn't cause health problems other than its addiction. too bad he became a thug on it, which also doesn't need to go hand in hand with drug use despite popular misconception. loved the movie, the book is about as good. can relate to more of this book than probably anyone on amazon (nyc, prep school, former precocious poet & dope user, successful shooting guard, thriving today). not saying that to brag but to say it holds up enjoyably as hell well as an odd mix of biography and novel."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"To have been written by a middle aged man this would have been a really well written piece of work, considering that Jim was only a teen, WOW. To see all the things he went up against, and that he is still ALIVE, just makes you ask how? Very well written (as well as all other books/ poems by Jim).

Jim Carrol growing up in the mean streets of New York. The situations were very real, and show what many teenagers have to go through today, even if they don't grow up in a large city. Violence and crime are spreading rapidly, and no teen is safe from it. I can't really understand why every person gave it five stars, to me five stars is a book that you read five times before reading another. Overall, the book is a very realistic and entertaining and I would recommend it to any teenager that is headed down the wrong path, it will most likely set them straight."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"The Basketball Diaries was an extremely fun book to read. Beyond the gross overuse of swear words, sexual content, and excessive drug use the book really does say something. It's interesting to see how Jim Carroll's drug use rapidly increases over the years. He slowly turns from recreational user to stone cold heroin junkie. The people and incidents he encounters are very fascinating. This book is probably not good for people who are into drugs and sex a lot. It will make you fiend for both of them really bad. My sex drive was boosted dramatically the week I was reading the book. This was bad because I read the entire book in school. I had one complaint about the story though; Jim Carroll became a poet and a rock and roller but throughout the book they made minimal reference to his future career. Most of the story focused on radical overuse of substance and sex. Only towards the end did the real meaning of the book come true, and the revelation of that truth was really faint and short lived. Overall The Basketball Diaries has great stories of sex and drugs but most of us could easily have the same or similar stories in our own lives. All we have to do is keep track of them in a diary, publish them, and make a bunch of money off curious kids."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I thought it was incredibly well written, and I liked the fact of it being so depressing. It's hard to believe that some one, Jim Carroll, actually went through this hell on earth. Well, it just is a matter of time before you could get over it."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"In my opinion this book was very good. I thought that it was very well written and gave in-depth descriptions on what growing up is like for some people. Some people grow up on robbing stores or selling weed and smokling stuff all the time. I believe they do this for a way to survive because they have no place left to go. I believe this is a good book for people to read if u are at least 15 because of the language and the more grown-up things discussed in the book. I thought that the book needed to be more about his basketball career or his poet career. The book is called Basketball Diaries and the main points in the book were about sex, drugs, and an occasional basketball game here or there. Many kids may read this book and be like that will never happen to me i won't do any of that bad stuff but when I read this book i couldn't believe half the things kids would sink to just to get an ounce of weed. At the begining of the book Jim's mom found heroin and Jim said that is was only weed that you get addicted to. It turns out that Jim wasn't only addicted to weed but also the heroin. Kids are always like well if I try it i won't like it so I guess it doesn't matter and they try it and the next thing they know is that they are addicted and can't stop. So again I thought that this book was very good but the author could have fixed the book more to concentrate more on basketball instead of weed and sex."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I really loved this book. It is about the young Jim Carrol, who is now a famous poet and musician, but in his youth was a troublesome teen who expeirienced many tramatic things. Trying to make a name for himself, while maintaining his basketball reputation as well as his reputation on the tough streets of New York, he was exposed to drugs and much, much more. This diary is great for female AND MALE teens, and i highly recomend that you read it."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I thought this book was very interesting and well written. I think John Carroll wrote this book to show kids that you don't have to do drugs or alcohol to fit in. This book was very exciting, every time I opened it up I could not put it down. I think other people should buy this book and read it. If you want to read a book that you will get your money's worth out of buy this one. I think that people who should read should be at least 16 or older."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I believe this was a great book overall. However I do think that the vocabulary in this book was a little over my head. I believe this book was wriiten for a younger audience, and with the words that Carrol chose to use it would be hard to understand. Once you pass over the vocab you will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"The Basketball Diaries kept me interested through the days that we got to read in class. Overall the book was not the best written due to words that are not in my vocabulary. I thought the book was a good read."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"The book \\"The Basketball Diaries\\" by Jim Carroll is about the life of Jim Carroll as a High School basketball player and a heroin attic. The book takes place in New York City's Lower East Side of Manhattan. Jim Carroll, the main character records his games as a basketball star in his diaries.He later becomes addicted to heroin and his life begins to change for the worse. He begins hustling, getting high and getting hooked. As Jim's life goes on so does his addiction to heroin. Jim also spends time in prison but, it still doesent set him straight.I think this was a really good book because it is a great example of how drugs ruin lives. Jim was a perfectly good student but then he fell into a heroin addiction and gave up on sports, school and life. Those are my thoughts on The Basketbal Diaries by Jim Carroll."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"John Carroll showed life through a teen's eyes while growing up in the nineties. So when you read this book, you should not expect any less then what you see a teenager being capable of doing. In Basketball Diaries, The extensive usage of vulger language, sexual conduct, and drugs was described to us in the step-by-step procedures taken as if you were him. I feel that John Carroll wanted to show the readers that how easily a boy or girl, in the society today, could be placed in these events. But as John Carroll had provided us with this information he had lost track of the title of this book. He wrote too much on how the teenager had been committing unmoral actions then he had been involved with basketball. If this was his intentions in the first place I feel that the title should have been changed to fit the contents or provide some involvement of basketball within the actions that had occured. But if you are just looking for a good book to keep your interest in, then I would recommend this book to anyone that is of 15 years or older for the reasons of maturity. Someone has to have a developed mind on understanding information that you would be reading. This book kept my attention for the time period that I was reading but you have to understand that some parts are not as interesting as others. Finally, I would like to state that John Carroll did do an excellent job in writing this piece of literature but I don't think that I could classify this book as being good enough for the superior rating of five stars."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"This book was definatley not what I was expecting. If you saw the movie and loved I would not recommend that you read it because doesn't have near as much of the detail that the movie contains. This book had its high points based on a few passages with exceptional writing but for the most part I felt the story was very impersonal and I felt that the narrator was hiding from what was below the surface. If you want a good book that tells about a lot of things included in this book, I would highly recommend Manchild in the Promised Land by Claude Brown."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"This book was sooo super. It was very nutso to read and I'm a crazy guy. When he sodomized his teacher in that giant tub of potato salad I was like WHOA"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"Overcompensation for his fundamental assessment that he is unredeemed trash. Tedious, self absorbed, and boring in a way that only a life of getting a next fix or hustle can be...which means that the majority of Carroll's worldview is the stall of a public bathroom. The lame narrative contrasts with Trinity School days and the clean-cut world of athleticism and basket ball versus his rough trade street life is such an obvious transition anyone else would have fallen asleep before making it up as their effort to construct his life as a work of art. One suspects this poetry was originally written on toilet paper and should have been flushed. Unfortunately it was preserved; and the whole disgusting mess is served up here. Don't pollute your mind or give it any artistic credence."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW LONG THIS BOOK TAKES FOR SHIPPING IT ?? HOPEFULLY 24 HOURS... I CANT SEEM TO FIND THAT INFORMATION ANYWHERE ON THE PAGE.. PLEASE HELP ME IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION... THANK YOU.."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"Could have been interesting, but this book was so foul (language) I had difficulty staying with it. It has remained, unfinished, on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"The Basketball Diaries is sad because it's honest. It's gripping because it's real. I recommend this book that captures the life of talent gone to waste through the fall of addiction. Although it's not one of my all-time reads - you won't be dissapointed that you picked it up."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"The Basketball Diaries is an extraordinary book. It takes place in New York City during the mid 60's. The main character is Jim Carroll. He is a teenager who loves to play basketball and get wasted with his friends. As he grows older in the streets of New York, he becomes more and more of a junkie. I liked this book because it's so real. It made me laugh a lot, and at times I actually felt bad for Jim. His diaries were very well written and never left out any details. This book was definately one of the best books I've read so far, and I hope that after reading this review, many of you would pick up the book and see what all the fuss is about. I've read many books that just wasted my time and I just didn't enjoy, but The Basketball Diaries is one of the books that I absolutely DO NOT regret reading."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I read this book back in 1986 when I was 16 years old and ever since then I never had the urge to even consider expirementing with hard drugs. Jim Carroll Takes you down the downward spiral with him in this book. Just when you think it can't get any worse you turn the page and it does. this book is based on real events and there is no happy ending. you really get to see how far a junkie will will go for a fix. it shows you the dark, ugly, and oh so real side of drug addiction. I personally think every high school child in America should read this book then we might just win the so called war on drugs."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I found this book to be amazingly realistic and enjoyable. If I had to prefer a book to someone I would most likely prefer this one. The book is an amazing story about the hardships of growing up in the big city of New York and how so much that goes on is unknown to the people outside of the city. Unlike other books I have read, I found myself actually interested in it. I'm not the one to be reading books but this one was outstanding."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I would rate the book The Basketball Diaries by Jim Carroll a five because of its excellence. The book is a well written autobiography. The kids in the book are flibbertigibbets, and for this reason it will leave an indelible mark on you. I like the book because it kind of relates to my life as a boy because in the book Jim wants to just hang out with his friend and just have fun. The book is also about drug use, and that is also the main conflict in the story. The book talks about how the characters in the book, unlike me, get hooked on drugs, and how they get off them. The book is for people who like to hear stories because mostly this book is about life and how Jim Carroll aspires to overcome his addictions. The book describes a person who knows when to do right and when he needs to get away from someone or something. I really cannot say anything bad or disparaging about the book; the book was very good. I would not recommend this book to an older crowd. I think teens would like it more than adults because of all of the drug use, and it is a book that tells the life of a teenager. I think that the book was written to show teens his mistakes so that other teen would not do it. This is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"During the 1960s period, Jim Carroll was a young and rising star in the dark streets of New York City. This book records his experieces and chronicles his feelings of the ever-present city. As a poet, Carroll moves his way through life in the litural sense. He created himself through liturature. I read this book when I first saw the movie. I loved the movie and ordered the book. I started skimming through it a couple times, like the entries that happened in the movie. I read after that and when I finished, I let out a huge sigh and felt something come into me. I was hooked. I loved this book so much I now have all of his books. Many people will say that this book is dark, vulgar, and indescent. It is. I know. That's not how people should look at it. In the end of the book, when he gets out of jail and is sitting in the headquarters where junkies hung out, he wrote, &quot;I can feel the window light hurting my eyes. I got to go in and puke. I just want to be PURE.&quot; I loved this book, and if you read this, you'll see that he is a boy lost and looking for something PURE."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"A very entertaining tale of life as a youth on the streets of New York. The birth of a very talented author."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"i have never read a book that could capture living in New York and showing how it is to surive on the streets. Jim is an amazing writer and he put his life on display in a raw uncut masterpeice. Durgs, sex and living it up..."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"A quick, hip read. I am a slow reader, and yet wrapped this up in 2 days, both because of its interesting subject matter and its ease of reading. Carroll is very slick, and certainly precocious, having done by age 14 the kinds of things that make grownups blush. This book is worth a read just for the language- Carroll has a fluid writing style that incorporates all kind of street parlance, making for a kind of underground city primer for the uninitiated square like me."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"A review of kewl guy in NY. It realy changed my boaring life, now it is like a handbook 4 life. I like the idea of the Carrol's concept of life."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"The Basketball Diaries is an amazing book. It was very well written. Even though it was written over 30 years ago, the book isn't dated. Young people still face today many of the problems that the author had to deal with more than three decades ago. Today's teens can easily connect to the book because they feel in a similar way as the author did, too. Furthermore, it also helps today's youth to realize that drugs aren't all fun and that they can easily get addicted to narcotics, too, because the author gives an amazing insight of how living with a drug addiction is really like. He doesn't glorify the use of controlled substances, rather, he plain and simply writes the truth about drugs. The Basketball Diaries is the book I've ever read and I strongly recommend it to everybody!"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"Bought used and it is in great condition. A must read for anyone who enjoyed the movie adaptation, or any of Jim Carroll's writtings and music. A geat memoire of a recovering addict."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I had seen the movie and I wanted to see what the man was all about. For his life falling down all around him, he kept it together pretty good. A little repetitious at time, though."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I last read this book about 30 years ago, so my memory is a bit hazy (maybe cuz I read this book and thought Jim Carroll was a role model), but all that aside, it was a very interesting account of growing up in NYC in the 60's. The movie kinda sucked, but maybe that's my anti DeCaprio bias. If you want similar movies that are much better, try Trianspotting, or Drugstore Cowboy (both available, I'm sure, on Amazon). Anyway, I digress it is a very good book. Jim Carroll is a talented writer, and his decent into heroin addiction seems to be realistic, and honest. It's very short, maybe 150-200 pgs, not much more than a novella, so worth a read."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"Purchased this book as a gift for a friend. They really enjoyed reading this. Said it was great from start to end."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I first read this book when I was maybe fourteen or fifteen. It was the sole text that inspired me to become a writer. I'd never read honesty, brutality, and blatant coolness in a book before. I reread this book ten years later and I was still carried from the first page to the last in astounded joy. Carroll was a visionary of his time. This book is perfect for teenagers 14-18. It is a perfect memoir of Youth and a dark but thrilling look into Carroll's overly advanced growth process. Older readers will enjoy it but I recommend anyone over twenty interested to purchase it along with it's sequel FORCED ENTRIES: THE DOWNTOWN DIARIES. BASKETBALL DIARIES is a wonderful memoir and testament to being young, but FORCED ENTRIES is the more grown up, art-based collection of Carroll's journals. FORCED ENTRIES takes place during the Max's Kansas City days and downtown NYC art scene in the 70's along with Carroll's more self aware recollections and his trials with kicking heroin. DIARIES should be instituted into every 16 year olds school syllabus because it is the only cool thing those kids would ever be forced to read.Also! Don't bother with the movie. IT SUCKS. It'll make you sad how horribly Hollywood can butcher and sap up such a good story."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"You just feel grateful that someone like Carroll was able to survive and tell the tale so beautifully and with such honesty. He doesn't spare himself; he doesn't sentimentalize the drug addict's life--it's a work with a lot of integrity."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I have read this book twice since I have gotten it. I really like it a lot. This is not a book for your children though. It is pretty graphic about things. So if your a parent please read this first before letting your kid read it."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"Basketball Diaries doesn't sanitize anything, which is an unusual accomplishment. This book, you see, takes place in 1960's New York; a city of trash-strewn streets, dark and dangerous subways, filthy hallways, shady characters. It's the NYC of Taxi Driver, Death Wish, Kojak, Mean Streets, and all those films and tv shows that make us nostaligic for the Lindsay-Beam-Kotch era. By reading The Basketball Diaries, I felt as though I was smelling the vomit on the sidewalk!Jim Carroll was one of the few White teens in his Washington Heights neighborhood. His friends were a mix of Irish, Italians, Puerto Ricans, Blacks, etc, and the one thing they all had in common was that they were all low-lifes from broken homes. He goes to the exclusive Trinity School, plays basketball, gets hooked on heroin, and ends up prostituting himself to support his habit. From the very first diary entry, he's stepping in vomit everywhere he goes. The descriptions are so graphic, that when he mentions getting an STD, you can almost feel your nuts itch!Now you might ask, what is this book really about? Do we need to know about a teenager's hroin addiction? Do we need to hear about Times Square Theatres where transvestite prostitutes took their clients? Do we need a graphic description of of a kid shooting up with dirty needles and having sex with in a vomit-covered subway restroom?The answer is no, we don't need to hear any of this. But I read this book because I wanted to learn history. I wanted to know what Manhattan was like in the 1960's, who lived there, what the people did with their lives. I first read this back in 1995, when I was taking art classes at Pratt Manhattan. Soho had a certain charm in those days, because it was all art galleries and interesting stores. The streets were still grimy, but no longer unsafe. As I read this book, I wondered \\"where are all the places mentioned in the book?\\" They were still there, but they were all transformed.Manhattan has always been popular with single men and women, but not with families. I find that once the kids are old enough to run up and down the hall, the parents want more space, and end up moving to a house somewhere. Perhaps those of us who are born in Manhattan quickly forget what it's like to live in this city?"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I reads this book many years ago and wanted to reread it. I loved the story and the way it was told, firsthand and very gritty. A must read if you are interested in the New York City of the late sixties and early seventies."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I founnd that this was probably the best book that i have read in a long time. I found that I couldn't put this book down and that everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"i think young teens every were should read this best book since &quot;the outsiders&quot;it\`s a great story because teens can learn from jim carrols mistakes"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"This book{and movie} was so good! It was a very good lesson to me. It taught me not to get in the middle of drugs. It also shows that you DO get addicted and it is extremely hard to quit once you have started drugs. Al in all, I think you should read the book or rent the movie!"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"This book reveals a lot, and seems like it does, but when i was done, i craved to know more (and there is more in &quot;Forced Entries: The Downtown Diaries&quot;, but that's beside the point). It's amazing to look at his life, from his perspective, and see what he's done and what he's been through. You feel like a special guest of sorts, being allowed to learn all this information, which is sometimes scary, many times hilarious, and often very graphic. I would find myself reading this book in class, and laughing out loud at times, or often grimacing in surprise, or even an almost sort of pain- as if i were there. I often loved certain excerpts of it so much that i would share them with other people, just turning to whoever was nearest. I wish i could say i've always been a Carroll fan, but i, like many others, didn't find out about him until after seeing the movie of this same title. I immediately wanted more, and this book supplied what i wanted. It's incredible, and i am so glad i had a chance to read it."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"This book is definitely one of my favorites. I read it in literally 1 day, while at a garden and museum. It was impossible to put down. Carrol's depiction of himself at 15 was extremely interesting, and I would recomend this book to anyone, especially thse who think reading is boring . -Julia, age 14"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I am only twelve years old and I have not been exposed to much stuff about heroin, grass, and other drugs. But I saw beyond all that stuff in this book. It feels like you are looking through the eyes of Jim Carroll, and seeing his friends and enemies just as he saw them. This autobiography is like taking a piece of his life and living it. What I'm saying is, read the book. It is just awesome. I'd recommend this to boys and girls (I'm a girl) aged 13 or older or mature enough to handle R-rated content. -Salem Barona"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"This book altered my life to a certain degree,keeping my boots soiled &amp; twisting in the comforts of proper ground.He has a voice of his own,the voice of a precocious teenager who is always above the situation with an intelligence &amp; humility to back it up.The shrug attitude towards society &amp; morality,&amp; the elevation of events without inflating them towards the lines of ridicule,has become the hallmark of great counterculture writing,which to Carroll's distinct contribution he was able to add a new twist to this highly original genre.The words are undeniably hip,&amp; the magic that comes out of it is that it doesnt come out tired &amp; tried,rather a surmounting barrage that just keeps hitting to the end.The quest for purity wraps up the tale in a surprisingly contrasting depth of appropriateness."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I loved the movie and the book. It expresses the feelings of a teenage kid who thinks he has no way out of life except to take drugs. Jim Carroll was a good kid and a great author who found out that drugs were not the answer. I admire Jim Carroll and all that he has done. If I could say one thing to Jim, I would just say, &quot;I really admire you.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"Jim Carroll is an amazing poet. His teen years were filled with highs, sex, violence, and much more but despite all that he wrote. The book was amazing. I can't even count how many times I have read it. I recomend Forced Entries as well which is another dairy by Jim Carroll."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"After seeing the wonderful motion picture, I felt inclined to read the novel that inspired it. It was better than I expectated it to be.It's a great stroy, but can be very disturbing and even depressing. I highly reccomend it to you."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I admire Jim Carroll for publishing this diary the best and most effective way possible- the whole and solid truth, not doctored with fairy tell endings or caviar dreams. This book depicted what I would honestly believe to be the days of living on the streets and becoming a Heroin junkie in New York City in the late 60's.The truth was told and told passionatley and completley. Pretty picturesque references were not painted, disturbing scenes not alluded to. If something needed to be said, it was - no matter how hard it may be for the reader to accept. The most frightening thing about the entire diary is it allows you to see how easily this lifestyle can become your own, without really ever realizing or intending it to happen. I think most of socitey considers heroin junkies moraless, disgusting, putrid and empty souls; but Jim allows you to see into thier world, live in thier minds and have empathy for thier lifestyle. It sort of reminded me of 'A Clockwork Orange'; I viddy parallells between both protragonists and thier drogs. However, Jim Carroll didn't sell out at the end."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"This is a very compelling read that is excellently written. It is very unfortunate that someone had to live this life but at least they got away from it eventually. You do feel like you are following Jim Carroll through the ups and downs (there are many downs) of his teenage life. All in all a book that will never date and that everyone should get a chance to read."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"Jim Carroll started to write this diary when he was only 12 years of age. At this time, he was finding every drug he could could get into his hands and took his first shot of heroin when he was only 13 years of age. A dark book, in the juvenile sense, but in the poetic sense, a book about a excellent book about searching for something pure. A reviewer wrote, \\"I think that this book was written to tell other teenagers not to use drugs.\\" That's not true. It's a true story and merely a diary of truth. It became known as a biography for the rock star Jim Carroll. Another reviewer wrote, \\"This book is dark and vulgar.\\" It is. It is really. But if you look at the book this way, there's no reason you should be reading it. Think of it this way, Puke and Pure. At the last entry of the diary Jim is in the headquarters a place where junkies from all over hang out, totally zonked and saying, \\"I got to go in and puke. I just want to be pure...\\" To me, the diary is about a lost young poet trying to find redemption through writing and finds that, not at the end, but at the end of when he becomes pure. This diary is vulgar and dark. Many swear wrods come into place, and many sexual indescence is in this book. But in the end Jim, the young poet is looking for redemption through his writing and searching for something pure..."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I got this book as a gift an I was interested cause I had seen the movie, by within the first 5 pages, I was hooked. I read the entire book right away. It was so intense at times and so well worded that i fell in love with Jim Carroll. This book was about his life growing up in the cruel streets of New York exposing himself to prostitutes, drugs, and more drugs. He let us all deal with hard times with him by writing down his experiances in his diary. I loved this book. And for all of you people who think Leonardo DiCaprio has something to do with this book--forget it. He's not. They just put him on the cover and that's ALL."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I have to study this novel on my Sports Literature course at The University of Sheffield, England. I found that some of the other texts were based around training and preparation for, and the playing of, the game. THIS IS NOT BASKETBALL DIARIES! I picked up the book thinking that, with heart throb Leo on the cover, it would be a rags to riches tale of poor boy made good in the world of the NBA, full of moving (or vomit endusing) moments, and All-American clean living. How wrong was I? The novel is excellent! The game is secondary to drugs, homosexuality, and pedophillia. It is a chilling novel, but a fantastic read. I would recomend this book to anyone, except those who want to read about basketball, or those who want to buy it because of Leonardo's roles in Titanic and The Beach."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"The movie had NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with the book. Carroll's book is a hilarious and horrifying saga of his teenage years as an Irish-catholic high school basketball star(he even played against Lew Alcindor later to become Kareem Abdul-Jabbar)and full time heroin addict roaming the streets of 1960s New York hustling for money. It is also social satire of the most insightful and wicked kind, not only of a bygone era but of Americans in general. Just imagine, Carroll's entire reputation is based on what he wrote at 16 years of age! He's never been able to come close to matching the level of this little book in all the years since ('Forced Entries' is more of the same done not nearly as good)."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I knew of Jim Carroll, read some of his poetry and such. And then I saw the movie--and let me tell you, you have to see that one. So I finally got around to picking up the book. Carroll is unflinchingly honest (though I do suspect he took many liberties with the story) and the story is brutal. This book does not glamorize drug abuse, as it shouldn't. This is a book I'll be coming back to over and over."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"This odd mix of biography and novel takes some terrible situations and turns them into a quest for purity. You won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"Disturbing and illuminating glimpse into Jim Carroll's early teen years in NYC in the 60's. Carroll lays out the nitty gritty of his sordid doings with a easy going, fresh voice. I was at once repulsed and drawn into his tales of his increasing heroin dependency and means of feeding his addiction. Unlike most drug tales, Carroll simply presents who he is and what happened instead of sitting in judgement one way or the other. Riveting and candid; I wish all books were as good as this one."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"This book has to be the most fantastic and influential book I've read to date. I have been a fan of Jim's work for years, and he has inspired me enormously; only now is he getting the reprieve he deserves. Here's to you Jim!"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"The Basketball Diaries is a great book about a teenager in trouble. This book is very interesting and is like some teenagers' real life. You start reading it and think about how bad it really is for some teenagers in the world. While you are reading it you forget it is a true story because it sounds like a horror story people make up to convince kids not to do drugs . You don't really think about all the teenagers in the world that really have that problem with drugs. I really enjoy this book and I recommend it to all teenagers. It makes you really feel thankful for all that you have."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"Considering this is one of the few books i have read in my life time, and i'm 16 years old it was the best book i've ever read! I did see the movie first, and yes Leonardo is absolutely a rad actor. I thought the movie was wonderful. When i told my sister she got mad and found the book, she said she read at least 10 times.

I found that the book was even better, as always. You can't find fictitious books this well written. This book showed me a side of reality that I had never known; and yet I could still relate to it. After picking up the book and not being able to put it down until I was finished, I am now looking for more Jim Carroll books to interest me as much as this one did"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"By age 15, Jim Carrol has lived more than most people ever experience in thier closed off, fearful lives. Wow!!!"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"Probably one of the most powerful collections of writing I have yet to read. Carrol's life in itself is amazing, and although his diaries may seem a bit self-indulgent, the flair and clarity of his writing are unbelievable. His frankness and imagery are awesome. I don't think it is a book of self-discovery, but more a book of the everyday banality and decripity of a young boy, and his point-blank and brutal accounts of what life is really like. Read it for it's ability to paint a no frills picture of what Carrol subjected himself to, and be amazed that he ever made it past the 1960s"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I think that this book tells what it is like to live and grow up as Jim Carroll. It is a must read. It's easy to read and easy to understand. If you think the movie was good but the book is better. Even if you didn't like the movie, the book is that much better. Jim Carroll is a talented writer and musician. If you don't read this book you are missing a experiance of a life time. I must warn you though, it is graphic and does not sugar coat anything he did. Jim Carroll was no angel"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"The truth of an individuals character can only be realized when that individual is placed in the most difficult of positions. If you claim to be strong and honorable you will quickly know if this is true when you find your self in a state where only your wits can carry you to the next day. They call this natural selection? Maybe. The law of the land? Maybe. There is something to be said of Carroll's character after having lived the life he did especially during that time in a person's development. It is a joy to experience the growth of his writing parrallel his growth in life. A true insight into the soul of a creative individual"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"The Basketball Diaries documents the life of Jim Carrollduring his turbulent coming of age in New York City. Startingat age 12, the book illustrates the life of the poet and basketball player,while trying to find himself. Perhaps what makes these chroniclesso powerfull is the first hand account of Jim's addiction toHeroin, which lasteded until his early 20's.

Its set in New York in what I believe is the 70's. Jim Carroll, who is also the author, is the star of this book. He and his few friends go out to seek drugs and get caught up in the stuff that he would regret later on and for the rest of his life. I thought that it was the same thing over and over again. The story had no high points in that it was very depressing. You got to know the characters very well and the author was great at setting the scenes and getting you to picture them in their own world, the drug world. I would not recommend it to anyone under the age of 13 because it's hard to understand and you learn a couple things about drugs during the course of the book. I recommend it for people who are interested in what could happen to you if you continuously use drugs. I also recommend it to the people that are big fans of biographies and non-fictions."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"This book not only shows the naivity of ourselves, but it shows the strength of a kid living on the streets in New York. He is rough and poetic and thoughtful and Jim Carroll's real life description only brings the world closer to the hope that we might actually be able to survive in this limp world where the crazies roam with the starry eyed dreamers on the streets. Jim wrote with the grace of a cheetah."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"A book which reflects troubled youth in a way that very view actually achieve. It provides a rush of emotion which fluctuates as rapidly as Jim Carroll's life within presented within the diaries."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"The movie inspired me to read the book. Many people were reluctant to see the movie because they didn't think Leo DiCaprio would play a good part. He did a great job! For those who still won't see the movie, you have to at least read this incredible book. It's unforgettable...and that says a lot considering the hundreds of books I have read. This book has made me a big Jim Carroll fan. This book is based on his life. However, instead of getting stuffy background information and dates easily forgettable, you get a simple &quot;this is how it was.&quot; Since he is a poet, the book has a beautiful flow of words and vivid detail. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"I find it a bit disturbing to see a cutesy picture of Leonardo DiCaprio on the cover of this book. It's not the sort of things most suburban thirteen year old girls would enjoy. This is a sharp, funny, and undeniably exciting account of a guy who lived life like there was no tomorrow in NYC in the early 60's. Basically it's all sex, drugs, and rock and roll with some basketball thrown in idiosyncratically to demonstrate the straight life young Jim Carroll is throwing away. What makes it so good is the vividness of the descriptions. I think it would be harder for an older person to write so honestly and fearlessly as Carroll does here. Most of us have only occasional glimpses of the harsh clarity that pervades this entire book. I'm most reminded of Henry Miller, and to a leser extent William S. Burroughs. I'd happily give it 5 stars if it didn't make me so queasy."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"Just finished this book. Kind of quick, but never dull. There is no moment in this book where you yawn, is what I'm trying to say. Jim's hip writing style is so easy to read. It's almost as if he is just talking to you, and never in the book does he try to be clever, but the whole time he is years ahead of writers, twice his age. I think when the diary starts out Jim is like twelve, or something. Absolutely amazing! Worth your time!!"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"This is an interesting, disturbing, and ultimately uplifting read. I am sure while reading it you will alternatly laugh, and be in tears. It documents a great singer, Jim Carroll's life between the ages of 13 and 15. It is a hard read, not in the fact that it is two complicatedly written(the slang can be a prob, but a good Internet site on Jim will give you the meanings) but in that Jim speaks of horendous things with such calculated nonchalanty. But trust me, get THIS book."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"While I was quite familiar with who Carroll was from the book _Please_Kill_Me_, I just now got around to read The Basketball Diaries.I have to say I have mixed feelings. Carroll's writing impressed me not so much for his style (although it serves him quite well) as for the sometimes gruesome honesty he has in describing his teenage years. To be sure, this is not for the faint of heart; to his credit, Carroll doesn't pull back from any subject--jail, dope, basketball, gay hustling, brutal crime. However, the upsetting thing about the book is that all this living on the edge left me feeling quite numb.Still, this is probably for the best; you take away from a story like this when you start to moralize. While reading this, I kept thinking about a supposedly anonymous autobiography called Go Ask Alice, which was a very heavy-handed (and probably fictional) description of a teenage girl's descent into drug addiction. Ironically, both this book and The Basketball Diaries describe roughly the same time period. What makes Carroll's book superior is that he doesn't offer up tired admonitions such as \\"Just Say No\\"; he doesn't even solicit your pity when he occasionally ends up in jail. Instead, he let's you make your own judgements, like he himself does when he concludes that when you get right down to it, being a junkie is a nine-to-five job, just like anything else.For those who can handle some disturbing scenes and subject matter, this is as realistic a look at youth, drugs, and sex, as you're going to find."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"When i checked out this book i thought hey it's a movie i'll just watch the movie but for some odd reason i started to read the book and liked it! The book i read was THE BASKETBALL DIARIES by Jim Carroll. It was a good younge adult or maybe a mature teen book. The story is the diary of Jim Carroll about his struggle with addiction. His playing basketball and his desire to be pure. I have never really read a book like this before but compared to most books i've read it's a whole lot bolder. When i first started reading this book i thought hey he said the F word but then i found out theres so much more to it and the language doesnt make it the good piece of literature that it is. This book is a good book and it really made me think about my life and was i in control of it. Most people would say this book is mainly about a kid doing drugs but i believe the book is mostly about a kid and his struggles to be pure. On page 210 his quote &quot;Then i stand up to puke, I just want to be pure....&quot;. Jim Carroll Has a great style of writting and i will be looking in to reading another one of his books. I liked this book but it is a very volgur book with alot of sex related situations alot of drug use and a whole lot of bad language. If this type of writting offends you i strongly suggest reading something different."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"All I can say is that I just saw the tediously boring &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; and at least Jim has a sense of humor. Another thing about Jim: at no point does he feel sorry for himself. I thought Aronofsky would never top the terrible film &quot;Pie&quot; but he did. His utterly humourless movie &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; prompted me to think about the diaries. The Basketball Diaries makes everything in its genre look sickeningly lame by comparison. Some stories are told. This is one of them. Any book about adolescent drug use must first go through this one, and, not surprisingly, most of them look embaressingly stupid when held up to this biting, if sordid and depressing, tale of woe."},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries","review":"Anyone who talks about the &quot;good old days&quot; has a faulty memory. The aketball diaries shows us how bad manhattan really was in the 1960's-pimps, prostitutes, trannies, drugs, pediphiles, teenage junkies. In this panoramic memoir we traverse the worst city at the side of a trinity school basketball star who is losing his talent to a growing heroin habit. I read this book at 16, right when the movie came out. When i later saw the film yhought it ... Dicaprio's performance was fine, but does no justice to the character, or what he stands for. One of the best things here is that Carrorl doesn't make any excuses for himself. he doesn't blame his addiction on anyone. but we can still get a good idea of his environment. This book is so atmospheric, you can almost smell the garbage in the streets. Try renting Taxi driver, the french connection, Taking of the pelham 123, mean streets, or tv shows like hil street blues and the equalizer. You will see how awfull this city was between 1960-1990. Remember, there were NO good old days!"},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"Concerning the physical nature of the merchandise, I was happy but not absolutely impressed at the nature of the 'packaging.' The text was well-bound (all four volumes), though there were bits of glue that had seeped out from the spine (which was easily peeled off to no detriment to the book); this was also the case with the same publisher's book The Three Kingdoms. The box which holds the four volumes is poorly constructed, but since it does not see much use it does not bother me too much. However, it comes apart very easily and unless it is re-glued (or maintained through some other method) it will quite literally fall apart on you. The actual books are much more stable and well-printed, even though the paper (also like The Three Kingdoms) is nothing short of being rice paper.The text itself is wonderful. I have scarcely read such intriguing material which captures my attention so easily. I can only think of a few other authors who have managed to do as such (Dante Alighieri comes to mind). If the reader has read The Three Kingdoms, however, and expects to find a similar story, they will be disappointed. Whereas The Three Kingdoms focuses more on the warfare and the political intrigue on a macroscopic scale (the politics between the three dynasties) with character development seen only connected with the overall plot, this tale tends to focus much more sharply on the development of the characters individually before it gets to the major plot line. It is, however, still a wondrous masterpiece, and should be highly recommended to all who partake of classical literature."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"Stunning portrayal of 14th century china. Intertwining tales of bold heroes, corrupt officials, jealous lovers, and chivalrous martial artists. I have never enjoyed another book as i've enjoyed this one. Will leave you wanting more! A must read!!!"},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"I have seen great things said about \\"Outlaws of the Marsh\\" and I agree with them. I especially laud the translation as successful though I haven't read others. The book was written in the 14th century in \\"colloquial style\\" Chinese (similar to modern speeches), in contrast to \\"literary style\\" Chinese which contains its own set of grammer and vocabulary (almost impossible to understand to people unlearned in that format). This book follows a very colloquial approach and the occasion use of some ribaldry which I deem to be essential in conveying the nuance of the original. Regardless,there is a certain loss in the conveyance of its 14th century time setting and that is only inevitable due to the particular nature of the Chinese laguage.After the good things said, I have to make a few warnings of the politically incorretness in this book which I don't necessarily consider the downsides of the book if not the valuables in a historical and anthropological sense.First of all, the villains and churls in this book are the protangonists indeed and this is even unusual in Chinese literatures of background alike. Violence is imbued throughout the book and the deaths are the most gruesome as our heroes are but blood-thirst men of desparation. A Chinese idiom puts it well in particular as regards this book: The young ought not to read \\"Outlaws of the Marsh\\" and the old ought not to read \\"Three Kingdoms\\". The reason behind this is that the former involves too much violence for the testosterone-driven mind of youth, and the latter involves too much shrewdness for the calculative mind of maturity.Secondly, there is an advocacy of misoginistic brotherhood in this book. Women are spoken of as properties all the time and it is overtly states many a time that women of \\"impropriety\\" should be disposed off quickly, especially since women are nothing but trouble in general. However, the camaraderie portrayed here is quite an honorable thing - reminds of the New Testment as everybody is a brother therein.Again please do not rage or regard these as drawbacks."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"Great to be able to get books like this.

It is not the content I'm complaining about, but the writing. It is so lousy that it will take away from your enjoyment of the story.The story is compelling but there is a few things that bothered me about it:1) whenever the main character (of the moment) gets in big trouble, his predicament is always bailed out by some incredible coincidence that his assailant (or antagonist at the moment) is actually a friend or knows a friend of his. It is ALWAYS like that, throughout the book.2) the characters in the book, whether they are righteous or unrighteous, always get lauded as heroes. You can have a despicable character and yet he is respected among his peers...why?

However, in the beginning of the second volume, it starts to get a little crazy. The protagonists are constantly drunk or eating mountains of meat. They are often crude and without reason, acting like bullies to those who do not sate their appetites. There are several events that make the protagonists extremely unlikable. It is outrageous how one of the protragonists would stick his neck out to help one organized crime boss over another, thinking that he is actually doing something righteous. In another instance that same character not only takes revenge on those who wronged, but also kills the women and children that live with them. He goes on to kill several more innocent people, and all the while gets off scott free. I just couldn't read anymore after that."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"If you read one saga in your life, you would die happy having read Outlaws of the Marsh. This is a particularly good translation and edition in that they take perhaps eight or ten different versions of this story and pack it all together in one bit so you get more quality tale for the buck. Mr. Shapiro even discusses the differences between several of the versions in the beginning of the book.The saga takes you through a few decades of this roaming band of Chinese warriors in a land of corruption and evil. Though they are no angels themselves (in fact they are demons on Earth), they fight together for loyalty and honor in the name of the Emperor during the Song dynasty.The descriptions of the battles are vivid and enthralling, and the window into the culture of that time is truly something to cherish.An ancient story such as this is not something to be taken lightly, though it has plenty of humor, sorrow, and action to captivate the attention of all ages. Characters such as Sagacious Lu, Stumpy Tiger Wang, and Liu Kui the Blackwhirlwind, will forever be a part of you in your travels. Chairman Mao, himself, actually carried this book with him during the Long March in China as a constant reminder of the proud traditions of the Chinese people.[Revised Edit]From reading some of the other reviews, I think I've come to a realization. For readers, Outlaws of the Marsh and Romance of the Three Kingdoms are a little bit like 1984 and Brave New World. Hear me out, doubters. If you read Brave New World first, you tend to have a pretty strong dislike for 1984, and vice versa. Those who've read Romance of the Three Kingdoms may pick up Outlaws of the Marsh expecting something similar in style. If that's what they're after, they'll be disappointed. I however read 1984 first, as well as Outlaws of the Marsh. Therefore, I couldn't even stand to finish Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Like it or not, Outlaws of the Marsh is truly one of a kind. You'll likely finish it like I did, wanting even more, but realizing that you've just eaten the very last Twinkie on the planet. Except here, you can just go back and reread it all over again."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"\\"Outlaws of the Marsh\\" provides a fascinating look into 14th century Chinese literature- and thus the minds of 14th century Chinese the story was intended to entertain. The story was extremely popular in its day, for many of the same reasons that it endures as a stunning example of Chinese story telling today.An excellent example of 14th century Chinese vernacular literature, \\"Outlaws of the Marsh\\" has been a favorite of Chinese readers for over 600 years. This riveting story has endured the centuries for a very good reason. It contains elements that captivate even today's jaded audiences: deception, violence, murder, gangs, and drunken revelry. Rife with charismatic heroes, scheming beauties, wild troublemakers and corrupt officials, the story brims with interesting characters and plot twists. The outlaws of Liangshan Marsh, societal outcasts drawn together by their misdeeds, form an almost super-human collective against the unjust (sort of like a precursor to Robin Hood). The story is peopled with rash, violent men; lusty, evil-minded beauties; upstanding men of honor fighting for what is right; well-meaning yet dangerous oafs; and corrupt, tyrannical officials.

Some believe that Luo Guanzhong, author of &quot;San Guo Yan Yi&quot;/&quot;Three Kingdoms&quot;, is either the co-author or editor of &quot;Shui Hu Zhuan&quot;.Although the novel is around 600 to 650 years old, the story is about how 108 men and women became the heroic outlaws of the Marsh of Mount Liang (Liangshanbo) during the reign of Emperor Huizong of Northern Song Dynasty (1101-1125), i.e. more than two centuries before the completion of the novel."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"An evil ruler has imposed a tyrannical reign of terror over his impoverished subjects. An intrepid band of resourceful men and women, driven into hiding, have formed themselves into an outlaw army dedicated to restoring the rule of law and justice. If this seems eerily like Robin Hood and his Merrie Men, forget about Sherwood Forest and look halfway around the globe: this story takes place in twelfth-century China. Written by Shi Nai'an and Luo Guanzhong, and magnificently translated by Sidney Shapiro, &quot;Outlaws of the Marsh&quot; is a stirring tale about the struggles of common people standing up for themselves against an overpowering oppression.Chinese history tells us that the outlaws of the Shantung Province marshes really existed; the story that comes down to us is based on their legendary exploits during the reign of the Sung emperor from 1101 to 1125. Sidney Shapiro's translation, neither too formal nor overly colloquial, preserves the original vernacular and brings the book vividly to life, while preserving such typically Chinese features as the double-sentence chapter headings, and chapter endings telling the reader to &quot;Read the next chapter if you would know&quot; what is about to happen next.The book is a rousing, old-fashioned action/adventure story, with lots of blood, gore, and battle scenes. Sagacious Lu, Stumpy Tiger Wang, and the other marsh outlaws are no angels, any more than Robin Hood, Little John and the other Sherwood Forest gang were, but they represent the good guys as brothers in arms against a corrupt government. &quot;Outlaws of the Marsh&quot; has been adapted into films, picture books, puppet shows, and at least one American novel called &quot;All Men are Brothers&quot; by Pearl S.

Thanks to those electronic annoyances, I have found a wealth of knowledge of mythology and literature, in particular, Chinese literature. So parents, let your kids play!Let me explain. About ten years ago, I stumbled across a video game called the \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\". A fascinating game, I was even more interested in this panoply of Chinese warlords vying for control of the great empire. Lo and behold, I come to find out that indeed this source for this game is an ancient Chinese classic.Fast forward. Having played the \\"Suikoden\\" games, I began to grow interested in this notion of the 108 stars of destiny. Again, I look, and I learn of another Chinese classic, the \\"Outlaws of the Marsh\\" (or Shui Hu Zhuan). Needless to say, I learned more about Chinese culture from two video games than from the Orientalist claptrap that was taught to us in high school and college.Oh, you don't play video games? Well, let's get down to the book! The \\"Outlaws\\" are a group of 108 which band together to fight in the name of the emperor and against government corruption during the Song dynasty. While certainly far from angelic, these people nonetheless fight for the Song dynasty as they are hunted as outlaws by the various nefarious factions of the corrupt Chinese empire. The book chronicles their tales. For example, we learn of Lin Chong, an arms expert whose wife is desired by the evil marshall Gao's lecherous son. Teaming with Lin's childhood friend and oath brother Lu, Gao and his soon manage to gain a death sentence for the righteous Lin. However, Lin escapes their plot and joins up with the other outlaws. Many such stories are chronicled in this fine work, which shares an author (Luo Guanzhong) with \\"Three Kingdoms\\".All in all, I loved this book, and place it highly among my favorite works. While not quite as engaging as \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" (which I consider the greatest piece of literature ever created), \\"Outlaws of the Marsh\\" certainly deserves a place on any educated person's shelf. Also, Shapiro's translation displays a grat deal of the ancient wit found in the classic, and the woodcut images provide an interesting look into Ming dynasty art. My only desire is that one of these days, our schools will have children read some of these tales, rather than the works of Pearl Buck (it seems reasonable to allow people their own impressions of ancient China rather than giving them the observations of another Westerner)."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"I loved this book, it is fast, exciting and truly engaging! Even though it is a loooOOooong story, and the story grows to epic proportions in a not-too-organized fashion very quickly; it deserves five stars simply for its character and plot development, and how it carries over one hundred main characters without losing any story!

That's a justifiable complaint, and I would be lying to not say that some of the things that happened in the novel completely shocked me. But all these things are there as background for the true theme of the novel, that of brothers-in-arms.This \\"novel\\" is more like a nation-creation story on the lines of \\"The Song of Roland\\" or \\"The Iliad\\". The 108 heroes in the novel, charged with \\"killing rapacious villains and greedy officials\\" are an embodiment of the ideal of justice. And, furthermore, they are very cool. You have to admire a book whose chapters have had martial arts styles named after them. Although you'll detest them for killing entire families and razing whole cities, you'll also never not admire these guys when one of them, by himself, goes off to storm a city just for the sake of a friend.And, if I have a kid, I'm definitely buying this book for him once he's 13. It's a great story, with great characters, but, most importantly, instead of the cynicism and other tripe that he'll have gotten from the media, this book at least makes it cool to be patriotic, to have duty, to do suicidal things in the name of honor.If you can get past the gore, you'll actually find one of the better lessons on morality and honor that's around."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"When you put elegant Chinese prose with an exciting, twisting story, what do you get?

By the end of the 2000 odd pages it is easy to forget that the first half was so exciting and fast-paced.As for the translation itself, it is not too bad. Some translations make the characters out to be villains whereas Shapiro's translation takes a more neutral approach. The printing is on very thin, delicate paper with lots of typing errors and as such is a bit disappointing. There are also some paintings reproduced in the text but these are of very low quality."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"My admiration and respect for this book grows each time I come across it on t.v or writings.The violence in this book is one that stands out to many people. However, to me, it is not the violence, but certainly the legend being lay out before those who willing to accept that it was their destiny to be fulfilled. It is beyond the understanding of violence. in fact, it wasn't violence at all. the violence was forced out off them. violence was one that was put out by the culture in which their time requires them to be. They were guided by stars in their individual rights. Their prowess and virtue were certainly a period that cannot easily match or compare with by any other time, but maybe except the romance three kingdoms period. This story is much more than a mere period in time, it was an epic struggle for truth and justice in the face of violence that society has brought on to them. Brotherhood was built upon one thing, that is loyalty and honor. Their brotherhood was set upon one purpose in life, for glory. the glory that makes what legends all about. These people had nothing to lose, for many the brotherhood is all they have. For many reasons there, and what society had taken from them, they had managed to survive and upheld what is long lost and disappearing in this time, that is an ideal hero. In a period of chaos , heroes will arise, and so came the 108 heroes. Their individual abilities, prowesses, stories, and deeds left an imprint on this world shown being the brightest stars in heaven. what came to be an end, came to be a legend, the legend of 108 heroes was passed along through time."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"Classic literature, and readable at that, but I only read the first 1000 or so pages. That's about half. As is common in Chinese literature, the Outlaws of the Marshes, also know as Water Margin is thematically repetitive. The same basic pattern repeats for many of the outlaws and I just didn't feel the need to read 1000 more pages of slaughter, mayhem, marauding, debauching, and prison breaks with the same general twists repeating.On the other hand, if you are a scholar of Chinese history and literature, it is possible to derive certain insights about the social climate and views based on the events depicted since it is a major work of Ming dynasty literature."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"This 14th century Chinese novel is simply one of the most entertaining reads I've had in a while.

A chinese classic is now accessible by English readers with just 1-click."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"Having slogged through part of the original Chinese in college, I was pleased to be able to breeze through this competent translation"},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"This is a book that makes the reader boil with emotions. It begins by showing how each main character became an outlaw. The things that some of the characters go through are very bitter. Some of the protagonists are crooks who are not likeable at all. But some of them are true heroes, and it's tragic that people like them are forced to become outlaws in such a dark and corrupt society. It makes you think of life, of society, of the relationship between people. Hundreds of pages are not enough to say it all."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"Overview: Outlaws of the Marsh is an entertaining novel chronicling the lives of 108 men and women forced into brigandry by injustice.Setting: The story takes place in China during the Song Dynasty.Theme: While many criticize it for the brutal justice which the outlaws enact, one ought to acknowledge that Song China was a different place at a different time and thus the opinion on what is due to someone differs from the common view of the average English reader. With this acknowleged, one can view the book as an interesting way of learning the culture, beliefs, and character of both Song China and the China of when the book was created. While this novel (very lightly) touches on Buddhist and Taoist transcendental philosophy, it primarily praises justice, loyalty, and honor.Characters: Although the novel has 108 protagonists, only about fifteen need to be remembered. Each of the main characters is wonderfully developed and his or her personality is learned through their speech and action rather than a tersely put paragraph about their personality and claim to fame. The author stays within bounds of making the badguys only as bad as they need to be.Plot: With many interlocking plots, some are good, some are bad. The deepest vein of plot, that of leader Song Jiang, coincidentally follows the standard Nietzschean conflict of a man striving for excellence hated by those who envy and fear him, something which will endear the Western reader to this hero. At times, the author uses the deux-ex-machina excessively, replacing heroes deeds with the favors of gods. Some incidences are far fetched but comical and ought to be read that way. It could most easily be read as a light-hearted, sometimes farcical Robin Hood-esque tale. Nonetheless, it has the standard ending to a Chinese novel.Style and Language: The language is relatively simple, probably about the level of a newspaper. This makes it accessible to a non-academic audience (including those unversed in Chinese traditions). The translator avoids excessive technical terms and those that he does use he explains in notes.Recommended?: The novel is violent, but those with an interest in martial arts or military will find it exciting. Because of its importance to Chinese culture, it is worth the read."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"I couldn't believe this story was written in the 13th century! The structure read like a modern novel. You won't be disappointed with the adventures that these characters get into. It is also a nice insight into ancient Chinese thought about political legitimacy and virtue. While very gory at times, this book really shows you how the ancient chinese thought. The morals are also applicable to today."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"Outlaws of the Marsh is an absolutely engaging action-adventure experience! The characterizations are detailed and personal, and one never gets bored of their exploits. The translation (Sidney Shapiro) of this four volume, 2200 page novel is also very good, in some places it is downright hysterical! Never mind the spelling errors and such, the characters and the story more than make up for it.Even today we can see this great Chinese Classic novel's influence on the next generation - as the Playstation video game console has put out about five role playing games based on this novel alone (the \\"Suikoden\\" video games). Yes, I would indeed say that Outlaws of the Marsh has withstood the test of time in its 700 years of existence."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"Actually I read this book in Chinese version for uncountable times, in general we, the Chinese, read it for fun without much rethinking on what is right and what is wrong. For me, I read it when my brain does not work so I would like something different to refresh my brain.This time, I read this novel in English version compared with Chinese version line by line. Actually I feel that the translator knows the Chinese language better than me, because many nuances, when I read in Chinese version I do not pay attention because of strange and unusual words, were translated. These translations even help me to better understand those Chinese words.It is a pity that many poems in Chinese version were not translated in English version, some of those poems in fact reflect what the authors considered the behaviors of protagonists and what the authors viewed on Chinese society. Certainly those poems are extremely difficult to translate."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"Let us put away the culture, literature content of this novel, this book is about Democracy and revolution too. This novel spread like a fire in the past, when China was ruled by Imperialist system, every Emperor forbade people to read this novel, not because its violent content, but a message encourage warriors and people to fight against corrupt government, officials and of course the emperor, his system. However many people privately hand copied the novel, and not many people could possess a whole novel, often each family held a few chapters, and family and close friends must borrow to read. If local official found out, they would confiscate it, that often many officials hid it in their chamber so they could enjoy it, some burn it publicly, and the emperor knew that it could not be wiped out, so he hired some scribes wrote another novel, called \\"Wipe Out the Outlaws\\" to fight this campaign, and later the government realized that no one buying the \\"Wipe Out the Outlaws\\", so he ordered the scribes to add more chpters as what we have today, the original version ends after all 108 heroes gathered and they voted their own head, Song Jiang (that's the message this novel carries). But today's version tells that all these heroes surrender to the government and worked for government to fight against other groups of bandits, and these all works of scribe, and during hundreds years of underground circulation, public never knew the political trick of it, so many people were happy that they got some chapters, and the whole novel ends in a dream, and those who read more novel may find that this was not done by one or two authors, the latter stories two simple, and beginning so detail and vivid, etc. coz this novel holds its own history and battle. Today, this book got several versions, and survived many \\"wipe out\\" campaign, even in Qing Dynasty government tried to burn this book a few times, that no publishers publish it and officially proclaimed it's forbidden. In 19th Century, Chairman Mao shew the media and people that he carried this novel during his long march and civil war of China 1937 - 1949, that he wanted public to know that he was a representative of people, a people's revolution, a leader of democratic voice, that was his reason. There is only one novel that glorifies warriors (mainly common working people got squeezed for whole life, and one day got drunk and venting and killed a bad corrupted official, and could not go home, and start to hide, wander, and one day felt they are not gonna live like these and start to fight). It's a very entertaining novel, a great literature, a culture adventure, and a political message too. There is only thing most western readers would not like is the violence, but readers have to mind that the mentality of the author was not in today's western democratic society, the all people protected and government by Law, but in Song dynasty, the local officials could do a lot things that people have to suffer, a writer grew in such environment saw and experienced so many unspeakable events that just to make his characters so mad, hell mad, like Li Chong, Wu Song stories in this novel. So enjoy it, and cheer for the original author, his wisdom and courage."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"This book was a lot of fun to read.

They altogether beat back every chance of the evil government from removing them from power. I'll be straight up the government and the empire at this time in China was doing terrible and was ruining peoples lives as this took place. After many of these 108 outlaws became wronged by the government they all by chance joined together and oppose the evil song empire with the help from geniuses like: Gongsun Sheng and Wu Yong.

Jeez, 3 generations of my family were brought with the stories from these 4 literatures. If you want to know Chinese culture, history, customs, philosophies, disciplines, etc, definitively you need to own these books."},{"Title":"Outlaws of the Marsh/Chinese Classics/Boxed Set","review":"I wasn't sure how I'd react to this book. Well before I got my Kindle, I was at a Chinese book store in NY and was tempted to buy and English translation. The salesman suggested I might have trouble following it and suggested \\"Three Kingdoms\\" instead, which I bogged down with in print but eventually read through with my Kindle and I posted a review here on Amazon). Having been fascinated by \\"Three Kingdoms,\\" and having honed my ability to slog through one of these epics, I then decided to take a shot at this one and actually found it a much easier read. Yes, there are a lot of characters to keep track of in Outlaws, but I found it manageable with a bit of help from Wikipedia and a couple of other sites dedicated to this work, but also because each incident is better developed with a better grasp of what's important and what's not.As to the substance of Outlaws . . . Wow! This is an incredibly thought-provoking book, one that may have been way ahead of its time.Clearly, you want to root for the outlaws. The book is set up such as to drive readers in that direction and it's incredibly hard to resist. Character development isn't as intense as it is in our modern post-Freudian literary world, but it's still pretty good more often than not, enough so as to prevent us from brushing these people off as mere criminals and recognizing the genuine good that is in them; a lot more good than we find in many others who lead so-called law-abiding respectable lives. (Many bureaucrats and military officers of the Song dynasty would feel quite at home in the petty, stalemated early 21st century U.S. Congress.)Then again, it's unmistakably clear that these outlaws did bad things; sometimes in the heat of passion, other times due to habitual need for anger management, and other times as a thoughtful response to events. Even the most liberal-minded among us today would be very hard pressed to simply look the other way and say \\"Forget it.\\"There are no easy answers in this book. Even when you think you've decided where you stand, there's still likely to be a bit of discomfort, an awareness that you may find your belief hard to live comfortably with.My Chinese in-laws tell me it's true that this work as well as the other three great epics are widely read and admired today in China (\\"Three Kingdoms,\\" \\"Journey To the West,\\" and \\"Dream Of The Red Chamber\\"). The Mao-era Communist Party was uncomfortable with them and during the Cultural Revolution, my then-young brother in law had to read these stealthily at night. Now, the epics are again out in the open.It's unfortunate that we in the West are so unfamiliar with these epics. If I were teaching a university-level class in sociology in general or criminology in particular, Outlaws would be required reading along with such works as \\"Crime and Punishment\\" and \\"An American Tragedy.\\" Outlaws is a very worthy part of a true global literary cannon. (And by the way, this isn't just an anti-West multi-cultural rant. The Chinese miss a lot by not knowing our classics; I'm trying to find Chinese translations of Homer, etc. for my in-laws.)In any case, I very enthusiastically recommend \\"Outlaws Of The Marsh\\" (just as I do \\"Three Kingdoms\\" and I'm about 20% of the way through \\"Journey To The West\\" and . . . well, I'll review this, too, when I'm done, but the first 20% is definitely five-star material)."},{"Title":"The Oxford Bookworms Library: Stage 1: 400 Headwords Mary, Queen of Scots","review":"Great story for students who are learning English. Students always love to read interesting stories and this one is simple but well done."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"Third in the Covert-One series, this novel opens with a literal bang. Someone has destroyed with explosives one of the laboratory buildings in the famed Pasteur Institute. Not only is the building leveled, but also in the raging fire that followed, the world's first DNA or molecular computer was destroyed as well as its creator Dr. Emile Chamberland. For Covert-One agent Jon Smith the attack is personal as his good friend Dr. Marty Zellerbach was gravely injured. In addition, because of some very strange events surrounding military communications, there is a possibility the computer was not destroyed and may be in the hands of terrorists.Soon, Jon Smith arrives in Paris and finds his good friend lying near death in a coma. In fact, Jon Smith arrives just in time to prevent a second murder attempt on his friend's life. At the same time, someone apparently using the new computer manages to bring down the entire United States utility and communication grids. Deaf and blind, the United Sates stands vulnerable to attack and the terrorists seem to be seeing how much havoc they can cause before they launch their final cataclysmic strike. With the fate of the world in the balance as well as his friend's life, Jon begins to follow the complex trail to the terrorists and their secret lair.While that is the premise of what could have been a very enjoyable book, the execution is fatally flawed. Despite it's Bond style ending, much of this book commits the cardinal sin for any thriller. Boredom. This book is an incredible flat, dull read and quite a disappointment. This book is work to read and becomes a long march through the mud of boredom to reach the closing fifty pages that are mediocre at best.While for long time readers of the late Robert Ludlum it has always been clear that this series did not stand up to Ludlum standards, the other two novels were at least fairly enjoyable. Both The Hades Factor (Coauthor Gayle Lynds) and The Cassandra Compact (coauthor Philip Shelby) while overwritten at times featured plenty of action and engaged the reader at least somewhat. However, in this novel, the overwriting is extremely prevalent throughout the novel and the read is entirely flat and without emotion. Even in scenes where, for example, terrorists are attacking Marty's hospital room, the sense of emotion or nerve-racking danger prevalent in Ludlum works is nowhere apparent.The boredom factor is enhanced by the fact that released as a large trade paperback; this novel is 425 pages long. One gets the sense that the authors were paid by the word. Or that Gayle Lynds was unable to correctly follow Robert Ludlum's famous multi hundred plus page outline to properly create the work. The result is a novel that is seriously weaker than the first novel of the series, which she co-authored, and a sign that the series may die without the influence of the legendary master."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"No Spoiler Here. I am not done, but I am almost done, I'm far enough to have read the climax. It is a good book. Not great. The characters seemed a bit off. Randi didn't have enough contempt for Jon and so wasn't sassy enough. Jon didn't miss his widow enough and he didn't seem to have many inner battles. I liked what the author did with Marty."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"I was thinking how to review this book, and since it is a part of the covert one series, I think making a very short pros-and-cons list will be the most effective way.Pros- Most of the characters, both recurring and specific to the Paris option, are interesting and either likeable or threatening.- There seems to be something mystical and deeper about Mauritanias personality than surfaces in the book. It keeps you wondering what he will do.- The main frame of what you expect when you buy a spy novel is also what you get with the Paris option. The problem is in the details.Cons- As stated above this is a spy novel, and the genre assumes a certain degree of believability. Yet the abilities of the DNA-computer, which is what the story revolves around, seem more like fairy tale magic than anything remotely possible.- The author fails to create the sense of emergency which is vital to keep you turning the pages. Leaving the book on your night table a few days will not be a problem.- The plot is rather predictable, and most of your guesses may turn out to be right on track.

Another example: Marty gets the bright idea of posting a message on the internet in an attempt to find out how to rescue Jon Smith who is bound and gagged by the bad-guys ... Peter (MI6) and Randi (CIA) agree that this is a great idea. How stupid is this??? The man is captured and they are going to give him a laptop with keyboard and internet access???

I found it to be quite difficult to keep from throwing it in the round file before I finished it. I did give it a two star rating because it did keep my interest albeit boring. I think Robert Ludlum's name should not be on any book not authored by him. Now that this great mystery writer is dead, publishers should not be allowed to use his name to sell books. If his name had not been on the cover of the book, I would not have purchased it. I assume that he had made outlines of the three Covert One novels before he died and the co-authors went from there. This particular one should have been in the Science Fiction section of the bookstore instead of the Mystery Section."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"In spite of Robert Ludlum's name taking up half the front cover of this book, this is skeletonized Ludlum, with the flesh filled in by a writer that lacks his talents.The plot is Ludlumesque: the explosion of the Pasteur Institute in Paris leaves a brilliant scientist, Emile Chambord, missing and another, Martin Zellerbach, in a coma. Zellerbach happens to be a close friend of Lt. Col. Jon Smith, our hero from the other 2 Covert-One novels. Conveniently, Smith is working on a DNA computer, doing researach similar to what his friend Marty and Chambord were working on. But there appears to be sinister elements at work here by groups unknown. The future of the world is at risk, and Smith and his cohorts must find the missing Chambord and thwart the evil forces' plot to destroy the US and alter the future of the world. The plot, in and of itself, is no worse than most other Ludlum thrillers. Unfortunately, the plot alone isn't enough to make me enjoy a novel. The writing has to hold the plot together. In reverse, good writing can overcome a mediocre plot and hold my interest until the end.The writing in this book is very distracting by its overdescription of everything. It would be OK to tell us once that Jon is carrying his favorite gun--a Sig Sauer. But to keep referring to it that way is annoying. Much of the dialogue appears to be added superfluously to ensure the reader is not left confused. In addition, I am not all that interested in the minute detail of what each character is wearing. Laughably, it reminded me of old Nancy Drew Mysteries (\\"Nancy rushed upstairs to change into a light shift and matching pumps\\"). I would rather imagine to myself that Jon is a tall, good looking guy who is pretty physically fit. But the constant descriptions of his \\"muscular body\\" or \\"his strong arms slicing through the water\\" made me want to gag.Our heroes were a fairly likeable bunch, and familiar from the last 2 Covert-One novels. Randi's relationship with Jon seems like it might go somewhere by the 5th book in this series. Peter is quite 007-ish, a'la Roger Moore when he started getting older, and Marty is funny in his constant seriousness. The baddies are left fairly undefined, including the surprise head baddy, whose motivation once explained, remains murky.This novel could not hold my interest, and I was ready to toss it into the \\"already read\\" pile. But I perservered, and things did pick up in the 3rd section. By this time, everything had been well explained so the monotonous overdescription of everything seemed to improve. The pace of the book quickened, and perhaps knowing resolution was near kept me involved.I have nothing against Gayle Lynds, and to be honest, know absolutely nothing about her or her work. I do know plenty about Ludlum, however, and this book does not read like the novels he wrote alone. Since people buy books based on the name plastered across the front, it is fair for us to expect what we've enjoyed in the past. When it falls short, it's only natural to blame the co-author. In giving life to Ludlum's idea, she took it too far over the top, resulting in a parody of a \\"real\\" Ludlum."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"I gave up on this book on page 17 because I could not suspend disbelief. The premise of this book is so flawed that it bogles the mind.From the book:\\"Governments around the world wanted to be the first to have a working DNA computer because it would be able to break any code or encryption in a matter or seconds. ... All of America's missiles, secret systems at the NSA, the NRO's spy satellites, the entire ability of the nay operate, all defense plans-- anything and everything that relied on electronics would be at the mercy of the first molecular computer. Even the largest silicon supercomputer would not be able to stop it.\\"Ha!... That's hilarious. The idea is that someone creates a brand new computer, one with no software whatsoever and somehow it can overpower \\"everything that relies on electronics.\\"This sounds like the same plot as the Transformers movie, although in that movie this concept was far better explained.I don't mind it when a thriller bends the rules of science a bit, but you simply cannot introduce an idea this preposterous without providing a much better explanation.Thankfully, my bookshelf is crammed full of other books. I'm send this one to my local half price book store... save yourself the $9.99 and go find something else to read."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"Almost everything about this book screams of political fantasy rather than the thriller it purports to be. Fantasy is fine but when you toss in bad delivery to pound away on a message, it loses everything. The plot doesn't twist - it stalls at predictable points where the uninteresting \\"good guy\\" characters always live another day to shoot their overly described and oft mentioned weapons.Now to the heart of the story: It's about a US president using a secret agency named \\"Covert-One\\" to do everything on the sly. The country has an undisclosed operational anti-ballistic missile system as well. The French are the real bad guys and in the end their terrorist ally lives on, for a presumed future follow up, by escaping to Iraq.It's a tour du neo-conservative fantasy that would be enjoyed by the likes of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfield et al and strives to play upon the sentiments thought by the authors to exist in our post 9-11 world. However, it is so blatantly black and white in its delivery to make it laughable.

Here is another deadly plot that haunts our future in today's war on terrorism: a warning if you will. For this reason alone, the book deserves five stars, but it is also espionage at its most intriguing and heart-pounding pace. Once started, you can't put it down!"},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"It's really not bad, considering... The descriptions in places like Toledo are fairly good. The author has a good grasp of how to describe (perhaps over describe) things. The plot is passable(almost).Keep in mind all the other stuff that passes for books recently, and you will see. It's nowhere as good as Ludlum's early stuff, but even the Great Ones (can you say Clancy) have gone downhill recently."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"Paris Option is the third installment of the Covert One series that I have read. As a long-time Ludlum fan, I am still trying to get used to the series. Up to this point, the tales have been lighter and clearly not as complex as the typical Ludlum fare. This is not all bad, however, as the concept of \\"Ludlum Lite\\" has a certain appeal in its own right - although true Ludlum aficionados may be disappointed. If you are considering picking up the Covert One books, I would recommend starting with The Hades Factor to provide a nice foundation in terms of character building for future works in the series. With Paris Option, character development continues from the earlier work, leading to a quick read. All-in-all, not great but not bad."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"I picked this up to occupy me during a long plane ride and now regret not having consulted my fellow reviewers first. The novel may not be a genuine Ludlum (I have not read others) but it is genuine pulp. The plot is riddled with inconsistencies and has no credibility. The basic premise, a DNA computer, confuses the concept of a quantum computer (which might perform some of the tricks required for the plot) with that of DNA chips (which bear no relation to a computing machine). Our heroes are direct descendents of James Bond: almost single-handedly they discover who and where the bad guys are when the combined intelligence services of the Western world fail to do so; time and again they penetrate heavily guarded locations undetected; if captured they always escape; and when shot at by otherwise unerring marksmen they never receive more than a flesh-wound. Unlike Mr. Bond, however, they have no personality. Other stock characters abound: Frenchmen with a Napoleon complex, steely-eyed generals, cruel Arabs, bureaucratic spy-masters. Maybe earlier Ludlum novels are better, personally, I'd prefer to re-read Fleming."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"Maybe OK for beach reading, but barely. If you should happen to forget where you stopped reading, no matter if you skipped a few pages -- maybe that's even better! Not like Robert Ludlums earlier works. Has internal inconsistencies, like the hero picking a door lock when a blast of gunfire from an AK47 inside shreds the door, but just &quot;nicks&quot; our hero. After he goes inside to dispatch the baddie (a woman), he leaves the apartment carefully shutting the door behind him. Huh? The plot of this book is one escape from baddies after another. Ultimately the United States is going to be destoyed by a launched Russian nuclear missile until an autistic computer expert saves the day. Yawn. Try reading Alan Furst's spy novels instead. They are really good!"},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"It is unfortunate that Mr. Ludlum's name graces this novel. Rarely do I fail to complete a book; several failed attempts later it would appear that this one has beaten me. The dialog is contrived, characters are undeveloped, and the storyline tired. As others have indicated; stick to the vintage Ludlum."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"The Paris Option is a solid action thriller, with the Covert-One team, led in the field by multi-talented Colonel John Smith (seen here as doctor, researcher, diplomat, agent, failed romantic, and loyal friend). Smith teams up with his long-time CIA and MI6 colleagues and a childhood friend / electronics genius. The team moves quickly and easily from US to Europe and Northern Africa in search of terrorists who are only a front for other terrorists who are only a front for the real evil-doers. This thing has plot twists within other enigmatic plot twists. For several chapters, we dont even know which of the protangonists are dead or alive. On the downside, the Covert-One team and their camp-followers have nearly unbelievable extra-ordinary moments, seemingly ripped from the Superman cartoons. Why can't three poorly armed agents battle an army of trained terrorists if they have a French actress also on their side? Why can't John Smith stowaway on a terrorist boat for several days with no weapons, occasionally killing a few meddlesome terrorists without being noticed? This is a good read for the beach. Enjoy it, but don't take it too seriously. The idea that our European allies would unite to form a second superpower and regard the US as an enemy seemed impossible until the most recent outbreak of lunacy at the United Nations."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"The only good thing about this book is that some of the dialogue is so bad that it makes you laugh out loud. The story, unfortunately, is a series of chases. Our heros get in binds and do heroic things to get out of them. Over and over. Characters with no depth or motivation. I have a habit of finishing any book I start and this was the ultimate challenge."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"You'll never expect a Ludlum novel to be a literary masterpiece, and the Paris Option is no exception. This is an all through action-packed book, with a quite interesting plot. The weak point of the book, however, is that some of the characthers are quite silly and uninteresting."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"When John Smith, covert one operative extraordinaire is called to Paris to investigate a bombing at the Pasteur Institute and subsequent death of a noted scientist, little does he realize the depths of the problem. The famous (or infamous) scientist has created a hellish 'DNA computer' capable of destroying and hacking into the most sophisticated systems. Who can help? John's old friend Marty a computer genius who suffers from Asperges syndrome. But Marty is in a coma, and the computer is missing....Can John stop the terrorist plot in time?Frankly, the plot of this novel sounds far more interesting than this audio book actually was. Ludlum rambles on at length about each government, their response, each agent, their response. The Nefarious French. Muslim Fundamentalists. A bomb. Jihad. John smith is captured, manages to escape, is captured again, and the DNA computer is found and moved. Found and Moved.I liked the idea of this book, and I like Marty. But John as a character is rather wooden and lifeless. The other characters are merely stereotypes. Not his best work."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"As an avid fan of Robert Ludlum's work, I have always found his books rich with suspense, pacing, international intrigue and taut action. These elements are conspicuously absent from \\"The Paris Option,\\" leading me to believe that Robert Ludlum had minimal - if any - involvement in the creation of this novel. Rather than the aforementioned elements building to create a cauldron of intense interest, \\"The Paris Option,\\" much like previous books in the Covert-one series fails to match the original works of Robert Ludlum.The plot is rather unoriginal. A French scientist, Emile Chambord, is supposedly murdered in an explosion that completely obliterates his laboratory. While his body is not recovered, it is soon revealed that he was on the verge of an incredible scientific breakthrough- the creation of a molecular computer, with processing power of such magnitude that one can hack into any system, civilian or military on the Earth. Needless to state, Lt, Col. Jonathan Smith, member of the organisation Covert- One must discover the whereabouts of the computer and prevent it falling into the wrong hands. While the plot itself is cliched and requires considerable suspension of disbelief, the scene is set for a series of spectacular firefights as Jon and his team race around the world. The 'international' feel of Robert Ludlum is emulated, if nothing else. On a more positive note, the action sequences are adequate, though by the book's conclusion, the reader has inevitably become accustomed to the apparent invincibility of the main characters.In conclusion, \\"The Paris Option\\" exists as a hollow, unsatisfying read, not only because its plot is exceedingly well-worn and branching into the realms of impossibility, but the pacing and fine characterisation of Robert Ludlum is completely absent from the novel, where the characters resemble standard action stereotypes. Not a Ludlum novel."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"I've read a lot of Ludlum books but this book is so totally \\"off\\" in terms of technical authenticity and detail that anyone who understands a little about computers, etc. should stay away - it is just to difficult to read when you can't respect the knowledge of the authors."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"After being a Ludlum fan and enjoying his books for the last five years I was hoping for something of Ludlum in this book .

He, too, is feared killed in the blast. This \\"molecular\\" computer--if it existed--would essentially use DNA material to replace silicon chips. Like life forms, it would not only perform calculations, but would also \\"learn\\" from them--and quickly. Such a device could be used to hack into any computer system, satellite, weapons system, or other electronic gadget on earth. All communications and power systems could be shut down. Nukes could be directed to and from anywhere at will. In the wrong hands this would not be good.But there's no reason to believe that the computer even existed ... until the lights and phones start going out in the U.S. Enter John Smith, who belongs to a top-secret U.S. Government agency known as Covert One. It's so secret that not even the CIA, FBI, British Intelligence, or our enemies know of its existence. John Smith--a fictional character somewhere between Fleming's invincible James Bond and Clancy's vulnerable Jack Ryan--gets embroiled in a complex globe-hopping cat and mouse game in which Covert One variously competes and cooperates with the CIA and MI6 to crack gangs of resurgent Basques, militant Muslims, and Bonaparte-wannabe Frenchmen as time ticks down to nuclear catastrophe.Ludlum is a worldly, professional writer. The prose is flawless. The plot is thick and rich and twisty. His research and knowledge of cultural and international affairs is impressive. Yet none of that prevents this book from being too formulaic and chock full of stereotypes and cardboard characters. For readers who never tire of suspenseful spy thrillers, this is the mother lode. For those who find 400 pages of sneaking around and narrow escapes tedious, you might want to avoid The Paris Option. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"This is junk.

I found my thoughts wandering on several occasions and knew that if I had been reading the book instead of listening to it, it would now be in my unfinished book pile.I found the characters very interesting, but the plot dragged on and on in several places and a lot of the story could have been left out without affecting the meaning at all. Granted, there were several places that got my attention and I waited an extra 5 minutes in the car to see what would happen, but those situations were few and far between.The one other annoying thing is that the protagonists always seem to win out in the plethora of tight situations they got themselves in to, so by the 4th disc you never had that &quot;edge-of-the-seat&quot; feeling because you knew they'd come out all right. The ending too was very predictable and left me with the feeling that the evil plot should have gone off without a hitch...I know it would have made the book a lot more interesting...though I'd probably have to sit through 12 more discs while they worked that out."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"Reading it now, it's not clasic Ludlum, it's a bad movie screen play.

Yes, there was a lot of action, and yes, there was a lot going on, but no, none of it was mesmerizing or good enough to pull this book up to a level of being considered good. The characters were boring and the story was lackluster - it lacked depth, and the scenes all just seemed to rush together. Every now and then something interesting happened, but not enough to pull this story out of the rut it is in.I listened to the unabridged audiobook. I listen to a lot of unabridged audiobooks. Typically, when a book is good, I'm aware of every word being spoken, I hate to stop the tape/cassette to do anything, and when in the car, I don't mind rush hour traffic because I've got something to take my mind off of the sightseers who make you miss making it through a light. But with this book, I could barely keep my mind on the story. While listening, I was painfully aware of the rush hour traffic, I made mental lists of what I needed to get from the grocery store, and I solved the world's problems - all when I should have been listening to this book. When I did come back into focus and start listening again, do you think I stopped the tape and backed it up to hear what I missed? Heck no! I was just glad that I had less to listen to so I let it roll.This is definitely not a \\"Ludlum\\" quality book. I suppose now that the author is no longer with us, books \\"written\\" by him should no longer be published if the quality is along the lines of this one. If you pass on this one, you won't have missed a thing."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"Although no fan of spy novels, I decided to pick up The Bourne Identity after seeing the movie (I happened to have travelled most of the places described in the book), and was very impressed by both Ludlum's style, attention to detail and accuracy. Then I read The Bourne Supremacy, which I found even better (although the movie has nothing to do with the book, except for the names of the protagonists).Then came \\"The Paris Option\\"; Quite a disappointment I must admit. No way this got Ludlum's input beyond the story outline. Released in 2002, the book's innaccuracies are numerous, and frankly very annoying after a few chapters ... For instance, \\"Deuxieme Bureau\\", French Intel service, has not been called as such after 1982, when Military Intel \\"SDECE\\" became the DGSE. Ludlum would have never missed that. Similarly, some locations in Paris and Toledo are mis-named (ie \\"Seine St Denis\\" is not a town or a neibourghood as described, but an administrative region called \\"departement\\" in French). These research shortcomings tend to rate \\"The Paris Option\\" down from sharp spy novel \\"&agrave; la Ludlum\\" to cheap \\"roman de gare\\" ...Even the car models are not up to date !!!Stay away if you are un unconditional Ludlum fan.SamEnghien, France"},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"I am an avid Robert Ludlum fan.

I would not recommend this vendor."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"Since his unfortunate death, Robert Ludlum's legacy has been turned into an exercise in branding potential. Rarely does an action-flick fan realize that their beloved Jason Bourne series was first the brain child of Ludlum. While his history is rich with plot, narrative arcs, and action sequences, the Covert-One series helmed by a myriad of lesser known authors, relies on the characters first created by Ludlum.Each of the characters represents an archetype of our culture: Jon, the lone gunman; Randi, the cunning femme; Peter, aging action hero; and Marty, the misunderstood genius. Yes all of these characters are stereotypes and are often found in our literature, but they are also found in our literature because it works. Marty is the character that seems to be the most genuine. He cares deeply about his friend but is often conflicted on how best to show it, often simply bursting with rapid emotion before coiling into his shy sphere. It is because his character is so honestly genuine that I have trouble with the plot. He shuns mainstream society and stays within his fortress at all costs. He is a millionaire multiple times over and instead of gallivanting about, he uses portions of his wealth to protect his ability to stay within his miniature castle. It is here that the plot becomes inconsistant with Marty's characterization. The plot of the novel focuses on the Pasteur Institute and the appearance of Marty, half way around the world from his beloved home.Why would Marty, the genius that he is, not use some sort of technologically based system to observe and assist the creation of a DNA-based computer? Sure, the moment is greatly hyped in the novel and importance of such a system is made aware to the audience, but why would Marty, with all his resources as well as his aversions, need to physically partake in the matter thus beginning the plot? Of course his involvement is essential for bringing together the ragtag trio of Jon-Peter-Randi, but his physical presence in Paris, France would not have been necessary for him to be involved in the DNA-computer.On a different note, the Ludlum branded series has an interesting take on the bioweaponized war potential that has begun to grip our society. Because of the all-too-real possibility for biowarfare, it brings the unbelievably well put together cast closer to being believed."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"Well, these Covert One series are not really Robert Ludlum, but some selected writers to use the Ludlum success stories.

Since Paris Option was my first of the series, it was bearable, but all other Covert-Ones are very similar to each other. If you've read any one book from this series, I would suggest you stay away from the rest.The suspense is decent, but the climax is very predictable and it all works out somehow in the end, without a well-thought out approach to the finale. Covert-Ones start with a variety of events occuring simultaneously, events that in the beginning don't really seem to have a bearing on the other.

Several well-known authors are taking on co-authors (apprentices actually) in their latest offerings. Patterson with his latest, Cussler with his latest, Clancy for some time and now, Ludlum with his previous two and this one, THE PARIS OPTION. Of course, Mr. Ludlum passed away over a year ago (an incredible loss to the literary world) and anything with his name will be co-authored or a reissue. For those of us who are die-hard Ludlumites, any taste from the Master is welcome. However, these co-authored books are less than authentic and THE PARIS OPTION is no exception.Robert Ludlum was the absolute ruler of intrigue. If you are reading this review and haven't read a \\"real\\" Ludlum, pick up The Parsifal Mosaic or The Matarese Circle or the Bourne series (unlike a previous reviewer, I felt the Bourne movie didn't do the book justice). These books will absolutely put you on your heels. Ludlum had a way of telekenetically transporting the reader into the story. You are there...with the characters....truly spellbinding! In the co-authored books, apparently Mr. Ludlum's only contributions are the short outlines and a mentoring review (this, per an interview with Gayle Lynds). In the combined efforts, Ms. Lynds (and Philip Shelby in THE CASSANDRA COMPACT) develops the storyline and characters, which is what most hard-line Ludlum fans miss the most from Mr. Ludlum himself. While Ms. Lynds does a reasonable job of creating a suspenseful plot, it falls short of Ludlumite expectations. I would even go as far to say that if this was a standalone offering from Ms. Lynds, it might receive a more favorable critical review if for no other reason than not having to live up to the Ludlum standard.To the story.......Jon Smith, our resident M.D. and superspy of Covert-One, returns from THE HADES FACTOR to unravel the mystery of the missing DNA computer. The brilliant French scientist, Emile' Chambord, is clandestinely putting the finishing touches on the world's first DNA computer (a computer combining life and computational sciences thereby creating a \\"living\\" machine) in Paris' own Pasteur Institute when an incredible explosion shatters the Institute and ostensibly Dr. Chambord and his invention. When Smith discovers that his friend, Marty Zellerbach, was in the Institute working with Chambord and was seriously injured in the blast, he drops his current research and heads for Paris.Once there, the mysterious explosion, the frightening potential of the DNA computer and the uncertainty of Chambord's death throw Smith into the middle of an international crisis. An unknown cabal calling itself the Scarlet Shield, a pan-Islamic organization, is apparently behind the terror. Ultimately, Smith is joined by his spook cohorts from HADES, Randi Russell of the CIA and Peter Howell, retired (sort of) with MI6.The plot is timely and has the requisite sharp edges. The character definition is moderate (better if one has previously read HADES) and the climax is probably the best part of the book. All-in-all, a decent read but if you're looking for this book to have the delictable flavor of a Ludlum thriller, you're likely to be sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"Wow! Again I am very happy that I do not read the reviews before I read the novel. Of the 38 reviews 23 gave the book a bad rating (1-2 stars). I on the other hand gave it 4 stars. I have given all 3 books in this covert 1 series 4 stars. After skimming over a few of the reviews I realize how lucky I am. With every book I read I try to have a very open mind. So what if the truth is exaggerated. DNA COMPUTER! That is the basis of this book and If it gets too technical then I just skip over that section which usually is small.The book grabbed my attention immidiately and never waned. Our hero again is Lt. Col. Jon Smith, MD. My wife is in the medical field and I was in a Navy hosiptal for quite awhile and never have I met a Doc like this Smith. Not only is he a top research doc but a super James Bond hero type. But, that does not stop me from enjoying the book. There are 3 more heroes and one of them is his nerd buddy from childhood days, Marty. The other two are Randi from the CIA who is also his sister-in-law and his old buddy from MI6 Peter Howell. The 4 of them make an interesting team.Marty was working on the DNA computer with the genius DR. Chambord at the Pasteur Institute in Paris when there was a huge explosion. Marty is injured but he makes it okay in time to join the other 3 in their search for who did it and what happened to the computer. A number of twists and turns happen such as Chambord's daughter gets kidnapped.

Sometimes hard to keep up with all the names. I remember characters from previous novel so I enjoyed going through another adventure with them. Ludlum, as usual, keeps you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"The last few years I have been picking up 2nd hand Ludlum's at a local bookstore, and have a few 'Covert-One' books as well. Since I have never read much Ludlum I have no prior opinion as to what comprises his books.The first thing to realize with the Covert-One books is that someone other than Ludlum wrote them. That would seem elementary with many answering, 'tell me something new'. I just think that needs to stated, possibly even restated, as many reviews want to grade the Covert-One series as though Robert Ludlum wrote them, which as most of us know, he did not. Whether the authors who write the Covert-One series are actually following a Ludlum template, or writing free style, making the plot up as they go, is beyond my knowledge and beyond my interest.This present book, THE PARIS OPTION, I found to be very readable, a book that causes one to continue reading as I have been doing for the last few nights. I find nothing amiss in the plot nor with the characters, and whether it is a DNA or molecular computer I could care less, as the plot assumes a super computer with carbon as its base rather than silicone. Such a computer can over ride or take over lesser computers. Does such a computer exist? I don't know, but it is scary to think so, unless you have ownership of it.I feel as Thomas Jefferson that \\"I cannot live without books\\", however, I will not tolerate a poorly written book nor will I continue reading a book that is boring, this book, THE PARIS OPTION, is neither poorly written nor boring. In fact I greatly enjoyed it.Anyone stating an opinion that this is not a Robert Ludlum book is only stating the obvious. Of course the Covert-One series is not by Ludlum, but stands very well as a good read on its own. As far as 'using' his name, that is what the Ludlum estate wants, so there is no crime in that either. From what I have seen, both at the local library and here on Amazon, reader interest seems very high with all these books.So for those that are die hard Ludlum fans, I suggest reading only books you are certain he wrote, while for those others of us that look for only an interesting tale, regardless of author, then I suggest these books on Covert-One can be both worthwhile and interesting reads.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"I'm beginning to think that this book has gotten so many negative reviews because the reviewers have decided in advance to resent anything Ludlum coauthored with anyone. If you respect the man's other work, then let's respect his decision to collaborate on whatever level it worked out to be with Lynds, and give the Paris Option and the series a chance.The Paris Option was, in my mind, even better than the two earlier ones and a heck of a lot better than a lot of Ludlum's standalones, particularly from 1992 to 2000. Many of them were tedious, painfully overwritten, almost unreadable.This book reads fast, is highly suspenseful, and I learned a lot along the way. Obviously a lot of research went into the authors' creation of the molecular (or DNA) computer. We're going to see one in maybe twenty years, but in this novel we get quantum physics on an understandable and exciting level. I don't know anyone who's written so convincingly about a DNA computer.Plus, there's the growing political and economic conflicts between the United States and the European Union. Again, Paris Option delivers. Political suspense at its best. Yes, of course, the world is in serious danger in this book. This is not just a spy thriller, it's a political thriller ... a THRILLER. If you want something small and intimate to be the source of conflict, go read one of the wonderful so-called literary books that are out there.One of my favorite aspects of a Ludlum novel is the intricate intrigue he creates. I don't know how much of this is Ludlum, and how much is Lynds, but it's one heck of a terrific entwining of villains and maybe-villains. One group of terrorists seems to be behind everything, then . . . no! It's another group. Finally, the heroes figure out it's another party. And mind you, the clues are there all along. The authors play fair. When each twist happens, you feel as if you should've spotted it. For someone who usually does, I was really happy. It's no fun if you figure out everything in advance.And finally, I found the supporting cast ... Peter, Marty, and Randi to be fresh and unusual. Interesting. They're tough, and fun, and they talk like real people. They have moments of black humor. There are times when they're on top of everything, and other times when they fail --- both individually and as a group. You stick with them because you know they're in there pitching, and you hope and hope that they'll triumph in the end. They make a great counterpoint to the seriousness of the hero.And one final thought about who actually wrote and who actually outlined and who actually edited ... or whatever else one wants to complain about. If Lynds did it all, more power to her. If it was a collaboration based on outline and notes left behind after Ludlum's death, more power to both of them. I've heard that the way the two men who created Ellery Queen collaborated was that one wrote the outline and the other one wrote the book. They grew to detest one another and never met unless they had to. Nevertheless, that's a respected \\"collaboration.\\" Let's get off our thrones and quit judging.Personally, I'm going to give Lynds's books a try."},{"Title":"Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel","review":"Too many characters make a story difficult to follow and that's the case with this book in the Covert One series.

Firstly, it is way too long and the permise was just so unblievable... a DNA computer? That morphs into something the more it is used.. is that like DNA? I don't think so. I still gave it a solid 3 because of the sheer enjoyment I have derived over the last several decades with Mr. Ludlum as my companion. But this book showed absolutely no imagination. The narrow escapes are tired and overused. In the immortal worlds of Jason Borne and Carlos the Jackal no one gets out alive!

This was a great edition and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"The Art of War is one of those books that you always hear about in revered tones but which most people you know have never really actually read.This book provides a first part with the Lionel Giles translation of Sun Tzu's 13 short chapters on the Art of War, and this part is an interesting read. Despite its shortness however it is an involved read and can require a lot of thinking to try to unlock what Sun Tzu is really saying, or how it can apply to concrete situations. If you can cut through the cryptic writing style there are very important observations on the nature of war, insights on objectives, and directives about how to fight wars. The Art of War should be read by at least every American military officer, if not enlisted as well. People who want to learn about the nature of war and warfighting, and who want to get more in-depth understanding of any military histories they read would behoove themselves to read this book first too. Businesspeople can read it, but probably shouldn't get too wrapped up in it or neglect the more pertinent lessons from books on economics, strategic thought (which, admittedly the Art of War is one), project management, etc.A second part of the book re-prints Sun Tzu's text with notes by other Chinese warriors, Lionel Giles, Dallas Galvin, etc. after each of his sentences on the meaning of the sentence. The quality of these notes are very inconsitent however. Rarely the notes do actually provide extra clarification or a new discovery. Sometimes the notes don't seem to \\"get it\\" about what is being said though. Other times the notes just practically repeat Sun Tzu but literally changing one or two words, like turning \\"bad\\" into \\"undesirable.\\"Dallas Galvin writes an introduction to both Sun Tzu's raw text and the section with notes. Her contributions are practically worthless however, adding nothing except expressing a drippy love for Chinese poetry and missing the picture big time. Especially in a seemingly rather politically charged section where she implies strongly the war on terror is not a war but an excuse for tryanny. Hitler is then mentioned conspicuously on the heels of allusions to President Bush. She ends her introduction by projecting her fantasy that the Chinese, despite their constant warfare during the period that saw The Art of War written and events such as the Taiping rebellion in the 1860's that witnessed 20 million deaths, are pacificists.The raw text of the Art of War is inherently interesting, insightful, and can be read and absorbed in a relatively short period of time making it a worthwhile read. An advantage of this particular edition is that the cover design is quite handsome, and looks good on the shelf or the coffee table."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"I'm not really a student of military tactics, so I can't judge this work on those merits. From what I understand from the other reviews, and from the ravings of enthusiasts that I have heard, this book is one of the more important books covering the topic. This particular edition was interesting to me because there were a few examples of various applications of Sun Tzu's writings in actual battles from Stonewall Jackson to Hannibal given in the form of notes (I assume by Giles). Since I am more interested in historical events, than in strategy, this helped me understand the fine prose of the writer, even if I am not quite able to apply any of his \\"art\\" to my everyday life. I'm certain that a student of strategy would appreciate this work, as would people who are interested in Chinese history. I fail to see how it could be applicable to a corporate environment, but once again, that's not really my forte.

It is a must have for military buffs that enjoy reading about the tactics of the most succesful generals. It is rumored that Napoleon used a French translation of the Art of War to his advantage while conquering most of Europe, and he lost when he broke its principles.The principles that are with in this ancient text can also be used in games of strategy, business conflicts, and the day to day battles of life.Here are ten principles to give you a sample of the wisdom found in its pages:Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance with out fighting.If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.Spies are the most important element in war, because upon them depends an army's ability to move.All warfare is based on deception.The general who wins a battle makes many calculations before the battle is fought.There is no instance of a country having benefited from a prolonged war.The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals.In war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. (So they can retreat).Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained, fight not unless the position is critical.Taken as a whole this is a book of wisdom and principles on how to win. I rank it in my top ten books I have ever read. It is a must have for any home library. The is a very small book that is quick and easy to read."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"As others have noted some of the tactical advice is thousands of years out of date, but the vision of strategic issues is still very relevant. This edition is well written and an easy read.It does not take an interest in the military to make this a great read.It is also a great read for anyone interested in politics and will help one to understand the antics of folks like James Carville.Sun Tzu is also the foundation of much of the work of Col John Boyd that has had such a major impact on the current military.A reader of Sun Tzu might have a very different take on why there has not been a massive terrorist attack on America after 9-11. One of his basic principles is to separate the population from the enemy leadership. Clearly 9-11 connected the leaders with the population. The absence of an attack has allowed the anti-war movement space to become effective.Knowledge of Sun Tzu is most helpful in understanding a major force on current world leaders from Chinese leadership Muslim fundamentalists."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"As a Chinese, I feel I'm obligated to contend with the other reviewer's notion that we are \\" trying to act like Saddam, posing as if they had some kind of WMD\\". We didn't exalt Sun Tzu. Historically, Art of War has been considered inferior to the other classics in China, which is unfortunately, in my opinion. It was elevated to its current cure-all status mostly by Japanese and Western readers.As to its usefulness, I'd say, yes, most of its advices are not particular new, given the fact that it's more than 2000 years old. But I think they are still well worth reading today. Its discussion on the cost of warfare and extensive planning and preparation needs to be taken before getting into war, reads like a case study of the current Iraqi situation. Had Rumsfeld read Art of War...And, yes, in many cases, its relevance and effectiveness have been hyped by gurus and consultants. But personally, I found some of its advices are relevant and well worth taken in my profession as an stock market investor. As motivational/self-help books go, I'd say Art of War is as good as, if not better than, any guru books out there.Even if you are not into military strategy or self-help books, I still think it's well worth reading if you are serious about leading a meaningful life/career. Because I think what really sets Art of War apart from any other how-to books out there, is not the particular advices it dishes out, but the apparent contradiction those advices exhibit. I found this is really powerful and gives you new perspective on the way you think.For example, this is a book on war strategy, yet it advocate that the best strategy is to avoid war. Image a book on how to make money advising people not making money, a marketing book not doing marketing. This really blows your minds away. Most of us just jump right into the tasks we have on hand. By reading Art of War, you start to say to yourself: wait a minute. What am I trying to achieve here? What's the cost of the things I'm doing? Is there a better way to achieve the same goal?Other contradictions abound: it emphasis the importance of integrity and moral high ground, yet it insists war is all about deception; it is all about rules and systems, yet it says you have to not be bound by rules and be flexible. This really gives you a fuller appreciation of the complex and contradictory nature of reality.For these reasons, I think a short edition is not a bad ides, because you don't have to learn the nuance to appreciate the value of Art of War."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"It is common knowledge that you cannot become a great warrior without mastering this work. There is combat in all aspects of life - from work to family and even when playing games. Its true that winning isnt everything, but of course losing is nothing. I read this because I want to be a trial lawyer and thought it would be fun to try to draw analogies between Sun-Tzu advice on the battlefield and that of the courtroom. It was surprisingly easy to do so. The snippets of wisdom can easily apply to other situations - much the same as how a horoscope can apply to any and all Capricorn's or Leo's. The general wording allows the reading to twist the advice to fit into their own life situation. I'm not sure that the reader truly learns any strategies they would not already know - but I found that reading this book puts the reader in a state of mind for combat and that in itself can be the path to victory.Relic113"},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"Don't waste your money on this. The translation is clumsy, the layout is horrible, and it isn't even the complete book. Buy Thomas Cleary's translation."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"The Art of War by SUN TZU is not fiction. It's a Confucianist take on waging and winning wars (and business). It is important to compare this Eastern view of warfare with the western view as defined in The Prince and many subsequent titles.The heart of Sun Tzu's thought is \\"All warfare is based on deception. Thus, when able to attack, we must seem unable. Hold out bait to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is quick to anger, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.\\"Any football play has all kinds of people running around trying to fake the opposing team to going where the ball isn't.Perhaps the best strategic use of the principles was Ronald Reagon's Star Wars proposal. No one knew if it would work. But if it had, there was no way the Soviet Union could possibly have countered it. They didn't have the computer systems, and because of their closed society they didn't have the young kid genius programmers that we've developed in this country.

Sun Tzu was a remarkably insightful man, who seems to have captured the psychology of combat and running a team. So many of the principles he espouses are applicable in civilian life that it is worth reading by anybody managing people. There are sections in the book that deal very specifically with fighting (especially the discussions on terrain), but many of the other chapters could replace the word 'army' with 'team' and the meaning would be the same. Whilst many of the lessons appear simplistic and obvious, experience tells us that sometimes common sense is not so common. Sometimes concepts need to be presented in a simplified fashion for their full power to be revealed. I think that any person either training to be a leader or is already one (military or civilian) should read this book and ponder it's meaning."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"I'm a civilian, businessman, and fan of strategy games and movies. I've wanted to read this work for years but never got around to it. When a friend gave me this, the audiobook version, I finally did \\"read\\" it.Thoughts about the content:The work is surprisingly short, powerful, and rational. The descriptions are poetic but to the point. Some passages are brilliant and self-evidently true, some are harder to follow, but the entire work is engaging and worth reading/listening to. One can see why it is required material for military strategists and why so many people have called it the most important reference work on the subject of war of all time. One of the most striking aspects to me personally were the apparent logical contradictions. Act honorably because the moral high ground is critically important to military success, yet deception is the essence of warfare and you must deceive your opponent. You must follow these rules strictly otherwise you will fail, yet you must remain open to opportunity and adjust your tactics accordingly throwing out the rules. This is not to say the lessons are false or difficult, but that there are thought-provoking dilemmas to be explored. I was especially fond of the discussion of the roles of morality, economics, and spies in warfare, as well as several of the anecdotal side stories of ancient battles and strategems.Thoughts about the presentation/execution:Apparently, the most common and best English translation available translates not just Sun Tzu's original words, but also the work of an almost-as-ancient commentator who interspersed clarifications and illustrative anecdotes throughout the main text. Note that this complicates an audiobook, a fundamentally linear form. Textually, you can see that there is a tangent without breaking your flow (depending on how the text is formatted), deciding if and when to read the tangent. In this particular case, some of the commentary is truly required in place (it just wouldn't be understandable to a 21st century American listener without it) and some would best be read outside the flow of the main work (such as the stories of ancient battles that illustrate one of the \\"bullet points\\" being made). I believe the producers made the best possible translation from text to audiobook, and the readers chosen are top notch, but moreso than other audiobooks this work would just fundamentally work better as text, and for this reason I drop it to 4 stars."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"Great book.

This could be in conflict between nations or competition between business organisations or conflict between individuals. The book is a translation from an ancient Chinese classic written by an unknown warrior- philosopher.Sun Tzu's concepts are over two millenniums old but they are as relevant today as they have been throughout the ages. The book is studied in all continents, from Asia to America and from Australia to Africa in military command and staff colleges and business schools. The book teaches the art of invincibility by winning without fighting through mastery of politics, science and psychology of conflict.The philosophical foundations of this classic book are based on the spiritual tradition of Taoism, which is the origin of science, technology and psychology in the Far East. Taoism's view on power is that it should be tempered with respect for humanity.Permeating throughout the book or in Sun Tzu's philosophy is the basic concept that the ultimate effective and efficient strategy is to make conflict unnecessary. The greatest skill is to overcome other armies without fighting. According to Sun Tzu, the superior militarist foils enemies' plots. If this is not possible, then ruin enemy alliances. The next best strategy would be to attack the armed forces whilst the worst strategy is to besiege the enemy's cities. Hence the ideal strategy for winning without fighting achieves the most by doing the least.Therefore, clear understanding of conflict not only can lead to its resolution, but also to its possible avoidance altogether."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"This is a well-edited edition of Sun Tzu; the only aspect that left something to be desired was the inclusion of illustrative anecdotes; I would have preferred if they were left to the end of the chapter.I can understand why this book was a fad in the business world but object to claims that the tactics described in this book are easily applied to business. This is a book about conflict, specifically, war, and there is much wisdom lost if it is taken out of its context. There is much excellent advice for analogous situations; political persuasion and debate, games of Go, Shogi or Chess, or even sporting events.When taken from the world of conflict to the business, the realm of cooperation (in the sense that competing businesses compete to cooperate the best with their customers), The Art of War becomes yet another tome of &quot;Eastern&quot; sayings which sound pretty and can be &quot;applied to any situation&quot; only because they come to mean very little.Those who will be in a conflict situation or wish to prepare for one, even if it is a simple game of Go, should study this book.

This training, was easily adaptable for civilian use in business and has served me well in dealing with workers and the competition. I know that many use the Art of War to study history,or military tactics,but many more are utilizing the principals and wisdom of Sun Tzu for business success. I find it interesting, how the military and business parallel each other in methodology, planning and delegation. This version of the Art of War, was prepared especially for military leaders and business leaders. The goal was to provide both types of leaders a comprehensive study of Sun Tzu and his Art of War.You as a reader and student of Sun Tzu are given the best translation of the Art of War, which I found is the Lionel Giles translation. Lionel Giles, also provides history and commentary that adds insight and clear understanding of the principals and tactics given in the Art of War. The main focus was to compile all of the best information available, add useful resources and thus provide a book that you will recommend to co-workers, friends, family and perhaps those you lead, or mentor.Please, take a look inside and see for yourself, that this version of the Art of War not only contains the full version of Sun Tzu's classic work, but is also filled with notes, commentary, the 40 leadership principals of Sun Tzu and a resource website that provides you with additional information and discussion on leadership, business and more."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"I have saw Art of War for the first time in my firends house, it was a coniderably big book and the accounts in it were told by stories.This book is more like a manual, i just has bullet points of wisdom, not the rich content of storytelling and parables..That is not to say it isnt good, it like it.So if you are looking for a nice short version and are looking simply for the heart of the matter, this is your book."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"Written in approximately 470 BC, The Art of War is a Taoist treatise on martial and political philosophy ... one of the most famous ever written, and one of the most often quoted. The fact that it is still popular and well quoted, after more than 2,000 years, should say something about its timeless qualities.It's composed as a list of terse, keen and ingenious observations, sayings, and maxims ... with various translators over the centuries each adding their own interpretations and commentary. There's something on almost every topic ... from siege planning, use of formations & maneuvering, the virtues of adaptability and cunning, speed, the use of positioning & terrain, disinformation and the use of spies, etc.The author's advice spans both low level tactics [\\"do not stop an army on its way home\\" {Brad: because they'll be more likely to fight to the death} ... \\"a surrounded army must be given a way out\\" {Brad: channel their retreat into a killing zone of your own creation}] ... and high level strategic thinking [\\"a superior militarist foils enemy plots without the need to fight; the next best {strategy} is to ruin their alliances; next {best strategy} after that is to attack their armed forces; worst {strategy} is to beseige their cities\\"]It's required reading at many military colleges around the world."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"Sun Tzu realized that war, 'a matter of vital importance to the State', demanded study and analysis; his is the first known attempt to formulate a rational basis for the planning and conduct of military operations. Unlike most Greek and Roman writers, Sun Tzu was not primarily interested in the elaboration of involved strategems or in superficial and transitory techniques. His prupose was to develop a systematic treatise to guide rulers and generals in the intelligent prosecution of successful war. He believed that the skillful strategist should be able to subdue the enemy's army without engaging it, to take his cities without laying seige to them, and to overthrow his State without bloodying swords. Superb. Without hesitation or reservation five stars!"},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"Many of you might be thinking, \\"Why in the world would I need an ancient Chinese Military Classic on my bookshelf?\\"When a friend of mine suggested that I purchase this book, I asked myself that exact question. None-the-less I purchased the book and almost 100 pages later (because the entire book is just about 100 pages) I understood exactly why he had suggested it.This treatise has applications reaching far beyond battle field ethics and strategy. For me, replacing the word \\"enemy\\" with \\"opponent\\" converts the book into a strategical synopsis for the field of sport. Sun Tzu lays out the ways and means to manage teams of people in straight forward simple language. This application reaches into politics, business, sport, and any managerial position.I highly recommend this short, but critical read to anyone in a position of people management. This book will make you think about the strategies that you use in the command posts of your life."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"In the case of Sun Tzu, smaller is better.

Large font and a small number of pages make this book a VERY short read, probably 1-3 hours if you stop to think about what is written.That being said, there's not much you can write about something so complex as war in so few pages. The Art of War is always a classic because it's techniques are based on logic; a collection of dos and don'ts. The topics that are discussed are very broad and lack details, however, Sun Tzu delivers this knowledge in such a way that detail isn't really needed.I haven't read any other versions of this book, but it seemed like a great translation.

But I find this audio book of Sun Tzu's The Art of War disappointing. There are actually several narrators, but Ron Silver does perhaps 70%+ of the narration. There is a stark contrast between his speech and the other narrators whenever the switch takes place.Ron Silver speaks this text in a very low, monotonous way that puts me to sleep. He seems to have put on his \\"ancient Chinese philosophy\\" wise man hat, and speaks in a low, soft drone. Doesn't work at all for me.The content is great, but Silver's narration is soporofic. IMO."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"So many people have recommended this book, and talk up its application to other areas of life outside of war (e.g. business). I figured it was time to see what the hype was about, so I gave the Librivox audio version a try.I'm having a very hard time understanding who this book might be relevant to today. Many many years ago, war was a very different affair: soldiers lined up in ranks, marched at each other with the general in front, and that was the battle. These 'rules' were kind of mutually agreed upon and traditionally the way war was fought, so when Sun Tzu brought out his knowledge that there was a far more strategic way to do things it was no doubt a big big deal. Certainly whoever he was advising at the time would stand a far better chance when some of these then-novel ideas were passed into practice, as the author seems to have a grasp on basic military theory.Nowadays of course we have all seen the evolution of war in a thousand years of refinement, so nearly everything about this is either common sense or purely outdated. The problem with this book is that it dances the line between theory and practice too much, and so it repeatedly presents a singular view with a few abstracted examples, never managing to be concisely profound nor applicable. Here, I'll summarize The Art of War for you in one line:\\"Look for weaknesses in your enemy and exploit them, but carefully ensure that your enemy cannot do the same to you.\\"There, I just saved you a book full of epithets and variations on the theme. These double-statements continually take a form like this:\\"If you do X (seek the higher ground, scout the terrain, attack your enemy's supply line, etc), you can defeat your enemies. But if you instead do X (take to the lower ground, ignore your surroundings, fail to defend your own supply line), your enemies will defeat you.\\"Very frustrating and repetitive. Confounding things even more is that they are arranged in no particular order. Somebody with a poor understanding of layout has grouped these into various 'chapters' with headings, but the chapter heading only applies for about 10 lines or so, and then the focus completely changes to some other aspect of ancient warfare.From a historical perspective, it's undoubtedly important. Without a historical context, it's a pretty useless book. Those looking for a practical study of war would do well to look elsewhere. And those who are looking for a philosophical approach would be better served by introspection and study than trying to bend these little statements to their own needs. About the best thing I can say about it is that it does lend itself well to being quoted from, but that is hardly worth reading it for."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"I have just downloaded the kindle edition.

But if everyone shared common sense alike, all wars would come to stalemates.I can see in the future that this will be a book I will reference often. I couldn't help but think about modern day warfare being a protracted and expensive venture. Warfare has become a business. A business that will surely wear upon citizens and infantrymen.

Even though Sun Tzu, if he existed at all, was roughly a contemporary of Homer and Isaiah, much of his advice seems pertinent today. And, of course, the work is quite a window into Chinese culture and history. The Kindle edition I read was initially published in 1910, translated by and including commentary by Lionel Giles. Perhaps the oddest advice by Sun Tzu was for the general to keep his plans hidden from his own forces as well as those of the enemy; the most annoying characteristic (noted by Giles) is the typical Chinese approach of dividing a broad category (e.g., types of terrain) into a long list of subcategories that overlap but are not comprehensive."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"I expected a lot more from this book.

Anyone wishing to learn something about leading others to victory, whether in corporate, political, or personal battles, can walk away with something from this book.

I already had a copy of it at home, but this edition is so nicely done that I gave my old copy away and kept this one. The introduction of James Clavell is a nice touch.It is amazing to me that this book is not read in high schools or colleges in favor of Machiavelli's work (The Prince or The Art of War.) Sun Tzu's writing is clear and to the point. Unlike the popular Book of Five Rings by Musashi, this book is not metaphorical and poetic; it's downright practical. And it's not hard to read, unlike many classics.If you are doing business in China, this is also a good book to know. I mentioned some of the classic strategies while giving a course in China, and every member of the class had read it, knew it well, and gave me many examples from recent Chinese history where Sun Tzu's strategies were employed. This book is close to their hearts, and will give you insight if you are doing business in the East.Of course, the most famous anecdote from this book is about gaining the obedience of troops; the emperor, wishing to interview Sun Tzu for the commission of general, asked if Sun Tzu's military principles could be applied to women. Sun Tzu replied yes, the principles worked for women as well as men. Accordingly, Sun Tzu was given the task of organizing the emperor's many concubines into an army. Sun Tzu lined up the concubines and set the two favorites as officers at the head of the columns.He gave them a simple set of orders to march and drill (eyes front, right face, about face. The drums sounded and instead of following the commands, the girls simply giggled and blushed.He repeated the orders again, saying that if the orders were not clear, it is first the fault of the general. He repeated the commands, and the girls simply stood and giggled again.&quot;If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, the general is to blame. But if his orders ARE clear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their officers.&quot; Upon saying this, he ordered the two concubines at the head of the troop, favorites of the emperor, to be beheaded.The emperor hurriedly sent down the command to stop, he had no desire to see his favorites executed. The emperor said &quot;We are satisfied that the general knows how to command.&quot;But Sun Tzu said, &quot;Once having received the commission, there are certain commands I am unable to accept.&quot; And he ordered the two favorites to be beheaded. Once again, he gave the commands. The concubines marched, whirled about and drilled in perfect order. The emperor appointed Sun Tzu general."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"This particular edition of Sun Tzu's \\"The Art of War\\" is a bare literal translation prefaced by a rather wordy introduction that pads the book up to a total of 96 pages. While the translation is not bad, the book contains no explanations or notes to enlighten the readers on some of the more obscure points, such as the modern equivalents of ancient Chinese distance measures.The one sentence review, pronouncing this to be the best translation, was perhaps a bit generous. Among both military and history buffs, the prevailing view is that the translation by Lionel Giles, of the British Museum, is the definitive translation. Of the various available editions of the Giles translation, the Special Edition that contains two complete copies of the English text - one with and one without extensive notes and commentary - in addition to the complete text in Chinese characters - is far and away the best.The $4.95 price for this book (or for the matchbox size miniature edition from Running Press) is a bargain only for those who are more concerned with price than with value.

Utterly straightforward, and generalisable to any form of conflict.Surface-reading this book will take you minutes, not hours - however, time must be spent with even the barest of his principles. The purchase of this book has become alarmingly trendy over recent years, but with no noticeable effect on the global intelligence of its middle manager market.

This is the popular translation by Lionel Giles made even more popular by the introduction from the best-selling author of Japan epics, James Clavell. It contains Giles' commentary along with the translation. The annotations give historical examples of the strategies in action.Game theory is calculated strategy. The Art of War by Sun Tzu is probably the oldest and most important book on game theory ever written. It is the culmination of the development of the best warfare tactics prior to the 5th century BC. It is considered the foundation for all military plans and is still used to this day. It is most popular for its ability to win wars without fighting one. Its application has shaped the world as we know it.The Art of War can be understood as a breakdown of the chaos of warfare into components that can be analyzed and understood. The tactics are mostly about controlled organization, recognizing environments and situations and the correct response to each one. Organization is subject to change in competition. The Art of War is essentially the strategy of responding to changing environments. Response is thus relative to evolving conditions.1 - \\"Laying Plans\\"The core message of this chapter is to calculate as much as possible before committing yourself. Important themes include discipline, ethics, environmental conditions and assessing the competition. It's about setting up the mission and evaluating the competition.2 - \\"Waging War\\"The important detail of this chapter is to win as quickly and as economically as possible. Prolonged struggle means wasting resources and undermining confidence. When winning, use the spoils as rewards and capital. It's about making war pay.3 - \\"Attack by Stratagem\\"This chapter is about deployment of the previous two chapters. The central message is to know thyself and know thy enemy. This stage indicates problems such as sieges, bad management and interior anarchy or legal/government interference. Advantages such as good management, exploiting opportunities and attacking tactics are covered. Strength is about cohesiveness and is independent of size.4 - \\"Tactical Dispositions\\"This one stresses putting yourself in a position where you cannot be defeated and waiting for the opportunity to defeat the enemy. It is about recognizing the breaks and taking them as opposed to creating the breaks.5 - \\"Energy\\"This part focuses on the power of deception to lull the enemy into a false sense of security and the use of spies to learn the enemy's moves. It also stresses the need to evolve in battle. It's about building up war capability.6 - \\"Weak Points and Strong\\"This chapter encapsulates all the previous five chapters into an advanced war strategy producing outcomes, calculating and responding to events as they unfold. The strategies are developed here. It is about creating breaks.7 - \\"Maneuvering\\"This deals with managing units and the internal problems they face on top of how to respond during movement to various circumstances. It is a chapter based on types of situations and responses.8 - \\"Variation of tactics\\"This section expands on the evolution of tactics and strategies based on situations and responses but concentrates on what causes failure.9 - \\"The Army on the March\\"This is advanced maneuvering especially across long distances with different terrains and how to deal with encounters. It is about interpretation.10 - \\"Terrain\\"This describes the various terrains that an army can encounter and when and how to occupy them. It talks about distances, potential dangers and obstructions. Positioning is important.11 - \\"The Nine Situations\\"This piece explains the condition of each terrain in terms of its tactical advantages and disadvantages and how to deal with both. It is a very intensive chapter because of the number of complex conditions dealt with.12 - \\"The Attack by Fire\\"Arson in war is probably the single most troubling weapon that an army could have inflicted on the enemy around 500 BC. This chapter is obviously based on the most advanced weapons of the time which have since been developed. It is about using the principle of creating disorder and chaos to win.13 - \\"The Use of Spies\\"Without spies don't war. War is won based on foreknowledge not by calculation but by direct information about the plans of the other side from spies. Spies are managed in this chapter.Even though the work is quite short (about 100 pages or less with commentary) it is complex enough to warrant several readings. It is the equivalent to learning how to play advanced chess, a game which compliments this study. There is a lifetime of thought within the pages. Napoleon was said to have used it and lost when he didn't follow it.The Art of War has become one of the most important self help books of this century popularized in big business as many executives have had recourse to this material because it offers a sound winning strategy. Most readers come away believing that the book's message finds it adaptable to many environments because it is all about adjusting to variations and so can be applied to anything and everything.The Art of War is not supposed to be an exciting read. It is a strategy book, a step by step guide to how battles are won and why they are lost. It is more to be memorized as a set of responses, including when not to respond, than to be understood. The combinations of the responses are unlimited. There is enough on the plate without asking why. Understanding why would come later and the answers to these questions would come from a very sophisticated understanding of the theory. It is an endeavor that remains open to the reader if they can come to terms first with the information that is here.Even if the book is not followed up on by subsequent study it can still leave a long lasting impression with its tips on discipline and achieving goals. It is great value for the amount of information contained in such a short burst. It will get you thinking strategically and that is more or less its claim to fame."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"Sun Tzu's masterpiece, \\"The Art of War\\" is one of the most important books ever written. For the price, this bare-bones version is a bargain.You should note, however, that this is more of a booklet than a book. There is little to recommend this particular edition. The details, the subtle shades of meaning and the historical context, are left unexplained. If this is to be your only copy of Sun Tzu, you are going to miss out on a lot of the important details.A better choice is \\"The Art of War by Sun Tzu - Special Edition\\" that contains two versions of the Giles' translation in one book: both a plain vanilla version and the complete version which includes a comprehensive introduction and a detailed running commentary."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"This book is an embarrassment. It is cheap for a reason: This little book is all of 96 pages long, including the introduction.The best edition of Sun Tzu is the Special Edition that contains two English versions; one simple version, like this one without commentary or notes and another version that the complete, fully documented Giles's Edition and, in addition, it has the text in Chinese Characters.If you are going to spend the time and effort to read and understand Sun Tzu, you may as well spend a few dollars more and have a book that is worth the money."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"Sun Tzu's work, \\"The Art of War,\\" originally written sometime in the period of time from 400 to 300 B.C.E., has experienced numerous revivals in popularity over the years. During the 1970s it was popular with students of the New Left when the study of guerrilla warfare was in vogue. In the 1980s, \\"The Art of War,\\" reappeared in quite different company.In the 1980s and early 90's \\"The Art of War\\" was often carried in the brief cases of corporate raiders, who quoted from it liberally to explain their view of the corporate world into which they had entered. Note that the characters played by Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen in Oliver Stone's 1987 movie, \\"Wall Street\\" are pictured quoting Sun Tzu's \\"The Art of War,\\" and Wesley Snips in Kevin Hooks 1992 movie, \\"Passenger 57\\" pictured reading the book in the plane about to be hijacked.Although this volume translated by Samuel B. Griffith, published in 1963 by Oxford University Press, with a forward by B.H. Lidell Hart is not the only translation available, obviously. In addition to the entire text, the volume also contains an appendix with significant additional material on the influence of Sun Tzu down through the ages. I had found James Clavell's version quite difficult to find, but well worth it - due to clarity of reading and balance. I tried reading Cleary's version, but could not get through the first chapter. However, I did purchase \\"Mastering the Art of War\\" by Cleary; finding it a better tour guide. Clavell's \\"Art of War\\" offers tactical insight on overcoming an opponent whether it be war, work, relationships, or your own personal demons.Sun Tzu created a timeless piece of history written for the future. I personally feel that today's society needs to look back, master the art of war, in order to repair the future. I recommend you read it and see how a book can be so popular after 2500 plus years written can be so respected!"},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"I first learned about this book when I was reading selections from it in another book called A Collection of Wisdom (which, by the way, I highly recommend to anybody and everybody). I found the passages so outstanding that I soon became a full-fledged Art of War fan, reading anyhting and everything on it and even frequenting the internet Sun Tzu sites.It is really amazing how this book is still applicable today, and not just to military operations, but to so many other aspects of life. Sun Tzu teaches in a straightforward style how to command an operation of utmost efficiency and effectiveness. Everything he recommends is only concerned with the best ends to the best means.Rather than formulate rigid guidlines, Sun Tzu teaches us to base strategy on the infinite variety of circumstances and based on the foe we are facing. He teaches us to know ourselcves and whether we are in condition to attack, to know our enemies and know if they are in the condition to be atttacked, and to know the environmentla conditions in order to deermine whether fighting is practical. He advises us to have a balanced perspective based on defense and offense, the former protecting ourselves from defeat, and the latter making victory complete. He tells us to know the oppoenets weak spots and exploit them, and to avod where he is strong. And of course, he tells us to base warfare on deception, and to use direct methods and indirect methods in combination.To use Sun Tzu's way, you must guard yourself, put on false appearances, and wait for the enemy to give you an opponent to make a mistake or leave himself open for atack. Then you must capitalize on it. He also says we shoudl bait opponents into vulnerbale spots. And we must use spies to gather information.He also offers perspectives on picking the right people for the right jobs, and utilizing combined energy. Sun Tzu also tells us to be precise in out timing, and to avoid prolonged warfare, and know that the great aim is victory, and not lengthy campaigns.I have read abut a dozen translations, all of them pretty good. Honestly, my favorite is the old school Lionel Giles translation. Also check out the book A Collection of Wisdom by Rodney Ohebsion, which although it does not contain the complete text, it contains most of best parts, and in what I think is the best translation of all."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"An absolute necessity for businessmen, strategists, parents, kids, plankton, bacteria...basically anything that breathes life. Applicable from battlefield to the bathroom...an owners manual for your life."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"Sun Tzu communicates his tactical advice in thirteen chapters, each covering a different aspect of warfare: Laying Plans, Waging War, Attack by Stratagem, Tactical Dispositions, Energy, Weak Points and Strong, Maneuvering, Variation of Tactics, The Army on the March, Terrain, The Nine Situations, The Attack by Fire, and The Use of Spies.In each chapter, Tzu gives a mix of advice. Some of it deals with the psychological aspects of good leadership, while some of it covers the particulars of warfare. Some of it is rather trivial, while some of it is interesting and occasionally provocative. Here are a few examples:- He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.- A clever general avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return.- If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.- A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.This edition uses the Giles translation, which is quite terse but still fairly lucid.

It is a book detailing great planning and strategy of wartime. It discusses the role of leaders and how they should handle their troops. This information is useful when applied to managing one's own team.

I had to return this book, along with a few others which suffer from this problem. Luckily, Amazon handled the exchange of the two books I had to return promptly.As to the The Art of War itself, it is of course the most important work on military philosophy ever written (at least that's what my husband told me to write). I am plowing through the other deluxe edition I received instead of this one with the errors, but so far it is just as fascinating as the special about The Art of War I saw on the History Channel."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"Today many of Sun Tzu quotas are floating around mixed with Shakespeare and the Bible. And as with many of the quote they are out of context and misleading. The quoter usually thinks repeating the word is some sort of magic.Most versions of this work spend more time trying to identify and qualify Sun Tzu's writings than just quoting them. I will not go through all the arguments as to who \\"wrote what when\\" or \\"translated what when\\" as you can read this for yourself.Another distraction is the attempt to show how the book was applied or not applied in recent wars. This may be interesting to someone whose intention is to apply the theories of Sun Tzu; however it is not his writing but someone else's interpretation of its application.Now let's finally get to Sun Tzu. It is easy with hindsight and a closer look at the future to dismiss Sun Tzu as his practical tactical knowledge is of a time and place long gone. He spends a lot of time on the use of weapons and information gathering techniques of the time. This can be interesting in a historical context; other wise it is quite amusing.Oh yes those grains of truth I mentioned, well they may sound like clich's but they are still viable. \\"Know your enemy and know yourself\\". Others are just practical sense and statistical outcomes that you learn in any military training. I could go through the list, but again that is why you buy the book.Now just as you decide that the book is outdated for any practical purposes today we have artillery and now stealth and precision, the reminder that \\"no two wars are alike\\" and \\"it is flexibility that makes a difference\\" is being shown today to still be true. Even in today's wars there is a need for good intelligence and deception. We put a lot of time and energy into Psy-Ops. Sun Tzu shows the advantage in specialized units and crack troops.I have spent several years in the military and in business and can say this book is a nice addition to history, otherwise of very little value to today's world for war or business.The most abuse of this book is trying to use it for projects as project management is a science that that was in its infancy at the time this book was written."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"The Art of War, a military treatise written by Sun Tzu around 500 B.C. in ancient China, teaches many good lessons to anyone who will ever have to command a group of people, in the workplace, in school, or on the battlefield.

Some of the points he makes seem obvious to anyone with even a smattering of military knowledge -- like tactical retreat when faced with overwhelming odds -- but they're only obvious because he invented them.

In this way, it is similar to Machiavelli's The Prince (also a very important book on military and political affairs in a highly contentious environment) - a multi-polar environment.Sun Tzu's The Art of War is a serious book for the serious student of political science, strategic thinking, and military and political strategic and tactical decision making.It may seem to some to be a book of aphorisms or \\"lessons\\" - which may appear to some to be trite, and many people have tried to show the import of its lessons in the context of business management in terms of the competition of firms - lessons which may be applicable and relevant.However, if you want to study strategy (as it relates to any context: military, political, business, etc.) - this is simply required reading, and careful and considered reading of it, will reward the reader.

And even though the lack of annotation means that you don't get the full richness of Giles' (and that of the ancient Chinese commentators he regularly quotes) nuanced (and sometimes corrective) interpretation; sometimes the footnotes/mixed-in annotations have a way of distracting the mind from The Art of War proper itself.This edition should be a welcome read for both first-time readers (who should definitely consider also buying an annotated edition eventually) and those who already know the nuances and want to read Sun Tzu's masterpiece without constant the interruptions (however helpful and well intentioned they may be)."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"I've looked at 3 different versions of this book, trying to find the best...

It was also suggested reading during my entire time in business school. So, I finally pulled the trigger and read the \\"original\\" (or at least the most well-regarded translation) The Art of War. The most impressive thing to me (which is explained in the introductory material) is how well the Chinese recorded their history. My only complaint about the introductory materials was that most great Chinese historical figures have multiple names - this makes it hard to track who is who in some of the commentaries. The actual strategies themselves are full of guidelines on determining your opponent's weaknesses, exploiting them and achieving victory. Not exactly full of moral or ethical advice, so I can't use much of it. I'm glad that I read it as it gave me a great look into Chinese history...but its practical use in my world is limited."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"The original book written in Chinese is a great strategy book, however, the English translation in this version is so poor that it is obvious that the translator did not fully comprehend nor being able to convey the essense of these strategies. Keep in mind that Chinese language must be taken in its entire context, not seperated into individual characters and then translated word for word. What the translator has done in this case is equivalent to, for example, when English speakers say \\"Today, it rained cats and dogs\\", the translator automatically translated into \\"Today, it rained cats (as in the sense of house pet) and dogs (as in the sense of house pet)\\" instead of translating into \\"Today, it rained heavily\\".

The book is a collection of military stratagem and thought here translated by Lionel Giles at the dawn of the twentieth Century, which is considered one of the more authoritative translations of the tome.The Art Of War is a book of ancient battle and warfare, but when considered allegorically is read for its teachings and implication in management, corporate strategy and personal conflict. The Art Of War advises generals to know their own force, know the enemy and calculate odds of winning based on multiple factors. War should only be waged when the conditions are right and conducive to victory.The book itself is 2,500 years old and the translation is over a century old hence the arcane language and the references to measurements, persons and tools that are even more so, but it would be an understatement to say that The Art Of War has aged well. The book has been cited by modern generals, read widely in Japan, United States and modern China and even referenced in the original Wall Street film. The book is also referenced in the Connery/Snipes Japan corporate-connected film, Rising Sun. Quotations from the book appear on banners in Kurosawa's Kagemusha. It likely influenced Musashi Miyamoto's The Book Of Five RingsThe Book of Five Rings (Bushido--The Way of the Warrior).It is manifest to any practical and minimally observant individual that while humanity has made tremendous technological strides in the last 2,500 years, the same cannot be said of the advancement in philosophy, thought and logic. Indeed, it could be argued that humanity has walked backwards in philosophy and rational thinking. An ancient man would be shocked and beguiled with modern technology. Barely a living man could match ancient thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, Cyrus, Cicero or Yoga in philosophy, logic and debate.This edition of The Art Of War is just past fifty pages long and is concise in that only the text itself is presented and without introduction, preface or foot notes."},{"Title":"The art of war: The oldest military treatise in the world","review":"This item was exactly what I was looking for!

Instead, it was the passed-along gift of an aunt --fittingly, a Daughter of Charity who in those days sported the intimidating wings that Sally Field would later demystify for me-- and one of the many books on a wide range of genres and topics she carried on long train rides from El Paso to St. Louis.THE QUIET LIGHT also was, I believe, instrumental in sparking my earliest desire to write my own novels.And that is surprising, because De Wohl's narrative, character development, and spellbinding prose made THE QUIET LIGHT much more than the fictionalized biography of Thomas Aquinas I had expected. It was nothing less than a staggering example of compelling storytelling which, by the sheer enormity of talent displayed, should have intimidated any aspiring/wanna-be writer.Be advised: you will come away from THE QUIET LIGHT with more than the pleasure of having read a masterly crafted novel of the Middle Ages. Rather, you will find yourself informed and educated on everything from the Crusades to the philosopical infighting then being waged throughout both Europe and the Saracen worlds to the intrigues of the Italian nobility and their Germanic, decidedly unholy Holy Roman Emperor. You will marvel at how De Wohl weaves all this into a story that is filled with richly drawn characters, both historical and fictional.By the end of THE QUIET LIGHT, you may even discover you have learned something about how to tell a story in a way that makes the reader mourn that he or she has reached the end of the book.THE QUIET LIGHT is that good. So is Louis De Wohl.--Earl Merkel(Author of FLU SEASON and LIKE DISTANT CITIES BURNING, Penguin/Putnam's New American Library; both books are due out in Summer 2001)."},{"Title":"The quiet light,: A novel","review":"This edifying novel about the life of St. Thomas Aquinas actually focuses on the people who were all touched by his serene, cheerful, ascetic way of living. Carefully told through the eyes of the faithful knight-turned friar-turned knight again, his devoted sister, his protective mother, his arrogant brothers, and his fellow priests, the story reveals to us how a simple man brought spiritual strength and renewal to those around him, during a time of great political turmoil. The author does not tell the story through the lips of St. Thomas. At times, we may even feel cheated, thinking to ourselves that the story deviates too much from the simple life of the Dominican monk, to focus on the other characters. However, this ingenious manner of story-telling alludes fittingly to the way Thomas lived: quietly, doing the work of God, contemplating on mysteries only he shared with God, praying for those he loved, and discreetly staying away from all the attention he deserved."},{"Title":"The quiet light,: A novel","review":"In a panoramic fashion, Louis De Wohl makes accessible certain 13th Century aspects and personalities. We discover kings and warriors, court intrigue and noble family feuds, mild brutality and saintly virtue, knights and monastic settings. There is even courtly romance, and an insightful portrayal of the birth of science. Saint Thomas Aquinas is situated very quietly around the edges of the dynamic action of the book. Perhaps too quietly. For the story tells far more about events that happened, or could have happened, than it does about the work and life of St. Thomas. In fairness, however, it manages to relay popular Thomas stories, and provides a sampling of that giant and saintly intellect. So I recomend this book to anyone interested in Saint Thomas, or 13th Century Europe. It is a suitable family book, and would interest readers of historical novels. The work accomplishes making one feel both the frantic upheavals of Medieval Europe, and the reassuring order of Faith and Reason, that St.Thomas did so much to discover and invigorate."},{"Title":"The quiet light,: A novel","review":"An excellent book about the life and times of a great saint. It would be hard to estimate the spiritual fruit which this man's intellect has produced. The Catholic Church as well as intellectual life in general has benifited much from his life and writings. This is a well written book and hard to put down. I gave it four stars, however, because it is a novel more about the historical situation of the saint than the saint himself. Although the book did try and speculate about the some of the motivations of the saint, it failed to tackle his philosophy. Nevertheless, the book is sure to inspire further readings, especially into Thomas' own writings."},{"Title":"The quiet light,: A novel","review":"The life of St. Thomas Aquinas interwoven with a love story of his beautiful younger sister, Theodora. Thomas was born into a world of war and heresy. He was taken to a monastery of Benedictine monks at the age of 5 years as a mark of repentence by his guilt-ridden father, a baron of Italy. His father had burnt down the same monastery earlier in his life at the command of a wicked and lascivious emporer, Frederick II. His mother wanted him to be an abbot in the powerful Benedictine order, but he shamed her by choosing the life of a poor beggar in the new order of mendicants, the Dominicans. But even there, his brilliance was quickly recognized. He became known for his ability to recognize truth and error in every philosophical and theological argument, and to calmly put the truth in language for all to understand. One of his teachers once asked him &quot;Thomas, has anyone in your life ever been able to intimidate you?&quot; He responded, &quot;Yes, Christ on the cross.&quot; Very good and entertaining. Louis De Wohl brings one of the most brilliant men in history down to a level that we can all understand."},{"Title":"The quiet light,: A novel","review":"This Catholic historical novel, published in 1950, has proven a delightful surprise. Although a great reader of historical fiction of all types and vintages, I confess I ordered this book with trepidation, expecting that any sort of religious fiction, consciously marketed as such, might be too sentimental to suit my taste. On the contrary, The Quiet Light is a terrific example of most of the finest conventions in historical fiction: exciting, witty, often stylish, capable of piquing one's interest in the period and its leading figures. It's not at all interested in preaching to its reader, choosing instead to engage his or her attention in the conflicts of the period, whether physical, intellectual or spiritual.De Wohl apparently wrote many novels about Catholic saints. I chose this one because of St. Thomas's special significance to me, as the patron of scholars. Like the best historical fiction, it not only excites and delights me in its trappings and makes me want to read more, but also led me to investigate the personages and events of the day, to see how well the fictional and historical have been woven. The novel remained at a high standard of quality throughout and was on occasion both moving and exciting. About the only things I can say against it is that it takes an unflinchingly anti-Muslim slant (perhaps not that unusual for a 1950 Catholic novel) and it falls prey occasionally to heavy handed dialogue--not stilted but heavy on exposition. But given the wide scope of the novel, De Wohl is actually pretty subtle at getting the historical essentials across as smoothly as possible.The novel's somewhat peripheral treatment of St. Thomas is surprising at first, but then begins to make sense as his full story emerges. Thomas spends his days writing, teaching, thinking and praying, while Italy and his family are being torn to pieces around him. The main focus of the story is on political situations, then, (mainly the conflict between Emperor Fredrick II and Rome) which Thomas informs, inspires, and illuminates when the main characters seek him out, but which he only tangentially affects himself. That De Wohl is so capable at evoking this complicated political situation, that he can do so without resorting to tired genre clich&eacute;s, is the really delightful thing about the novel.Some brief mention of the people and places this novel manages to take on, within its 377 pages. Historical persons featured as characters include Thomas and Frederick of course, but also the following: Albert the Great (Albertus Magnus), one of Thomas's teachers; the Emperor's sons Manfred and Conrad, each of whom eventually become kings; Edward I; St. Louis of France; William of St. Amour, who writes a treatise against the mendicant orders which Thomas challenges; St. Bonaventure, claimed to be the heart of the Franciscans as Thomas is the heart of the Dominicans; John of Procida, a physician in Frederick II's service--at least I think he's historical; and Roger Bacon. Many other historical persons figure in the novel but aren't characters, including Popes Alexander IV, Urban IV, and Clement IV.As for place, The Quiet Light roams around Italy quite a bit: Monte Cassino, the monastery; the University of Naples; Parma; Rocca Secca and other homes of the Aquino families. Paris also is visited, mainly Notre Dame and the Convent of St. Jacques. One scene of the crusades (mostly a backdrop for the novel) takes place at El Mohar, which I take to be in North Africa.A really delightful surprise--probably would make a great gift too! I'm definitely ready for more De Wohl soon."},{"Title":"The quiet light,: A novel","review":"Louis DeWohl has crafted another masterpiece that touches on the nature of love as wonderfully interpreted by that great lover of God, Saint Thomas. The first love for Thomas, as it should be for all is God, all other loves however great must be put after. Thomas as a person of love, a saint, brings this love to all the characters he encounters in the novel; Piers Rudde, an English knight who comes into the service of Thomas' family and undergoes the torture of loving someone who cannot return that love properly. Then there is Thomas's sister Theodora with her heart torn with sorrow and guilt who Thomas is a father to. Thomas' holy life is infectious and \\"infects\\" all those who come into contact with him. I hope I will be forgiven by speaking so little about plot and action, of which there is plenty, for I just finished this book and found Thomas the man even more loveable than Thomas the genius. This is a book that can change one's life and I am still so moved that I have no more words to write."},{"Title":"The quiet light,: A novel","review":"This book was \\"just right\\" for me: accurate historical facts to make it educational, entertaining fiction to make it readable, and enough Aquinas philosophy to make it informative. If you are looking for such a balance and enjoy historical fiction, check it out! If you are looking to delve deep into one of these areas, consider this book as introductory."},{"Title":"The quiet light,: A novel","review":"Louis De Wohl manages to craft a stunning tower of brilliant writing, maybe somewhat akin to Thomas' own cathedral of thought. He masterfully portrays the courtly life and times of the middle ages and gave special depth to the reality of living as one of the nobility and yet desiring God. This stroke of genius is what really made the book for me. The story of the life of a saint is often told as a series of miracles portraying them as a holy person. While this does that, it shows how in the context of living as an Aquino that it could have been difficult. I believe that the book also gives sufficient depth to the reality of God's grace at work in a person as they gradually come to understand more and more of his plan.The only thing that I would fault the book with is that it really does focus on the history that surrounds St. Thomas Aquinas and the 13th century world in which he lived. While this helps us understand, it also leaves the saint in the shadows sometimes where he is not heard from for longer passages as others debate or act.All in all, it is a book that greatly assisted me in my spiritually journey and I whole-heartedly recommend it to others."},{"Title":"The quiet light,: A novel","review":"I have read the following books by Louis de Wohl: The Quiet Light, The Joyful Beggar, Lay Seige to Heaven, The Glorious Folly, and Citadel of God(partially through it). Without a doubt, The Quiet Light is the best of them all."},{"Title":"The quiet light,: A novel","review":"DeWohl tells the story of the life of Thomas Aquinas through the eyes of an English knight, Sir Piers, and his interactions with the Aquinas family. It spans the time from when Thomas is a teen living at a wealthy monastery to his death years later after his writings and teaching have made him famous. Set against the tumultuous backdrop of medieval Italian history, deWohl mixes romance, war, politics and religion in a way that keeps the story interesting and moving at a brisk pace while quielty contrasting Thomist values with those of the society in which he lived. DeWohl skims lightly over most of these areas. He is clearly more interested in telling a good story than in explicating any of the political or doctrinal issues in detail, but, he touches the high points of the life and teachings of a celebrated philosopher. This was one of my favorite stories when I first read it as a teenager. It was still enjoyable, despite its limits, when I reread it recently."},{"Title":"The quiet light,: A novel","review":"A great novel! Portrays the life of St.Thomas Aquinas, one of the most influential scholars in the Catholic church. Extremely well done!

A book worth reading for readers of all ages!"},{"Title":"The quiet light,: A novel","review":"I concur completely with the comments of the previous reviewer. I didn't know what to expect with this kind of novel, but the writing, character development, and story pacing were superb.

Most of them are to do with the implausibility of Barbie, but what if she was real, what are some of the issues she'd have to face. Is Barbie a healthy or an unhealthy image and why don't we have healthy female imagery and Role-Models in our culture. These are the Barbies that would never exist, because they would disturb the corporate mentality of Mattel.In some places it's overdone but you can imagine that Strohmeyer getting angry at Barbie and her images and deciding that she was going to make fun of her rather than just rant a little and feel impotent."},{"Title":"Barbie Unbound: A Parody of the Barbie Obsession","review":"Since I don't have a quarrel with Mattel's Barbie, I only found this book mildly amusing.The best part of this cynical take off and put down on Barbie, are the photographs of the doll in various unusual settings and costumings--such as &quot;Welfare Queen Barbie&quot;, and &quot;Hot Flash Barbie&quot;, as well as some looks at historical Barbie's such as &quot;Barbie Curie&quot; and &quot;Groovin' Gravity Gallileo Barbie&quot;, to name a few.There are approximately 27 take-offs of different characters Barbie could be, along with an interview with Barbie, and an epilogue entitled &quot;What if Barbie were one of us.&quot;While I agree Barbie is thinner and leggier than a normal woman would be, I don't tend to take this very seriously. She is, after all, only a doll.The invention of Barbie, unfortunately, came too late for me. I do think it good that Mattel has widened the scope of &quot;careers&quot; and &quot;interests&quot; for their Barbie doll.I've never quite understood how popular icons such as Barbie become objects of venom. However, if Barbie is on that list for you, then you should greatly enjoy this book.The book was a bit unclear to me in their layout for each of their Barbie subjects, but no less clear than is Barbie herself. As I've never understood why the doll keeps being re-created always with the name Barbie but with a different descriptive name infront of the Barbie."},{"Title":"Reputations : Essays in Criticism","review":"Re the edition sold by GenealogyAuthor- This edition breaches copyright and is published without the permission of the copyright owner and literary executor of Douglas Goldring, Polly Bird, PhD."},{"Title":"Napalm Dreams (Men of Valor)","review":"John F.

The conversations, while essentially true to the original, are enlivened by the introduction of a very active narrator and his skeptical friend who bring up the issues addressed by Brother Lawrence 300 years ago.

No wonder this author is at the top of so many reading lists."},{"Title":"In the reign of terror: The adventures of a Westminster boy","review":"This is one of my favorite stories by Henty.If more young people spent more of their time reading books like this one then chivalry and respect for women might be more common.Boys would again act like gentlemen and girls like ladies.Heroism would be part of life and not just a curious trait of characters in old books.The characters in this story are quick thinking,brave,and honorable.This tale takes place during one of the most frightening times in history yet the character of our heroes gives us a happy ending.This book is well worth your time."},{"Title":"In the reign of terror: The adventures of a Westminster boy","review":"We listened to this excellent story on audio cd as a family. It was captivating and we learned a lot about the French Revolution without even trying! My 9-year-old and 11-year-old listened to the story again a few months later after we had studied some of the facts of the revolution and enjoyed it thoroughly a second time through. I recommend GA Henty's audio books performed by Jim Weiss in abridged form- available through Lamppost Publishing website. I like these stories because you get a good undestanding of the context of a historical time period, and the main characters are courageous, honest, and good problem solvers."},{"Title":"In the reign of terror: The adventures of a Westminster boy","review":"A fine young white male plays the leading role in yet another one of Henty's kiddy story books. If you are a young boy (perhaps under 13) and would like to imagine yourself as such a lad (a lad that saves Rousseau, some beautiful French girl, etc.) then perhaps this is the book for you. If you are one of those silly girls who likes to dream about underage boys running about buisily doing all these fabulous deeds (again, such as saving Rousseau's life) without changing the course of history, then maybe this book is for you. But, you will grow out of this stuff (I hope...for the sake of those that be about you). However, I enjoy this stuff while you can. You will never be able to later.

Most of us have a general knowledge of presidents Theodore Roosevelt (TR) and Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR). We also have some idea of the contributions of Eleanor Roosevelt to the world stage. The story of Eleanor Roosevelt and her female kin (grandmother, aunts and cousins) is in some respects even more remarkable than that of the Roosevelt men.The book starts with Martha \\"Mittie\\" Bulloch Roosevelt, TR's mother. This beautiful Southern Belle married the senior Theodore Roosevelt. While often times spoiled, fragile and frivolous, she was also a caring mother and patient teacher to her children. According to Caroli, she withdrew from \\"family competition\\" in order that her plain daughters would \\"feel superior to her, to develop both wit and charm sufficient to outshine her inordinately good looks.\\" Though she never lived to see her four granddaughters, they all credited her for her contributions to the Roosevelt family.Mittie's daughters, Anna Roosevelt Cowles and Corinne Roosevelt Robinson, provide the most engrossing characters in The Roosevelt Women. While not well schooled, they were both bright, articulate and politically astute women. They surrounded themselves with powerful, witty and intelligent men and their houses were the center of lively and sparkling conversation. In later life, Corinne became a published poet and a public speaker. While these sisters were trailblazers in many ways, they were content to stay in the shadow of their more famous brother, TR, and never flaunted their relationship with him. Yet, they did everything in their power to help TR reach his political goals. It has been said that if Anna, Corinne and Teddy were all alive today, the women would make better presidential material.Subsequent chapters cover the lives of Mittie's daughter-in-law, Edith (TR's second wife), Eleanor Roosevelt, Corinne Robinson Alsop (Corinne's daughter), Alice Longworth (TR's oldest daughter), and Ethel Derby (TR's youngest daughter). \\"Princess Alice\\" is probably the most colorful of the group and was considered the \\"other Washington Monument.\\" TR once said of his wayward and headstrong daughter \\"I can run the country, or I can control Alice. I cannot possibly do both.\\"The Roosevelt Women is a very readable book, and often seems more like a novel than a work of nonfiction. But this is by no means the complete story of all the Roosevelt women, as there is very little on the Hyde Park side of the family (Eleanor Roosevelt was an Oyster Bay Roosevelt before she married her 5th cousin, Franklin) Sara Delano Roosevelt (FDR's mom) does not rate her own chapter. Also, there are no women covered in depth after the generation of Mittie's granddaughters. Still, these criticisms aside, this is a book not to be missed by any true Roosevelt fan."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"I wasn't expecting to like this book. The Roosevelt women I knew about, like Eleanor, seemed too wealthy and upper class to interest me. However, once I started reading (at a friend's recommendation), I was drawn into each of these Roosevelt women's stories. The history and politics in the book were easy to grasp, and everything that happened in the lives of the women discussed was made vivid and dramatic by the author. I wish I could sit down with her and have a cup of coffee and hear about the parts she left out."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"I enjoyed immensely this collective biography of a group of women linked by a family name made famous by two presidents. Each was a notable, and in some cases extraordinary character in her own right. It is not an easy task to untangle and explicate the intricate skeins of nine overlapping stories, but the author succeeds wonderfully by filling her book with memorable details, photographs and contexts for each of these women. I felt very well guided through the complexities of their relationships with each other and to the men of the family, and the influences they exerted, many of which have not been as clearly profiled in biographies focusing on the Roosevelt men. I was grateful for the large doses of social historical context, which helped me appreciate the scope of some of the lesser-known women's accomplishments. Caroli writes in the most affecting terms, clearly delineating each personality in her own right and in terms of the mark she left on American history. The choice to approach these women as a large group differentiates this book from other Roosevelt biographies and underlines the qualities of immense energy, curiosity, and forcefulness of character which are the common threads of these women's lives.I found it a fascinating read and could not put the book down."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"This was a pretty well written biography of the women of the Roosevelt family. It includes TR's mother and sisters and a few others you don't ordinarily read about, such as his second daughter, a niece, his second wife. The author does not go into any great depth for any of these women, but she gives a good overview of the lives of each. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"I've just finished a wonderful book which I'd like to recommend to anyone interested in a good read. Betty Boyd Caroli's, THE ROOSEVELT WOMEN, reads like a good novel. It's filled with interesting stories, enticing gossip, and legendary women, - all combined with good history. Although I was familiar with Eleanor Roosevelt's story, I must admit that I knew very little about most of the Roosevelt women Ms. Caroli introduced me to. These aunts and cousins were role models for Eleanor - women who traveled the world, wrote books, served in state legislatures, even addressed the Republican National Convention - all while raising families and running large households. If you want some insight into the lives of the women in this very special American family, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"This is a simply wonderful book for what it tells us both about the women of the Roosevelt clan and the men. Caroli's story lends great insight to both Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt and the relationship between the two.The book is set up as a series of smaller books, each one on a particular Roosevelt woman. The great thing is how Caroli connects these women to each other and to the politics of the time. It is interesting to see how different these women were as well as similar. For many of them, their most important relationships with men (outside their brothers/fathers) were not their husbands. Bamie, Corinne and Alice's husbands all take a backseat to other men - often the political magnets of the day. Not that scandal haunted any of these women (except Alice, who courted it). There were some genuine love matches - Edith and Theodore really had a strong, passionate marriage.Caroli begins with Theodore Roosevelt's mother, Mittie. Mittie is often an overlooked figure and this book brings out who she was and why. It also gives great insight to the childhood of TR and how the Civil War affected him quite differently than you'd expect. Mittie's sister, Anna Gracie, is also a huge force in the life of the young Roosevelts and we see this chapter.Then Caroli covers TR's sisters: Bamie Roosevelt Cowles and Corrine Roosevelt Robinson. Both these women played down their role in their brother's political life, but this book shows how involved they actually were. Both these women contributed greatly to the political future of the US. These women were also the models for the next generation and where they went for advice and help.The fourth \\"book\\" talks about Edith Roosevelt (TR's wife) and Sara Delano Roosevelt (Franklin's mother). What is interesting here is the comparisons that Caroli draws between these two women. Edith was seen as the perfect wife and companion while Sara was vilified as the evil mother-in-law. Yet Caroli manages to show them as real women, beyond that basic stereotype. I especially find it interesting how involved Sara was in creating the woman we know as Eleanor Roosevelt. Eleanor, in the beginning of her marriage, needed the advice and guidance of the older woman, although she would later outgrow it, hence the later picture of Sara.Then Caroli covers Eleanor Roosevelt, but here it is interesting to see the background to the political life we know so well. Eleanor, although Franklin's wife, is also Theodore's niece (the daughter of his brother, Elliot) and connected to both sides of the family. With this generation we see the split between the \\"Theodores\\" and \\"Franklins\\" politically and then moreorless socially (although there is never a complete severing of ties). Theodore's family had always been staunch Republicans, but Franklin was going to be the golden boy of the Democratic party, which would rub hard on the \\"Theodores.\\"Next we see another niece of TR's, Corinney Alsop [her name is Corinne, but the family called her Corinney and to distinguish mother and daughter, Caroli does as well], the daughter of his sister Corinne. Corinney followed in her mother's shoes as a political speaker and activist, even serving in political office herself (one of the few to do so and the only of this generation). Corinney also kept some of the best relationships with the \\"Franklins\\" and even voted for him at one point.Finally we cover TR's daughters: Alice and Ethel in the last two sections. Ethel's life revolved around family and her activities more confined than some of her cousins. Alice, while not an activist in any sense, was one of the best known figures of Washington for her outrageous behavior and tongue. Alice would literally say anything. The stark contrast between these two sisters is brought out as we see Ethel as the more dutiful and responsible and Alice as the butterfly, always seeking attention, yet these two were constant friends throughout their long lives.This book is definitely worth your attention for several reasons. First, it showcases these oft-overlooked political figures of the Roosevelt clan. Second, it gives new insight to the men who rose to political heights on the shoulders of these women. Lastly, it is just plain entertaining and well-written - a completely enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"Betty Boyd Caroli gives equal and entertaining time to several generations of Roosevelt women who were just as intelligent and strong-minded as their male counterparts (if not more so), even if they didn't have the same career opportunities. This extremely well-written and thoughtful book fills a long-neglected gap in the copious field of Rooseveltiana. Highly recommended to casual readers and historians alike. More compelling as fact than most fiction you'll ever read."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"This book really held my attention. While I must admit that I still get a little confused with the Roosevelt family tree, this book gave me just enough information about the Roosevelt women. It's refreshing to read about the women behind the men!"},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"This book is so good, I can't put it down. It should be on the reading list of every college student doing Women's Studies, as well as regular history courses. Thanks to Book Notes for interviewing this author on C-span, I can continue my education with these wonderfully insightful books."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"What a delightful book. While Caroli's title, &quot;The Roosevelt Women&quot;, could cover as many talented women as there are rabbits, she has elected to portray those she found most interesting. Roosevelt-philes, including relatives, may resent her exclusion of some members of the clan they deem of more importance than those who appear as subjects of the book. Inclusion of all would have meant a computer-like scrolling and a Britannica compendium. As written, her subjects have personae made relevant to her modern readers. Good for Caroli."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"I did not find much in the way of fresh information in this book. Just about everything has been published already ---- and many of the more peripheral Roosevelt women (who left little in the way of extensive diaries or memoranda) remain elusive. Thus the book is frustrating."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"Two years ago,I started my Teddy Roosevelt addiction when I was browsing through a book store as my wife was signing up for a tole painting class next door. Though the book store is no more I read everything I can about the Roosevelts.After six books about TR, I felt I wasnt getting a full picture about his parents or his siblings.When the author centers her story around the family other than Teddy I got a better perspective on him as a son,brother and uncle.If you want know more about a very interesting family.I highly recommend this book. Then you will agree with me and wonder why Spielberg hasn't made their story into a film. Heck I would settle for a mini-series on Lifetime."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"Surprise, a lot of the interesting \\"Roosevelt\\" women married into the clan!Betty Caroli writes and interesting and fast moving, factual, book about the women in both the \\"Theodores\\" and \\"Franklins\\" branches of this amazing, intermarried, family. She manages to tell their stories with a minimum of confusion which is no mean feat since the Roosevelts like a number of other families tend to use the same \\"family\\" name generation after generation and collateral branches.After visiting Hot Springs, GA and Hyde Park, NY (including Val Kill and The Cottage on the Hill) I had to know more about the women who supported (and sometimes managed) the men and families and travelled the world when travel was long and arduous. Fabulous reading."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"The women in this book were many faceted. They were wives, mothers, grandmother, help-mates for their husbands as well as leading their own lives, in some instances. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and it was interesting learning how each of them reacted to the pitfalls and high points in each of their lives, how they interacted with each other as well as with those family members that were either supporters or detractors, and how their attitudes about life shaped the lives of their children and grandchildren. If you love history, and especially the Roosevelt family history, this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"This book discusses in detail the lives of a dozen Roosevelt women - Teddy's sisters, Eleanor, Teddy's mother, and Franklin's mother (and others). Very well written and interesting. The Roosevelts were not as intelligent and capable as everyone thinks, but the women were interesting enough to make this a good read if you want to know more about the less famous members of the Roosevelt family. I would read this one first before others that are similar."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"I was delighted to read Betty Boyd Caroli's new book, &quot;The Roosevelt Women.&quot; While I've read a lot about Eleanor Roosevelt, I knew next to nothing about the other Roosevelt women. According to Caroli's book, ER's aunts had a major influence on her. Perhaps the future First Lady saw in them what strong women could accomplish. The aunts and cousins Caroli describes were quite accomplished in their own right. They wrote books, traveled the world, one became a state legislator and one even gave a speech at the Republican National Convention. While they seemed to have very active lives apart from their husbands, they also played traditional female roles raising children and running large households. &quot;The Roosevelt Women&quot; reads like a novel. It was a pleasure to learn about the other women in this amazing family."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"Coroli discounts assertions that Eleanor Roosevelt had a lesbian affair with Lorena Hickok -- an affair that is more than amply documented in another book out this season, published by Macmillan, (and available from Amazon.com) entitled: Empty Without You : The Intimate Letters of Eleanor Roosevelt and Lorena Hickok."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"Lots of fascinating Roosevelt women are missing from this stew. Why not give a line or two to Selwa &quot;Lucky&quot; Roosevelt, Chief of Protocol for the Reagan White House, or the distinguished anthroplogist Anna C. Roosevelt, of Chicago's Field Museum? What is the point of focusing so much attention on Eleanor Roosevelt and Alice Roosevelt Longworth, each of whom have been the subjucts of dozens of full biographies? Is there really, at this point, anything we don't all already know about Eleanor, Alice and their often-strained relationship? As Caroli's dull book demonstrates, the answer is &quot;no&quot;."},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"There is no fresh research here. Just old stories regurgitated. So Alice Longworth was sharp tongued and Eleanor Roosevelt was destroyed by an emotionally-bankrupted childhood. What else is new?"},{"Title":"The Roosevelt Women","review":"The book's treatment of most Roosevelt women is trivial and one-dimensional. For example: Mittie = Southern Bell. Sara = haughty Brahmin dowager. Eleanor = do-gooder. And so forth. I gleaned absolutely no new insight from this work. NOTHING. Now I realize why Publishers Weekly gave it such an awful review."},{"Title":"Dare the school build a new social order? (The John Day pamphlets)","review":"Count's brief book on the role of teachers in the shaping of society's values is a must read for future teachers and anyone interested in the social foundations of education. By positing that teacher should champion classroom discourse that focuses on issues of democratic living, he places the emphasis of the curriculum where it should be - issues of social justice. Likewise the implementation of this ethically conscious curriculum is left in the hands of those who, if empowered, could have the greatest impact concerning issues of equity in American society - classroom teachers. The relevance of Count's criticism of racism, rote education and of the dangers of unchecked capitalism are such that this work could have just as easily been written in our present."},{"Title":"Dare the school build a new social order? (The John Day pamphlets)","review":"I was disgusted by this book! To suggest that our role as teachers is to build a social order is fundamentally WRONG.

While I am mired in the realities of grad studies in education--lesson plans, theory, pedagogy, etc.--this book helped remind me of why I wanted to pursue teaching in the first place. Counts calls for teachers to become leaders, not just in their schools or local communities, but as an effective, powerful political force. We are the ones in the trenches, aren't we the experts on education in America? Shouldn't we know how to fix it? Shouldn't we try?The book is a bit dated--I couldn't help by shake my head in disgust when I read Counts ideas of what a teacher's union could and should do and compared it to my limited experience with those organizations. He presents an idealized movement where social problems that are the root of educational problems are addressed/eliminated, where teachers are respected leaders and seen as the professionals they are, and where our schools, in the end, effectively serve more students than they currently do."},{"Title":"More than a Pilot: A Pioneer in Mission Aviation","review":"In More than a Pilot Claire Mellis quotes extensively from her late husband's letters as she descriibes the three years they spent in New Guinea, pioneering air services to missionaries in the then wild, mostly unexplored interior of that great island. Those were formative years for the Mellis family and for Mission Aviation Fellowship as well - years of attempting the near-impossible with extremely limited resources and equipment. The interminable, almost-daily changes from wheels to floats to wheels to floats on their single Piper Pacer airplane, for exqample, required a level of patience and commitment almost beyond our present comprehension.Ther were adventures aplenty. Stone age people in a \\"Shangri-La\\" valley. Flights over unmapped terrain. The search for a missing fellow mission pilot. The first landing on a tiny lake to establish a missionary bridgehead in the heart of Dutch New Guinea....But these adventures are merely the backdrop. This is a book about commitment and searching and personal growth.--- excerpt from book's introduction"},{"Title":"Tied Up in Tinsel","review":"Ngaio Marsh (1895-1982) wrote this one just ten years prior to her death. It's a formula cozy murder, much in the vein of her other Inspector Roderick Alleyn/Detective Fox series entries.THE STORY here is that a rich aristocrat (Hilary Bill-Tasman) has re-purchased his noble family's run-down former estate and he's restoring the Manor House (Halberds Manor). Along with that he's bringing a young and beautiful wife into the home, a caveat of which not everyone approves. To add even more to the accoutrements Hilary has hired Inspector Alleyns' wife, the renowned Troy, to paint his portrait (a Marsh theme that we've seen before inFinal Curtain, 1947).To commemorate the event, Hilary has invited his close relatives to celebrate a community Christmas at his not-quite-finished home, where the locals and their children are provided with gifts and subsequently fed a nice supper. Instead of Santa, Hilary opts for an ancient folklore Druid character to deliver the gifts. Providing the domestic service at the event is Hilary's staff, comprised in part of five men who have previously been convicted of murder -- but they've all been rehabilitated... or have they?In any case, Hilary's eccentric and aged Uncle F. Fleaton Forrester (\\"Uncle Flea\\") is supposed to play the Druid role but he falls ill and his personal manservant, Moult, has to take on the task at the last minute. Moult has been somewhat at odds with Hilary's unusual house staff members but it comes as a great surprise to all when Moult comes up missing just after the gifts are distributed.Of course Inspector Alleyn, who has just arrived back in England, ends up on the scene at the snowed-in and isolated mansion and he reluctantly takes on the case -- but his ability to solve the case is hampered as the level of cooperation is not high from the distrustful house staff, all of whom are naturally distrustful of the police.This mystery flows along nicely and one can read it over a couple of evenings -- the hardcover edition (Little, Brown and Company, 1972) runs for 222 pages. As usual, Marsh has crammed this cozy murder with lots of terrific wallpaper and atmosphere.While this isn't a \\"must-read,\\" Marsh fans will clearly enjoy this entry and I can recommend the book to anyone who enjoys a good, fluid, British cozy murder."},{"Title":"Tied Up in Tinsel","review":"Very entertaining mystery that takes place in a wealthy eccentric's enormous home. Troy Alleyn has been commissioned to paint Hilary (a man) Bill-Tasman's portrait during the Christmas holiday. While she knows that he's eccentric, she doesn't count on the fact that he likes to staff his house with ex-convicts (&quot;onecers&quot;)from the local prison. When their crimes start repeating themselves in the great house and a missing person turns up dead, Inspector Alleyn is unwillingly pulled into the picture, taking charge of the investigation. I would have ranked the book higher, except that the identity of the murderer became fairly clear a little too early."},{"Title":"Tied Up in Tinsel","review":"I really liked this particular Inspector Alleyn mystery. I've read quite a few of Marsh's books, and this one really sucked me in. I read it over the holidays on purpose, to put me in the mood. Didn't really work since it doesn't snow here, but it was nice to *read* about snow. At any rate, I loved the notion of the Man of the House having ex-convicts as his staff. I knew who had actually committed the murder in question, from the start (I had a hunch), and I was right, in the end. However, that in no way detracted from the pleasure of the story. I was glad, too, that the central figure was Troy, this time, rather than Roderick. Made a nice change. Her character is wonderful! Anyhoo, great story, all around. I just finished &quot;Artists in Crime&quot;, too, and would give that 5 stars, also. There's a few Alleyn mysteries I would *not* give 5 stars to, so don't think me a fawning fan. These two books were exceptional."},{"Title":"Tied Up in Tinsel","review":"First, let me be clear. I do like this mystery. In fact, I very much like all of Ngaio Marsh's body of work. However, this audio narrator chose to pronounce the leading character's name differently than the author intended, which unfortunately was distracting to me, and interfered more than a bit with my listening enjoyment.The case in point is that Chief Detective Inspector Roderick Alleyn's name ought to sound like Allen/Allan. Ngaio Marsh gently pointed it out in another of her novels featuring Alleyn (Vintage Murder, c1937) by including not one, but three, mentions at different points that individuals hearing Alleyn's name wrongly assumed that it was Allen. Even the passenger list for his Pacific crossing had his name misspelled. In the storyline, Alleyn hadn't corrected the shipboard listing from \\"Mr. R. Allen\\" to his actual name because he welcomed the anonymity it afforded him. Vintage Murder is set during a journey while Alleyn was traveling abroad for health reasons but had recently led several highly-publicized murder investigations back in England. Alleyn wants the peace of being casually taken for a \\"Mr. Allen\\" of no particular distinction or notability.In addition, the source and the reason for choosing Alleyn's name and its pronounciation are explained by Ngaio Marsh in Death In The Air.Enjoy Tied Up In Tinsel, this mystery at Halberds Manor. Enjoy the storyline and its glimpse into the long-gone elegance of the 1930's. Enjoy Alleyn and his artist wife Troy, and each of the quite remarkable characters assembled at Halberds Manor over the festive season."},{"Title":"Tied Up in Tinsel","review":"This was the first Inspector Alleyn mystery I ever read so it holds an extra special place in my heart. Marvelous characters and a great mystery make this one of Marsh's best. The character of Troy Alleyn, a respected portrait painter, starts off the tale never expecting to be plunged into intrigue. She more than manages to hold her own until her husband is called in to solve the case. Quirky players, a little twisted holiday spirit, and the standard Ngaio Marsh wit make this book stellar. A must read and a great first book for Marsh newcomers."},{"Title":"Tied Up in Tinsel","review":"I enjoy Ngaio Marsh books. I enjoy the discriptions of the English country and the historicial homes.English who dunits are great."},{"Title":"Tied Up in Tinsel","review":"Troy - Roderick Alleyn's artist wife - is painting a portrait of Hillary, the eccentric owner of a country house called Halberds. It is snowing and close to Christmas and there is to be a house party which will include a distribution of presents to the local children by one of the guests dressed up as a cross between Father Christmas and a Druid.As the guests start to arrive it is clear there are tensions which are not helped by the guests' knowledge that all the servants are murderers who have served their sentences. When one of the visitor's servants disappears Troy wishes her husband, a Scotland Yard detective could be there too.This is an excellent country house mystery with an ill-assorted collection of guests and residents. Troy feels totally out of place especially when unpleasant notes start to appear under people's doors and practical jokes are played on unsuspecting people. The air of menace is well done and the plot is excellent. I had worked out who was the murderer before the end but I could not really see how the murder had been carried out. When all is revealed everything falls into place and the clues are clear.A well plotted and well written story with an excellent collection of eccentric characters. Troy and Alleyn himself - not to speak of Inspector Fox - are good value as always. If you enjoy Agatha Christie, Georgette Heyer's crime novels and Patricia Wentworth's writing then you may enjoy Ngaio Marsh."},{"Title":"Tied Up in Tinsel","review":"The basic premise of a house staffed with one-time murderers (oncers) was certainly intriguing, and giving Troy, Alleyn's painter-wife, a larger part was refreshing IMHO, but the overall novel left me a bit unsatisfied for some reason. As in several Marsh books, there are numerous Britishisms, possibly some are also anachronisms--from the time of writing?), understandable but not (to a modern American) comprehensible. Still, one can generally ignore such things in order to enjoy the story itself. But the characterizations are too intricately woven into a good mystery novel to separate the two in one's general impression. This appears to me to be the case here because the characters seem more like caricatures. Were such people really like (and spoke like) this in Marsh's England? Maybe. I wasn't there then. But, it seems hard to believe. Furthermore, the ending left me wondering how Alleyn figured out all the details beforehand. I'm not speaking about who the murderer is, I'm referring to all the gory details. Don't get me wrong, it's Marsh's usual solid mystery, but not IMHO one of her best. I do like the very last paragraph very much though--it brought a smile to my lips.

When after a series of frightening pranks and a stint as the Christmas Druid, Alfred Moult goes missing, Troy's husband Roderick is called in to see if murder is at hand.While perhaps not exceptional (the situation is a bit overdone, and it's rather easy to guess the killer) _Tied up In Tinsel_ is a typically well-written Marsh mystery.

My self-directed preparation came from a 1950s lesson book, but an excellent home stay arrangement allowed me to update my antiquated vocabulary and jump from beginner to intermediate level classes after one term. Of course, language skills atrophy without practice, as I discovered on subsequent, short trips to Asia. Recently, I was motivated to resume serious study.Languages evolve, so I was a bit put off by the \\"February 1990\\" copyright date of Barron's \\"Mastering Japanese: Hear It, Speak It, Read It, Write It,\\" but at least, I thought, it would be an improvement over my 1970s texts. I was wrong. Barron's merely wrapped a new cover on a 1963 university text. As for reading and writing Japanese, the introduction (p. xv) clearly states, \\"This textbook is concerned only with spoken Japanese.\\" Everything is written - seemingly by typewriter - in one of the Roman alphabet schemes long since abandoned. The introduction also makes it clear that the text was designed specifically for classroom use, rather than \\"at your own pace, in your spare time\\" as claimed by Barron's.In short, this is a repack of old material. I commend the textbook's admonition that each lesson \\"requires many hours of class work supplemented by outside study and, if possible, laboratory work.\\" No one should pretend that it is easy to learn Japanese. A downfall of many, more modern courses, is the claim that learning can be quick and painless, a claim \\"proven\\" by teaching a large vocabulary of Japanese words adopted from English. Barron's \\"Mastering Japanese\\" does not do this. But if one is going to put forth hours of effort, one should invest in a course that teaches contemporary Japanese. This is not it."},{"Title":"Mastering Japanese with Book","review":"First, to set the record straight, Japan indeed has changed a lot since this course was issued.I believe the course was produced in the mid-60's...Language education has changed too...That said, different people learn in different ways, and if you're not a really good \\"traditional text book\\" type learner... and have trouble with structure and focus, this course is a godsend.The method, basically are drills... repetition, substitution, response, expansion... drills that get you learning basic sentence patterns then changing the sentences around based on various cues.Another interesting point of the course is that even though grammar is explained, it is not taught separately, but rather demonstrated then integrated into the speaking/listening exercises.The title of the course is misleading: The course teaches you HOW TO SPEAK IT and HOW TO WRITE IT... however, unless things have changes, the course on writing and reading are separate.(In fact, what made this course unique was the fact that it kept speaking and listening totally separate from reading and writing -- a common problem with old courses that confused learning to read and write with learning to speak a language.)So just how far will the course get you? Well, don't expect to be able to follow the movies or TV news... you will however be able to get around with an unfortunately caveat... Japanese has become way simpler since the course was recorded a book like JAPANESE FOR BUSY PEOPLE might cut to the chase much quicker... however, it does not offer this method - - which incidentally is similar to an English Text Book by Molinsky and Bliss called SIDE BY SIDE (a book that virtually every English teacher in Japan has taught from and come to hate or love over the years.)All in all - - if you're expecting gimmicks, topical relevance and ultra-modernity... forget it.And if you want something that's colorful and quirky, forget that too...If you want to get the basic structure of the language down and just aren't so good with standard texts... its a method that's a godsend and works... DO NOT however make the mistake I did:Learn hiragana and katakana from the get go...No, don't use it to learn to \\"speak\\", however, with hiragana and katakana you can learn more from the environment while living in Japan and take advantage of other learning opportunities.As a side note, I really believe the course deserves to be revisited, revised and recorded for our modern times... the method is solid and doesn't deserve to fall into obscurity."},{"Title":"Mastering Japanese with Book","review":"I picked this course up to brush up on my (15-year-old) spoken Japanese language skills. I spent a year in Osaka at Kansai Gaidai in '92, so although I had some familiarity with the language, I was definitely rusty and needed a refresher. I picked up the Barron's course because I'd had good experiences with Barron's Spanish course.This course suited my purposes perfectly - although it starts with the basics, it moves _fast_. The drills are very rapid (much faster than Barron's Spanish course), and I had to review all of them several times, in spite of the fact that I already had a good command of the grammar.One thing that I found interesting was the early introduction of honorifics (ultra-polite speech). When I was studying Japanese at the college level a decade and a half ago, honorifics were presented at the very end of any course series (if at all). Apparently, they were more common when this course was put together in the 60's... although I found the honorifics drills interesting (and new, to me), I'm not sure how useful they really are to somebody trying to learn Japanese in the 21st century, unless you plan to become the ambassador to Japan or something.My biggest complaint was the accompanying text. All of the dialog is presented in Romaji (Japanese written out in the Roman alphabet), using a strange, very outdated romanization technique. There's really no reason why the dialog and vocabulary couldn't have been presented in Hiragana (native Japanese phonetic writing) - given the bizarre spelling conventions in this book, there were places where a word I knew was presented and I didn't even realize it until I heard the word spoken.Still, although some of the vocabulary was definitely dated, you'll have a good starting point after working through this course."},{"Title":"Mastering Japanese with Book","review":"Japanese is a very difficult language to learn. This audio and book package does a very good job of covering the basics of a Level One type class.It provides a good foundation for those wishing to continue their study of Japanese.

Trust me because i have bought many books and i have gone to many language classes just to learn how to speak japanese. so what im basically saying so far is that ya mid as well spend ya money now because as soon as you start trying your never gonna stop looking for a useful source to learn japanese, because it really is a complicated language and it is so very different than english so you need to find a easy way to learn japanese. So like I said you might as well get it over with and spend about 60 dollars on a book but seriosly, it a lot better than just trying to look for a good japanese book when it doesnt seem to be very helpful."},{"Title":"Poetic Meter and Poetic Form","review":"Fussell's foreword says that his book is for aspiring readers, not aspiring writers. But if you are an aspiring poet, I think Fussell has something to offer that is absent in most \\"handbooks\\".One of the most important things Fussell addresses is how the form of a poem affects the meaning and impression of the total poem. For example, he notes how many poetic forms are inevitably coloured by their initial or most famous use. He says regarding Tennyson's In Memoriam stanza-form, that it \\"is now so closely associated with the sturdy, serviceable elegaic atmosphere of In Memoriam itself that...its uses now seem limited to occasions which either resemble or mock the original\\" (Ch 8 The English Stanzas).Another chapter that poets will find helpful is Metrical Variations, in which Fussell examines how poets substitute variant feet to create particular effects. Or if your interest is in free verse, he devotes a chapter to examining the characteristics of successful free verse, including how line breaks create effects.This is not a substitute for a general handbook of poetry, and assumes a minimal knowledge of poetic technique, meter, &c.; But if you are serious about reading or writing poetry, I don't think you can afford to miss this book."},{"Title":"Poetic Meter and Poetic Form","review":"When I was 21 and in my first year of graduate school, Paul Fussell's &quot;Poetic Meter and Poetic Form&quot; was one of the first text books assigned to me. When I bought the book and saw how slim it was, I snickered, &quot;Grad school's gonna be a walk in the park!&quot;Yeah, RIGHT!This densely packed tome is not for the uninitiated and definitely not absorbed in just one reading. On and off, over the last 20 years, I have come back to this book to refresh my memory and, usually, to astonish myself. The book's real strength, besides Professor Fussell's obvious command of his subject, and his ability to convey that command, is in the sprinkling of dozens of anecdotes by and about poets about other poets and poetry. Even at this late date in my life, I can't pretend to understand the entire book but what I do understand I admire and respect. &quot;Poetic Meter and Poetic Form&quot; is not recommended to anyone studying poetry; it is urgently required."},{"Title":"Poetic Meter and Poetic Form","review":"This book is a classic of prosodic exposition. (And understand, when I call a book a classic, I am not just lapsing into a cliche; it really IS a classic.) Fussell shows us the relations between form and content, between rhyme and rhythm on the one hand and the function of these formal devices to illuminate meaning on the other. The book also devotes a chapter to empirical observations on the properties of free verse, and it includes a concise bibliography of other works on prosody. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Poetic Meter and Poetic Form","review":"This is a lucid, engaging short book on the elements of poetry listed in the title: meter and form. Fussell does not provide the kind of encyclopedic information found in many poetry &quot;handbooks&quot;; what he does offer is a basic approach to scansion and analysis, and models for using these techniques in reading and writing about poems. This is a classic text, written with a great love of formal poetry, and referred to often by students and writers of poetry. The only thing that keeps my rating under 10 is that it is fairly out of date, and there are more recent texts that cover contemporary poets and verse forms with more rigor than Fussell. But for a readable treatment of the accentual-syllabic tradition and the first century or so of free verse, this book is a gem."},{"Title":"Poetic Meter and Poetic Form","review":"I came across this book for my Poetic Analysis class in college. It is an exellent book on meter and form. I can't even say how much this book has helped me with both reading and writing poetry. If you want to write better poetry or understand the poetry you read, then this is a good book to pick up."},{"Title":"Poetic Meter and Poetic Form","review":"Fussell's command of formal verse is extensive and even if you're more inclined to free verse I highly recommend his book because it provides essential tools for becoming a more critical poetry reader. Scansion and the additional vocabulary have been the most useful tools for me."},{"Title":"Poetic Meter and Poetic Form","review":"I used this book for my Literary Analysis class and it helps explain all different kinds of poetic forms. It goes into detail about Petrachan and Shakespearean sonnets and talks in length about meter. The only down side about Fussell is he tends to go on and on about some of the less important stuff but overall it's a very helpful book about poetry if you're willing to commit."},{"Title":"Poetic Meter and Poetic Form","review":"This book is wonderful. Fussell in opinionated and unafraid to display his own taste, but I find that a good thing (uncommon in academic writing in my experience). My favorite idea of Fussell's is that for a stanza break to be merited, something must happen in the white space _between_ the stanzas: there must be a shift of register or mood.I can't wait to read his most famous book, The Great War and Modern Memory, on the literary impact of World War I."},{"Title":"Poetic Meter and Poetic Form","review":"This is really a fantastic book for those of us who are interested in the art form and all that entails. Namely this book focuses on how meter and forms are used to create and compliment the feelings of the poems in question. The first chapter on scansion is a bit of a boot camp (and godsend?) for those who have not been satisfied by mere wikipedia research. I must say I had a really difficult time, as both a writer and a reader, in discerning and implementing exactly the art of metrical analysis. Most of the chapters are well structured and interesting, but tend to focus on non-contemporary poetry, or even recent poetry, or poetry after 1900.That being said, Paul Fussel is somewhat of a poetic prude, as exemplified in his exclusion of a discussion on free verse (a huge literary movement that erupted in the 20th century, as I'm sure you know)until this edition; even so, the chapter on free-verse is skimpy and pretty much useless. Unfortunately, I would say it's not worth the paper it's printed on. However, this book has a lot of great ideas on poetry, and if you take it with some skepticism, it should be a wonderful companion to any lover of poetry (but check your library first)."},{"Title":"Poetic Meter and Poetic Form","review":"The only thing that may stop you from buying this book is the price. It's a lot for a slim paperback, and there are other options available that will tell you about formal poetic forms and meter.But if you have read any of Fussell's cultural criticism (\\"Class,\\" for example), you know that he writes with verve and wit. And if you are familiar with his excellent treatment of WWI poetry, \\"The Great War and Modern Memory,\\" you know he knows his poetry. So here, you get his informed, scholarly overview with some sharply barbed opinions along the way.This is no picnic. It is graduate school stuff. It is practicing poet stuff. But if you are serious about poetic form--in trying to understand what you read or what you want to write--you owe it to yourself to have this text at your fingertips. He shows you how a poem works for him--syllable by syllable--so that you can better appreciate the choices a poet makes (especially if you are that poet).Fussell pulls many examples from the 18th century (Pope, for example). I commend him for it. But for those who believe that poetry began with the Romantics, you may not have much appetite for Pope's \\"Essay on Man,\\" for example. Your loss. Even so, anyone who reads or writes formal poetry will want to understand its practice across the centuries. And this book gives you that understanding in a few, packed pages."},{"Title":"Poetic Meter and Poetic Form","review":"A handful of books I've read have imparted lessons that stuck with me for life. This is one of them. As others have said, this is a book to be studied rather than read.But the writing is so elegant that you'll enjoy the study. After you've worked your way through this book, the way you read and write will be changed forever--for prose as well as poetry--because the best prose occasionally employs the poetic techniques that Fussell explains so well.You'll read a phrase that seems particularly apt, you'll wonder why it works so well, and then it will occur to you: Why, that phrase is iambic until the last two syllables, which includes a trochaic substitution. And the trochee at the end conveys exactly the twist that the writer wanted to convey.And when you're lucky, on a good day, you'll look at a sentence you just wrote, and you'll see the same forces at work."},{"Title":"Poetic Meter and Poetic Form","review":"Fussell's work is fantastic...the only problems are his high handed attitude towards free verse and a general snarkiness throughout the text. But overall, a good resource."},{"Title":"Poetic Meter and Poetic Form","review":"Expensive isn't it! But it's the most excellent book on writing poetry and poetic form I've read. Fussell has a masterful understanding of the material and handles it with great style and insight."},{"Title":"Poetic Meter and Poetic Form","review":"A good introduction to the mechanics, usefulness, and limitations of scansion and rhyme forms. His examples are well-chosen and illuminating.My main beef with Fussell is that I think he puts too much stress on the limitations of convention -- on how much past use of a form shackles future use. But then, I'm a young poet with a couple bones to pick, so apply salt as needed."},{"Title":"Poetic Meter and Poetic Form","review":"Fussell describes how forms of poetry define and focus the poem. He does this really well.If I knew a really effective superlative, I'd use it here. Nothing comes to mind. Shouldn't have drunk so much.This is the best book on poetry."},{"Title":"Figures of Dissent: Critical Essays on Fish, Spivak, Zizek and Others","review":"Terry Eagleton is perhaps the best-known academic literary critic writing in English today. Author of nearly 30 books on topics ranging from critical theory to Wittgenstein, Eagleton remains the political conscience of modern criticism and (with Fredric Jameson) the foremost Marxist theorist of our time. His deep literary and philosophical erudition and commitment to a more humane approach to looking critically at our culture have made him an important voice in academia since the mid-1960s.In &quot;Figures of Dissent,&quot; Eagleton turns his penetrating gaze to topics ranging from Lukacs to David Beckham, and his wit, learning, and elegant prose make this his most accessible and diverse collection of essays yet. Unlike such earlier essay collections as &quot;Against the Grain,&quot; this book contains many of Eagleton's mainstream writings. While it includes reviews of critical theorists like Gayatri Spivak, Paul de Man, and Stuart Hall, there are also examinations of popular history, fiction, and the culture of late capitalism. Those with little interest in the abstract world of literary theory (Eagleton's academic specialty and principal interest) will find essays on other topics to entice them.Overall, this is a fine collection from Eagleton, who remains an indispensable and passionate voice for Leftist thought in our tumultuous times."},{"Title":"Figures of Dissent: Critical Essays on Fish, Spivak, Zizek and Others","review":"Terry Eagleton is best known as an, albeit unorthodox, Marxist writer on literary theory, so one could well expect a collection of some of his best literary reviews to be chock-full of impenetrable jargon. But looks can be deceiving: this collection, titled \\"Figures of Dissent\\", is in fact quite entertaining, even for those who have no particular training or interest in high-minded lit-crit. The title is somewhat odd, as the subjects under review have nothing in particular in common (except their works being published in English at some point), least of all some sort of status as 'dissenter'. The authors involved are on the other hand all interesting and varied, and this makes the book in fact rather a page-turner.Most appealing about the reviews is Eagleton's unsurpassed mastery of both style and content. He pairs erudite literary insight with a sharp wit and a strongly developed sense of irony, which makes his reviews both informative as statements on literature and highly effective as polemics. Moreover, in contrast to many collections of such essays by famous theorists, the vast majority of the reviews involved can be considered to be overall 'positive', and Eagleton deftly avoids the grumpy predictability of the entrenched newspaper critic.Admittedly, one could complain that the collection is rather unduly focused on British literature, and there are many references to literature theorists as well as writers who are not likely to ring a bell with anyone outside the Isles, but this is easily forgiven as Eagleton is the best guide to the subject one might wish for. It does help to have a particular interest in Anglo-Irish literature, as this is Eagleton's specialty and a recurring theme in the book, and perhaps choosing this as the subject of the first two or three reviews in the book was not well-chosen. But the reader discovers soon enough that Eagleton has something intelligent to say about pretty much any subject from Dario Fo to Bill Gates, and his short-and-to-the-point criticisms of ideology hit home like so many arrows of Artemis (one will find the book very quotable). The high point of this collection as well as his artful irony is when Eagleton reviews David Beckham's autobiography, which is mercilessly dissected in a very comical dry style without ever becoming condescending to its subject.Much recommended to anyone who enjoys English language literature."},{"Title":"Figures of Dissent: Critical Essays on Fish, Spivak, Zizek and Others","review":"I spent some time this summer reading Eagleton, beginning with After Theory. This was a long time after his Literary Theory: An Introduction, which was a must-read back when I was in college. Yet, other than this one must-read, I really didn't read any of his books, which, I was surprised to find out, now total over 30 titles. Solely on the basis of Literary Theory, Eagleton didn't seem a particularly witty writer to me, so I was delighted and intrigued by his way of making light of heavy topics with humor. With this discovery on hand, if you go back to his early books, heavy-handed seriousness toward a subject was indeed rarely his way from the beginning. There are many passages in Literary Theory (or Against the Grain, and other early titles) where his deeply ironical stance toward the topics obviously of great importance to him, or at times surprisingly savage wit, makes you laugh.Quite a few reviews in this book have hilarious one-liners or otherwise laughter-provoking comments. One of my favorite is one written for Harold Bloom and his How to Read and Why. Bloom is a \\"figure of dissent\\" in his way, who, according to Eagleton, was \\"once an interesting critic\\" when he came up with a theory of literature as an oedipal drama, and then much later, after his \\"critical wheel has come full circle,\\" began distancing himself from the US academia by \\"preaching the unversal humanity in a New York accent.\\" Eagleton's concluding comment, that \\"if there is Bloom the self-therapist, there is also Bloom the American TV evangelist, full of windy moralistic rhetoric about how to 'aprehend and recognize the possibility of the good, help it to endure, give it space in your life',\\" is so very correct.Laughter aside, the book contains a lot to learn from. To me, this can be a field manual to book reviewers, and those who want to be good readers. In some reviews, for example the one done on Rolf Wiggershaus' The Frankfurt School, Eagleton seems to spend almost the whole of the space in discussing what *he* thinks and knows about the subject the reviewed book deals with, giving the book in question a space of just a paragraph or two toward the very end. In the end, such an approach is always a well-taken one, since it gives the book a more precise location in not only the cultural/intellectual climate where it appeared but also the personal context where it's read and appreciated."},{"Title":"Figures of Dissent: Critical Essays on Fish, Spivak, Zizek and Others","review":"Esencialmente, este libro es una colecci&oacute;n de ensayos cr&iacute;ticos y rese&ntilde;as publicadas en varias revistas y/o medios acad&eacute;micos.

Four stars is somewhat lenient, but...I still enjoyed it.After receiving a promotional e-mail, I bought the book to support a fellow writer (although he's a stranger to me), and was struck first by the numerous editorial flaws. This left me with a sour taste regarding ... Also, a good editor could've tightened the narrative and turned it into a riveting tale. Instead, I was distracted by overwrought adjective usage and occasional sidetracks.Now, let me tell you why I still give this four stars. \\"St. Jude's Secret\\" has heart and soul. This book, while not as seamless as a Grisham tale, has feeling. Jones shows true care and concern for his characters--something Grisham's \\"The Brethren\\" absolutely lacked. And, despite the sometimes ponderous description, Jones cooks up some true gems amid the coal. Some of his sentences and scenes positively gleam with magical appeal.I'd love to see Jones hook up with the right editor who could polish his abilities and create a book that sparkles throughout. This book does not do so, but it entertains and occasionally enthralls--and it never fails to have heart and soul. If you can look past all the typos, you'll be glad you took the chance on this. I certainly was."},{"Title":"St. Jude's Secret","review":"After reading my comments about another book (The Sharpshooter Blues by Lewis Nordan--highly recommended!), the author, Daniel H. Jones, kindly offered me a review copy of St. Jude's Secret if I would consider reviewing it here, and I am pleased to do so. It is a fine first effort, with believeable characters and a plot right out of today's headlines. The protagonist, lawyer Bobby Grace, is a refreshingly average everyman--neither the musclebound bulletproof superheroes of David Morrell's Rambo clones, nor a Sherlock Holmesian super-genius. In fact, Grace barely solves the mystery at all--clues are given to him (too much so, occasionally) without which he wouldn't figure things out, and he certainly can't fight his way out of a paper bag! Grace is somewhat reminiscent of James Garner's Jim Rockford, from the TV series The Rockford Files. Villain Carmine &quot;The Vat&quot; Cashio and his dysfunctional family are evilly quirky enough to step from a James Hall novel. The characters and the plot, a tale of coffee genetically modified to chemically resemble cocaine which is smuggled into New Orleans, make the book well worth a read. In fact, if Jones could put this book in the hands of the right producer I wouldn't be surprised to see a movie result.There are, however, a few flaws--to be expected in a first novel, to be sure. Smaller presses can't offer the editorial services that the big companies give to the likes of Steven King and David Morrell, and there are quite a few slips in this regard. The most unfortunate of these is proof that Jones uses a word-processor. The sentence &quot;Bobby stared at Jewel, noting her slight widow's peak, her thin nose and her green eyes that seemed to suck in what little light there was in the dark limo,&quot; on page 136 returns word-for-word less than 10 pages later, except that now it is a dark restaurant rather than a limo. Alas, those dark-sucking eyes weren't such a fascinating detail that they should be forced to work overtime. But these are minor slips, and if ignored they don't detract from the story--and I admit my copy is stamped &quot;DRAFT&quot; in rather large red capitals. My biggest puzzlement, though, and a real plot concern, was why the Mafia kept selling the GM coffee in its original state, when the whole point was to refine it as cocaine, and for which the profit would be thousands of times greater. This failure to maximize profits is a necessary plot device to jeopardize Bobby Grace's lover, but it seems most un-Mafia-like behaviour to me.Regardless, though, St. Jude's Secret is an enjoyable book, and I look forward to future works by Jones as he matures as a writer. I wouldn't be surprised, in fact, to see Bobby Grace return as a series hero--it would be a pleasure to have such a realistic character."},{"Title":"St. Jude's Secret","review":"This book doesn't fit into the thriller category- thankfully. I found it to be more in line with the southern tradition of Faulkner, Percy and more recently Norden and Woodrell. It's a weird and entertaining book, perhaps more character driven than plot driven. That's , of course, frowned upon in this genre, but the novel rises above and I think crosses over into literary fiction. I also found this novel to be like peeling back layers of an onion, (there's underlying themes of faith, spirituality,honor, along with treachery and horror see excerpt: &quot;Bobby stared at the old photo depicting The Vat's testimony ... He was a stocky,pugnacious fellow who seemed to be seething with rage behind his Fifth Amendment shield of silence. Across the table sat his interrogators,the Kennedy boys, seemingly invincible in their honorable crusade to preserve truth, justice and the American way.

Unlike the vast majority of New Orleans thrillers (New Orleans noir?), this novel is special beacuse it doesn't set out to see how many New Orleans landmark eateries it can cram into a run-of-the-mill,plot-driven, piece of pulp fiction. This book takes some quirky risks with its characters (a maritime attorney who has a copy of To Kill A Mockingbird always at hand, listens constantly to the Stones' Exile on Main Street while cruising in a Checker - cool!). Often the payoff is great. Everybody's a bit off-center in this one. Not just the villains.

This, however, caused a catostrophic event due to the fact that I was at the helm at the time. After being harshly punished,in a way that only another Greek seaman could imagine,I was allowed to resume my duty at the helm of the lifeboat. When we finally washed ashore on Delos, all the men celebrated with Retsina and much dancing. Opa!!"},{"Title":"St. Jude's Secret","review":"I enjoyed this novel very much! It was a quick read, one that might entertain a reader on a flight or by the pool this summer!)I thought Jones did an outstanding job in presenting the city of New Orleans (one can tell he's drawn upon a personal affinity for the city that care forgot- a lot of munching of local treats in this story!) and in developing his characters. The plot is something out of today's headlines, but I equally enjoyed the subtle handling of the main character's inner story that to measure up to his hero (who else for a southern lawyer but Atticus Finch) he needs to overcome a past emotional wound and make a life with the former Bourbon Street showgirl- his main-squeeze, the gardenia-scented Magda Mar. What a name ! I loved her! More than a reformed stripper with a heart of gold, she's a real street-wise copper-skinned looker, whose strength is her faith. She's the perfect match for the disillusioned and somewhat shiftless attorney Bobby. Moreover, there's a lot of local color in this novel beyond the descriptions of setting and climate. Notably the old bad guy seeems to have a few of the well-known characteristics of the city's most infamous &quot;tomato salesman&quot;. If Jones' first effort could be faulted , it might be for weaving in a little too much of that sort of thing (trying to bring in too much into a fairly tightly-woven plot )and he may wish to be a little more economical with description. However, the book overall is fun and on a deeper level reminded me of Sanctuary by Faulkner and Walker Percy's The Thanatos Syndrome. Jones could be one to watch!"},{"Title":"St. Jude's Secret","review":"Before I review, let me synopsize the book for you. Immobilized emotionally by the death of his grandfather, Attorney Bobby Grace is living a peaceful life in New Orleans' French Quarter with his former-stripper girlfriend, Magda, who once danced for Sammy 'Mad Dog' Cashio, who is importing bioengineered coffee (from a Costa Rican farm once owned by Magda), which may have killed Cilton, who is the cousin of Yvette who is Bobby's ex-girlfriend. The coffee was engineered by Jewel Cashio who is the daughter of 'The Vat' Cashio, who may have killed Bobby's father by tossing him into a vat of lye (hence the gangster's nickname). It doesn't take long to realize we are strolling down Coincidence Road here and in so doing, we are asked to suspend our disbelief so high we fear it may suffocate in the thinning air.This alone is not enough to make 'St. Jude's Secret' the worst New Orleans novel ever; there are other, more pressing, factors. For example, Jones's credit card must have been offering double points for shopping at the Clich&eacute; Store because the author uses them liberally and without shame. Bobby Grace is an earnest young fellow who idolizes attorney Atticus Finch from 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. He is haunted his father's disappearance and is exhorted by his grandfather to exact revenge on the man who killed Grace's father. Magda is the stripper with a heart of gold. 'The Vat' is the old gangster who has charm and manners and wants to legitimize his operation. 'Mad Dog' is the loose cannon who will push anyone's buttons, even if it is not in his own best interest. The victim, Cilton, is the saintly, hard-working poor man with two mouths to feed at home. Cilton's wife is a relatively new saw, the voodoo woman with 'second sight', who gives Grace cryptic advice. Yvette is the dialect-speaking country girl made good. Ishmael Lopez is the quirky investigator sidekick.Perhaps the only character that is not a reliable old chestnut is Jewel Cashio, who, for some reason, thinks she can legitimize her father's crime syndicate by engineering caffeine-free coffee trees. No sir, I've never seen that anywhere else.I don't claim to know much about the Italian mob in New Orleans, but I have read enough Louisiana literature to know that James Lee Burke cornered the market on New Orleans gangsters years ago. It seems to me that a new writer would do well not to crib characters directly from a bestselling author; if you're going to steal ideas, stick to midlist authors.Throughout the book, characters behave in ways that make absolutely no sense, not the least of which being Mad Dog himself, who's plan to introduce cocaine-infused coffee is killing the people who drink it. Surely even a crazy mobster realizes that it's poor business to kill off one's customers, not to mention the difficulty in receiving FDA approval?Author Jones also seems to lack a basic sense of grammar, often using 'he and Magda' when he means 'him and Magda'. Punctuation appears to have been accomplished by loading commas into a shotgun shell and blasting the manuscript.It's unfair of me to rant and impugn an author without giving him the chance to rebut, so I plan to do just that. I've selected a few passages that, in my estimation, underscore the badness of 'St. Jude's Secret'.In an early chapter, the stunning Yvette meets Bobby in a dim bar and orders a couple of chilidogs. After wolfing them down, she exclaims, '...Umhmm these good dogs. Mais yeah we know how to eat down here, don't we cher?' Okay, first, they're in New Orleans, the land of amazing food, and she's raving about chilidogs? Second, a native saying something like that is akin to someone in Wisconsin suddenly blurting, 'Man, we sure make good cheese up here, eh?'When Bobby demands a payoff for his client, the opposing attorney retorts, 'Mr. Grace! We've made a reasonable offer, however, you seem intent on obtaining a fortune that would rival old Spoons Butler's haul during the Union's despicable occupation of our fair city.' Clearly, Daniel H. Jones studied his New Orleans history while researching this book. Equally as clearly, he has no idea how to work that knowledge into the book aptly.'As Jewel examined the pulpy, yellowing stalks, she stepped over several dark shapes dressed in blood stained gray cotton. These were the twisted, charcoal bodies of Sheriff 'Doughboy' Valentine's field hands strewn across the dark, earthen furrows like breast-shot doves fallen from flight between the mangled coffee trees.''St. Jude's Secret' is an embarrassment that taints the honor of published authors everywhere. But it was also a quick read and provided hours of sidesplitting laughter. If you are the type of reader who doesn't require accuracy, believability, originality or quality writing, 'St. Jude's Secret' might be the book for you."},{"Title":"X-Men: The New Age of Apocalypse","review":"To celebrate the ten year anniversary of the landmark X-Men storyline the Age of Apocalypse, Marvel comissioned hack writer Akira Yoshida (X-Men/Fantastic Four, Elektra) to script a six issue mini-series that returns to the dark, dystopian, alternate reality we all know and love. The mini-series itself begins where X-Men: Omega ended years back: Apocalypse is dead, and somehow Magneto and his surviving X-Men are still alive. However, not all is well, as we soon find out thanks to Yoshida's schizophrenic storytelling. Is it me, or does anyone else remember Sinister dying in the last issue of X-Man? Not to mention, in X-Men: Omega, remember when Jean Grey is killed, and as Weapon X cradles her, the caption states that \\"she is no Phoenix\\"? I thought so, but Yoshida tosses all that aside as Sinister is alive and well, and the Phoenix is here too. Nitpicks aside, this could be all well and good if the story were anything decent, but it isn't, and the characterizations of Magneto, Rogue, Gambit, Nightcrawler, Weapon X, Sabretooth, etc. are so far from what we came to know in the original AoA storyline that they seem like completely different characters all together. Other characters that weren't in the original AoA cross-over, including the Silver Samurai, Xorn, and even the currently hot X-23, are here as well, but for no good reason. Chris Bachalo provides the pencils for the mini, and they're about what you'd expect from the guy from seeing his most recent work: incoherent and sloppy. Also featured in this TPB is an AoA one-shot featuring work from original AoA writers Larry Hama, Scott Lobdell, and co., and that may be worth a look for old AoA fans, but all in all, this unnecessary TPB is better left on the shelf for the rest of us, and should be rightfully avoided."},{"Title":"X-Men: The New Age of Apocalypse","review":"I bought this volume with great interest. My understanding was that that AoA universe had expired due to nuclear holocaust (not Holocaust) some years back. Imagine my surprise and anticipation when Marvel found a way to keep this fascinating timeline alive. The orignal Age of Apocalypse was such an innovation, with good characters gone bad, bad gone good, and a goodly number of new ones mixed in. I didn't know what to expect from New AoA.My initial reaction was positive. I was always curious as to the origin of Wild Child, and my memories of AoA didn't explain his appearance. This book does. However, it really makes me feel like a comic nerd (not that there's anything wrong with that) to notice a discrepancy here. Sabretooth and the Apocalypse troop parted company during a battle with the X-Men, and they left him behind. It doesn't fit that he would have been tossed into a cell with Wild Child after his moral turnaround. Why, oh why, do the writers do things like this? It doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things, but it's one of those irritations common in comic books. The writers don't write to preserve existing storylines. Another huge revelation there!A major premise of the main story involves a huge secret that involves Magneto, the government, and The Real Person who saved America from nuclear holocaust. The generally-held perspective is that Magneto is responsible, but gasp! it is someone else, and for some reason he's not telling. It's all based on a visit by Sinister and it causes all kinds of internal turmoil. The plot unravels further and further until it comes to an awkward and hastily-wrapped-up-ending that left a bad taste in my mouth. Characters who were noble and strong in the original AoA storyline are suddenly weakened into liars that capitulate to blackmail. It is unlike the original AoA. In fact, it is a cheap knock-off loosely based on Marvel's most innovative X-Men storyline in recent years.Now, the artwork - the characters and artwork have changed, and changed again, since the very beginning of The Uncanny X-Men. Some of those changes were improvements, while some of them were stylistic disasters. I would count the artwork in this book to be one of the latter. Many important action sequences are packed into little tiny display boxes, followed by a great big box with a great big reaction to whatever just happened. I spent much time squinting at the artwork trying to figure out what just happened. The pages are arranged right next to the spine of the book, so many dialogue bubbles are obscured. The characters are sometimes glossy, as though they were made of shiny plastic. To top it all off, the artwork is so strongly anime-manga influenced that, were it not for distinguishing characteristics such as Rogue's white streak, they would be unrecognizable. They look childish, puffy-faced, and sloppily-drawn.Had Marvel continued with artwork, storyline, and characters exactly like those in the original series, New Age of Apocalypse would have been much more appealing. Instead, this hastily cobbled-together volume touches on themes from the original, but it pays them no compliments."},{"Title":"X-Men: The New Age of Apocalypse","review":"Ten years have passed since the original AoA storyline but only a year within this current collection. The characters are thin copies of what made the original series exciting. Explanations of how events and such got to this age are minimal and laughable. Not recommended for fans of the original AoA and not worth it for a quick read to see what has been happening in the X-Universe if you stepped away for a while."},{"Title":"X-Men: The New Age of Apocalypse","review":"Marvel came with the age of apocalypse, which was one of the best from the house of ideas but then they release this book that does not even worths the paper that they used.In the original history you can see one of the best endings in the comic book industry, but they destroy all of that in this one.Being one of the best x-men fan ever I can tell you, save your money go ahead and get something else...."},{"Title":"X-Men: The New Age of Apocalypse","review":"Ten years ago, all X-Men titles stopped for 4 months, replaced by a horrifying world called the Age of Apocalypse. In this world Professor Xavier had been killed, leaving Magneto to create the X-Men and guard the world from the horror Apocalypse created, a world were humans were being exterminated and only the strong could survive. In a final battle, this world was supposed to end, to be restored to the X-Continuity we know (and love)....But ten years after that crossover event, comes this graphic novel. We learn that world did not end, but continued. Apocalypse has been defeated, but enough of his evil remains in the world that the X-Men are still at the center of rebuilding. Not only must they rebuild the world, but their own team, who has suffered and must be drawn back together. It's the usual X-Men twists and turns, just with different takes on the characters that we know and love. This volume features Wolverine and X-23 prominently, as well as the Phoenix in all her fiery glory. Magneto, Charles, Rogue, Gambit, Nightcrawler, Storm, and Quicksliver are also featured characters.This volume also lets us see characters that are now fan favorites, but weren't around or included in the original Age of Apocalypse, including Xorn, Beak, Cloak and Dagger, Psylocke, and the Hellions.Also in this graphic are four small mini stories first published as a one shot, that gives background on the characters and makes the rest of the graphic easy to understand.This volume can be enjoyed by someone who knows nothing of Age of Apocalypse continuity, but it is easier to understand if you have read the other AOA stories before. This trade collects the Age of Apocalypse miniseries from 2005 and the AOA one shot that proceeded it.Over all this is very enjoyable. Just be aware if you aren't already that these characters are different in personality from their mainstream X-Men counterparts.Recommended."},{"Title":"X-Men: The New Age of Apocalypse","review":"Title: The New Age of ApocalypsePublisher: MarvelWriter: Scott Lobdell, Tony Bedard, Larry Hama, Akira YoshidaArtists: Alvin Lee, Paco Medina, Talent Caldwell, Mark BrooksCollects: Age of Apocalypse One-Shot, New Age of Apocalypse #1-6Price: $20.99OK, for those few of you who have never heard of the Age of Apocalypse (a Marvel Comics crossover event that took place 11 years ago in the X-titles), the series was about a dark, alternate future timeline where Professor Xavier had been murdered and Magneto formed the X-Men. Apocalypse and his legions of mutants have taken over North America and plan to eradicate homo sapiens from the planet, given enough time and opportunities to do so. By far, the best thing about the series was the chance to see the creator's revised versions of popular X-Men heroes and villains. Some villains were now on the side of the angels and some heroes were now devil's advocates. No matter which side the characters were fighting on, they all looked really cool, as did the new characters that were introduced in the series. The storyline was a bit weak, and the battles were pretty predictable, but the new character designs made the story all worth while.On a play to monopolize on the fantastic success of the original series, Marvel launched this new series on the 10th anniversary of the original series to milk a few more dollars out of current X-fans and fans of the original series. I'm sad to report that the story in this new series is incredibly weak, the artwork didn't thrill me at all, and the characters just don't have the same appeal they had 10 years ago. I know that part of this is simply the fact that I've matured and demand better storytelling in my comic fare than I did 10 years ago. I also know what I like, artistically, and this just isn't it. The artwork in this story was very stylized. Most of it reminded me strongly of Ultimate War from Ultimate X-Men. I didn't care for it then and it's no better here. Fans of Manga would probably take to it more, but Manga is not a love of mine. Giant robots? Sure, I like those, who doesn't? But doe-eyed girls with simple triangle noses wearing sailor suits and guys with thick points of spiky hair and extra large feet just don't pull my trigger. While the overall character designs and re-vamps remain the highlight of the series (for me, at least), the artwork was not nearly as good as it was the first time around. X-23 shows up this time, too, and I don't care for that character one bit. NO CLONE CHARACTERS PLEASE! Leave that garbage to DC.I'm not sure what the breakdown was here for the four writers and what part each had in the making of this storyline, but one would think that the four of them would have been able to come up with something more exciting than this. The story did very little to grab my interest, and there were really no surprises to be had in the entire series. Most \\"surprises\\" were foreshadowed and telecast so clearly beforehand that anyone could pretty much see what was going to happen in the end. Also, these futuristic X-Men have no qualms about killing their enemies. This is so far removed from what the X-men in current continuity believe that the whole thing seemed implausible. Would the general public really embrace \\"heroes\\" that readily put their adversaries six feet under? I don't know. Maybe at first, I guess, but not for long. I just didn't buy it. If you're trying to build a better tomorrow and a new age of peace between mutants and men, why stoop to killing all who oppose you? Like I said, I just didn't buy it.The cover price of this book is high enough that I would really caution anyone against buying it until you really know what you're getting. No matter how much you liked the original series, I think you'll be let down by this addendum to the story. This is a shame, because the original was pretty good, even if it doesn't hold up well over time. They could have done something really special with this part of the X-Men franchise, but I came away thoroughly disappointed by this project. Buyers beware!Writing: 4/10Artwork: 6/10Cool Factor: 8/10Overall: 6/10"},{"Title":"X-Men: The New Age of Apocalypse","review":"...But it was a somewhat confusing read. This book brings you seven comics from 2005, all bound up in one edition.The 'Age of Apocalypse One Shot', which brings you four [short] never-seen storylines from AoA, shedding some light on some areas. Sabretooth's first encounter with Wild Child, the 'origin' of Generation Next, Weapon-X and a young Mariko Yshida, and a brief depiction of how AoA survived the nuclear bombardment that it was left with, ten years ago. These stories, though agonizingly short, had decent writing and images. The creative team (writers, pencils, inks, colors, etc) was different for each installment, which seems to help with the story-seperation, and add a unique flavor to the individual tales. All in all, not a bad one-shot. It delivers, if only in small quantities.Next we have the X-Men: The New Age of Apocalypse #1-6 mini-series, from earlier this year. The writing and pencils were done by the same duo throughout, with about eight inkers and good ol' Studio F on colors. Akira Yoshida, who has also written a number of other recent marvel titles (which I have yet to read) does a fairly good job with this story. It's a difficult task to undertake, in my opinion... These brief mini-series deals always are. How to come up with a -good- story that will be worth the extra dollar or so per issue, and also pay hommage to the original AoA Epic, with such a short run? In general, I think that the ideas he worked with were good, though at times I felt that they were perhaps incomplete, or under-developed. But, that's pretty much a given with these short works, anyway. There's usually not enough time to truly develop the characters, new and old, with the 'new' setting. And yes, folks, make no mistake: This is a new setting. While it does pick up where the first AoA left off, the world is a very different place without old Porklips running things.So, while I -did- enjoy the series, there were times that I was awfully confused. New characters were introduced without much explanation or backstory at all, and presented in such a way that it was difficult to follow exactly what was going on. Sure, most of them were variations of characters from the 'Mainstream' timeline, but the similarities were sometimes few and far between. (Growing up under the hell of a five thousand year old god-like dictator will have that effect on a character.) I was a little baffled by some of the characters, such as 'Xorn' (until her true story was revealed, which irritated me to no end) and a few others. But, really, the writing was pretty good, and the parts that were a little mushy didn't really detract all that much from the overall story.Unless, of course, you factor in the very confusing art. I'm not a huge fan of Chris Bachalo's pencils in this, at all. Honestly, his name did not ring any bells, and I had to do some looking to find out that he's actually been around for a while, having co-created 'Generation-X' with Scott Lodbell, worked with Neil Gaimen on 'Death: The High Cost of Living', his own 'Steampunk' series, and some others. Having read GenX for a long time, and having enjoyed the Death piece, I was really surprised to find how much I disliked is pencils. I don't remember disliking his work in the past, at all. In fact, I think I probably liked it. But reading this AoA mini-series, I found myself peering at panel after panel, trying to figure out just what was going on. Who had done what to who? It's not always easy to tell, especially in the under-sized action scenes. Perhaps the overall confusion of this series is more related to the art then the writing, though I don't really feel comfortable 'blaming' one aspect when I cannot put my finger on anything definitely. I will say this: There are some scenes and images that Bachalo pulled off masterfully here. Aside from the action-confusion, there's really only a small handful of pencil shots that really irritate me, though it may simply be that his unique style does not work for me.So, in conclusion... the writing is decent, if a little underdeveloped. The art is good, if more than a little confusing to follow at times. The overall piece is definitely worth reading, as long as you have already read the first AoA storyline. Without that, you're probably going to be pretty damn lost here, folks. Luckily, Marvel is printing the original AoA stuff in trade paperback form, as well! The first book of the 'Complete Epic' is out now, and is also worth picking up. But when does the next one come out, I wonder?"},{"Title":"X-Men: The New Age of Apocalypse","review":"Back in the 90's Marvel released a series called Age of Apocalypse where the heroes of the marvel universe, X-Men in particular, were recreated in a world where Xavier had been killed and Apocalypse had taken control of much of the world. It has since become known as one of Marvel's most successful spin-off series and was both critically acclaimed and fan appreciated.Now, ten years later, Marvel released this collection of all six New Age of Apocalypse comics and the Age of Apocalypse One shot. The one shot itself does little more than fill in a few gaps from the original story and without the original Age of Apocalypse is of little worth. The six piece mini series however is a continuation/stand alone series that's an interesting new take on the original X-Men, as well as those from the AoA universe. Chris Banchalo's art is what really makes this story worth the money. He offers a new design of all of the previous characters and his art style is fresh and dark, very appropriate for the AoA universe. The story however is where the graphic novel falls apart. Not that it is horrible, but author Akira Yoshida has a few unexplained gaps like how Psylock suddenly became Japanese or how Wolfsbane freed herself of her transitional form. Yoshida leave plenty of spots for action where the artwork really access and in doing so makes up for his misshapes. In the end the story is readable and the artwork is admirable, this book should defiantly be picked up if you're a fan of the original series, or Weapon X (Wolverine) as a lot of the story focuses on him."},{"Title":"X-Men: The New Age of Apocalypse","review":"Ultimate X-Men will just never be for me, I am afraid.

I do not recommend this book for the first-time dieter, but I'm sure it would be fine for a more serious dieter. You REALLY need to be a strict dieter who can live on total fruits and veggies for 9 days if you want to use this book. Good luck."},{"Title":"The Take-Control Diet: A Life Plan for Thinking People","review":"Thank you, Dr. Smith. You have taken all the mystery out of maintaining a good and appropriate weight. Your medical and scientfic expertise is expressed in a readable and understandable fashion. Goodbye to fad diets and hello to a lifetime eating and exercise plan!"},{"Title":"The Take-Control Diet: A Life Plan for Thinking People","review":"I bought this book on the street date and began Dr. Smith's plan a week later. It works! It's reasonable and sensible. I talked to my doctor about it, and he gave it an enthusiastic thumbs-up. I've been on the plan for four and a half weeks, and I've lost 14 pounds.Dr. Smith's plan has changed my life. I finally have control. I will update this review every once in a while with my new total. I know I can stick with this plan, because I've done it for a month, and I don't feel hungry or deprived. It works!!"},{"Title":"The Take-Control Diet: A Life Plan for Thinking People","review":"Finally, someone has written a book that makes sense and doesn't ask people to starve themselves or not to eat carbs or other things. The diet is practical and it makes sense for everyone. I find the reading very easy"},{"Title":"The Take-Control Diet: A Life Plan for Thinking People","review":"First, reading some of the other reviews, some people are reviewing the wrong book. Any review referring to \\"phases\\" should be completely discounted because it is a review of Dr. Smith's Fat Smash book.Second, Dr. Smith isn't just some guy on tv, he's a Harvard and Columbia grad. Not too shabby.But to the book...this was the first \\"diet\\" book I read that really made sense for me. This isn't a crash diet, you'll lose a moderate amount of weight by making simple changes. He really spoke to, as the title says, taking control of your life. You can't lose weight just by hoping or wanting it bad enough. You have to work at it.The book has lengthy, but useful, exercises to find out things like your current level of consumption and activity. It is basic, yet teaches a lot of things that really need to be known to have a healthy weight loss plan. I've been on a lot of plans, read a lot of books, but never had it broken down for me in such a way that a) it made a lot of sense, b) didn't talk to me like I was a simpleton, and c) made it seem doable and not extreme.Exactly what I needed."},{"Title":"The Take-Control Diet: A Life Plan for Thinking People","review":"If you've tried every diet under the sun and don't know where else to turn for getting on track with your weight, I recommend Dr. Ian Smith's book. He takes a scientific and a practical approach to weight management.In this book, you are given easy to use formulas to determine the exact caloric intake your body needs according to your frame, plus ideas on how to control your calorie intake throughout any given week to achieve weight loss.Dr. Smith provides practical applications to a lifestyle, rather than a diet, that prevents dieters from having to refrain from favorite foods. For example, if you know you are going to a party where you will be eating cake and ice cream, he suggests that you subtract those calories from another day's caloric intake to make up the difference and still allow net weight loss for the week.We've all been in and out of \\"The Zone\\", we've given up our carbs for Dr. Atkins, and we've gone to \\"South Beach\\" with temporary success, but if you want to truly stay on track with your weight management skills, I highly suggest you give Dr. Smith's book an opportunity to help you gain your weight loss sense back again."},{"Title":"The Take-Control Diet: A Life Plan for Thinking People","review":"What I liked about the book is that it tells the truth about exercise and the need to eat good food. This isn't information that you can't find in many other places, but given this is a bestseller I'm happy to see this position take front and center.I don't doubt that this system of weight loss will work, but you would need to be very disciplined and have a lot of free time to follow it completely. This may not be practical for most people.I didn't find anything extraordinary about this diet book. What it does is to provide a structure for you to change your life gradually to a healthier lifestyle. I agree with one of the other reviewers that Andrew Weil's \\"Eight Weeks to Optimum Health\\" is at least as good or perhaps better. It is certainly more realistic.I think the correct audience for this book is people that are very serious about losing weight and changing their living habits forever. Without a deep commitment to living differently, you aren't likely to stay with this program for long.I agree with Dr. Smith that exercise is one of the most important factors to lose weight, regulate appetite and manage stress which often leads to overeating. I also agree that making gradual changes over time is the best way to make major life changes.Where I feel the book failed is in providing more content, depth and added value. In my opinion, almost everything that was said in this book has been said in many others that are just as good or even better. This book is not a waste of money, but it is not a practical long term solution for most people.I've also read the Fat Smash Diet Book and have similar sentiments about it. Neither of Dr. Smith's books is anything new and revolutionary. If you eat right and train hard, you'll lose weight. That's the bottom line.I have also done a detailed review of Dr. Smith's latest book the FAT SMASH DIET. If you scroll down to reviews for August 21, you can see my comments about this book as well. This may help you decide which one is right for you or if either of them are right for you."},{"Title":"The Take-Control Diet: A Life Plan for Thinking People","review":"After trying diets all of my life and failing all of them, I am now a believer!

Some background is given on how these inequalities are rooted in half a millenium of colonialism and (now) neocolonialism. For readers new to Wallerstein's thinking, this book will require quite a bit of study but many pages are just overflowing with profound insights. The result will be an understanding that will provide intelligent and studious readers with a framework that can be used to interpret modern history and current international events, as well as inequalities and issues within most countries around the world.Highly recommended reading for advanced undergraduates, grad students, and professionals. Only 110 pages, but can easily fill an entire weekend for the studious reader.An outstanding work that should be read before Wallerstein's more detailed analyses, such as \\"The Modern World-System\\" series."},{"Title":"Historical Capitalism","review":"Wallerstein indeed present here a number of interesting ideas, but they are very un-conventional, and he doen't try to prove them in any way (the book deliberately lack of any endnotes or biography), nor he make the effort to bring the reader's attention to possible criticisms. I guess his task was making a short, accessible and coherent introduction for his ideas, and the book have some succees as a trigger, but he could do better. Maybe he should have take one or two of his thesis (as semi-proletarian households pushing themselves proleraziation; or the origin of agraraian capitalism in the 15's century aristocracy making itself into bourgeoisie) and polemicize about them."},{"Title":"Bull In The Ring","review":"Dr. McCarthy is a great storyteller. \\"Bull in the Ring\\" is his autobiographical tale of a Navy doctor who is recruited to coach the hospital football team, a perennial doormat in a league of Marines.

While this book did have a very interesting part about how to resurrect the ghosts of your dead family, it had nothing about how to get rid of them again. They're still living in my basement.

While reading it, I had to keep reminding myself that this is not a piece of fiction. This is the real story of Richard Brautigan, and in some ways not so different from the fictional character we came to love in his novels. On top of that, this is a fascinating tale of a father and daughter living through extraordinary circumstances together, and her triumph over the tragedy of his death."},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"This memoir was written with sensitivity and emotion but never seemed maudlin. I was sorry when the book ended. I wanted more."},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"Ianthe's book knocked me out. Her writing is powerful, her images vivid. She has captured moments from her life with her father that are memorable and revealing. I don't understand how another reviewer at this site said that the pictures aren't relevant. They truly added to the experience for me. And after all, they're family snapshots, not studio portraits. The same reviewer said that the book was awfully depressing and graphic... if you're writing about suicide, it's hard not to be. However, Ianthe is able to remember many magical moments with her dad, and these help to create a memoir that is just as joyous as it is sad."},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"Your favorite artistic hero from college days no longer rings a bell for many if not most. Richard Brautigan was one of the most innovative, creative, and \\"counter-culture\\" (as we used to say) poets of his day. His poetry was utterly refreshing and blew (literally) all the stuffy poetry elevated to a plane beyond God out of the room. As to this truly grand memoir by his daughter, Ianthe Brautigan, as much as a fan as I was - I did not know that her father's poetry revolutionized the genre and sold millions world-wide. Most profound of all, is Ms. Brautigan's literary gifts so evident in this book. For the price of a cup of good coffee, it is surely worth your time."},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"Will find her insight very interesting.

I gave him this book to help him understand why."},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"The title of this review says it all. I can only add: if you have children, or indeed anyone that cares about you, please read this book before committing suicide."},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"This is the strongest memoir that I have read by a family member. Ms. Brautigan has a beautiful, strong writing style all her own, and she doesn't fall into the trap of whining or gossiping the way so many memoirs do.The observations that she has about her father are very personal and create a nice sense of intimacy, and her fears about herself and her daughter after her father's death are very nicely handled. She doesn't try to blame her father for his shortcomings and her suffering, but instead tries to understand the mystery of his life and the reasons that he may have acted as he did.Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"Having never heard of the memoirist's famous father, Richard Brautigan, author of, among others, Trout Fishing in America, I'm likely in the minority of those who've read this book by Ianthe Brautigan, his only child. In spite of that, I'm glad I read it. Those of us who've lost a parent tend to spend a lot of time thinking about the lives of our lost loved ones and dwelling on the circumstances of their deaths. I wouldn't even want to try to imagine what it must be like to have had a parent choose to check out. In Ianthe's case, she'd been forewarned repeatedly. Her alcoholic father would often go on and on about wanting to die. How would you get past the wonder that (maybe?) they didn't love you enough to want to remain on earth. It seems, though, that Ianthe has thought through it thoroughly and, thankfully, turned out pretty darn good in spite of it. Not only is there the usual stuff, memories of the time they spent together when she was growing up, which was sometimes spotty due to his mental state and the fact that her parents divorced when she was very young, but she also spends a lot of time recounting dreams she has about him after his death. From the view of an outsider (to the world of Richard Brautigan) book aficionado always happy to hear about a new author, especially someone as unique as he was, I'm thankful to have found him through her (although I read but didn't \\"get\\" Trout Fishing in America). However, I probably wouldn't recommend it to the average memoir fan unfamiliar with the father. You Can't Catch Death is exactly what the subtitle claims, \\"A Daughter's Memoir.\\"Important companion read: Trout Fishing in America by Richard Brautigan. Also good: The Mercy Papers by Robin Romm, The Summer of Ordinary Ways by Nicole Lea Helget, and The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls."},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"I loved reading this book about my favorite author, his devoted daughter, and the life they shared while Richard was alive.

I'm sure her father would be proud.

I enjoyed her comments and insight into the fishing stories, the observations of the scenery, the wilderness and feeling the life of her father's past. Her trip to Eugene, OR is a spiritually challenging and moving portion of the book.

What's interesting, however, are the descriptions of her father's writing room, particularly in San Francisco in the 1960s-70s on Geary Street and the surrounding vicinity. There are wonderful descriptions of the writing room with its typewriter and art hanging on the walls, such as the pencil drawing of a bus with real Lincoln penny heads as passengers and a picture of an ancient Colt pistol. And who can forget the small Buddhist shrine, the oak table with the stained rings of coffee cups, and the the back porch with those stacked piles of the San Francisco Chronicle. Like any good writer, Brautigan couldn't throw away a day's newspaper without going through it completely. This memoir also has some nice depictions of cabin life in Montana, and there as some interesting old black-white photos of Brautigan. Check out page 71 with it's picture of the ranch house kitchen and the bullet holes on the wall in the shape of a clock.--Alex Sydorenko, Chicago, 2001."},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"Ianthe is the daughter of Richard Brautigan, although this book is more her personal story of overcoming her father's suicide than a biography of him. I would have preferred the latter. Still, you get a good, if incomplete portrait of Richard Brautigan through the eyes of the person closest to him. You get to know his multi-faceted personality, including his tragic drinking habit, but never understand his life or what drove him to suicide (nobody, including his daughter, knows). Some great stories about the last of the beats. I think my favorite was when he sat with a friend in his Montana cabin and shot out the hours on the clock, each hour on the hour, with his handgun."},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"Although I began reading You Can't Catch Death with the expectation that it would be about her father, Ianthe Brautigan quickly set me straight; this book is about her. Reading the book provides a fascinating look at her turbulent childhood with a talented, but troubled father. A father who clearly loved his daughter but, just as clearly, didn't quite know what to do with her.Brautigan the younger is a skilled wordsmith whose first book displays a polish and readability usually associated with more \`seasoned' authors. Whether or not you appreciate Richard Brautigan, after reading this book you will appreciate his daughter."},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"I love this book. It is as painful to read as going to the funeral of a friend or a writer whose work you loved. It is as rewarding as the grieving process. We've been wondering about Brautigan's daughter, the girl with the stange name, Ianthe, and this book of hers lets us know all about her. This memoir she has taken so long to write suggests she has struggled to find her own voice, as a writer, and I am happy to report that her father's style has influenced her enormously. That's a very good thing. I will look forward to the publication of the next Brautigan and I will be as sad it is not by Richard as I am happy it is by his daughter, Ianthe. Write a novel, Ianthe, write short stories and short short stories, too. We'll be waiting patiently for you."},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"In an effort to reconcile memories, dreams and fears with real life, Ianthe Brautigan writes of her life with father, Richard Brautigan. After he took his own life in 1984, she was left with memories and what-ifs. This book is her journey into remembering and discovering her father and his life. Within the pages of this book lies a healing journey, back to the terrible drinking times, back to the grandmother she never knew, back to treasured morinings at her father's San Francisco apartment, and other times shared with her father. Photos capture the fragments of that life, and let us glimpse again at the shy, wild-haired Brautigan. Somewhere in facing down deamons and fears of this past life, I feel she somehow reclaims her own life and is no longer afraid of the future. This book had a powerful impact on me. The story of a daughter trying to gather the pieces of her life and to set them out to study, is a portrait of courage and grace."},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"-Ianthe Brautigan stays on target throughout her memoir -- as the daughter of Richard Brautigan, and the daughter of a father who killed himself. Brautigan turns out to be an articulate author, and she expresses her feelings very openly. I feel callous saying that this is an enlightening read for R. Brautigan fans, because much of I. Brautigan's drive derives from her troubled feelings about him. But the book is also a biography of her father, the ways he lived (as well as the way he died, which is vividly described). While reading, I felt it was a reliable biography, from the POV of someone very close to him, who understood him, and had her own experiences with respect to growing up his daughter; it was a reliable/subjective biography, which turned out to have merits of its own that an outsider can't match -- for better or worse. What it loses in objectivity, it more than overcomes.No doubt I. Brautigan has had many other life experiences too, but very impressively she keeps to her misssion to tell the story of her father, his life, his death, her relationship to and evolving feelings about it. I did not expect it to be as well-done as it is. Kudos, as well as my sympathy to the author who indeed had an unfortunate and difficult time due to his suicide. Regarding R. Brautigan, fans will appreciate her anectodes and stories, despite their coming from the place they do -- of having to learn that she can not \\"catch death.\\""},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"This was a lovely book.

I picked up this book in hopes of some insight into the reason for his death and was rewarded with much more than I could have hoped for. The vignettes of life with her father and dealing with his death were so immediate. The scenes stay in my mind and the beauty of the writing stays in my heart.

I was -- and still am -- enchanted by his poetic visions of life. There is something very pure and absolutely wonderful in the way he wrote. For the next several years, I made it a point to seek out his books whenever I visited bookstores. Then, in the mid-70s, life became busy with family and work, and I lost touch with this sensitive poet and his little books of sparkling wit and beauty. In May 2000, I unpacked a box and found again Brautigan's beauty books that had been packed away for the preceding 25 year or so. I stopped unpacking, went outside, sat down beneath a tree, and read the books I had of his again -- &quot;Trout Fishing In America&quot;, &quot;In Watermelon Sugar&quot; (my favorite), &quot;The Pill Versus The Sprinhill Disaster&quot;, and &quot;Rommel Drives On Deep Into Egypt&quot;. The sweet memories of his writings flooded back to me -- here was a truly sensitive soul so full of music and poetry, a unique way of seeing the world, and a beautiful way of expressing it. My interest rekindled, I wanted to find all the books I had missed of his in the intervening years, and learned of his suicide in 1984... I discovered his daughter's book, and read the story of her father through her eyes. It's also a book about herself, about her coming to grips with the tragedy and terrible pain of her father's death, about her journey to Oregon to see her father's mother and come to grips with the poor and abusive boyhood that Richard had kept hidden from his family. We see Richard Brautigan and come to know him as the sensitive, troubled, eloquent, and deeply beautiful soul he was, and we hear it through his daughter's tenderness and love. Yes, I'm sure Richard would be very proud of his daughter -- and very happy too. I truly hope we hear more from Ianthe. She has her father's gift of poetry and expression, and she has her own voice."},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"This is beautiful poetic recounting is told in a pastiche of dreams, poems, sunlight and shadows, facts and feelings. It has all the information a Brautigan fan could wish for--he never drove a car, fell all over himself laughing at Young Frankenstein, burned all his telephones--and yet I should think it would be helpful for any survivor of parental suicide. Her struggle to get at the why of it is really poignant and universal. I could have done without the morbid details, however, and felt myself getting depressed as I read, but you can't fault her for being totally honest. I am so grateful to Ianthe (now I know why this is the perfect name for a poet's daughter) for writing this book, and believe she will find she has others to write. The big disappointment of this book is the photographs which are mostly of poor quality and not relevant."},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"Ianthe's first book is perfectly lovely. It achieves just the right tone in eulogizing, mourning and seeking after her father -- respectful without being overweening, comic without being self-conscious, and truthful without giving the upper hand to either her father's talent or his problems. I'm sure her father would have loved the book -- but then it would be a different book if he'd lived, wouldn't it?There are a fair number of poetic images worthy of a Brautigan -- the rain becomes Richard's tears, a typewriter is left unplugged to keep her father from temptation, her father's ashes remain unburied for reasons you'll have to read about -- but there are also stretches of Ianthe's unique voice, her level-headedness and practicality -- traits which seem to have skipped her father's generation.There are many chapters so quotable I've already sent them to my writer-friends. There are images so poignant that I'm crying now just remembering them. And there are laughs to alleviate the hurt.A marvelous first work. I hope she has several more stories to tell."},{"Title":"You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir","review":"An ardent introspective of a loving father and maverick writer.Ianthe Brautigan brings forth the complexity and tenderness past biographies and articles have lacked.She peels away the ambigous hazy portrait of this profound and innovative writer, and elicites a faithful,candid memoir that details his faults and quirks as only she can.Weaving us back and forth through time,she evokes his mind tickling prose hand in hand with the dark mordant wit of his writings.A memorable, healing and thought provoking book that faces loss,and suicide up front and barenaked.Brautigan rises to the occasion and her writing style stands tall on it's own!Encapturing, a must read!"},{"Title":"The History of the Steam Tram","review":"This is a partial reprint from the Journal of the Institution of Locomotive Engineers, of the author's paper of 1937, with new illustrations.

Reading it from a sociological perspective allowed me to gain even more insights than I would have otherwise. It allowed me to both participate in the reading and the enjoyment of the novel, but also to be able to analyze the broader meanings of what is going on in the book as it relates to sociology. C. Wright Mills thought that people often see their lives as having explanation solely in terms of personal success and failures, failing to see the many ways in which their own personal biographies link with the course of human history. This could be said to be the root of all of Harry Haller's problems.Steppenwolf is the story of Harry Haller, a middle aged intellectual who is unable to find any joy in life. Having taken a course in Sociology, one can see that an individual's choices are never free but are always determined to some extent by a person's environment. This is a core idea in Sociology and may have saved Harry a lot of heartache. He moves into a boarding house, where despairing, lonely, and suicidal, he laments his life and his lack of any feeling of identity with the society around him. Durkheim called the way Harry was feeling, anomie, and felt that it was caused by a lack of integration of the individual into social groups and communities. This feeling of anomie causes people to feel lost or adrift and it is this feeling that causes Harry to feel suicidal.Harry comes to view himself as a Steppenwolf, or a wolf of the steppes, in that he views himself as a man of a dual nature. He yearns to transcend the Normative order of the bourgeoise and into the world of the spiritual, but he also feels drawn to this world of sensual pleasures. Not being able to comprehend how society is able to find happiness in their lives of drab conformity, where people seem to coast along with productive diligence towards meaninglessness, yet unable to resist the charms of their easy sense of happiness, Harry begins to loathe the Steppenwolf he sees himself as. He is unable to come to terms with the concept of Socialization, the ways in which people learn to conform to their society's norms, values, and roles. Fom an interactionist perspective, it can be seen that Harry is having a difficult time with the devolopement of his social self through the interaction with others. Unable to take the role of the generalized other, unable to shape his participation in a social life according to the roles of others, identification becomes a problem for Harry in that he does not wholly identify with any social groups. Half man, half wolf, half desiring the easy and sensual pleasures of the common man, he also desires to transcend this life that, for him, has no value. In a Social Darwinistic manner of speaking, it could be said that Harry has been unable to adapt to the social environment in which he finds himself.One night, while walking through the city, Harry sees a sign over a door thatreads \\"MAGIC THEATER--ENTRANCE NOT FOR EVERYBODY.\\" Looking closer he notices the words, \\"FOR MADMEN ONLY\\". Enthralled but unable to open the door, he is given a book by the sign holder entitled, \\"Treatise on the Steppenwolf.\\" Upon reading it, Harry discovers that the book is describing himself, the half man, half wolf that he sees himself as, feeling drawn to more spiritual matters, but unable to altogether resist the sensual pleasures of this mundane world. At this point, Harry becomes even more convinced of his desire for suicide.Before he is able to do so though, and after a disastrous meeting with one of his former colleagues, in which Harry insults him about a picture of Goethe, the German poet, in his house, he ultimately meets the woman that will lead him towards salvation, a young sensual woman named Hermine. She teaches Harry to dance and how to enjoy life's simple pleasures without having to analyze his every feeling. Becoming totally enthralled with her and agreeing to obey her every command, Hermine informs him of his ultimate duty, which will be, after falling in love with her, to kill her.At this point, Harry jumps head first into a life of sensual hedonistic pleasures and he comes to appreciate such a life, based upon the pleasure principle, even though he still feels a sense of yearning for transcendence above such a life. After attending a masquerade dance and dancing with Hermine, Harry is invited by a man named Pablo into his Magic Theater and this is where the book gets even more symbolic and metaphorical. Harry is told that the goal of the theater is to lose his personality and that the only avenue for doing such is laughter. Harry laughs at himself in a mirror and travels down a corridor of doors, some of which he enters, into a sort of theater of the absurd, a kind of waking dream. Entering one room where he finds Hermine and Pablo naked and lying on the floor, he believes that this is the moment that Hermine had meant when she told him that he must ultimately kill her, so, finding a knive magically appear in this pocket he proceeds to stab and kill her. He is now greeted by the ghost of Mozart, the classical composer, who tells Harry that he is much too serious and that he has committed a grave error by misunderstanding the magic theater and that his goal was to learn laughter.Erik Erikson said that throughout the life course, an individual must resolve a series of conflicts that shape that person's sense of self and ability to perform social roles successfully. It is this conflict that we see Harry having a difficult time with. Hermine and Pablo make an attempt at resocialization for Harry, but he ultimately takes everything too seriously and misses the point that laughter is the key to happiness. It can be seen that as society becomes more complex, it tends to become characterized more and more by secondary groups and organizations, making society more efficient but also causing confusion and unhappiness. This is the story of Harry Haller.Using social imagination, I was able to analyze Harry Haller's feelings and actions from a sociological perspective. I was able to see how Harry was having a hard time coping with society, and how that it was this inner turmoil that he labeled the Steppenwolf. I can very much relate to Harry Haller, as I myself have found myself feeling exactly as he has over the years. I, too, have felt a sense of the Steppenwolf within me, a sense of not being able to recognize myself in others and the easy way some people seem able to proceed through life. It has always seemed to me that the vast majority of mankind seems easily able to just live life without having to think about much of anything. For people like myself and Harry Haller, there is a spiritual yearning for more, even as we reject much of what religion has to offer. The story of the Steppenwolf is to realize that there is a dual nature within all of us, even more than just two natures actually, according to Herman Hesse, and that the best remedy is to learn to be able to laugh at life and at ourselves.It is interesting that laughter is also one of the main themes of another book I have just finished, Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes. In the Steppenwolf, laughter is what Harry was to learn in order to find some sort of happiness, while in Bradbury's book, it was laughter that was used to thwart the evil carnival freaks. It seems that Harry Haller was visited in his life by Bradbury's carnival freaks and unable to learn laughter, succumbed to their evil.I would definitely recommend this book, especially to those introspective types, such as myself, who may feel a tinge of the Steppenwolf within their own soul. It is my humble opinion that if one is paying attention to the world around them, and not just floating through life Paris Hilton like, then one can't help but to feel their own personal Steppenwolf."},{"Title":"Steppenwolf","review":"There are people out there, reading this review now, who have gone thru life feeling as though no one has ever understood them. Some of those people will read this book, 'Steppenwolf', & it will hit them like a bolt(& some wont like it at all). Not only will a few of them feel as though they have finally been understood, but they might feel as though at last they can begin to understand themselves!Yes, there is someone who understands. His name is Hesse. Unfortunately he has passed on, he was from an earlier generation. But you know, when he lived people from all over the world wrote him letters asking for his understanding. He answered them all, & he usually had good advise for them. & he was able to understand not only because he was intellgent, but also because he had also suffered the problems of his 'Steppenwolf' himself. Yes, it might seem that he were writing this best of all books about each of us individually, but it was, in fact, autobiography. Half autobiography, half poem, & 100% masterpiece. Please read it, & dont allow the 1st 80 pages throw you off- it is going to come alive for you, as it has for people since 1927. You might be in for a treat.However, some dont feel this way, especially these days. It is a little odd, I feel, that Hesse (who was so popular with readers from my generation in the early 1970s) has had a decline in popularity from 1980 on. He doesnt seem to strike the same chord in todays young readers as he did 30 years ago. Maybe because his books spoke about the importance of spirt over that of technology, I dont know. I dont think Hesse would have seen the rise of the PC & the internet as a bad thing at all, & think it would have been right up his alley, & that he might have made the internet a better thing than it is. In fact, the theme of 'The Glass Bead Game' brings to mind todays internet, & there is a website devoted to just that. But, for me anyway, the fact that todays generation has sort of rejected Hesse is one of the more sad things about it, because I would have believed that they would have embraced him even more than mine did. I think the reason that they havnt might be because that while they are very much in favor of the enlightment that Siddhartha, Goldman, Harry Haller, Sinclair, etc ultimately reach, they have never experienced the PROBLEMS of the Steppenwolf that set those characters on that road in the 1st place. I think that those kinds of problems might have been unique to my generation, & that Hesse came along for Americans just at the right time. It seems that the times have changed"},{"Title":"Steppenwolf","review":"Here I am, like the Steppenwolf, approaching the age of 50. I understand him now for I have lived his life. His deepest thoughts are mine- indeed, they read exactly like my own journals. No wonder I am told that Hesse is my soul mate. It is true.I lived Steppenwolf's solitary life. I knew his crisis. I share his rejection of bourgeois society because it grates the fundamental essence of my soul. And I know what he means by the strength derived from knowing that you can leave this world any time. I know the conviction to never sell yourself into wage slavery for mere money. I know his night wanderings, his books, his music, his rooms, his cigars, and his wine. I know.But I also know his central crisis. For when we are ready then a door really does open to a higher perspective. I literally walked through that door in the wall for \\"madmen only.\\" Like the wulf I had always sensed the golden moments that form the golden path to that door. I was eventually shown it. I had always suspected that man was more than a half rational animal, that he was a child of the Gods and destined to immortality. When you are ready, when you are sick enough of the petty ego, you will be shown the kingdom on the other side of time and appearances. It is just necessary to stumble through your share of dirt and humbug before you reach Home.Time and the world, money and power belong to the small and shallow people. To the rest, the real men, belongs nothing. Nothing but death- and eternity- and the kingdom."},{"Title":"Astrological Timing of Critical Illness","review":"After nearly 30 years studying astrology and tarot, and teaching them as a single unified subject on simegen.com, in seminars, and in my book series The Biblical Tarot, I now see Noel Tyl's entire approach to astrology as fundamentally different from anyone else's (except his own students perhaps).Some people thrive on this angle of approach, others are mystified and think his writing style is at fault, and others reject it in their bones and believe his astrology faulty.As a professional writer of fiction and nonfiction, and teacher of writing (also on simegen.com ) I judge Tyl's writing style as exactly appropriate to project the underlying philosophy of his approach to astrology.Tyl's is a psychological approach and his style is an exceptionally lucid version of the style you will find in most psychology textbooks. By reading a few paragraphs of his work, you can probably decide if his approach is for you.As a mystic who is also a science fiction writer trained in Chemistry, I find that Tyl modernizes astrology by correlating and re-interpreting the Ancient Wisdom in terms of what modern science has discovered about the human psyche, personality development process, and the scars left by even the most benign upbringing. In the Tyl approach, nature, nurture and karma come together into a picture of the whole person, and the wholeness of Life as an ongoing developmental process.ASTROLOGICAL TIMING OF CRITICAL ILLNESS is not a book that can be easily read and understood outside the context of Tyl's basic approach. This one is an advanced book for the student of Tyl's version of astrology. It would seem opaque even to an accomplished practicing professional astrologer if that astrologer were steeped in a different set of assumptions about Life and where astrology can fit into Life.If your skills aren't up to comprehending an advanced astrology textbook on an extremely specialized branch of astrology, buy this book and put it away on your top shelf. You'll get to it eventually, and it could save someone's life. So many of Tyl's books are out of print, I wouldn't let the chance to stock this one go by.In the meantime, read it quickly for the definition of the quindecile aspect and the way Pluto tends to show up as a harbinger of a health-challenge. Then notice those elements in the charts you analyze, take notes, track your clients, and see if these clues help you help them. If so, sit down one weekend and really read this book cover to cover.To get the most out of this book you'll probably need to follow the footnotes that refer to many of Tyl's other works -- on midpoints, developmental deficit and the moon's nodes, and especially on the Pluto involvement in extreme Prominence and fame (which is treated in Synthesis &amp; Counseling in Astrology : The Professional Manual by Noel Tyl ).Most of Tyl's life work in astrology consists of contributions which are just the start of a line of research that will have to be carried out by teams with serious funding at their disposal. Some enterprising medical student may one day use this book to design a project and apply for a research grant.Even if you don't like or subscribe to Tyl's approach, you should come to understand his theories so you'll understand that research when it's published. And it will be."},{"Title":"Astrological Timing of Critical Illness","review":"Noel has once again written an astrological text based on his extensive research. It's important to note that this book is simply not for those who want an instant answer. You will have to READ the book and admit that more study is needed. Noel breaks new ground by introducing the Quindecile and the importance of the 12th house. Anytime someone discovers something new, it warrants study. In spite of the lack of clarity in parts, a careful read will deliver a far better understanding of medical astrology than any other text in print. This is an absolute must have on any astrologer's shelf. This is a job very well done! ...hopefully a sequel is in the works!"},{"Title":"Astrological Timing of Critical Illness","review":"Tyl's usual combination of gobbledygook, pendantry, and his annoying push to create acceptance for an aspect he terms the &quot;quindecile&quot; an aspect whose degree no other astrologer agrees with, not even Karen Hamaker-Zondag, all make this book just one more of Tyl's attempts to define himself as the age's leading astrological intellectual. As usual with most of his writing, he fails to clearly define his terms, and the conclusions that he leaps to in his many example charts will startle and mystify most seasoned astrologers. Why, for example, Neptune/Pisces/12th House emphasis should indicate potential blood problems is not very clearly discussed--usually the body part attributed to this complex is the feet--and Tyl acknowledges a few contemporary medical astrologers, while dismissing others who had decades of practical medical experience and tutelage. If you've got the patience, you can probably learn something here, but you probably won't figure out how to predict and avoid your own or others' maladies--at least not based on this material."},{"Title":"Astrological Timing of Critical Illness","review":"This book presents interesting case histories and studies of small groups of people with the same illness from an astrological point of view. The book could have used a good editor because the writing is often dense and overly verbose and pendantic so that the main points get lost in the verbiage. I think the book is worth reading, but it is hard-going and confusing in many parts."},{"Title":"Astrological Timing of Critical Illness","review":"I ordered this book hoping to begin learning the fascinating subject of medical astrology. This would require a clear explanation correlating different astrological events to their associated medical conditions, hopefully in a systematic and complete way. I was disappointed, and I will be returning the book to Amazon.What I found here was the \\"case study\\" copout. In hindsight we know, for example, that Arnold Schwarzenegger is very strong and has heart trouble. I really am not impressed by a recital of far too many astrological details about his chart coming to the conclusion, somehow, that he is very strong and has heart trouble.I appreciate directness, simplicity, clarity, and organization. None of that can be found in this book."},{"Title":"Astrological Timing of Critical Illness","review":"Astrological Timing of Critical Illness provides excellent and timely example charts for review as one follows the step-by-step process Tyl uses to track the first warning signs of a variety of serious illnesses, including diabetes, heart disease, strokes, and cancer. Well worth it's jacket price. The author's style of writing is clear, concise, and as usual, elegant in form and structure, if occasionally a bit pedantic. Most refreshing of all, the book is written with an intelligent general public in mind, in what appears to be a sincere effort to reach a far wider audience, and perhaps be truly helpful in the early detection of what most of us consider to be both life altering and life threatening illnesses."},{"Title":"Astrological Timing of Critical Illness","review":"Some of this works, and some of it simply doesn't.

First, it will challenge your management practices and possibly prevent you from ever having to deal with a foundered horse. Second, if one of your horses ever does experience founder, Jackson offers a proven recovery process, and you will need to comprehend it before you call your vet and/or farrier.Founder causes the death of a scandalously high number of horses and condemns many more to a lifetime of suffering. It remains a mystery, and veterinary research and treatment is all over the map. Jackson developed his philosophy by observing wild mustangs, who unlike their domestic brethren, almost never suffer founder. The author's conclusion is that this difference is completely due to life-style rather than genetics. Consequently, you can prevent founder by creating an environment for your horses that mimics life in the wild, and by managing the horse's hoofs to simulate the mustang hoof.The foot of a healthy horse suspends the coffin bone in the hoof capsule with a thick concave sole between the coffin bone and the ground. In founder, the laminae attaching the hoof wall to the coffin bone lets go, allowing the coffin bone to drop. In extreme cases the coffin bone will drop so far that it penetrates the sole of the foot. Some times the hoof will be completely sloughed off the foot. Jackson's approach to treating founder is refreshingly common sense. Horses grow new hoofs from the hairline down in about nine months anyway, so with help (proper diet, frequent trimming, and exercise) there's no reason he can't be better than new in a year or less, even in severe cases.A former farrier, Jackson no longer believes in shoeing, and has founded a promising barefoot movement. Adherents believe that most horses will never need shoes if their hoofs are properly trimmed, and that horses that need protection would be better served by wearing hoof boots.Negatives: First, Jackson's advice varies from the authoritative to the speculative, and he doesn't distinguish. For example, working from the wild horse model and drawing on years of trial and error in trimming, the author makes a persuasive case that your horse is better off without shoes. He loses me when he argues that the use of bute, tranquilizers, vaccinations and worming medications somehow present a founder risk.I can see why a horse would be healthier in a large dry lot eating free-choice grass hay than either stall confinement or knee deep in alfalfa pasture. I'm less convinced that neither my hay nor my pasture grass can contain any trace of legumes or fescue, particularly when Jackson thinks it's fine to feed controlled quantities of oats, carrots, apples, and sugar treats. Even though Jackson admits that no good studies exist on wild mustang diet, he is uniformly categorical in his recommendations.Second, in the case study presented in the book, the horse experiences significant pain following trimming. Jackson seems to regard that as normal. The most successful of Jackson's disciples, Pete Ramey, says even foundered horses should be more comfortable following a trim, not less. For that reason I would steer anyone who wants to learn to do their own trimming to start with Ramey's book, Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You. For a preview and additional information on learning to trim, type Ramey's name into google - you'll find a lot of resources on the web.Third and last in the negative category, Jackson falls into kind of a marketing speak, which I found distracting. I have a personal loathing for the word holistic, and the author finds a need to insert on just about every other page. It's a different way of managing livestock, not a religion. (Interestingly, Jackson has no use for magnets, massage, acupuncture, herbal drenches, etc., all of which some would consider holistic.)Negatives aside, this is an important book and part of an important movement. Ramey does trimming clinics around the country, and he admits veterinarians free. Jackson has published papers with farriers' associations. Clinician Clinton Anderson promotes Ramey's work and has converted all his horses back to running barefoot. I hope that large-scale university research is coming. We could be headed for a revolution in horse care.Until the revolution comes, if your horse founders, you need this book. Better yet, if you read this book you probably won't have to worry about founder."},{"Title":"Founder: Prevention and Cure the Natural Way","review":"This book is amazing, as an owner of a foundered horse, it summarized a way for me to CURE my horse of founder.

I read about his approach to &quot;natural&quot; horsekeeping, and adopted his practices to my best ability, and my horses are all happy, sound and founder-free. My 24 year old, previously foundered, Missouri Fox Trotter is now sound to ride without horseshoes! I would have never dreamed that this is possible. He has NEVER gone without shoes.

This book by Jaime Jackson will absolutely dispel the myths surrounding founder and give you a more sane view of the problem. I know because when I ordered it, my horse, who is the love of my life, was into his second founder session. However, this time he was worse than the first time. At the time of his founder, I was given so much bad advice from people who should have known better, from farriers to veterinarians. My horse was wearing shoes at the time and had been for years. The grass in my pasture was nitrogen deprived from lack of fertilizing and was growing things that were harmful to my horse, unbeknownst to me. This book will take away your fears of founder, including the dreaded rotation, and will put you on the path to healing your horse once and for all. It's all about changing the way you've always looked at founder by natural, holistic lifestyle changes for your horse. Get rid of the shoes and bars and pads. Take away the sweet feed. Give your horse all he can eat in hay instead of starving him to try to get the weight off, and take away the legume hay. It will take time, but it's well worth it if you love your horse as much as I love mine. Jaime Jackson is not a veterinarian or a doctor or a scientist - he is an observer of wild horses and their natural lifestyles and habitats. He has done much research in the field of founder, and he offers advice that works. This book will make more sense than anything else you will read. I live in Georgia and do not personally know Jaime Jackson, but one day I hope to meet him in person and thank him for all the information contained between these red covers. My horse is finally on the way to recovery following Jaime's words of wisdom contained herein. It is a slow process, but patience is paying off for my big guy!"},{"Title":"Founder: Prevention and Cure the Natural Way","review":"This book is packed full of information that benefits ALL horses.

One of the most surprising ironies of Existential thinkers is the retrogressive application of this way of philosophizing projected on every philosopher, theologian, or Jewish prophet who caught their attention, all the while disavowing the label themselves. This book could have been more appropriately titled \\"A Existential Interpretation of the History of Christian Thought\\" since Tillich cannot spare us his own commentary through page after page of theological thought and development.Like any good liberal theologian, Tillich is sympathetic towards those historically labeled as heretics or whose thought life was controversial. His section on Schleiermacher can only be described as a short historical treatment mixed with his own rambling apologetic against the neo-orthodox thinkers who attempted to marginalize the thinker's importance.Tillich spares no expense to show that the original thinking of the church was a mix of allegory, metaphor, and existential thinking that was repressed by what he calls \\"the simple ones,\\" those who clinged to literal renderings of scripture. The real fight for Tillich though is not doctrinal, but philosophical.If by now you're wondering what any of this has to do with a fair and equitable treatment of an historical summary of theological reflection, you are right in asking this question. While the New Yorker calls this an \\"excellent guide for the non-specialists,\\" it's likely a student new to theological study will come away with strong opinions superintended through the lens of 20th century existentialism.Some specific examples will help to drive this point home. In Origen, he sees the \\"greatest theologian\\" of the church, and one who systematically denied the reality of hell. The \\"simple ones\\" (primarily the magistrates of orthodoxy), out of sheer malice and a hatred of their enemies, repressed his work as a means to inflict mental torment and anguish while pronouncing eternal damnation on those who in life they could not bring under their authority. Tillich has no problem summoning motive and establishing psychological profiles where there is none specifically to be derived.He reinterprets the doctrine of creation ex nihilio as a metaphor for expressing a reality about God's all-encompassing being. For Tillich, there is nothing in the cosmos that resisted his creating, which he contrasts to Greek thinking in which matter was eternal and existed alongside the eternal gods.Neo-Platonism is also introduced as a precursor to existential thinking. For example, evil is not a force of spiritual opposition to the good. But it is \\"participation in non-being.\\" By non-being, Tillich asserts anything that is not self-generating or self-sustaining so as to have a reality in itself, namely material reality.At times Tillich is so utterly wrong that it bears pointing out a few examples: In recalling the life of Apollinarius of Laodicia he seems to group him with the doctrine notable in Eutychus and fails to mention his most famous formula, namely that the mind of God replaced in the person of Jesus his human mind.When it comes to Theodore of Mopsuestia, there are more than a few attempts to turn him into an orthodox thinker. For example, Tillich mentions that in his theology, God the Son suffered and the human nature must be adorned. In the same paragraph, Tillich says God both suffered and did not suffer a few lines down. Confusing? But he says nothing about his heresy as he has brought up in other thinkers. This detail is conspicuous, although it should be mentioned that Mopsuestia like Nestorius after him, believed the union was one of ethical union.Meanwhile, he represents the Western thinkers as adopting a notion of the gloried Christ as one that returns to oneness with God, saying that the human nature was \\"swallowed up\\" in the heavenly one\\" after his ascension into Heaven. Here, Tillich seems to make the Western churches followers of Marcellus. I'm aware of no authorized view in the West, be it in Roman Catholic or Protestant circles where the churches believe that the Incarnation is an impermanent event. Plus, this implicitly denies the pre-existent oneness of the Trinity, a concept too Tillich repristinates in a form of modal monarchianism as he explains it in a later chapter.By the time he gets to Aquinas, he informs his readers that his \\"five proofs\\" is a valid analysis so long as it remains an analysis and not an argument. Remembering that Tillich finds an existential parallel in everyone he likes, as far as analyses go, Aquinas' five proofs, we are told, are by and large \\"existential.\\" He even calls Jesus and Socrates existentialists because they moved people.This goes on and on, from personal asides such as he wishes the theological climate in Germany worked with the same agape love present in American theology, or his own affinity for Kierkegaard as he studied under Martin K&auml;hler. There is simply too much Tillich. Tillich, however, is known for this kind of bait and switch tactic. His monumental work Courage to Be, had nothing to do with \\"courage\\" in the traditional sense, but was really a reinterpretation of \\"faith.\\" So to read this book as a history, would be first to know how Tillich operates.My recommendation is that this book be read by individuals interested in Tillich's theology not as a book impartial to a history of Christian thought. There are much better books out there, for example Thomas Oden's Classic Christianity, which simply presents the historical thought or doctrine and provides chapter and verse support from the ancient authors, allowing you to judge for yourself."},{"Title":"A history of Christian thought","review":"These lectures clearly reveal Paul Tillich as one of the greatest, most brilliant, theologians of the 20th century. The book summarizes and critiques the entire history of Christian thought (with special emphasis on German theologians). Tillich's appraisals of others are completely fair. His own insights that he shares along the way are those of a devout and brilliant liberal Christian. He summarizes his approach as follows: &quot;Theology must see both sides, man's essential nature, wonderfully and symbolically expressed in the paradise story, and man's existential condition, under sin, guilt, and death.&quot;I have only one reservation. This may well be Tillich's most accessible work, as one reviewer states. But that speaks more to the difficulty of Tillich's other works than to the ease of working through this treatise. It is brilliant, it is beautiful, but it is tough going. I had to reread many passages two or three times to understand them (and a few I simply had to give up on). The book is absolutely worth the effort, but for anyone looking for a somewhat simpler (but excellent) introduction to Christian thought, I would recommend Alister McCrath's &quot;Christian Theology, an Introduction.&quot;"},{"Title":"A history of Christian thought","review":"Paul Tillich was perhaps the most important and influential 20th Century theologian writing in English. His books, however, are tough slogging--especially for those who haven't read all the many continental philosophers and theologians with whom Tillich was arguing.

Ultimately, the book (consistent with Tillich's existentialist leanings) attempts to point to theology's inherent purpose--personal application. He does so in this book with impeccable scholarly and intellectual skill."},{"Title":"A history of Christian thought","review":"This is an extraordinary set of lectures by the great theologian and cultural analyst. While hewing to the main intention of presenting a history of Christian thought, the lectures necessarily encompass a history of Western thought in general from Greco-Roman times to the present, given that specifically church-sponsored Christian thought developed and must necessarily develop in close, thoughtful, and fervent dialogue with significant trends of thought, feeling, imagination, and morality in the larger cultural environment. Each section of this book is stimulating and rich in insight. Your future reading (or past reading, for that matter) on any topic he covers in these lectures will surely profit from attending to what he writes. Tillich has a knack for getting simply to the root of any matter.One important implication of the lectures given by Tillich on ancient and medieval Christian thought and policy is this: though they may differ as to what they draw from that tradition, that tradition belongs to all Christians."},{"Title":"A history of Christian thought","review":"Paul Tillich - one of the greats in Theology - systematic, thorough, enlightening.

Pelagius had a point, but he did not see the profundity of the Christian description of the human situation.\\" (Pg. 124)\\"The church of this period lived in constant anxiety about the presence of the demonic within itself and in others.

It is the basis for the demonic persecution of the demonic.\\" (Pg. 148-149)\\"I could say that where God is not the prius of everything, he can never be reached.

The depth of his insight and the breadth of his knowledge are stunning. There is a hardly a page in this book from which I did not learn something that will stick with me for the rest of my life.My only complaints are hardly complaints at all.

The author states that many African kingdoms succumbed to the pressure of a new civilization and new technology. Some tried to adapt to the new ways, others retreated or fought against them. It mattered little which tactic they adopted. Most African kingdoms disappeared under the onslaught of European colonialism. A few survived, but always as puppets or anachronisms living at the mercy of a colonial power. Scholefield's aim is to tell the story of three such kingdoms---the old kingdom of Congo, Dahomey, and Lesotho---widely separated geographically, but sharing similar struggles. He does so on the basis of English language sources only.South African-born author of seven novels by 1974, Alan Scholefield comes to comparative history with a gift for story-telling and capturing interesting details. THE DARK KINGDOMS is certainly well-written and will keep your attention. Whether or not it is professional history is another question. I would say that this volume is excellent for whetting one's appetite for a knowledge of African history, for getting students interested in various questions in the field, and as a starting point for further readings. However, the author does not stick to his topic, often wandering into byways and circumlocutions that are fascinating, but produce no ammunition for his stated aim of describing the impact of Europe on Africa. The tendency is most acute in the section on Dahomey, where Richard Burton, his life and activities in Africa take over from the matter at hand. I felt that Scholefield really does not say what impact Europe had on Dahomey, other than a kind of postscript in which he tells how the French finally took over, while his chapter was entirely on the English ! The chapter on Lesotho and its relations with English, Afrikaaners, and other African peoples is best, perhaps because the story is most familiar to the author. In addition, too much time may have been spent detailing lurid episodes of cannibalism, ritual murder, the slave trade, tribal wars, etc. This always draws in readers, true, but is it necessary for a serious history ? In conclusion, I cannot say THE DARK KINGDOMS is bad. There are interesting illustrations and three decent maps. The author attempted to be fair in his portraits, he wrote interestingly, and I enjoyed the book. Is it good history ? Did he write what he said he was going to write ? These questions made me hesitate to give it four stars, but I do so on the basis of readability."},{"Title":"The dark kingdoms: The impact of white civilization on three great African monarchies","review":"Given that this is Africa, it is curious to look back 30 years at Alan Scholefield's little essay looking back on 400 years of African politics. The current (early 21st century) condition is quite different from what Scholefield observed just 15 years after the African colonies started to practice independence.Here is how Scholefield judged the kingdoms at the end of their periods of first (and greatest) impact from the whites: \\"Unlike the Old Kingdom of Congo, which opened its arms to the white man too wide, unlike the Kingdom of Dahomey, which shut its doors too firmly, Moshesh (of Lesotho) was a man who understood whites.\\" Moshesh maintained independence, balancing off Britons and Afrikaaners.Today, Congo has remains mired in the savagery that gripped the land when its ancient rulers proved unable to cope with the ambitions that Portuguese weaponry roused in them.Lesotho, despite having a chance to show how an African polity could develop differently from those that had suffered a colonial overlordship, was little different from the ex-colonial states until AIDS swept into the country. While Lesotho is not nearly the worst state in Africa, it isn't doing well, either, and it had to go through nearly the same Marxist thuggery as the average \\"emerging\\" nation.Who would have guessed that Dahomey (now Benin), the Slave Coast, the continuous cannibal feast, would now look like the most modern state in West Africa. Admittedly, that's a low bar, but still.Scholefield, a novelist from South Africa, is a graceful and intelligent writer. \\"The Dark Kingdoms\\" does not pretend to break new ground nor to present in-depth history of societies. He uses the accounts of the early European visitors, naturally personal. The first encounters were dominated by the personalities of a few men, mostly Africans. What the majority of the people thought did not count for much.With local dressing, the response of local strongmen (and not just in Africa) was to get access to superior weaponry to enlarge their petty sovereignties. The Congolese seem to have also been the most sincere in adopting the outsiders' religion. They ended up in a nasty dynastic war. According to more academic historians, Congo had had something of a centralized government, with a capital that was, just barely, able to live off a typically unproductive countryside.The wars destroyed the capital and the country was too poor ever to build a replacement. This is about the condition today, too.In Dahomey, firearms lifted a minor group, formerly oppressed by better-situated neighbors, into impressive oppressors themselves. Rather like the Aztecs, nobody in the vicinity cried when Dahomey stumbled over its succession problems. Dahomey/Benin's current status as a poor but comparatively free and liberal state is so odd that it requires considerable explanation. Nothing in Scholefield's exposition throws any light on it.His section on Lesotho comes from a much later period, better documented. Moshesh had some of his sons educated, so more of an African version of events is available, too. Scholefield is a great admirer of the old murderer. If ever a country had a father, it was Moshesh.One of Africa's biggest problems is that its indigenous social/political units were so small. Modern states have to be big, and Africa has had a hard time scaling up. Lesotho is just a tiny place even after Moshesh's empire-building, with a population a little over 2 million.\\"The Dark Kingdoms\\" also serves as a marker document of how the outside world, or at least an educated, sympathetic individual in it, thought of Africa as it started \\"emerging.\\""},{"Title":"Introduction to the aerodynamics of flight (NASA SP ; 367)","review":"It is a good general introduction to aerodynamics.

Nowhere is this raw reality more apparent than at the United Nations, dominated by a single country since the decline and fall of the Soviet Union.Who call the shots at the UN? And how is it done? Phyllis Bennis has written a readable, gripping and masterful, if ultimately flawed account of the world body's domination by the US.Carefully tracing how American power dressed as principle strategically hobbled the UN from its inception, she reveals concrete instances of how the US coerces or subdues countries into toeing its line, and how it quashes dissent.Whether she is examining US manipulation of the UN Security Council to secure multilateral cover for conducting a unilateral campaign against Iraq, or its conscious policy of apathy in the Security Council in the face of the Rwanda genocide, Bennis is excellent at teasing out US double-standards and hypocrisy. However, her judgements are perhaps too broad and sweeping, failing to take into account the realities of power. No country operates on assumptions of altruism. Any freshman realist will tell you this is the way the world works, has worked, and will always work. Can any country afford to suspend its national interest for the sake of fuzzy moral principles, even if these principles lie at the heart of international law, the UN Charter? Bennis believes that the US has a moral duty to do so, and must provide responsible and enlightened leadership to revitalise the UN. In unveiling the contradictions, ambiguities and doublespeak in US policy at the UN, Bennis compels the reader to confront a hard question: can the US get away with mobilising the world's most important international organisation for its own interests? Is it answerable to no-one but itself?Embedded in her book is a lesson in ethics - calling the shots entails responsibility and accountability. But any freshman ethical philosopher may tell you that. Some readers may expect such a lucid, well-written account of US domination at the UN to deliver more, instead of serving as a jeremiad on unbridled US power.In concluding her book, what appears to pique Bennis most is what she terms the &quot;self-righteous know it all ism&quot; of US officials and politicians.

Reading her book one is to believe that the U.S. has &quot;swayed&quot; and &quot;cajolled&quot; the U.N. into its lax standards of rule and &quot;fuzzy&quot; moral concepts. Sorry, not when the U.N. has steadily allowed corrupt governments of every ilk to hold sway in its councils. Not when the very fabric of the charter of the U.N. is ignored to allow governments hostile to peaceful and democratic rule to be part of the decision making process. Bennis neglects the history of &quot;anti-american&quot; and anti-democratic activities that have taken roost in the vaunted halls of the U.N. since the 70's in favor of making this an all America's fault diatribe. Nevermind the fact that Americans pay more than any other nation to support the U.N. Nevermind the fact that the U.N. members live better in the U.S. than they might in their own homelands. Were supposed to believe that the U.S. controls the U.N. when nations like Syria are allowed on the security council? When Tiawan is illegally voted of the concil in favor of Communist China. Sorry. Ayn Rand was more visionary in regards to the U.N. than Bennis, and at a time of when the U.N. is about to be investigated for corruption under the food for oil program, little Miss Bennis needs to stop making excuses and really explore this bastion of international law she reveres. Once done she will see that Washington has very little to do with the politics of how the U.N. is run and how the Secretary General can either make or brake the power structure within. Answer this Miss Bennis. If the U.s. manipulates the U.N. so well then how is it that the agency never listens to the U.S.? Out of all the wars the U.N. has never stopped a single one and I doubt that is the U.S.' fault and I am happy the world is not ignoring the U.N.s' failures, we need to stop allowing this organization full of false alliances to speak for those truely dedicated to peace. Down with the &quot;peacekeepers&quot; who rape and steal from those they are to protect. Down with the support of terrorist nations within its councils for money. And to hell with the waste this organization dumps on civilized nations when it looses control of its unstable politics."},{"Title":"San Francisco Irish 1848-1880","review":"This book arrived about as close to cut-off date as possible in far worse condition than described by seller.

PM attempted to write about hot topics of the day without being beholding to advertisers. They championed the causes of those with little power such as unions and minorities. Paul Milkman offers great insight into the way a radical publication such as PM gives us a unique view of politics in America in the 1940's. His sentences are frequently eloquent.

To be fair, this is the onlytranslation of Patanjali that I have read."},{"Title":"I Chose Freedom: The Personal and Political Life of a Soviet Official","review":"I had been looking forward to reading this book for sometime since it has been out of print. This was a seminal book in the process of deglamorizing Joe Stalin and the Soviet Union. The brutality of the Soviets as manifested by the genocidal famines, purges, persecution of religion, and overt aggression and occupation of neighboring countries was known to the West. However, due to the outright denials and other obfuscations by leftists of all sorts, and FDR's administration, presumably to get Stalin to side with them against Hitler, this knowledge was suppressed and did not influence public opinion.Well, the book is an expose of communism written by a communist. The author makes it clear that he realizes that he dedicated his life to a system that was essentially terroristic, and no effort on his part to instill or elicit decency from the rulers and their underlings was going to work inside the system. That is why he comes to the conviction that the only way to save his people is to write this expose, hoping that outside world could influence the Kremlin, so that they would finally feel some fear for what they were doing. The author was correct, and subsequantly other exposes influenced forces, both externally and internally, and brought about the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, the author did pay a terrible price for his actions, as I am sure he knew he would, his family and freinds in the Soviet Union were severely persecuted.I dissagree with a earlier reviewer's point that the author was not a confirmed advocate of Western style democracy. Considering the time that the author had after he entered the country, defected and wrote the book, it is unlikely that he could do a reasonable comparative analysis of political systems. The author was convinced that the Soviet system was evil, and that it was much worse than Czarist Russia. Also consider how devastating it must have been to him to abandon this ideology to which he had devoted his life to. I am curious about what his further convictions were.Overall, this is a very well written book, a credit to the author's ability and his translators. I just wish that the publisher had included a little on the author's biography post the release of the book."},{"Title":"I Chose Freedom: The Personal and Political Life of a Soviet Official","review":"This book is the most important description of the soviet terror that stroke the whole society in communist countries much before Soljenistin.

Written by a man who's father fought the Russian Revolution, and was himself a worked for the state, detailed to help nt he collectivization of the farms, the author documents the many problems of a centralized economy, that also shows no compassion for the farmers. Later, as an engineer is a pipe making factory, Victor tells of the priority of politics over engineering konwledge, when many are accused of sabotaging the machinery, when it breaks down due to the improper hardness of the steel being delivered as raw materail. Factory workers are sent to prison, rather than blaming the problems on the process that puts a mindset of \\"meeting a quota\\" over meeting required quality specifications to ensure you can make what is needed.When he travels to the US during WWII for an engineering exchange program, he defects as soon as he is able, having long known he is a part of a broken system.Excellent book, if you want to know what life was like as the Soviet Union came into being, through the eyes of a young man with an analytical mind."},{"Title":"I Chose Freedom: The Personal and Political Life of a Soviet Official","review":"For anyone who still thinks that Communism is an attractive alternative to Capitalism, to those who wear Che Guevara tshirts, take a bit and read this book.

By reading this book, a good comparison can be made with other famous revolutions in history."},{"Title":"I Chose Freedom: The Personal and Political Life of a Soviet Official","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time, a fact which caught me completely by surprise as I purchased it on a whim after seeing it referenced in a 20th century social history of Russia textbook I was assigned in college. I was hoping to get a personal account of life under Stalin; Kravchenko certainly delivers, not only from the perspective of an ordinary citizen who began his career with deep hopefulness about the Soviet system, but also later as a profoundly disillusioned, high-ranking official who miraculously manages to survive every major calamity of the period -- collectivization, purges, the Nazi invasion, etc. Kravchenko's writing (or at least the English translation) is a delight, his narrative riveting, and the implication of what the Russian people went through in this period is absolutely mind-boggling. As an insider's account it is first rate.While this edition of the book (purchased through Amazon) appears to have been republished by a conservative group as a means to promote \\"conservatism,\\" Kravchenko's own motivations were quite different: his commitment was to seeing the totalitarian regime replaced with a democratic one, whatever form that democracy might eventually take. Even in his defection to the US, he does not endorse any particular ideology, choosing intead to acknowledge injustice where he sees it (the US and Britain included)."},{"Title":"I Chose Freedom: The Personal and Political Life of a Soviet Official","review":"Victor Kravchenko made a stunning defection to the USA in 1944, while working as a Soviet purchasing agent on the lend-lease program. He was 38 years old. Kravchenko grew up as an idealist and a zealous communist. His father even served prison time for revolting against the Czar in 1905. Kravchenko fought with the Reds in the civil war and joined the communist party.He began to sour on communism as a witness to the ghastly collectivization efforts in the Ukraine in the mid 1930's. He was sent to organize a harvest but forbidden to feed the starving workers. Kravchenko broke the rules then, and many times as manager of various pipe factories. Nevertheless he witnessed widespread starvation. His communist resolve began to crack when his family adopted a young girl, a wandering orphan, who cried herself to sleep every night because her parents had been shipped to Siberia. And further, when he finally delivered the grain to a warehouse only to find the previous year's harvest safely store there while thousands perished nearby.His communist devotion was finally destroyed by numerouse 'purges', endless questionings, tortures, and beatings. His knack for rallying factories seems to be the only reason he survived. Kravchenko vividly describes the human condition of the workers and farmers, the lush perks of party members, and the omnipresent informer culture of a police state.He eventually achieved a high post in the Kremlin working under Stalin's top lieutenants. Then deftly maneueverd himself into a position where he might be posted abroad to defect. After his defection, he wrote this book and lived in constant fear of assassination in the US. He died in New York in 1966.This all too human book shimmers with truth and the realism of genuine witness. Written in rugged prose (translated from Russian) it is the memoir of a great soul. A compelling read for anyone who wants to understand Russia, communism, Stalin, Evil."},{"Title":"I Chose Freedom: The Personal and Political Life of a Soviet Official","review":"I discovered this book in my fathers collection of Danish books. He read it while on a freighter on his way to the US in 1948. I struggled through it years ago. It was impossible to put down. I am grateful that Victor took the time to write his story. For a person of logic and common sense what he went through must have been beyond a nightmare. Victor does a great job of describing his zeal for the party and his gradual disillusionment and finally the realization that he has made a huge mistake. How can you read this story and not have pity for the millions who starved to death? I'll bet some of the peasants wished they would have had a gun so they could at least have gone down fighting. What puzzles me is why this story hasn't been made into a movie? Does Hollywood only go after the Nazi's and give the communists a free ride?

Even though a translation, the style is superb, and there is hardly any idiosyncrasy in it, so the translator must have been very good indeed. The only thing I find objection to is the way in which dialogues between protagonists are presented: they are so accurate the reader might think they were written in a diary, which is out of the question! And when Kravtchenko wrote the book, he was on the run, fearing that he would be \\"erased\\" by NKVD agents.So was his memory that good, that he was able to memorize dialogues with his father, mother, colleagues etc? I very much doubt it. But all in all, it's an excellent book, and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to know how ugly the Soviet Union under Stalin was...The only book on the same subject that I consider superior is Soljenytsin's \\"Gulag Archipelago\\", but that was written by the greatest Russian writer of the 20th century..."},{"Title":"I Chose Freedom: The Personal and Political Life of a Soviet Official","review":"\\"I Chose Freedom\\" by Victor A.

They, and his family left behind, are sent to prison and/or killed. A sad testiment to a personal quest for freedom. In addition, it is hard to explain why some of these escapees never sever their ties to communism. It may be based on their lack of religious belief.

Spark's prose is not ornate or overburdened with description. She drops in the right word in the right place and moves on. I am reminded of William Trevor's prose as close in style. Spark's attitude toward her characters, all of whom are at least seventy years old is unsentimental and not a little mean. Spark's vision of old age is unremitting in its irony and at the same time offers a recognition of the continuing involvement and outright underhanded manuevering in life that continues up to death. While this resonates with other Dodgy Old Englishpersons novels such as Carey or Waugh, Spark's vision touches on deeper issues, more philosophical and/or religious, while not lingering on or trying for profundity. Through the sardonic laughter, there is just the right touch of profundity. In the end, Spark leaves us with an undecideable mystery, the conceit by which the action is structured, which leaves it up to the reader to decide whether, in confronting the mystery of death,and life, we have been dealing with a metaphysical matter, or something more mundane."},{"Title":"Novell's CNE Study Guide for NetWare 5","review":"This study guide is outstanding!

The surfaces of the front and back plates are silky smooth, taut and very pretty. The spine, being sewn with strings, is tight, yet allows the book to lay completely flat when open. The pages inside are very smooth, practically non-porous grain, and of a medium weight, thick enough for fine-tip pen-and-ink, but too thin for any other medium of drawing or writing element.

It is sensitively written, attractively laid out, and full of illustrations. Can be read in one sitting and makes the woman's cycle easy to understand. A lot of basic information on hormones, fertility problems, and practical strategies. Also how nursing, contraceptive pills, and menopause can affect the cycle. Those who wish for more detail can go to a more comprehensive book such as &quot;Taking Charge of Your Fertility,&quot; but &quot;Your Fertility Signals&quot; is a good, easily-read, basic manual. I especially liked the clear, easy-to-use charts included for tracking your cycle."},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"At the time, I had been married 3 years, and my husband and I didn't use any form of birth control. We were trying to conceive and I wasn't getting pregnant. Little did I know, after seeing my Gynecologist (who thought that I probably had endometreosis or PID) there was nothing wrong with me. Thank God I didn't have further testing.I had a conversation one day with our office transcriptionist, who informed me of how she had gotten pregnant. She promoted Merryl's book to me, and she promised to lend it to me to read. I was happy to accept this book from her, which later I found out had exchanged many hands (with success I might add).It only took 2 months for me to get pregnant, I had no complications at all. When our first child was 6 months old, I found out that I was pregnant with our 2nd child. Our second child also had no complications.So thanks to Merryl we are the proud parents of two beautiful, wonderful, intelligent children. I would advise potential parents to try this out and see, but enjoy the whole process. I'll never forget how this book changed my life."},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"After having been on the pill for several years, my husband and I were ready to have children. We decided it would be best to give my body a chance to regulate its cycles before we jumped into trying to conceive. This book kept us pregnancy free for 4 months and on the first serious attempt to get pregnant, we conceived! I'm now 8 weeks pregnant and my husband and I have become great promoters of this book among our friends. I was also able to use the book to give myself an indication of how well my body was rebounding from being on the pill. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"This is one of my favorite books as it simply and quickly explains many processes of a woman's fertility cycle. I would not consider it a text for natural family planning, but I would consider it a great way to get to know about what is going on inside your body and how you can tell. It is information every woman should know. I have lent mine to many of my friends and they have all found it very interesting and informative and have enjoyed it all the more because it is quick and easy to read."},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"I really recomend reading if your planning or avoiding pregnancy and I would even recomend it as basic sexual education for the stable couple.It is wonderfull to be able to understand my body so much better and I got pregnant at the first try, following my charts, and aiming for a boy...we got him! An he's sooooo cute.And also the contraceptive advise is great... I dont take the pill well and it allows for some freedom and some extra special dates with my husband, without risk of pregnancy"},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"I bought three other books at the same time as this one, and this one was one of the worse ones. I did not feel it gave an adequate amount of information on the methods compared to the other books I bought. I don't even think this was a good book as a supplemental to the more in-depth ones. It went to Value Village immediately.The other books I bought were:Taking Charge of Your Fertility (Weschler) - definately the best resource for this; very in-depth and lots of information; definately my go to book;The New No-Pill No-Risk Birth Control - not as good as Taking Charge of Your Fertility, but had good supplemental information and also would be fine as a stand-alone book;Honoring Our Cycles: A Natural Family Planning Workbook - Waste of money! Worst of the four I bought. It seemed as if it was written for a sixth grader who had never learned anything about the reproductive system. Really annoyed me and I didn't even make it through the first couple of pages before tossing it."},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"This is an extraordinary book. Every woman should own a copy. I still don't understand why we are not taught about our own bodies since childhood. If this was the case there wouldn't be so many unplanned pregnancies. Not only that but we wouldn't have to put harsh chemicals into our bodies to avoid pregnancy."},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"I have used this book for years. I appreciate the ease of reading and application. Anyone can do this, and learn it for life. The charts in the back to copy are of great help when you are starting. Well written, concise, and nicely laid out. I would recommend this book to anyone just married or about to get married, or even farther along in their journey. It really only works in a long term committed relationship."},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"This book is definitely a keeper! I checked it out of the library first after hearing about a married friend of mine that used 'family planning' as a method of birth control. That was 13 years ago and I now own two copies, one of my own and one I loan out. In the thirteen years of using the BC method that this book teaches, I have had two planned children that I chose the sex of (her method worked for me!), and never had any accidental pregnancies. I conceived my son in two cycles and my daughter in one. This book is a very easy read, the drawings are easy to understand and there are charts in the back that you can photocopy to keep track of your cycles with. Charting may seem intimidating or time consuming to some women but after your first couple of cycles you become comfortable with it and its not a big deal.We use a barrier method or a Vaginal Contraceptive Film when I know I am fertile but I have a friend that abstains during fertility, so either way will work. Most of my friends use this book for conceiving a child but I do have 5 friends that use it as a way of preventing pregnancy. I think that most women on hormonal birth control methods don't realize the fun they are missing by not ovulating, and many don't understand that is what is happening to their body. During ovulation most women experience very loving feelings toward their partner, heightened states of arousal and are more easily orgasmic. To take away that time of the month from a couple is just tragic!"},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"This is a good book for a quick reference on the NFP method. It has great descriptions and pictures to help you learn. I also bought the Taking Charge of your Fertility book and that one is much larger and goes into much greater detail, but will take some time to get through the entire book. I think it is helpful to have both. This book is great for a quick reference if you forget something or want a quick learning tutorial and the TCOYF is great if you have the time to go through the whole book, or at least the sections that apply to you."},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"This is by far one of the easiest books on knowing your body and tracking your fertility signs. this book is a must own by every woman it truly takes the guess work out of trying to figure out your fertile and non fertile days. I'm a former nurse and I found this to be the most concise and reader friendly book on this subject. everyone from the novice to the expert can learn from this book. kudo's to the author on demystifying the ovulation cycles of womens bodies."},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"I found this book before I even meet my hubby of almost a year now. Back in 1997, I was in collage and knew from a experience with the pill for health reasons that when I became active in this area I would not be able to rely on chemicals to control fertility, I tend to become sick after a short time of take a pill. Plus I did not like the idea of being on pills or what ever to limit how many kids I might have. This was the only information I could find on a natural fertility method of birth control and I found it in a used book store. When I read this book it cleared up many Questions I had and help me feel more confadent that I would be fine with out pills. All though I did end up using the NuvaRing for a few years before I married my guy(he is allergic to latex), that was do to miss placing the book through a cuple of moves. As soon as we were married I tracked bown this book again and fond Cyclebeads as well, I have been off chemicals for almost 6 months using both methods to learn and understand my body. I know when we are ready to have kids we will be well informed and have no problems. I wish this information was standard class tought in high school. Peace & Blessings, Cloe"},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"This book is pure information on what makes a woman &quot;tick&quot;. Every grown woman should read this whether you are interested in having children someday, or not. A good gift for a new bride."},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"This book is easy to understand, easy to put into practice. I was trying to get pregnant in my late 30's and was able to do so within 3 months. After the birth of my first child I waited a couple of years before trying again. By now I was 41. Again I got pregnant within 3 months. All my friends around my age were going crazy taking hormone shots and doing in vitro. Of course, it could be that I am a very fertile person. However, even at that, at the age I was, I did not have any time to waste! So I do credit this book for giving me the right information so I could be get pregnant naturally within the shortest possible time frame. If you have had trouble conceiving, I strongly recommend you try this natural method first before getting any expensive treatments."},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"Not the greatest book on the subject. I didn't find this book to be up to date. I bought it to learn more about the after effects of being on &quot;the pill,&quot; and achieving conception; it was not beneficial. It needs more content in regards to this subject matter. As well, it sounded like the author was not certain about the subject matter and the effectiveness of the recommended procedures for conception or to avoid conception. A friend who was using the book for just the opposite reason, to avoid pregnancy recommended it to me, and she enjoyed it. I think the book sways more towards how to avoid conception than how to achieve it."},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"This book is well written and easy to understand. There are helpful diagrams and charts that illustrate the points the author is making.This book is for women who want to better understand their fertility, avoid or achieve conception, eliminate use of the pill or other chemical forms of birth control, and attempt to conceive a baby of one sex or the other. It explains how you can use your basal body temperature (taken before rising first thing in the morning) and your cervical mucous to tell whether you are fertile or not. This allows you to avoid intercourse if you are trying to avoid pregnancy, and to have intercourse at your most fertile times if you are trying to get pregnant.I think that even women who want to remain on birth control should read this book - it is valuable to understand how your body works and why. For women who are breastfeeding, this book has a whole chapter on using your temp and mucous to ascertain whether your fertility has returned - an excellent tool since chemical birth control while breastfeeding is best avoided. For women who are experiencing infertility, charting your temps and mucous can help you discover why you aren't conceiving, and knowing this can make it easier to seek treatment.There may be more thorough books on this topic out there, but I think this is one of the best basic ones. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"I can tell you that I am one of the success stories from using this book. As artificial birth control is against our religion, I needed to learn, so I checked this book out of the library. I learned the method entirely from this book (I never took a single class), and consequently never spent a day of my marriage using artificial birth control. We have spent THREE YEARS successfully avoiding pregnancy, and are now applying the concepts to become pregnant.This book is written in basic language, not crammed full of medical jargon. You can pretty much read it in one sitting, and understand it. I bought this book as a reference, and still use it from time to time, if I need to check up on the guidelines.And for those who say that natural family planning results in a huge restriction on intimacy, I will tell you that I am one of those women who has LONG fertile phases, and many annovulatory cycles. Calculating my charts over the last three years, my fertile vs non-fertile time is pretty much equal. This means a lot of abstinence, but it can be done! My husband and I both agree that it has enriched our marriage. It keeps those lines of communication open, and we know that we still love each other, even when abstaining during the fertile phase. Instead of birth control being only the woman's responsibility, it becomes the couple's. Yes, the onus is still on the woman to check her signals, but the man has to be cooperative for the method to work.The abstinence can be difficult at times, but think of it this way: you get a honeymoon to look forward to every cycle! It keeps those fires burning. All the couples that we know who are on the Pill are down to maybe once or twice a month, and that's after less years together than our three. We are still just as active as when we were first married, because that mandatory abstinence period ensures that you can't take your partner for granted. Not only that, but many of these couples on the Pill have unplanned children, and we don't have any \\"accidents\\". Hmm . . . and yet they tell us that we don't know what we're doing, and that natural birth control doesn't work. (Please note: this is NOT the rhythm method! That method is only 75% effective - natural family planning, when used properly, is 99% effective.)This is a wonderful book for setting people free from society's negativity towards fertility. We don't need harmful pills or intrusive devices to control what is a normal, healthy condition. Instead, we celebrate and respect fertility, and learn to control ourselves.Only one caveat: As a Catholic, even \\"barrier methods\\" are forbidden. The author noted that one could use barrier methods if temporarily unsure about fertility, or if one didn't want to abstain, but did say that pregnancy can obviously still result. Other Catholics and possibly other religions would have to ignore that bit of advice from the book, but other than that, this is a great resource.Update: I am now happily expecting our first child, who was conceived within seven cycles where my husband and I were applying the guidelines to become pregnant. That should satisfy any skeptics who might think that our three years without an accidental pregnancy was due to infertility! (And nobody who is fertile would be lucky enough to not get pregnant within three years using the outdated rhythm method.) Also, I knew almost from the first day that I was pregnant - because I knew exactly when my period was due. You don't need regular cycles to know this (I don't!), you only need to know which day you ovulated, which the symptoms will tell you. I was able to take my pregnancy test as soon as I was a day late. No wasted pregnancy tests, which is a good thing, as many of us \\"trying to conceive\\" women can attest to how expensive they are.Update: Unfortunately, I lost the first pregnancy to miscarriage. I was too emotionally devastated to want to get pregnant again right away, so I once again used my fertility signals to avoid pregnancy until I wanted to try again. We then got pregnant again when we wanted to, because we knew when we were most fertile. (This baby was born healthy and is now a very happy 9 week old boy). That's the great thing about this method: it's totally reversible. If you take the pill or use depo, you usually have to wait for months to over a year before fertility returns. With this method, you can decide each month whether you want to keep avoiding, or whether you want to start trying. Also, you can avoid using the pill while breastfeeding to avoid passing potentially harmful hormones to your baby."},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"An excellent overview of human fertility cycles. Very concise and clear-cut, it can be read in one sitting. The charts provided in the back allow a woman to understand her own fertility. This was an invaluable tool for planning my own two pregnancies. I've also lent this book out to several friends who all conceived successfully after reading it. I recommend it highly to anyone trying to make a baby!"},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"This easy-to-read book tells women, step-by-step, how to understand and chart our body's signals to figure out when we can and cannot get pregnant. This is a non-religious approach to natural family planning, and includes instructions for using the method with a condom or diaphragm.Women can also use this book to figure out the best time to conceive. Other side benefits include: a better understanding of mood swings and other physical and emotional changes that accompany our menstrual cycle; and heightened awareness of abnormalities in our cycle.The simple writing style and plethora of pictures and diagrams make this a fun, interesting, and very useful book."},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"I recommended this book to a good friend of mine who'd been struggling to conceive (she has a very irregular cycle); it worked for her and has since worked for several of her friends, too. Interestingly enough, a friend recommended the book to me in the first place, as well!The information is basic, and the author doesn't write in a complicated manner. I think someone with a sixth-grade education could read the book and use it effectively. Which is good - regardless of our educational backgrounds, I think every woman should know how her body works. There are more 'complex' versions out there, and classes etc. as well - which can also be helpful in addition to this book. But the single most helpful option I found, was Winstein's book. I continue to recommend it to friends who are struggling to get pregnant, and to friends who are looking for other options for family planning.I used the book for natural family planning, so that I did not have to use chemical or artificial birth control options; when we were ready to start a family, we succeeded the very first month.I have every confidence that this book will be informative, regardless of whether the purchaser is hoping to avoid or embrace pregnancy. I think Winstein had to walk a fine line while writing this book, in terms of religious issues etc. and managed to do so in a way which allowed her book to be unbiased, open, and helpful regardless of what the readers' backgrounds or goals might be."},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"This book is so well written and explains very clearly through detailed description and diagrams everything you need to know about mucous. Sounds odd, but if she didn't have such good diagrams I don't know if I would have quite understood what she meant. For the first time in my 35+ years I am understanding my body better than ever and YES, I can actually tell when I'm ovulating now, simply through tracking changes in the mucous as the author recommends. I definitely recommend this book to women who both want or do NOT want to conceive.June 2004 UPDATE: I'm pregnant now for the 2nd time - unfortunately I miscarried in February. I conceived both times in months that I was careful to follow the fertility signals especially the physical signs of ovulation (i.e \\"strings\\" - read the book, you'll know what I mean!) I'm a believer!"},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"I had already gone through the very tedious process of studying NFP from the huge study manual in order to learn about my fertility signals. I ended up adapting the information I had gathered from the huge behemoth NFP manual and several other NFP resources and coming up with what worked best for me. It turns out I was using the Fetility Awareness Method (which this book teaches) without even knowing it. If only I had found this simple little volume first!! :) It is a great way to review and has simple drawings to help certain things stick in your mind. My husband and I used FAM for 9 months to avoid pregnancy, and then used it to achieve pregnancy in only 2 cycles. We are now 7 months pregnant. I would highly recommend this volume to anyone who cannot afford to take an NFP course outside the home and doesn't have the wherewithall the read the several hundred page NFP study manual."},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"This book is a very simple, concise, easy-to-read explaination of Natural Family Planning. It includes the \\"how-to\\" of using both temperature and mucus symptoms to avoid or achieve pregnancy, as well as the cervical position information. I love that it also explains the hormones going on at each phase of the female cycle to help the reader understand WHY these symptoms are happening! I use it as a quick reference instead of dragging out my big Art of Natural Family Planning book from the Couple to Couple League. It also includes brief information about charting your signals during breastfeeding, and information about some common infertility problems. I really like the added information about \\"Regulating Cycles With Light\\" and \\"Choosing Your Baby's Sex\\". I still think everyone should have the Art of NFP in their library, but this is a great reference for every-day use!"},{"Title":"Your Fertility Signals: Using Them to Achieve or Avoid Pregnancy Naturally","review":"I found this book extremely informative.

We recently completed our fourth month of pregnancy free naturally!"},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"I enjoyed it tremendously. Normally it takes me two weeks to read a book, but this one took two days. I couldn't put it down, couldn't wait to see what would happen next to Miles/Jim. And as the novel went one, as the pressure built on what was going to happen, how would he get out of this, short of faking his own death, I became more and more fascinated with the transformation in his character, in his desires, his thoughts, his hopes, his fears. In the beginning he is running. Running from the vulgarities of his past, from his family, his broken home, a father who never really cared for him (&quot;Are you stupid, Smiles?&quot;), a girlfriend who left him, a daughter he at least realizes he will probably never know. But as we move through the events of the story, as Miles/Jim is confronted with the grim and harsh realizes of humanity, the depravity existing in the rest of the world, he comes to realize that his petty issues are nothing, and most certainly not worth lying over, not worth losing his own identity completely over. And in the end, of course, he discovers that the truth is the only thing that can set him free.As for identity, a major theme throughout, Miles wants to be One Of The Guys, until he finds out truly what that means, that being OOTG only subserviates himself to the reign of another's personality, another's whims and fancies. But Miles's identity is lost throughout the novel to most of the other characters, including himself. He becomes the chaplain, better, in many ways, than the real one, better than the other chaplains, for besides the fact that he is faking he does show genuine concern for the well being of those seeking his counsel. Kruger is a confused young man who wants to be both honest and forthright, but also OOTG, and he cannot control, in the end, the desires that ultimately control him, that define him. He cannot forget who and what he really is. His identity crisis comes in fighting his nature, and he seems able to only fully accept himself when he meets the equally confused Robin, who wants to defy her identity by being the alluring seductress, and she discovers there may be something to be said for discretion.I don't want to write a thesis here, so let me just conclude by saying this book was thoroughly entertaining and well written. I look forward to reading his next one."},{"Title":"One of the Guys","review":"... Not. But this book is fun. As an Army vet, I found that the depiction of military life was compelling and accurate; the way in which the purity of action, in terms of achieving the military goals, mixes with the vulgarity of desire, in this case the impending good times promised by the Phillipines, results in good comic effect. Young never lets his characters lapse into caricature, however, which is a grace not often found in picaresque writing.The regularity of the prose, awfully plain at times, is an interesting attribute of the book. It's the talk of the twelve-step program, the desperate grab for common nouns and regular activity in the hopes that the world will start making sense. That Miles is able to do so in the topsy-turvy world of acronyms, parties and belligerent cpo's is all the more admirable."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],B={key:0},W={key:1};function q(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",W,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",B,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const G=d(x,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-d8d8600e"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/36.md","filePath":"quotesmag/36.md"}'),P={name:"quotesmag/36.md"},L=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(G)]))}});export{R as __pageData,L as default};
