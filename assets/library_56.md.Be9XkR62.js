How any human can endure what many illegal immigrants endure is shocking. I recommend this book for insight as well as inspiration to take action and eradicate ignorance.

I learned to appreciate the desperate position they were in. The author captures the humanity of the immigrants and the Border Patrol agents in this story. He incorporates the correct folklore and language used by both groups. Few people know why Border Patrol agents refer to illegal aliens as &#34;tonks.&#34; It is rare to find a book with such great prose that also incorporates the details with precise accuracy. The book should be required reading for high school or college students."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"I saw the author interviewed by Bill Moyers and decided to read this disturbing story.

Americans need to read this book."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"The compelling true story of a group of Mexicans who attempted to cross the desert into the United State. The book traces the failed journey of men who leave Mexico with hopes of making enough money in the US to purchase a house in Mexico for their families and to then return to their families. It is the story of hope and courage and greed and endurance and peril."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Urrea sheds light on the numbers and figures we hear about by not only reliving their passage but also by naming them and making the victims matter. That to be too extreme in either side is unproductive and fruitless in this debate of Immigration reform. I will never forget the Yuma victims."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"This is a book I would not have chosen to read and in fact the first few pages confirmed my fear it would be a depressing book about a depressing subject. I was wrong. The book had been chosen by my book group so I had to persist. Soon the book became surprisingly compelling even though the gruesome end was never in doubt. The author brilliantly tells the true story of a group of men who died (or nearly died) in the Arizona desert in May 2001.Luis Alberto Urrea does so by revealing meaningful details about all the people in this tragic event. He displays the diverse backgrounds of the Mexicans crossing the border--giving a visceral understanding or where they were actually and metaphorically coming from. The book might have stopped there with an emotional story of their pain and suffering and their appalling ignorance of the desert (many of the men had come from the lush wet tropics and had no idea of the importance of simple things like wearing a hat or not wearing black pants). But, to his credit, the author goes beyond that and presents background on all the players: the border patrol, the local residents who are plagued by problems resulting from people walking across the border, and the others involved in this dangerous and expensive activity. In sometimes poetic phrases we learn about the desert, the heat, stages of death by heat and thirst. The result is a realization of the true tragic quality of the illegal immigration problem. Everyone involved in this story labored under misconceptions or gross ignorance that led to a terrible outcome. Worse, there seems no clear path toward stopping or even tamping down the problem. All you can say after reading the book is you have a much better grasp of the issues facing the parties near the border. That may not be enough, but it is something worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"I was not fond of the way the first 20-30 pages of the book were written. Not great, dry and hard to get in to. Some of the short stories were good but I felt like I had to just plow through the book to get anywhere with it. Not my kind of read."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Urrea is unflinching in his research that puts a human face on the tragedy of Mexican immigration. This is a fair minded account of the forces that impel Mexican migration to El Norte as well as the efforts of the Border protection forces in both upholding law and their dedication to rescue of the misled walkers seeking their way through the harsh and searingly hot Arizona deserts and mountains. Both sides are given a human face. The author's writing style is reminiscent of the novels of Mexican realism in the revolutionary era such as Azuela's, \\"The Underdogs.\\" That the Arizona Legislature sought to inhibit reading of this book in public schools by cutting back on Hispanic studies programs is a testament to the value of this book worthy of its being considered a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. I highly recommend the book, a thoroughly researched, well written and compelling story."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"the book was ALMOST a 5 star book for me. A great read, written by an amazing author. I enjoyed 100% of this book up until the very end, where the nonfiction turns into the author's personal agenda. instant book killer if you ask me."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"I was concerned to hear that this book has been removed from the Texas School System. The negative reviews or comments about The Devil's Highway: A True Story are more gratuitous than comments which move our country's story forward. My Great Grandparents on both sides came here from Germany. I want to thank the Mexican people for allowing me to visit and live in the territory that was part of their country. I am not threatened by recognizing the work and contributions of other cultures. I have written to the Maryland State Board of Education as well as my local school board to consider using this book as part of a larger discussion which includes diverse views but emphasizes critical thinking."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Urrea delivers a moving novel based on the true story of the Yuma 14, fourteen Mexicans (from a group of 26) that tried to cross the border and enter the US illegally through the Arizona desert and succumbed in the attempt. The author presents the facts efficiently and his conclusion follows: Mexicans trying to cross the border are human beings like everyone else that had the bad fortune of facing tough economic condition; they should be respected.The author describes the conditions and historic events that lead to the beginning of the illegal immigration into the US and draws a clear parallelism with our times, when there are several tasks in the US that Americans are reluctant to do, thus illegal immigrants are needed for this. When price changes in international markets adversely affected the Mexican economy and overpopulation became a problem, some Mexicans decided to come to the US. They ended up with a comfortable life, so when others found out, a growing interest in crossing the border developed.Organizations of coyotes were formed to provide supply for the growing demand, and the poor people seeking a better future became just a means to an end. These individuals in their attempts have to fight against the heat of the desert, thirst, exhaustion, &quot;la migra&quot; (Border Patrol) and the coyotes themselves. On top of this, the control at the border has intensified throughout the last years, so the groups seeking a new future have to go through more dangerous paths each time. In the case of the twenty-six Mexicans that are the center of this story, the point of entry was the Devil's Highway, a deadly desert in Arizona that has claimed numerous victims through the years.Urrea shows his outstanding knowledge of the topic in question and uses this in his descriptions with no holes barred. One of the most shocking passages of the book was the explanation of the different stages of death by heat, which go from Heat Stress to Heat Stroke. The realism and brutality of this account left me absolutely breathless. Overall, the quality of the novel is outstanding and even though it is a tough read at some points, in the end it is extremely satisfying and enlightening."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"\\"The Devil's Highway,\\" is a pretty good book. Urrea sees no sacred cows - unless discussing the poor individuals who dare to cross over to the U.S. The border landscape is murderous, and the \\"Coyotes\\" that lead the illegals across are predators and gangsters. It's all about money. Urrea does his best to give each of those who suffered through the 2001 ordeal (the Yuma 14 (those that died), or Wellton 26 (the entire party), take your pick), faces, lives, hopes. They are people, and not just rotting bodies found in the desert. Still, I get the sense that \\"The Devil's Highway,\\" is a bit padded. There are also a few inaccuracies (Department of Interior police as a separate body from the BLM? An inaccurate description of a Tarantino movie), which left feeling that Urrea was shooting from the hip. Given the subject matter, he can't help but hit his target (which is extended to both sides of the border), but when I see mistakes (even nitpicky ones), I wonder, whatever the book, what other ones am I missing? Further, Urrea's style will remind you of Hunter Thompson, or even James Ellroy. This is high-risk writing, that hooks a reader, but can also annoy when unnecessary slang is used. At its worst, it seems like the writer is more interested in being hip than telling the story. It's a high wire act. Urrea for the most part stays on that wire, but there were a few times where the slang gets to be annoying.But even with a slightly padded feel to it, it's the last twenty or so pages of the \\"Devil's Highway\\" that deliver the goods. Urrea could easily expand on those twenty pages and write a new book the current state of things Mexican - and American. There were some real revelations for me - such as Mexico losing jobs to China - just like everyone else, which of course contributes to the lure of going North. How illegal immigration contributes to suppressing wages in the U.S., which is why Industry just loves the current situation. The sheer violence (and weirdness) of the border: Mexican law enforcement crossing over in pursuits and shootouts; a very disturbing wave of what seems to be connected murders of women in Juarez (it's been going on for ten years!); and of course the deadly trek north, with Hope and Death sitting in the balance, while Money holds the scales."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Amazing book! I couldn't put it down and read it from cover to cover in one day. Urrea has a gift for language and he applies it here. This is the story of 26 men from Veracruz. Urrea could have recounted the story of how 14 of them died in the desert and left it at that. This would still be a book worth reading... but he went way beyond those confines. He took the story of those 26 men from Veracruz and put it in historical, cultural and geographical context. He opened a window onto other worlds and onto our own. He portrays the immigrants, the border patrol and even the coyote, without judgment. He allows the reader to come to her/his own conclusion. Powerful, poetic and unforgettable. I finished it and got back on line to order everything else he has published."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"&quot;Mr. President, tear down this wall.&quot;Some day, perhaps, an American president will have the courage -- or a Mexican president will have the honesty -- to go to the wall between Mexico and United States and demand its removal in the name of freedom.Until then, the Sonoran Desert will continue to be the site for hundreds of unbelievably agonizing deaths every year. Within the last 10 years, more people have died here than those who tried to cross the Berlin Wall. Until then, as Urrea makes abundantly clear, Mexicans will continue to create networks that in a few years will be the great criminal syndicates of the United States and Mexico.It's happened before. Prohibition was a great &quot;holier than thou&quot; movement, and it generated many vicious criminals. It took the courage of President Franklin Roosevelt to end its rampant hypocrisy. Some day, if Americans ever elect another president with the courage of Roosevelt, a border solution will be found.It's agonizing to be slowly baked to death in the sun. Thousands of desperate people risk it every year; this book tell of 14 who didn't make it in May 2001. The reporting is excellent, the writing is superb. Don't read it unless you have a strong stomach; the deaths of &quot;Los illegales&quot; and the pure greed of Mexicans who recruit and deliver then to the US is a gruesome story. (Keep in mind, this is also a major route for deadly drugs.)It took a man from Chicago to write this book. Few in Arizona, where people hire illegals with the casual unconcern of buying a drive-through taco, care about the human cost. Arizona cities actually run drive-by labour centers to facilitate the hiring of illegals by homeowners and business people. The media generally ignores desert deaths unless it is groups of a dozen or more; &quot;big&quot; news in Arizona is the opening of a new shopping center or the latest exploits of a Britney Spears.But then, who ever wrote a book exposing rum runners?John Steinbeck immortalized Okies in 'The Grapes of Wrath,&quot; but they had a cakewalk compared to what Mexicans now risk to get low wage US jobs. Urrea has done a superb job citing facts about one of the world's deadliest border crossings; read this book, and you'll cry in sorrow and rage at what people endure to reach the US.I've hiked the area where these men died; three hours without water, even in the cool (only 85 degrees F) winter, is enough to produce the first signs of dehydration. It's a tough, unforgiving, brutal land. Mistakes are seldom forgiven. Few, if any, Arizona writers know the desert well enough to describe it as accurately as Urrea. For most Arizonans, illegal aliens -- like federal spending -- makes their state cheap, easy and lazy.It took a man from &quot;the city of big shoulders&quot; to write this book. As you read it, keep in mind that a child or grandchild of any one of these migrants could well become another Urrea (provided they get out of Arizona). It's what America is all about, and it is why people will literally &quot;walk through Hell&quot; for days on end, even when they know the only job they'll ever get is scrubbing toilets.Read it, and you'll scream in anger, rage, sorrow and frustration. Of course, if you're from Arizona, where chain gangs are still policy and jail inmates are housed in surplus army tents during summers which easily reach 115 degrees, your only reaction will be, &quot;So what? That's the penalty for breaking the law.&quot;Maybe it's time to reconsider the Gadsden Purchase.Read it. This book will shake anyone's conscience.Read it. Learn what courage and greed mean in today's world."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Pulitzer Prize finalist, Luis Alberto Urrea, has written about the struggle people desperate enough to risk their lives crossing the Mexican/American border (Arizona) in search of a better life. The story itself is as old as the hills but this time, he paints a picture of the area so vividly, that if you've been anywhere in this region, you'll appreciate his descriptions even more. The people who abound, from many walks of life (and not only Mexicans), faced the oppressive heat and lack of water, not knowing where they'd land up, were brave and courageous. Urrea unfolds the account of the twenty-six men who ventured into the unknown and in search of a better life, and the \\"human hunt\\" that followed them. Their fears and dreams, the desert's own laws, and the stretch known as The Devil's Highway is all explained. Doggedly they pursue freedom but the price is extremely high, as the desert has obstacles few humans can survive. Urrea does a great job describing the officials whose job it is to patrol this particular area along the Arizona/Mexican border, as well as the brokers who help arrange these trips to freedom - usually at a high cost."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Luis Urrea only writes classics.As another writer who writes about the borderlands,I assure you ,he is the best purveyor of the human condition on the planet.You cannot read this,or any of his books, without changing your view of the world;changing your view of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; and without changing the contents of your own heart.In Luis Urrea's world there are few villains,few stereotypes and few &quot;blame-games&quot;.But there is a mountain of reality that every person in North America needs to consider----what worlds,political and economic, have we created that push humans into impossible journeys,folly,even death,just to earn enough to eat and send their kids to school? What borders have we imposed--both geopolitical and cultural, that separate human beings so completely as to compell the events of this book?And,for God's sake, what does any of us gain from it? The Devil's highway is about the desperate saga of a group of poor Mexican immigrants....and it is about all the rest of us who perceive ourselves as &quot;not part of the problem&quot;. The US/Mexico border has become a stake through the heart of humanity.No one intended it that way,but it pierces the hearts of millions just the same.This is a book that every high school and college kid in America should be assigned.Period."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Luis Alberto Urrea earned the moniker \\"the Voice of the Border\\" through his unflinching portrayals of life in the slums of Tijuana in his books Across the Wire and By the Lake of the Sleeping Children. In his latest and best effort yet, the Devil's Highway, he chronicles the tragic voyage of the \\"Yuma 14\\" -- the fourteen illegal Mexican immigrants who perished in the blistering heat of the Cabeza Prieta desert in an ill-fated attempt to enter the United States. The goal of these pour souls was simply to earn enough money to feed their destitute families in their remote native Mexican villages.But the Devil's Highway is far more than just the account of what happened to these fourteen unfortunate walkers. Urrea also details the near-death experience of the surviving walkers, as well as the human smuggler who lost them in the desert. This coyote abandoned them in the baking sun after taking all of their money - in exchange for promises of water and an eventual rescue. Even in the case of the coyote, however, Urrea manages to write a heartfelt and impartial account of every player in the tragedy.In the course of the Devil's Highway, the stereotypes of the evil Migra are dashed when Border Patrol agents turn out to be humanitarian lifesavers, paying from their own pocket to help save walkers. The image of the opportunistic coyote is also defaced by the revelation that he is just a young man in love, making a modest wage in a very dangerous line of work.In the final analysis, it becomes obvious that every person involved in the tragedy is exactly that - a human being. If anyone is to blame for the tragedy, we are all to blame. It is in that sense that the ultimate finger of blame has to eventually point at the U.S. and Mexican governments. Their efforts to end the dilemma could be considered laughable, if not so disastrous: from the Mexican side there are signs telling walkers not to walk, and on the U.S. side there are preventive walls and fences that discourage them from crossing where it might actually be safe to do so. In order to make the passage, the immigrants are forced to traverse a hostile desert. Yet, as Urrea so successfully demonstrates, the two countries are in truth extraordinarily codependent.Through prose that reads like poetry, and reality that is shockingly surreal, Urrea puts the reader in middle of the arid barrenness that delineates the U.S.-Mexican border. More than only a physical divide, the border created the by heat and desiccation of the wasteland that separate the two countries is exposed to function as a symbol of all the imagined differences that separate us. With a passion that permeates every word of the story, Urrea illustrates that the only place that none of us belongs is to be lost along the Devil's Highway. \\"In the desert, we are all illegal aliens.\\"The Devil's Highway is essential reading for socio-political relevance, passion, compassion, imagery, and the sheer beauty of its prose. It is also unquestionably Luis Alberto Urrea's crowning achievement - a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"This is as good as it gets if you want a short but comprehensive examination of the issues surrounding our porous border with Mexico. All viewpoints are represented, and with surprisingly little bias on the part of the author. As a Mexican American, Urrea admits to an initial bias against the Border Patrol, or \\"Pinche Migra.\\" His investigation changed his mind, and he presents them in a favorable light.Urrea uses one well-publicized 2001 tragedy to illustrate the complexities and absurdities of illegal border crossings and their consequences. He follows a group of 26 Mexican men from hopeful start to brutal finish as they made their way through the process of illegal entry into the U.S. He begins with each man as an individual -- deciding to come to America, collecting the money to pay the smugglers (Coyotes), and traveling to the meeting place.From then on we witness their collective ordeal in the desert corridor known as The Devil's Highway. The personal touch is effective here, so we see each man with a name, a family, a history, and a specific dream or purpose for coming to America.Fourteen of the men died, and the other twelve came close to death, surviving only due to the quick rescue from the Border Patrol once they were discovered. Sadly, their story is not unique. It's only one well-documented example of the hundreds of Mexican people who die in that desert every year after having been lied to and then abandoned by the Coyotes. Some of them who cannot pay a lot of money are even transported in car trunks or tied to engine blocks, and then die from the heat.Urrea's description of the physiological breakdown of the human body in that harsh desert with no water is especially distressing. The journey of the men through the six stages of \\"heat death\\" will make you understand why the men who work for the Border Patrol have paid out of their own pockets to erect $6,000 lifesaving towers. Walkers in trouble can press a red button and the Border Patrol will arrive within one hour to rescue them. And so the bad guys, the \\"Pinche Migra\\" so greatly feared by illegal entrants, sometimes turn out to be the saviors.This is not a book about presenting solutions, but about making people aware of the difficulties extending so far beyond immigration policy. In the Aftermath section, Urrea addresses the political, financial, and humanitarian aspects of the problem, with all sides fairly represented. He especially highlights the absurdity of the money spent on rescue efforts, medical care, and body recovery -- money that could be much better spent to improve life in Mexican villages.To his credit, the author doesn't claim to have answers, but he provides a compelling understanding of the problem, which is a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Not being a avid reader ,if a book doesn't interest me in the first few pages I put it away. This certainly was not such a book. Written by a Mexican American I expected the story to be slanted toward anti immigration only to find a balanced view of the Border situation from the prospective of those desperate to make a better life for their familys, to the Border Patrol and the almost impossible job before them. Two things that stand out are the compassion of the Border Patrol and how the immigrants are so often preyed upon by their own people. A must read before making a judgement about our border situation and the people who live {and die} there."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Luis Alberto Urrea's read is riveting - and a superb blend of research, fact and \\"in the moment narrative\\" as you live the story of these border crossers' lives, dreams and disasters. You'll learn more about the real issues facing peoples' lives and the complicated costs, politics, heartaches and realities of the US border and its management - and its implications for immigrants - illegal, legal or otherwise. Written in short segments and so well put together - Urrea's book is simply terrific. I'd also recommend Tommy Lee Jones' recent movie - The Three Burials...\\" on the same topic - slightly different plot but similarly engaging in its content and depth."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Engrossing and captivating.Came across an interview with Mr. Urrea on I believe PBS and his story was really compelling (born to a Mexican father and Irish American mother in Mexico, passing for white and yet bullied as an outsider after moving to California and straddling two cultures).After his accounts of meeting garbage pickers and missionaries who've devoted their lives to helping them, I thought I'd pick up this justifiably well-received book.The descriptions of the western deserts are Cormac McCarthy-esque. The profiles of the border patrol agents are riveting and the accounts of the crossings are shocking and won't soon be forgotten.\\"Guias (guides) now give their walkers cocaine to make them walk faster and longer. Of course, cocaine helps their hearts explode, too. If the guia has been paid in advance, he doesn't care if you get to your toilet scrubbing job or not. It's easier for him, frankly, if you drop and return to dust in the middle of the Devil's highway.

The most startling was of the water level in the river after it leaves California and flows into Mexico just west of San Luis. Having crossed this river by bus and seeing this trickle of water first hand, it was as though I was travelling the road again. No wonder the Mexicans have to cross the US/Mexico border by bus each day to work in vegetable fields. There is not enough water on the Mexico side to wet the rocks! Should the Canadian government dam the waters of their rivers before they cross the US/Canada border I wonder what would be done?A very moving story of two governments that are not dealing with the basic problem of poverty and dignity of people.

In fact, I camped at Organ Pipe twice in late 2000, unaware of the tragedy that happened less than 20 miles or so from me just 7 months prior.It is a beautiful, rugged landscape and as deadly and as physically imposing as Urrea describes in the book. Having seen the Border Patrol outposts, the caravans of green-stripped vehicles racing up and down the highways, hand-cuffed crossers sitting in the gravel along the side of the road to Lukeville, and even a ten-speed bike stashed beneath a dead cholla for future use, I know a bit of what these desperate walkers were up against. And I can even sympathize with the coyote who had trouble finding his way through the low mountains that all look the same, and all look as nasty as the others.Its sad that we as Americans, the wealthiest people in the world, the people who have \\"more\\" of just about everything than any other people on the planet, can not find some way to accommodate or at least deal with these desperate crossers other than to force them into the desolate places along our southern border.They don't want to steal, they don't want to kill, they don't want to \\"take back their country!!\\" They just want a means to a better life for themselves, and more importantly in just about every case, their families.This book hit home. Urrea did a masterful job of bringing home the reality of this event, even to someone who is already familiar with the territory. And he did just as masterful a job of bringing these walkers to life, of helping me understand who they were, what they were about, and why they would risk everything to help their families back home.I had heard of this book a long time ago, and I wanted to read it. But it got lost in the giant stack of books I \\"need to read.\\" However, I was introduced to Luis while watching an interview by Bill Moyers on Moyers & Company.

This is in my top-five of all time. Well written. Great research. Easy to read. Compelling story. Read it."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"This is a distinctive case study of a politically charged, ambiguous border-crossing incident... one that is almost rendered coherent by the author, thanks to his impassioned reportage (you can almost see his tongue hanging out). The book is timely and entertaining and emotional, and undeniably instructive for anyone who wrestles morally with immigration issues. There is no shortage of astonishing anecdotes, most of which I even believe.Despite these positive indicators, it's not a very good book. It would be a good 8,000-word article for Harper's, but as a 200+ page book it is severely padded. The verifiable facts are fairly thin, and the author's attempts to flesh them out (or obscure where they are thin) makes the book's pacing jerky and weird. The author is not sure whether to write in 'objective prose' or in 'native vernacular': the result makes for some laughable phrases (picture your great-grandmother asking you about your iPod). And while there are epiphanies to be had in stray sentences and paragraphs, and lots of strong opinions throughout, there is no concrete, consistent perspective to take from this book, and it's not clear that this author is suited to this style of writing. Which is a shame, considering the potential of its subject. I'm glad to have read about this incident, which deserves a better tour guide."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"This is a story that needed to be told. It is important that people learn what it is like to cross the border in the desert regions of Arizona and New Mexico. Too many Americans make assumptions about illegal immigration that could be dispelled by the story of the so-called Yuma 14. My problem isn't with the story being told, it is with the way the story is told. I cannot stand Urrea's writing style. I find it to be disjointed and distracting. He tells the story of the many people involved in the case of the Yuma 14, but it is a non-linear narrative. In addition to the structure of the writing, I think his vocabulary was a little distracting. I didn't need the incredibly graphic and often visceral descriptions Urrea utilizes. I'm sure his intention was to shock the reader and to really drive home the reality of what is being read. It came off a little too over-the-top for my taste.I think there are other authors who handle the subject matter better. The writing style was just too distracting for me to be able to give it a higher review. However, I believe there are certainly others who will not find it problematic at all."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"Touching story about everyday life at the border."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"When picking up the Devil's Highway by Luis Alberto Urrea, be forewarned: this is not the story of 26 men who walked into the desert and fought futilely against death that it is made out to be - it is a ramble about illegal immigrants and the Arizona desert which just happens to contain a section about the Yuma 14/Wellton 26 and their disastrous encounter with the Devil's Highway area of that desert. Many of the 26 men walking across the desert - the supposed main characters - are not introduced by name and backstory until seven-page-long Chapter 11 - more than halfway through the book. Some of the characters don't even get that much - some merit only a single reference at their death. One comes away at the end feeling as one knows more about the recruiter Don Moi, Mendez the Coyote guide, and definitely Rita Vargas, the Mexican consulate agent who oversaw the aftermath (why does so much concentrate on her in particular, one has to wonder?) than 90% of the actual walkers.The walkers' real story doesn't even seem to begin until Part Three of the book's four sections - maybe the end of Part Two. Up to that point (and even past it) the book's narrative seems to leap aimlessly around and spends pages upon pages of its own aimless wandering in the desert - entire passages are taken up by such irrelevant (and some just downright weird) topics and stories as folkloric creatures and spirits said to reside in the Mexican desert, Mexican rap, religion in Sonoita, campers dying in the desert, the medical benefits of urine, statistics, and the shooting of a Border Patrol. The narrative seems to spend an excessive amount of time on things that leave the reader asking \\"And the relevance to the story was...?\\" Even a riveting passage about the stages of hyperthermia seemed out of place jammed in the middle of the Wellton 26's walk and between three pages of relating other terrible but unrelated desert deaths and, \\"And the men headed deeper into the desert.\\" In addition, at least twenty pages at the end of the book, after the end of the survivors' story, is dedicated to touting numbers on illegal immigrants immediately after Urrea claims that the situation isn't a game of numbers but a story of the heart.Sections of the story, in brief, have other things jammed into and in between them and lose their power even when written well, such as in the excessive but powerful descriptions of the desert. Quotes, too, are thrust in without adequate lead-ins and some even without relevance. The result is a story that is padded with irrelevant sidetracks and, even worse, has very little if any flow, leaving it confusing and certainly not clear-cut or efficient; the majority of it should make any sensible editor (or reader) cringe at the hack-job.In addition, the book seems to attempt to hide a bias at first, but it inevitably leaks through. Although considerable poking at gringos and American \\"Yanquis\\" (Yankees) is to be expected, one section states: \\"White Europeans conceived of and launched [immigration northward] just as white Europeans inhabiting the United States today bemoan it.\\" Urrea has seemingly forgotten that most Mexicans are as much Europeans through Spanish conquistador blood as Americans are European. In addition, minute racial prods can be found at Arabs, Salvadorans, Native Americans, the Chinese, and at one point an African American is referred to as \\"exotic.\\" A bias especially comes through in the treatment of Border Patrol agents. Although in the afterword Urrea says that he wanted to introduce, \\"The Border Patrol agent - a law enforcement officer who is disrespected and demeaned\\" he still seems to blame them, and throughout the book, the Border Patrol is referred to as \\"la Pinche Migra\\" - the damned Border Patrol - and once even as \\"Trailer Trash.\\" Urrea seems to echo an opinion quoted in the book, \\"America was to blame!\\" and his bias becomes evident."},{"Title":"The Devil's Highway","review":"As a resident who has lived in Yuma, Arizona for the past nine years and read the daily paper and watched the nightly news giving scant details about one or two bodies found here or there, presumed to be those of \\"illegals\\" -- Urrea brings to the reader the faces and lives of the human beings behind the numbers. I often think of the deceased that are briefly mentioned in these news blurbs and wonder where they came from, whom they have left behind and what dreams of theirs did the desert kill? And is the desert what really killed them? Or was it some errant Border Patrol agent or a frustrated and pissed off Minuteman? Just what are they so pissed about, anyhow?Regarding the immigrants and their motivations for leaving their beloved behind for the north, Urrea certainly answered some of my questions. No, America, they are not all criminals, drug runners or people out to get your top jobs! They just want to make enough to feed their families and if they're lucky, save enough to buy a little building material for a house or to start up a small business. I have yet to hear any of my friends or acquaintances get excited about applying for jobs in agriculture or plucking chickens!This book should be recommended reading for our government leaders, the INS, and ALL law enforcement agencies - they might just be able to figure out a plan for immigration reform! Just be sure to read the interview of Mr. Urrea in the Reading Group Guide at the end of the book -- the numbers (profits) will amaze you. As this book painfully demonstrates, fences are not going to do anything but make death in the desert an even more certain fate for crossers.Thank you, Mr. Urrea, for giving the world a clear and concise picture of what is really going on in our corner of the country and our part of the globe, for that matter.

I read the Windows 2000 Security Handbook (W2KSH) to learn how to advise clients on improving the survivability of their Windows 2000 platforms. Like its predecessor, Tom Sheldon's excellent &quot;Windows NT Security Handbook,&quot; W2KSH delivers practical content in a digestable format. I recommend Windows 2000 system administrators read and heed this book.Good operating system security books are thorough, educational, and honest; W2KSH is all three. The authors are not mindless Microsoft prophets -- consider this sample from page 501: &quot;It seems that Microsoft just does not get it when it comes to the need for robust auditing/logging of services... the logging configurations are totally inadequate.&quot; To deal with these and other deficiencies, W2KSH provides installation, configuration, and deployment recommendations. This advice, on topics like Active Directory, user and group management, and file systems, equips system administrators to survive hostile network environments.As an intrusion detector, I was most happy to read how the Microsoft security model operates, and what components present the greatest vulnerabilities. I appreciated explanations of system and discretionary access control lists, and how to effectively employ them. I learned Microsoft includes Web, FTP, SMTP, and NNTP features in Internet Information Service (IIS). I also became aware of best practices for secure deployment of a Microsoft infrastructure.W2KSH has a few problems. Like Microsoft products, its &quot;backwards compatibility&quot; revealed weaknesses. For example, some text was lifted directly from Shelton's earlier book, but necessary background material was omitted (see pages 86, 88-90, 148). This issue was awkward but minor. I also did not leave the book with a strong understanding of the different types of groups in Windows 2000. Such complexity is not the authors' fault. They show that the OS' dozens of options leaves plenty of room for misconfiguration, leading to compromise.If you're familiar with general security practices, skip Part I (TCP/IP, threats, countermeasures, and policies). I recommend the authors mention these topics briefly in the introduction and move the bulk to appendices. Start with Part II, and keep your highlighter handy. W2KSH gives balanced insight into the workings of Windows 2000, and helps system administrators and security personnel better understand the opportunities and liabilities of running this operating system."},{"Title":"Windows 2000 Security Handbook","review":"I've read many books on Windows NT and Windows 2000 security.

My comfort level with concepts of IPSec, PKI, EFS, threat types, auditing and firewalls has risen remarkably.

Heikal was the chief editor of Al Ahram during the time of Nasser and Sadat and a close confidant of both, and is authoritative enough to have been considered an official state spokesperson, at least up until Sadat's trip to Jerusalem. Indeed on several occasions he acted as a diplomatic envoy and negotiator. Provided one can read between the lines there is a great deal of information that one can extract from what is said, and from what is glossed over, provided one knows the history. As a rule, discount anything Heikal states about motive, particularly about the Jordanian monarchy or rival Arab leaders, whom he tends to denigrate, or about Nasser whom he tends to aggrandize.The book is essentially a political history with autobiographical overtones. Much of the material seems to be extracted from Heikal's personal notes and there are extremely few proper references to outside sources, nor is there a bibliography. Also he infers motivations based on his own preconceptions again largely without reference or justification. On the other hand he does let slip a number of intriguing details, such as Nasser's intent to carry out a long term war of attrition against Israel, the fact that on the eve of Nasser's death Egypt had 850,000 troops massed on the edge of the Suez canal waiting for orders to attack (pp161); that there was a breakdown of relations between Egypt and Syria during the Yom Kippur War (Sadat referred to Assad as \\"my Mussolini\\" - wholly inappropriate, jokes Heikal, as this would cast Sadat as Hitler - pp188) and that the 1977 miniwar with Libya, poorly thought out, was basically about seizing Libya's oil to alleviate Egypt's debt. We also learn that Egypt as a \\"frontline state\\" received between $16-$22B dollars worth of aid from oil rich Arab nations after the YK war as compensation for their losses, which dwarved the amount given by the US after Camp David, however the $ \\"disappeared\\" in bad business investments (pp245). Jordan, Syria and the PLO received massive funds as well, paid for by the rest of the world in the run up of the price of oil resulting from the Arab oil cartels' embargo using the oil weapon in 1973.We learn a lot about the Arab politics. The first theme of the book is on a near absolute taboo in the Arab world against even talking with the Israelis, and Heikal introduces a stream of at least a dozen or so prominent individuals including 5 Prime Ministers who were assassinated either for talking with Israel or even just talking about talking with Israel. Even foreign emissaries who had an Israeli stamp on their passport were barred from entering Arab countries. And, as promised in the title, there is ample discussion of \\"secret\\" negotiations. Rather than risking talking directly there were a number of approaches through Europeans, Soviets, the Socialist International (both Israel and many Arab states were members), journalists interested in becoming go-betweens and through European and American Jews. Early on it is suggested that Heikal contact Albert Einstein, a friend of Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion. Einstein in turn offers to be a go between, which Nasser, fearing the negative consequences turns down. (pp96) There's an amusing misunderstanding where an Egyptian agent tries to recruit an Israeli attach&eacute;, whereas the attach&eacute; thinks he's made a diplomatic contact, the whole affair coming to a stop when the agent's expense account was examined and the value of the information that the attach&eacute; provided proved to have little value.The middle part of the book emphasizes Sadat's shift away from Soviet dependency towards the US. In Sadat's estimation the Israelis were more likely to keep an agreement if it were endorsed by the Stars and Stripes rather than the weakening Hammer and Sickle. He also resented the presence of Soviet military advisers that made Egypt, ostensibly a leader in the Arab world, appear to be a client state. Sadat, who deeply loved his nation, felt that after not being defeated during the Yom Kippur war his major goals had been achieved, that of restoring Egypt's leadership position in the region, and establishing respect for Sadat as a leader, so that Sadat could turn his attention inward to the problems of Egypt.The last 200 pages concern the emergence of the PLO and the uneasy relationship that it had with rest of the Arab world. The Palestinian blunder of supporting Saddam Hussein had major repercussions and as a result Arafat's funding from the Saudis and the Gulf States was cut off. While sympathetic to the Palestinians Heikal sees Arafat as an opportunist and a bumbler, incapable of statecraft. He's highly critical of the PLO, an organization that Egypt created back in '64, and related/rival organizations such as the PFLP as to a large extent they had become guns for hire and arms dealers. Though when the Libyan's asked PLO intelligence chief Abu Iyad to send a hit team to assassinate a former Libyan Minister of the Interior he complained to Qaddafi and refused. (pp339) There is also an excellent description of the evolution of the Oslo agreements.From a historical perspective I enjoyed it because it did hilite some of the differences between a western and a Middle Eastern point of view. One can more fully understand the Arabs dedicated sense of humiliation at being defeated by Israel in '48 and '67, then has Sadat turn the idea around in '73 with a face saving apologetic that it was only American aid to the Israelis that prevented them from being defeated, and that he did not wish to humiliate the Israelis in turn. Says Sadat: \\"Egypt wishes to make clear it that it does not seek to humiliate Israel, because Egypt has tasted what humiliation is.\\" (pp196) Heikal also points what he considers to be fundamental differences in Arab vs. Israeli styles of negotiations, though I don't think he appreciates that the Israelis understand this as well.As other reviewers have rightly noted, there is a lot of depth and layering here, and if one looks close enough one finds that these go beyond the intentions of the author. In the final analysis, what we get is an unapologetic account of Arab rivalries and POVs, and an understanding of the failures that led to the death of pan-Arabism. Inshallah we can learn from our mistakes and find a better path."},{"Title":"Secret Channels: The Inside Story of Arab-Israeli Peace Negotiations","review":"Everyone with a slight interest in MidEast history and the Arab-Israelis conflict should read it. First part is a mine of historical information about what went-on behind the scenes. The palestinian tragedy and exodus was more a result of dis-unity between the Arabs than supremacy of the Israelis.While now everyone is refusing to nationalise the palestinian refugees, in the early 50's this was offered in exchange for extra land captured on different fronts.

Warren, a doctor who prescribes \\"clean\\" heroin and provides a safe and sterile environment for users to inject, has developed a close relationship with drug addicts, and knows more about the ins-and-outs of the heroin trade than most people. Hellier wants the trade smashed at any expense, and offers Warren unlimited finances to use his insider knowledge against a major international drug ring. Initially reluctant, Warren is worn down by professional interest and personal circumstances, and assembles a rag-bag team of friends and specialists to travel to the Middle East. Through a combination of deceit and violence, can this eclectic bunch infiltrate and bring down the drug ring, and destroy the heroin supply at its source?I am a huge fan of Desmond Bagley's work (see my other mostly positive reviews of his books on Amazon), but 'The Spoilers' is easily his worst book, by a considerable margin. The fundamental problem with this book is that the plot just requires too much suspension of disbelief. The idea that an ordinary doctor, no matter how sympathetic to addicts, would have knowledge that the most well-resourced international police forces wouldn't is hard to accept for a start. But even allowing this, we then have Warren turning into a quasi James Bond character, travelling to some of the most dangerous corners of the Middle East, blowing up drug factories, fighting pitched battles in caves, and so on. This is an ordinary doctor, remember, not some ex-Special Forces mercenary who dabbles in medicine in his spare time. It's just not believable, even accepting that your standards for realism aren't high in an adventure thriller. When Warren himself notes over and over how \\"ridiculous\\" it all seems, you know there's a problem. And the motivation for many of the other protagonists is pretty weak; they tag along basically because Warren asks them to.The parts of the book that focus on Abbot and Parker's attempts to infiltrate the organisation are better, however. This sort of clever scheming and manipulation is much more like what we'd expect from Warren, using brains and guile instead of brawn. Some of the baddies such as femme fatale Jeanette Delorme are interesting, and these parts of the book allow the antagonists to be fleshed out and developed a bit. If 'The Spoilers' had been based around this sort of strategy, and not on Warren pulling a Rambo, it would have been a much stronger and more interesting book.Unfortunately, for the most part, you just can't really believe Warren doing all the things he does, and so you can't really get into the book. You just read with increasing frustration and lack of interest as the book becomes more and more over-the-top and silly. 'The Spoilers' is definitely not the place for newcomers to start; if I'd read this one first, I probably would never have given Bagley a second chance. If you're a fan, you'll eventually get around to reading this, but be aware that this is quite clearly his weakest and least interesting book."},{"Title":"The spoilers","review":"Old-fashioned action thriller with one redeeming feature - a character sharing the same name as me!

I currently live in the windy city and it was fun to read the street locations, etc. and know that they did in fact exist and were accurate in their descriptions. I am usually not a fan of the author that tells the story by jumping from one character's view to another character's view but in this case it really works. You understand the psyche of the story teller of the moment and Hugh does an excellent job of tying one lead in to another. In other words you are never left hanging as to why he went from one point of view to another. That's usually where the some author's go wrong when trying to tell a story from multiple viewpoints.If I had a complaint, mind you this is real small, it's that I would have liked a few more pages devoted to the cop Larry Cole. I suspect Hugh didn't give him more pages because he himself is a cop.You'll find yourself sympathizing with Reggie,one of the main characters, his upbringing with his grandmother and uncle Ernst and then what the FBI does to him when all he wanted to be was a law abiding cop. Even though Hugh is busy telling you the story straight out you keep second guessing him and you end up surprised in the end. Although Hugh can be forgiven his slight digression of giving away who Reggie's father was so early in the book.Speaking as one who is easily bored I have to say at every opportunity I had I would pick up this book to read it and managed to finish it in a couple of days. I can't wait to get to his other books."},{"Title":"Chicago Blues","review":"In Chicago Blues, Hugh Holton weaves an intricate tale of murder and mayheml in the Windy City, and abroad. With as many as 5 plots being simultaneously told, he keeps you on the edge of your seat. The Characters are so real you can actually hear, see, and smell them, you will be through with this book before you know it. If words were music, his book would be a melody to your eyes!!! Finally someone has been able to harness my attention. Thank you Mr. Holton"},{"Title":"Chicago Blues","review":"The authors police background certainly lends considerable authenticity to this interesting novel. There are many unusual twists in the story that keep the reader absorbed in the various plots. The book really picks up steam as you progress. Reggie develops into a fascinating character."},{"Title":"Chicago Blues","review":"Hugh Holton is a Chicago police officer who uses a vivid imaginationand a good sense of story telling to weave some prettydifferent mysteries set in a realistic Chicago background.While it is generally helpful to have read Presumed Dead andWindy City, it is not a requirement.One of the most intriguing characters on the side of law and order isthe Master of Deception and Disguise. Read the book and seewhat I mean.Larry Cole is truly at his best in this book. I look forwardto reading Hugh's next."},{"Title":"Most Secret","review":"I've read it many, many times. The characters are very believable (you will feel as though you have met people like them), and the suspense buildup is managed brilliantly. The ending, though poignant, is superb.About as good a war tale as you can get -- the plot is fast-paced, always developing. No wasted words. This book proves that good war tales can be told without lasping into profanity and gore -- neither of which are used by Shute.As with other Shute books, it is written from the viewpoint of a detached observer to the main tale -- a technique he has used rather well in other books.Read _Most Secret_ once and I guarantee you will never look upon fishing boats or Worcester Sauce in quite the same way."},{"Title":"Most Secret","review":"This is a war time novel that I had not read before. I have been reading Neville Shute's novels for many years but had missed this one. It is excellent. The story is told in the same way he did \\"A Town Like Aliceand \\"No Highway.\\" He is the outsider looking at the characters from his passive role as observer. In the novel, the narrator is an older naval officer who becomes involved in a Special Operations action in Brittany. The other characters are young men and women and their lives and relationships are a large part of the story. This is extremely well done. One of them, a young industrial chemist, is similar to the character in \\"No Highway.\\" He is totally alone and shrinks from contact with girls as he is certain he will mess it up. Another character grows up with the young woman who will become his wife. One of the most interesting, Charles Simon, is born British but lives almost his entire life in France except for his schooling. He, on an impulse, volunteers to be a British officer when a commando raid happens to find him at a seaside cafe during a raid. His character and the circumstances remind me of the Helen MacInnes novelAssignment in Brittany. The Bretons are fiercely independent and resisted the Germans more than most in 1940 France. They are still quite proud of their heritage, as I learned two summers ago when I inadvertently referred to a small hotel in Brittany as being Norman. I was firmly corrected. The adventure is good, although a bit bloodthirsty for some so many years after the war. The best part is the character development, which has always been the best feature of Neville Shute's novels."},{"Title":"Most Secret","review":"Nevil Shute is one of my favorite writers. Although he's best known for two fine novels --A Town Like AliceandOn the Beach-- he produced a number of other gems during his prolific career. Most Secret is one of them.War plays a role, large or small, in many of Shute's novels. Most Secret was first published in 1945; the action begins in 1941. Bombs are raining down on London and England is fully engaged in the war. Three of the four main characters are in the Royal Navy. They devise and carry out an ingenious plan to attack a German ship off the coast of France. But while Most Secret can be accurately categorized as a war story, it's much more than that. Shute is one of the few writers who successfully blended character-oriented fiction with a plot-driven story. Ultimately, he wrote about people; not just their actions, but the impact those actions had on their lives. War has tragic consequences; death and sorrow are usually present in Shute's novels. It's difficult to read them with dry eyes. That's certainly true of Most Secret.I don't need to like the characters in order to enjoy a novel, but that's never an issue with Nevil Shute. He nearly always wrote about decent, likable people who cope with catastrophe with their dignity intact. Most Secret introduces the reader to Oliver Boden, the carefree son of a wool-spinner, who marries his childhood sweetheart shortly before joining the Navy, the natural outgrowth of his love of sailing. Boden teams with Michael Rhodes, a shy, awkward young chemist whose best friend before joining the Navy and falling in love with a Leading Wren is a misbehaving dog. The Labrador makes only a brief appearance, albeit a pivotal one in Rhodes' character development. The third actor in the plot against the Germans is Charles Simon, a young British citizen whose mother was French and who is working as an engineer for a French concrete manufacturer when the war starts. As a civilian, Simon provides vital intelligence to the British about the German occupation of a French harbor before he's rewarded with a commission to the Royal Engineers. A former rum-runner named John Colvin signs onto the mission as navigator. Their joint venture is narrated by Commander Martin, who oversees the mission but generally stays in the background.Most Secret has something for every reader: a wartime adventure that eventually develops the pace and tension of a thriller; a story of blossoming love and another of a love left behind; a series of character studies; a spy story; a survival adventure; an exploration of differing philosophies of life and war; an inspirational saga of courage and self-sacrifice. It has tenderness and tragedy and unforgettable characters. Most of all, it is a powerful, moving, heart-felt tale told in the quiet, unassuming prose that marked Shute's style. Most Secret is just as compelling now as it was when Shute wrote it. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if Amazon offered that option, only because I think another of Shute's lesser known novels,The Breaking Wave, is even better."},{"Title":"Most Secret","review":"I am in love with this author's writings and he truly can tell a tale that keeps you turning the pages. Set in the war years, the characters are unique and developed throughly as the plot unfolds. You will never be disappointed with Mr. Shute's work which is now being re-printed in some areas."},{"Title":"Most Secret","review":"After many years (60?) since first reading him I decided to \\"pig out\\" on Nevil Shute and bought every available book on Amazon. Terrific selection! And I had not known that his last name is/was \\"Norway\\". I learned something new even as I groked Shute. Thanx muchly, Amazon!"},{"Title":"Most Secret","review":"Another tour de force by Shute. The author keeps you in suspense through every page. He involves your emotions and some passages are so loaded they literally bring tears to your eyes or make you want to stand up and cheer. Beautifully written and a superb read.."},{"Title":"Most Secret","review":"A carefully crafted jewel of a story with clearly defined hero characters. Published in 1945 with the Battle of Britain fresh in Shute's mind, it's not surprising that hate of enemy leads to setting him on fire. Literally. And for personal reasons.If you're into PC, read something else."},{"Title":"Most Secret","review":"Classic WWII story with suspense and good characters. Like so many of Mr. Shute's books - I couldn't put it down!Nevil Shute's characters are always so human; with their weaknesses and surprising strengths; foibles and quirks.Here several young men come up with an idea to assist the war effort in France, daring their own lives to bring it off, and not one of them spares himself, and not one is unneeded.Great story. (Notice - I did not give the story away at all.)Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Most Secret","review":"Nevil Shute (Norway)was an excellent writer. His stories will be considered juvenile now, but still his tales are spell binding."},{"Title":"Most Secret","review":"Neville Shute's books often seem to start with a rather boring ordinary person narrating rather boring ordinary events in far too much detail. This goes on for a while until you notice that you are totally hooked on the characters and that mixed in with the boring events are some quite extraordinary ones. This is a strange experience if you are used to more modern novels, where events occur at a breakneck pace, but Shute was a master of the art of planting a hook so slowly and gently that you hardly know it is happening, and it leaves his stories feeling truer, and his characters feeling realer. \\"Most Secret\\" is a fine example of this format, a mundane wartime narrative that ends up gripping you. As other reviewers are said, you wind up very involved with these characters.But there is something else interesting going on here. This is also a curious portrait of civilized hatred. Every single English and Breton character hates each and every individual German with a deep and consuming fierceness. Even priests and doctors thrill with anticipation at the thought of German soldiers being burnt alive or spending weeks slowly dieing from untreatably infected burns. The characters all have reasons for their hatred, and I believe it is a historically accurate depiction of how those people at that time felt, but it is curious to encounter such vicious hatred in such sympathetic characters. These days we civilians are so insulated from the wars our country fights that we have little emotional involvement and this all looks strange to us, but I think there is a deep human truth in it that is a bit uncomfortable to run up against."},{"Title":"Most Secret","review":"I bought this gift for my husband for Christmas. He was unaware of this book but a big Nevil Shute fan so it was fun to find one he didn't know. Though he is an author from another time and not necessarily for me, he certainly is a guy's author."},{"Title":"Lockheed Sr-71 Blackbird","review":"Nice pictures, nice captions, but the text! The text is just full of factual errors, sentences that don't fit the paragraphs, sentences that contradict the paragraphs, paragraphs that duplicate what was said earlier in different wording, etc. For just two examples, pg 18 says 17 A-12s were built, but across the spine on page 19 it says there were eighteen produced (18 is correct). Then on page 31 the author states, concerning the M-21, that \\"...the D-21 was initially mounted on the upper fuselage of the M-21...Unfortunately, this concept would only last for one flight. That first flight attempt took place on July 30, 1966.\\" This is not true-there were three previous (reasonably successful) flights of the D-21 from the M-21, and the fatal crash on the 30th was the fourth (and last) flight.Maybe you'd consider this nit-picking, but I buy books like this to get facts. I want to learn things I don't know. I trust authors have checked their facts, because they have access I don't have. When a casual reading of the book lets me spot obvious errors like this, I lose faith in the rest of the text (and, frankly, anything else the author has written, and I see several others by this author available in Amazon that I might have bought.)It's a shame, because the book looked good, and it is a great subject."},{"Title":"Beyond the Glen","review":"Though the other customer who reviewed this novel called it a Contemporary romance, I must disagree. Beyond the Glen was so much more. It was romance/coming of age/suspense/mystery all rolled into one. The range of emotions Haeger was able to make me feel through her words is amazing. I found myself as torn as Marielle was for her physical desire of Calum and less potent but slow burning love for Barry. Haeger did such a good job making both men seem worthy of Marielle's love that I could not decide, as I can in most romance novels, which I wanted her to end up with.All in all a lovely novel that doesn't fit in the genre of &quot;romance&quot; easily, because it is so much more."},{"Title":"Beyond the Glen","review":"In 1983 Scotland, half-sisters Colleen and Mairi Gordon are extremely close friends. However, their father's physical and mental abuse of Mairi's biological mother leads to a divorce. Colleen remains with Gordon while Mairi goes to France with her mother. Mairi desperately misses her best friend, but ma mere wipes out all references to Scotland and renames her daughter Marielle Girard.Over ten years have passed before Marielle learns that Colleen never stopped trying to find her. Deciding to see her best friend for the first time in a decade, Marielle returns to Scotland, only to learn that Colleen has been dead for two years. The locals hint that Colleen's spouse killed her. As Marielle tries to learn what happened to half-sister, she becomes romantically involved with Colleen's husband and a man from her own Scottish past.Diane Haeger scribes an interesting contemporary romance filled with several types of love lost and regained. Readers are never allowed to get close to the characters, which surprisingly adds to the overall feeling of grief that permeates much of this well written contemporary romance. BEYOND THE GLEN is a powerful relationship drama that demonstrates that Ms. Haeger is a rising star.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Secrets of Buying and Selling Real Estate...: Without Using Your Own Money!","review":"This book is great!

This book has no substance. &quot;Find a $300,000 house, buy it for $200,000 and flip it to an investor for $250,000 and pocket the difference&quot;. Yeah, it sounds nice but I live in a place called Earth. Perhaps in some depressed areas you might find sellers motivated enough to sell at that kind of discount, but don't plan on moving that property anytime soon either. Where I live, in Northern Virginia, people pay $30,000-$50,000 OVER the asking prices for a house. My neighbor just sold her TOWNHOUSE which she put on the market. She listed it for $385K and had SIX contracts on it the first week and sold it for $430K. Good luck finding a &quot;motivated&quot; seller around here. Up into southern Maryland you can find properties for below &quot;market&quot; value, but you can't turn them quickly.This guy may have done quite well during the real estate boom, but its a different world now and the things he is saying to do &quot;without by the way telling you HOW to do them&quot; are just ludicrous.Keep your money, don't waste it on this book."},{"Title":"Secrets of Buying and Selling Real Estate...: Without Using Your Own Money!","review":"Robert Shemin really nails it with this book.

Here is the plan presented in the book -- Find a $250,000 that you can purchase for $190,000 from a motivated seller, and sell it to someone else for $230,000, then retire rich.Not much of a plan if you ask me, especially when where I live, a $250,000 would be a mansion, not a 3 bedroom 2 bath starter house. A real presented plan would be, do A, B, C, D, etc.What he is suggesting in the book is not investing, rather it is speculating in real estate. While there is nothing wrong with that, let's call it what it is.His other book, &quot;Unlimited Riches,&quot; which I also own, covers everything here, and is a much better written book. It at least presents a cohesive plan that a novice might be able to follow.The book updates us on where Mr. Shemin is going in his life, and career. He lets us know that he got out of the landlord business and is now speculating in real estate and &quot;writing paper,&quot; (hard money lending) as he calls it.I have read many what I call &quot;Rah Rah&quot; books. There is nothing wrong with convincing people that they too can succeed in real estate, but this book doesn't even do that.I always try to find 2 or 3 new ideas, even out of a bad book. While there are a few ideas that make me go, &quot;Hmm, interesting,&quot; there are no sonic booms here. The book comes off as an advertisement for his real estate seminars and multilevel marking of some products, nothing wrong with that, but not much else for me to sink my teeth into.I am presently reading his new book &quot;How to Avoid the 75 Mistakes Every Investor Makes.&quot; That book should have been 50 Mistakes, but they stretched a few to get 75. Mind you, they are not bad, just that some didn't even take up half a page, and there are 250 pages in that book.If you have the money, buy the book, but if you have to choose between this one and another one, pass this one by. However, that said, do purchase his Millionaire books. They are worth the money.In closing, I'd like to find someone who would write a book on how to check real estate records for liens. You know, the nitty gritty work of real estate investing. Instead, they all want you to pay the $1000 for this information."},{"Title":"Secrets of Buying and Selling Real Estate...: Without Using Your Own Money!","review":"Whenever an author touts get rich quick type of message, which this book does, you have to be skeptical.

You will always need more information, experts in your area, and experts in different fields of real estate; and Shemin states this in his book.One real estate book will not solve all of your problems or answer all of your questions, but the bottom line is that this one gives you more than most. I will continue to go back to this book for ideas and to fine tune my investing skills for years. The only thing missing is him taking you by the hand to take action.

If you are just beginning or are an experienced investor, I would reccommend this book to all levels of investors."},{"Title":"Caught in the Act","review":"This account of beginning her semi-retirement, told with candor and vulnerability, wonderfully illustrates how the personal becomes universal. Who doesn't have an identity centered around what they do, think, and know? More than a flash of recognition in the mirror, Caught in the Act is an invitation to explore your own boundaries and to step out beyond them. Best of all, the challenge is to step out playfully, to keep a sense of humor about how our conditioning limits us. How to enjoy life just as it is now, while being open to seeing more than we think we already understand. This is no instructional manual of advice, thankfully, instead it is a book about learning to surrender. An informed and well-grounded wisdom shines forth on every page.While the stories from her life give the reader a sense of connection to her, somehow the book magically becomes about you. Her questions become your questions, too. She writes unpretentiously, as one who finds it unnecessary to state the obvious. It is tempting to credit her decades as a book editor for the clarity of her writing, but the ability to turn a rigorous, analytical mind back on itself requires a degree of personal honesty that only comes with years of spiritual practice and contemplation. This is what makes her insight so recognizably human and relevant. It takes both humility and courage to first see, and then reveal oneself so forthrightly.It is easy for anyone to relate to the challenges of losing your identity with one's work and filling free time creatively; you needn't wait for retirement to explore the territory of \\"doing non-doing\\" or to face the inner critic that turns play into more work. Learning to live at ease in the \\"don't know\\" zone sounds like the advice of many a Zen master. To watch how someone really applies these teachings to their own life is a wonderful opportunity. Trips to Japanese Zen monasteries, classes in Chinese brush painting, and retreats with Dzogchen masters are fascinating enough just as stories, the inner life evoked by them contains observations you may find useful in any circumstances. I found myself saying \\"Oh, I do that, too\\" a hundred times over, as would anyone paying attention to the mind's usual antics. Her focus on the many ways we avoid being present shows (with the usual irony) how awareness of doing that immediately puts us in touch and makes us present in a deeper way. Sometimes just seeing how plain silly we can be might jolt us into whatever is real for us now.Never mind that she calls herself an \\"almost-Buddhist\\", her grasp of the issues centered around \\"aimless aim\\" is right up there with Zen and the Art of Archery. If we don't have any goals or intentions with whatever activity we are doing, we may go nowhere. Yet if we are too focused on results, we burden our actions with heavy expectations. This book is about finding that balance in your daily life."},{"Title":"Caught in the Act","review":"I sat down to read just a chapter of this book, and simply couldn't put it down until I'd read almost the whole book. Reading it was like spending time with a good friend--the best kind of friend: one who levels with you, thinks deeply, cares about the spiritual path, and is unusually honest and direct in discussing core issues. The author talks about her own struggles with meditation, for example, and the difficulties that we all have with remaining really present. Topics include surrender, dealing with hard times, and learning how to just *be*, instead of self-defining by *doing*."},{"Title":"Caught in the Act","review":"We have to hope Toinette Lippe keeps writing since she does it with such grace, and it is clearly addictive. Her observations are profound, but they require only a receptive mind to be understood and accepted. The spiritual books she has edited over the years offer clues to her intellectual integrity and serene spirit. For those who are inspired by clear and imaginative thinking, she has become one of America's most endearing writers. She writes about how we feel and what we would say if we were poets. For readers unaccustomed to contemplative writing, their first encounter with Ms. Lippe's ideas will feel like reaching to shake a new friend's hand and being pulled into a full embrace: surprising, delightful, and comforting."},{"Title":"Caught in the Act","review":"This book gave me the refreshing feeling of having a deep conversation with a kindred soul. When finished, I had numerous pages marked to reread, as profound thoughts are interspersed between interesting anecdotes from the author's own life...much in the same way that we all experience our everyday lives with unexpected moments of insight and clarity. For those who haven't read it, I also heartily recommend the author's earlier book \\"Nothing Left Over: A Plain and Simple Life.\\""},{"Title":"Caught in the Act","review":"I really wish Ms. Lippe would write more books! I picked up her \\"Nothing Left Over\\" by chance several years ago...and it is the only book I have read twice! I highly recommend both of her books. If you're at all like me...you'll see yourself clearly in her writing."},{"Title":"Caught in the Act","review":"This book takes me straight to the heart of my current preoccupation, how to live more fully in the present. Many spiritual teachers address this subject, but rarely is the experience captured with the intimacy of Toinette Lippe's reflections. Reading Caught in the Act is like being inside her mind-which is astonishingly like being in my own. In the practice of entering ever more fully into each moment, the aspirations and the obstacles encountered are largely common to all of us. I was touched and inspired and also greatly entertained by reading such candid accounts of another person's path toward deeper awareness of moment to moment \\"being, knowing, and doing.\\"My favorite parts of the book concern the author's painting lessons. Her description of a Chinese calligraphy workshop makes almost palpable the sensations of moving an ink-laden brush across paper-so vivid, in fact, that I felt an intense yearning to have the same experience myself. The writing in this section is like a thick ribbon of silk drawing us through each sensuous step in the act of painting to the unexpected culmination: folding the sheet of paper and putting it aside, relinquishing the work of one moment, surrendering to the next, acknowledging impermanence. \\"Where the paint meets the paper,\\" the author writes, \\"there is discovery.\\"In addition to the elegant writing and thoughtful examination of many fascinating subjects, I enjoyed smaller elements of the book, like the clever chapter titles. \\"Watch This Space,\\" for example, is followed by an epigraph from Ovid: \\"Let your hook always be cast; in the stream where you least expect it, there will be a fish.\\" The illustrations at the head of each chapter are another nice touch-the author's own paintings, offering a lovely link to her descriptions of her art classes."},{"Title":"The Major Languages of Eastern Europe","review":"THE MAJOR LANGUAGES OF EASTERN EUROPE, edited by Bernard Comrie and published in 1990, is a selection from THE WORLD'S MAJOR LANGUAGES, Routledge's 1987 general overview. Each language's phonology, morphology, and syntax is presented, along with occasional mention of the lexicon. This is a very idiosyncratic volume. Romanian, one of the most important languages of Eastern Europe in terms of number of speakers, is missing. It instead was placed in a volume on Western Europe simply because its Romance relatives are there. Turkish is included, in spite of the fact that it's barely in Europe, while neither Albanian nor Bulgarian get a mention.The book includes not only descriptions of individual languages, but also descriptions of language families. The first two chapters are an overview by Philip Baldi of the Indo-European languages (a very basic presentation most linguaphiles will already find familiar) and a thoroughly insubstantial description of the Slavonic languages by Bernard Comrie. The IE languages covered are Russian, Polish, Czech and Slovak, and Serbo-Croat. Two Uralic languages are covered, Finnish and Hungarian, so we are also treated to an admirable ten-page description of this language family by Robert Austerlitz. Finally Turkish and the Turkic family in general are covered in a single chapter.In the 1990s, Routledge began the Language Family Surveys series, which has more sensible organization and is more detailed. THE MAJOR LANGUAGES OF EASTERN EUROPE may have had some value as a reference work when first published, but it has long been surpassed."},{"Title":"The Drum Goes Dead (A Christmas Tale)","review":"Bess Streeter Aldrich is one of my favorite authors.

Some segments are only a few sentences and others up to a few minutes in length. Most of these are eye-witness descriptions that are both engaging and gripping for their &quot;you are there&quot; sense. It includes some of the most famous sound-bites from Churchill and Roosevelt, but also a reporter's moving description of school children being evacuated from London, with all its pathos. I recommend it to anyone who values history, and seeks to know distant events in a more close-up experience."},{"Title":"Because I survived: An autobiography","review":"There are many books about the holocaust. First written in German, Lu Muhlfelder's English retelling of his exodus from Nazi Germany and his subsequent relocation in America is a first hand and inspirational story worth reading. What is it like to be expelled from the country of your heritage and then enlist in the United States Armed Forces to fight against your expatriots? How does one adjust to a new country and a new lifestyle? How will an immigrant adjust and assimilate?Ludwig Muhfelder tackles these issues head on in a poignant and self-revealing story of his personal history that reads like a brief novella. Touching, insightful, and though-provoking, &quot;Why I Survived&quot; is a must read for those interested in holocaust literature."},{"Title":"Alchemy: An Introduction to the Symbolism and the Psychology","review":"I first discovered Marie-Louise Von Franz in her collaboration with Emma Jung in their extraordinary book &quot;The Grail Legend&quot;, which is by far the most intellectually coherent book I have ever encountered regarding that material, in which they place those strange and surreal stories in the framework of a Jungian perspective on the history of consciousness. In these lectures on alchemical symbolism, Von Franz applies many of the same Jungian techniques to explore some important alchemical texts.I especially appreciated her decision to explore three texts in depth, rather than simply presenting a survey of alchemical literature, since there are numerous other books that do that. The fact that this is a transcript of a lecture series actually adds a wonderful dramatic tension to the book, since it includes some encounters with the attendees that demonstrate both her tremendous humanity and her impressive understanding of the subject and its relevance to modern psychology.One of the most provocative concepts presented is the danger of an individual experiencing an overload of revelation from the unconscious, with its accompanying challenge of integrating more insight than a mere mortal can manage. Von Franz explores this concept especially well in the discussion of the text by Thomas Aquinas, where we learn about his very stressful final years in a very moving lecture that continues to provide me with much to ponder."},{"Title":"Alchemy: An Introduction to the Symbolism and the Psychology","review":"If I had my time over again I would read these three books on alchemy in the following order: All of them are excellent in their own sphere to introduce a complex process.(1) The Forge and the Crucible - EliadeThis is an excellent prehistory of alchemy showing the patterns of thought out of which Alchemy most probably arose. An easy read.(2) Anatomy of the Soul - EdingerSet out according to seven processes involved in alchemy Calcinatio, Solutio, Coagulatio, Sublimatio, Mortificatio, Separatio, Coniunctio, this is an accessible book that puts each process in reasonably neat boxes, (though the considerable overlap and intermingling is acknowledged). The approach is somewhat mechanical.(3) Alchemy, an Introduction... - Von Franz.More 'organic' than Edinger, Von Franz has a very warm and human touch. She deals with the origins of alchemy in Egypt and Greece and delves into the 'Aurora Consurgens', attributed to Aquinas. She includes relevent and interesting case material. Being a transcription of lectures, it is a little haphazard, though none the less informative for that."},{"Title":"Alchemy: An Introduction to the Symbolism and the Psychology","review":". . . the active nature of participation in outer reality and relationships, together with the process of inner reflection.\\"The above quote from page 83 of von Franz' book illustrates the reason that Jung and von Franz were interested in alchemy: as a symbolic portrayal of psychic processes, particularly individuation. Individuation is the goal of all psychic processes which, in a nutshell, is balance--between conscious and unconscious processes achieved in part by developing a healthy connection with the collective unconscious.This book displays the masterly scholarship of M.L. von Franz, who wrote this book as an introduction to the more arcane and less clearly written books by Jung on the topic. The book is taken from transcriptions of a series of lectures on alchemy.Von Franz begins with discussing some basic Jungian, mythological and alchemical concepts. She then proceeds to discuss Greek alchemy for several chapters starting with one of the oldest alchemical writings \\"The Prophetess Isis to her son.\\" Isis' son is of course, Horus. In this passage, an angel comes to Isis and wants to have sex with her. She negotiates a bargain where the angel will tell her the secret of alchemy. The bargain stipulates that she cannot share her secret with anyone except her son. Hence the secret of alchemy--the philosphers stone--is known as \\"the secret of the widow\\" (Isis was the widow of Osiris).In other chapters von Franz discusses Arabic and European alchemy, utilizing other source texts. Von Franz recounts Jung's search for a text called \\"Aurora Consurgens\\" conducted with her assistance. Von Franz subsequently translated and published this text which some sources attribrute to Thomas Aquinas.This is an excellent introduction to Jungian alchemical concepts. The text is accompanied by black and white illustrations of alchemical symbols.(Remember that this is a transcript of lectures so the writing is not as good as some of von Franz' other works. In particular I found some of the transcribed questions and comments from the peanut gallery to be annoying.)"},{"Title":"Alchemy: An Introduction to the Symbolism and the Psychology","review":"If you're reading Jung or have read Jung and are finding his ideas about Alchemy a little complex, then this is a perfect introductory text. As von Franz points out, Jung has done all the hard work for us. If so, then von Franz makes all of Jung's hard work even more accessible."},{"Title":"Alchemy: An Introduction to the Symbolism and the Psychology","review":"just a note: the review above refers to Anatomy of the Psyche by Edinger. Anatomy of the Soul is a misprint."},{"Title":"Alchemy: An Introduction to the Symbolism and the Psychology","review":"Alchemy is the hidden science of psychology and von Franz makes it perfectly understandable in this lovely series of lectures.

Since it is not written material every word is not weighed, which is a problem within the field of Jungian psychology. It's, however, quite interesting. One major surprise is that St. Thomas Aquinas is, with great likelihood, the author of the alchemical work 'Aurora Consurgens.'Mats Winther"},{"Title":"Chilly Scenes of Winter","review":"First off, let me say the movie version of this book, while well acted, chops the story up in ways that kills some of the best things about the book.This is one of those books that is tough to describe. I've read it several times now and find new things everytime. Beattie does an incredible job of creating these people who walk through their own little world, trying to deal with the hand that life has dealt them. They're just like us, selfish, unaware, worn out in places, but full of humanity. There are acts of kindness, warmth, vulnerability in these people the author has created. This is what makes this book, you follow these people along an episode of their lives and wonder where its going to go. I find that when I take a step back, I question where they end up, but while I'm in it, I don't.At the heart of the matter is a love story, an awkward, imperfect love story about a man who is obsessed. It drives him through his days, drives him into doing dumb things, and gets his friends and family to roll their eyes.An excellent read, the first or fourth time around."},{"Title":"Chilly Scenes of Winter","review":"In &quot;Chilly Scenes of Winter,&quot; Beattie creates a crisp, objective (except for the subjective parts) snapshot of a life. Main character Charles (never Charlie!) yearns for what he doesn't have and believes he wants -- but maybe he doesn't. These are a few days in the life of Charles, his best friend Sam, sister Susan, love-of-his-life Laura, the ghost of Janis Joplin, and step-dad Pete (the dancing, Turtle Wax devotee) and Charles' crazy mother. And these days are at once funny,poignant, sardonic and absolutely riveting. Although it takes place in the mid 1970's, the references are a snap for any pop culture fan and the story is timeless. This is Beattie's first and best book. A must!"},{"Title":"Chilly Scenes of Winter","review":"Ann Beattie's first novel captures the mundanity of everyday life and the exquisite pain of unrequited obsession perfectly. Our hero, Charles, takes trips to the supermarket where nothing in the entire store looks appetizing, and cuts work to take long walks in the cold. Every characterization and conversation plays itself out with sharp realism. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Chilly Scenes of Winter","review":"This book started out interesting, grew rather tiring, you started feeling slightly melancholy and reflecting on the good things in your life and then just as it started to become emotionally warm and fuzzy, it stopped. From an academic standpoint, the voice and the character development were phenomenal. This book isn't exciting but it is one of those things that makes you scratch your head and be amazed that you really aren't the only one having these inane types of conversations and bizarre interpersonal relationships. A good read for a cold night and a hot cup of tea but not a good read if you are wanting to really entertain yourself. If this book were a Friday date night, it would be more of a glass of cognac at a quiet piano bar than a night of dinner and dancing in a nightclub. It has great value at the right time and place."},{"Title":"Chilly Scenes of Winter","review":"This book, copyrighted in 1976, is a story of \\"twenty-somethings\\" who are floundering. The economic environment is very challenging, but Charles, the protagonist, actually has a secure government job, although he finds it unfulfilling. You get to know Charles very well, which is not a total positive, although he is a decent man, a great friend, and a romantic. Beattie employs two approaches to developing his character. I loved the dialogue, which was often very funny, although sometimes more repetitious than it need be to sound authentic and get the point across. I found my entry into Charles' thoughts frequently dull, and I wonder how much of this book Beattie could have gotten across by just relying on dialogue and some narrative. There is more to this book than Charles: several other characters make their mark. In particular Charle's step father is almost pitiful, but really a vulnerable and well meaning person doing the best he can with a situation with no good resolution, the mental illness of his wife."},{"Title":"Chilly Scenes of Winter","review":"Things I Liked:-The prose style. The book seemed to create inside jokes with itself. It was funny. I liked it.-The dialogue. Sometimes the characters seemed to talk at each other instead of to each other. It was funny. I liked it.-Flashbacks/backstory. Always seemed 'well done,' 'transparent.' I liked it.-The main character was hopelessly in love with someone who, for the most part, didn't love him in the same way back. I liked it.-The main character was male, the author is female. This is a stupid comment, but I liked it.Things I Didn't Like:-The ending."},{"Title":"Chilly Scenes of Winter","review":"Simply wonderful.

Chris uses powerful tools for seizing control of your own attitudes and behaviors to produce wealth on every level. In the book Chris uses a fairly new science, a study of the mind known as NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming), which is the psychology of achievement thru interpersonal communication.Chris has an amazing ability to inspire people to think differently about themselves and the world around them, enabling them to pursue dreams and ambitions that they previously never thought possible.In \\"Turn Passions Into Profits\\" he reveals in detail of how the rich and famous build massive wealth. Chris shows mind maps for people like Oprah Winfrey, Warren Buffett, Donald Trump and Richard Branson. Mind mapping is a brilliant tool to create and deepen new neurological connections and crystallize your new found knowledge in both your conscious and unconscious mind. Chris then teaches you how to create your Mind Map in a way that is so clear and simple to understand.This is not another course in positive thinking; it is a secret road map to abundance, both financial and personal.

It's not hard to read and it iscertainly inspiring.On stage Howard has a blinding charisma that no doubtsells a lot of books. My girlfriend bought this bookat a seminar and I read it.Don't get me wrong - I have been through is BreakthroughTo Success seminar twice and it is very worthwhileand somewhat deep.This is basically Howard's story of how he rose fromfailure to success by borrowing 30,000 and investingit in NLP training, building his executive coachingbusiness through aggressive cold-calling, and finallybreaking out in a big way as a superstar NLP guru.I don't know enough about NLP to assess whetherHoward's thinking is original or better than TonyRobbins or Bandler and Grinder. I do know that heis a master salesman and in his marketing he haspositioned himself as a developer of \\"cutting edgeinner technologies\\" - which is an attractivejargon.I really like his workshop.He is friendly with Richard Branson and talks aboutthe man frequently.

He shares his story and the steps he feels anyone who cares to can take to achieve the sort of life they would only dream of - doing what excites their own heart and making a living, and much more than basic living, out of it.Using a basis of NLP he developed related techniques that can speed you in the direction YOU want to take. One overall read is required to get an idea of the whole process. Then a more deliberate step-by-step approach to put these ideas into action.

I can't tell you how it happened but a lot of my behavior changed after reading this book.However the reader might be decieved into dropping the book after the first few chapters. After the first two chapters which has a more \\"touchy feely\\" approach, there is a huge and abrupt transition into major analytical constructive thinking. I was so turned off that I put down the book twice before I finally got through it. The book slowly gets its rhythm back towards the end, so stick with it. There are things within the book that will change your life. But you definitely have to get past his ackronyms. I hate Ackroynms.I really appricated that this book avoided sprituality or concepts and instead searched long and hard to find examples from human beings.

Most of the so called \\"100 best colleges for African American students\\" don't have more than a handful of African American students. Here is a list of 20 of the 100 schools listed: Alaska Pacific University, Colorado School of Mines, Earlham College, Goshen College, Hanover College, Drake University, Hamline University, University of Mississippi (for God's sake \\"Ole Miss\\" is one of the 100 best colleges for African Americans?!?!?!), Creighton University, University of New Mexico, Utah State University, Marlboro College of Vermont, University of Wyoming, Stetson University, Harvey Mudd College, Agnes Scott College, Illinois Wesleyan University, Iowa State University, Bowdoin College in Maine, and Willamette University in Oregon. There are only 8 Historically Black Colleges in the book. I am not saying that only black colleges are good for black students, but I can't imagine that only 8 of them would make a list of 100. Here is a list of 20 historically black colleges that are NOT INCLUDED in this book, but should be in ANY African American college guide: Fisk University, Southern University, Grambling State University, Lincoln University, North Carolina A&T;, North Carolina Central, Johnson C. Smith, Bennett College, South Carolina State, Tennessee State, Kentucky State University, Delaware State, Shaw University, Tougaloo College, University of Maryland-Eastern Shore, Texas Southern, Xavier University, Norfolk State, Jackson State, and Alabama A&M.;I would suggest that you get the Black Enterprise list or the DayStar Guide to Colleges for African American Students or Black Excel."},{"Title":"The 100 Best Colleges for African-American Students: Revised and Updated Edition","review":"This book starts with the assumption that the African American applicant is sub-par. It goes so far as to suggest that African American students make certain that the college of their choice include remedial courses to assure that they are allowed to graduate (since ivy league colleges have lowered their standards to attract minorities, but have neglected to include remedial studies). I hoped this book would provide suggestions of the best colleges that would widen the horizons of my academically talented, African American child. It gave a list of schools where an African American might actually graduate!

If you enjoyed, \\"Papillon\\", by Henri Charriere, then this book is for you.This is the harrowing TRUE story of Ren&eacute; Belbenoit's 15 years in the French penal colony. He describes the cruel conditions the convicts lived under in a very matter-of-fact way and mentions some of the incredible statistics, such as how half the convicts died within their first year in Guiana from malnutrition, diseases like malaria, leprosy etc.etc. He also describes his escape attempts and how he was punished with solitary confinement in a cell on Saint Joseph Island. We hear the stories of some of the famous convicts, and the perversity of the guards who enjoys to add to the convicts sufferings be dealing out unjust punishments. In fact, the guards are in many cases worse crooks than the convicts and they steal and swindle with the supplies which were meant for the convicts. We hear about hospitals without medicine, where the only treatment is a can of condensed milk.Belbenoit finally succeeds in escaping after four unsuccessful attempts and ends up in the U.S.A. where he becomes a citizen.He later writes a follow-up book called, \\"Hell On Trial\\", in which he expand on some aspects of the penal colony, which is also a great book."},{"Title":"I Escaped From Devil's Island: Fifteen Years Among the Living Dead (Bantam Book)","review":"I am 73 years old. Sixty years ago I got a hold of this book and read it. I was born in 1936. It must have been shortly after its publication. I came from a conservative Christian background. I have been an atheist now for decades. I'm am not sure why my parents let me read this book. I am glad they did. I remember to this day that the book was riveting. I was always a non-conformist, even at 12-13, and so when my teacher assigned a book review I turned in my report on \\"I Escaped from Devil's Island.\\" My teacher was so shocked that she contacted my parents. I don't know to this day what transpired at that meeting. I do know that my parents never censored my reading. I went on to a career in science and to earn four college degrees. In my retirement I am the author of six novels plus other books. Read on, my friends. Don't let anyone get in your way."},{"Title":"I Escaped From Devil's Island: Fifteen Years Among the Living Dead (Bantam Book)","review":"Just to add a little more to Bookworm's excellent review, with the passage of time this book is likely to be difficult to obtain but it is worth hunting for.Charriere has been criticized for writing in the first person (perhaps not his fault but rather than that of his agent/translator) but Belbenoit's story is all his own. As a bit of trivia they were both on the same shipment from France (Belbenoit being returned) but I don't know if they knew each other.Another book covering this fascinating era is The Convict by Felix Milani.Dry Guillotine was issued as \\"I escaped from Devil's Island\\" and made into a film of the same name by the Corman Brothers. It was brought out quickly to capitalize on the publicity for Papillion. The movie usually gets a grade Z in reviews but really it is not that bad!"},{"Title":"The Invasion (Doctor Who #98)","review":"I must admit this book did not excite me like many of the other novelizations I have read recently. Yes, the Doctor once again saves the world, this time aided by Jamie and Zoe. But the enemy is not particularly well portrayed. The immediate enemy is the Tobias Vaughn, who runs the company International Electromatics. But the real enemy is the largely unseen cybermen. The Doctor's interactions with Vaughn feel somewhat formulatic and the cybermen are lacking in definition. Took me a few days to get through this one as I did not feel the urge to pick it up when I got distracted by something else. Typically theses novelizations can be read in one sitting or are interesting enough that you want to pick them up again as soon as you get the chance."},{"Title":"The Invasion (Doctor Who #98)","review":"Ian Marter adapts the Cybermen epic, 'The Invasion'. Probably the second best Cybermen story ever made (beaten by 'Tomb of the Cybermen' and only rivaled by 'Earthshock'). This novelisation has the benefit of an increased page- and word-count.The TARDIS arrives on contemporary Earth with a problem, so the Doctor decides to enlist the aid of friend Professor Travers in repairing it. They quickly get drawn into what appears to be some kind of commercial espionage, but turns out to be an official investigation of the activities of the company, International Electromatics.The story is notable for the introduction of Doctor Who's mainstay organisation, UNIT, and features the return of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe assist UNIT in their investigation and infiltration of IE. But they soon encounter their old enemies, the Cybermen.The only problem with this story is the Cybermen: they are essentially a nondescript opponent. It is their human ally, Tobias Vaughn, who is the real villain of the piece.While it isn't complete (two of the eight episodes have been lost), watching the video is preferable to reading the book as Kevin Stoney's portrayal of Tobias Vaughn really makes the story, adding to great performances by the regulars."},{"Title":"(Sick): A Cultural History of Snowboarding","review":"For anyone who started snowboarding after 1993 this book is a must read. No way..this is a must read for all snowboarders. I grew up in New England snowboarding on Burton Backcountry boards in my back yard.

Also her historical section was deviod of reference to many of the true pioneers of the sport. As entertainment it is ok as a giuide to snowboarding and it's cultural history, it falls far short.

If you were born after 86 you would get the book, if u were born before its a great, not a must, a great read. I loved it because of how much of a taboo it was, it was a current day mystery that wasn't respected at first, and needed brave people to design the board from a ski with a rope, much more than that, but great read."},{"Title":"(Sick): A Cultural History of Snowboarding","review":"Awesome book.

I enjoyed learning about the evolution of surfing on water to skateboarding the streets, and now riding the mountains. As one who does both skateboarding and snowboarding, I can see the great similarities between the two sports. Photos that you cannot see in any of the new magazines were shown throughout the book. You got to see the first primitive boards, old school styles, and the modern ones in use.

You may wish to also order Sherry Lewis' book titled, An Echo in Time, since it is the sequel to this book.We begin our tale with a fellow named Kurt Richards, modern man, who just ended another relationship. Or rather, SHE ended the relationship. He has had a string of bad luck in love, mainly because he is devoted to protecting the historical ruins of Anasazi at Black Mesa, Montana. While on a stake-out to catch looters, he finds himself swept off a cliff into another time.He wakes up in the year 1890 and finds himself without a place to stay and nothing to eat until a widow takes him in as her hired ranch hand. He discovers he is very much attracted to the lovely, dark Olivia. But then, so is the neighbor, Sam Evans. And Sam is not too friendly with Kurt.Olivia struggles to maintain the ranch and it's surrounding property left to her by her late husband, Harvey. Considered useless land for farming or grazing, she finds herself unable to pay the upcoming mortgage payment to the smirking bank manager, Sloan Durrant. And really strange yet, he wants to buy some of the so-called useless land up on Black Mesa! Something is up, and Kurt knows what it is. Durrant is after the legend of a treasure, but won't ever find it if Kurt and Sam have any say.The characters are written with the characteristic warmth of Sherry Lewis, and the setting description is satisfying. This is a story that doesn't forget the plot for just romance. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Whispers through Time (Time Passages)","review":"First off, I messed up and read An Echo in Time before reading Whispers Though Time. \\"Echo\\" is the sequel to this story and can be read alone but it helps to read this book first.Kurt Richards was betrayed by his first wife. Since then he has had a hard time establishing a relationship with other women. At the beginning of the story he has been dating Charlotte who is in the process of breaking up with him. Like with his first wife, Kurt has put his job of working for the Department of the Interior first.The Black Mesa is \\"home\\" of Kurt's passion. Kurt has made it his life's work studying the Anasazi people who inhabited this protected area many years before. Afraid of robbers carrying off artifacts, he decides to spend the night at the site. That evening he hears a woman crying. Thinking the person could be hurt he goes to investigate and, instead, falls into a ravine.Upon waking he finds himself outside Cortez, Colorado in 1889. He meets Olivia Hamilton, a widow, who is soon to lose her ranch. The story continues with both fighting their underlying feelings while trying to save the homestead. Sam, a neighbor, also loves Olivia and wants to marry her. And then there is wily Sloan Durrant who is a banker up to no good.A western romance that includes time travel, Whispers Through Time lacked a certain amount of passion that you would expect to feel between Kurt and Olivia. It seemed as though Olivia didn't know who she wanted. One minute she would remember the best of her deceased husband but was blind to hurtful decisions that he made. Then she was confused by Kurt, did she really believe that he came from the future? And what about Sam...he had always been there helping to make her life easier.It is slow in some parts but you'll want to read this before taking on An Echo in Time."},{"Title":"Whispers through Time (Time Passages)","review":"Great story.

The book is an engaging recap of the games from the past few seasons, along with interesting behind-the-scenes information on Pete Carroll and his role in reviving the USC football program. Even a hard-core USC football fan will likely learn something new about the team and its history.

Check it out."},{"Title":"Conquest: Pete Carroll and the Trojans' Climb to the Top of the College Football Mountain","review":"As an 'SC alum and avid football fan, this was easy reading - brain candy.

Being a life long Trojan fan, this book served justice to not only USC Football but the University itself. From the beginning it had me hooked. I wasn't really willing to read it at first but then my humanities teacher required that we have a Silent Sustained Reading(ssr)book. I forgot to bring a book and it just so happened that I had this book in my backpack. This book includes interviews, quotes and real life stats. My favorite part of the book had to be when USC lost to Utah in the Las Vegas Bowl and ever since then Pete Carrol came in and brought change to the program making Trojan football a powerhouse. Unfortunately, it is a little depressing reading the book in 2011 and looking at USC football and the heartbreaking sanctions. The great part about this book is that in the end there are all of the stats and scores of USC's games mentioned in the book.

It contains some insider detail of locker room cheering, reporting on recruiting battles, and even a nice reminder that TV commentator Bob Griese said that Heisman Trophy QB Matt Leinart had \\"no supporting cast\\" moments before Leinart and all his teammates crushed Oklahoma in the 2004 National Championship game. I'd venture that even though Griese was a stellar pro football player, he knew a lot less about the Trojans than David Wharton and Gary Klein did.

Perhaps this march will continue over the next few years, but one nine-yard Vince Evans TD run turned the 2005 team from the best ever to that other list which includes the '79 Trojans, '83 Cornhuskers, '54 Indians. . . Close but no cigar.SOOOO. . . This book turns into that piece of history to be cherished, and both Gary Klein and David Wharton were with Pete Carroll's juggernaut every step of the way. Upon reflection, this - not the '05 team - is Carroll's best team up to the 2006 season. One is inceasingly thinking we will never see their likes again, not just at Troy but in all college football.Who is better than the 2004 Trojans? The 1972 Trojans. Maybe the 1995 Nebraska team.

For years I had a rather elaborate yard haunt that seemed to grow bigger and bigger each year. I haven't put on the annual production in a while but one of these Octobers the casket is going to come out of the garage then its trick-or-treaters beware. With that in mind, one day while browsing around Amazon I came across this book and it caught my interest given my love for the macabre holiday and its traditions.David Skal in this book gives the reader a quick overview of the holiday. There is a little on the history, a little on the traditions, a little on the legends and a little on about the darker side of Halloween. There is not however much detail on any subject. For example his chapter about Halloween movies deals almost exclusively with the &quot;Halloween&quot; movie series and its shortcomings. If he had just switched over to television he could have written an entire chapter just on The Simpsons, let alone all of the other series that have started to do Halloween episodes, something almost unheard of before 1990 or so.I found his chapter on debunking the poison candy myths to be one of the best in the book and was of course attracted to the chapter on yard haunts. The chapter he offers about witches was also interesting although I am sure there are some Salem merchants who would disagree. Overall this is a pretty good book but it could have been much better. The appearance of the author's personal agenda on occasion didn't help but overall I just never really got a feel for what he was trying to say about Halloween. I enjoyed the book and did pick up a few bits of information but I couldn't help but think something was missing. The man has to love Halloween to have written so much about it but that love for the holiday just doesn't come across in this book.Yes, there is something about Halloween that has a great appeal to my generation. I can't really explain it and so I guess I can't complain if Mr. Skal can't either. This is not a bad book; it just doesn't live up to the glory of the holiday it is about."},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"Being a fan of Mr. Skal's writing (Monster Show is an annual literary tradition for me) and of Halloween in particular, I picked up this book hoping to find a detailed historical account of Halloween and all of its manifestations (from cultural to the commercial).The initial chapters delivered this perfectly, and I thoroughly enjoyed his account of the origins of Halloween and its cultural significances, however, beyond this riveting opening, the author goes on to pursue disparate topics marginally related to, or peripherally effected by Halloween. The whole came off a little disjointed, with too much emphasis given to topics that might have made better footnotes than chapters. I would rather have had pages of more in-depth information on the Jack-o-lantern or druids than the West Coast Pride parades. That's not to say the borderline topics of the individual chapters weren't interesting, I enjoyed them all and found some of them truly fascinating in their own right, but I couldn't help but want to revisit the initial chapters' themes.I wanted more History with my Halloween, as per the book's title.Granted the first half of this book may be reason enough to buy it (The Candy Man story gave me the creeps), but ultimately, I would rather have had a 300 page detailed exploration of the themes and ideas brought up in the first half of the book, with the remainder of the chapters' topics sprinkled about where necessary. Still, it's a well researched, well written book that can enlighten anyone with more than a passing interest in all things Halloween, I have certainly learned a lot reading this book. There may be a few rocks in this trick-or-treat bag, but ultimately it's a rewarding and engaging read."},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"Although I appreciate Amazon.com for providing a forum for customer reviews, it needs to be pointed out that the review of my book DEATH MAKES A HOLIDAY by \\"Zaine Ridling\\" is an unattributed cut-and-paste of a piece actually written by USA TODAY reporter David Colton and published by USA TODAY last week.

(They're still somewhat mysterious, as no one can explain for certain where all the traditions came from.) One of the other reviewers complained that he already knew some of the information in the book, but I've never found a history of Halloween that answers the questions this one does; maybe my local library needs to beef up their Halloween section. The book's approach is very personal: the author spends a lot of time on topics he finds interesting, such as monster movies, that not every historian would consider strictly relevant to the celebration of Halloween. However, I found those topics interesting, too, so I didn't mind. Skal's writing style is intelligent but conversational, so the book is a breeze to read. I especially enjoyed his first-hand interviews with haunted-house creators, and Sara Karloff. I wouldn't recommend the book for kids, though, because there are descriptions of real-life murders that are actually quite scary, even for an adult."},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"This is one of those books that is very hard to put down if you're a fan of Halloween as I am. I found this book to be extremely enjoyable and easy to read because it's informative and fun at the same time.In this book the author shares some stories, both positive and negative, about Halloween. This includes the trendy panics of candy tampering, religious nuts attacking the holiday for everything it's worth, the inevitable commercialization, people who go out of their way to make awesome Yard Haunts and Haunted Houses, movies that focus on or that relate to the holiday, and even a chapter about the Halloween after September 11th, 2001.

And it was worth it! It is not a standard history; instead, the book is \\"episodic\\" in that each chapter covers a completely different subject than the previous ones, making this less a unified book and more a collection of interesting essays.Each essay *is* interesting, though of varying strength. The chapter on the history of Halloween is the best, especially when Skal is showing off his in-depth collection of primary sources. The film chapter is almost *too* detailed, with a rapid-fire pace that one would expect from an expert on horror films, but that leaves the reader winded. The chapter on witches is the weakest, less about Halloween's adoption of the witch than it is about Salem's exploitation of it.All in all, Skal's book is a welcome addition to the scholarly Halloween shelf."},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"Has the world gotten too scary for Halloween?For a second terror-filled October, the prospect of costumed monster kids cavorting across lawns and giggling in the glow of pumpkin-lit doorways is filling parents with dread.But in a surprisingly timely look at America's second-biggest holiday, horror historian David J. Skal argues that it is precisely such \\"death anxiety\\" that gives Halloween its dark and playful power.\\"Halloween is a holiday that refuses to play by anyone's rules,\\" Skal writes in Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween. \\"Unpredictable and unrepentant, Halloween also remains stubbornly unofficial and underground, and this may be the key to understanding the tumult that regularly erupts in its name.\\"From the urban myth of poisoned treats in the 1970s - Skal finds only one documented case of such tampering - to the cultural wars over costumes and religion, Skal celebrates a holiday in which \\"death reigns triumphant but no one ever has to grieve.\\"Kids have always known the safety of that mask. Birthdays and the Christmas season have their charms, but Halloween remains the true holiday of childhood.An ungodly brew of Celtic rituals, medieval devils, English revels and an autumnal equinox of death, the holiday was easily a millennium old when it arrived here, rough and in rags with Irish fleeing the potato famine of 1846.Ghoulies and ghosties came, too, of course. But America added a wicked grin to the macabre: pumpkins and skeletons, witches and brooms, dark covered bridges and slow-blinking owls - a $6 billion treat when the candy and costumes and haunted theme parks are added up each year.Commercialized, bowdlerized, Disneyized and demystified, Halloween is America's \\"patchwork holiday, a kind of cultural Frankenstein stitched together quite recently,\\" Skal observes.Trick-or-treating didn't knock on America's door until the Depression, \\"a property-protection scheme\\" as homeowners tried to buy off the street toughs who ran riot in the late '30s. By the postwar '50s, the candies were not a gift but a childhood entitlement.\\"If trick-or-treating had previously been a localized, hit-or-miss phenomenon, it was now a national duty,\\" Skal writes.The author is at his best when he takes on the perennial forces that seem hellbent on slowing this dance of chills. Whether faced with Tylenol scares, Detroit fires, anthrax attacks or intolerance of gay parades, Halloween survives.And if Skal is right - if fear, terror and even snipers fuel the need for a gentler form of anxiety - then this Halloween season might be needed more than ever.Boo!Copyright, USA TODAY"},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"Anyone who has read \\"The Battle for Christmas\\" by Stephen Nissenbaum and is looking for a companion book for Halloween...run.

Almost as in search for a suitable number of pages, Skal almost endlessly describes the plots of movies we already know and muses so shamelessly about tourist attractions in Salem that it begins to read like an ad for the Visitors Bureau. This is an overwritten introduction for what could have been. Lots of fluff for those of you who don't want too much information muddying up that slick cover."},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"The history of Halloween we find here is selective, not all-encompassing. Skal has picked a handful of topics to which he has collected a score of personal anecdotes and stories from people across the country, with occasional interjections of analysis thrown in.On the plus side, the personal anecdotes are interesting and fun; photos showing early 20th century Halloween-themed postcards are delightful; and one chapter, which (among other things) details the gay community's association with the holiday is fascinating.However, these positives are outweighed by several problems.A sense of \\"been there, done that\\", permeates much of the book. While the inclusion of certain subjects in any history of Halloween is almost mandatory - guaranteeing a certain repetition of information - the fact remains that some will have already read much of what is included here.A chapter entitled Halloween On Screen spends more time detailing the storylines of the (Michael Myers) HALLOWEEN movies than trying to find some underlying themes or connections between Halloween-related films and the holiday itself.Lastly, I lost faith in the book's factual accuracy. In one paragraph, mention is made of a particular film. The first thing to catch my attention was an incorrect year attached to the movie. Second, a questionable statement is made concerning the fate of the young female student. Depending on one's interpretation of this statement, this statement is also incorrect. That two errors are found back-to-back just made me question what else in the book might be inaccurate.All considered, I do not recommend DEATH MAKES A HOLIDAY. In addition to the above problems (and others not mentioned), when one considers the book comes in at under 200 pages (when index and notes are subtracted), the price tag is high for the product delivered. And when you start doubting a book's facts..."},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"Have you ever wondered about the origins of Halloween traditions? Why do we go trick or treating, or dress in costume? Who brought the traditions to the New World? How much of the mythology is real, and how much is poppycock? This book answers these questions and more, with a brief overview of history, traditions, folklore, and the lure the holiday has for so many.I am one of those people who loves to be scared, and is absolutely fascinated by the psychology of fear. As a kid, Halloween was my favorite holiday, and even now, I prefer horror to romance, in terms of books and movies. So, it is natural for me to be drawn to a book like this, and I think it provides a good starting place for those looking to learn more about Halloween.The book gives an overview of several areas, like history and folklore, but is unable to go very much in depth in any area. I think, however, for the purposes of the book, Skal does a good job with these overviews. There is a huge subculture around Halloween, with it no longer being a holiday just for children. In fact, increasingly, children are being left out of Halloween, in that trick or treat nights get cancelled, and school ban costumes.Everyone likes to forget who they are now and then, or pretend they are someone else, and I think this is part of the Halloween appeal. Also, when we allow ourselves to take charge of the things that scare us, they no longer have the power to cause that fear. I think the book does an adequate job of covering the holiday, and is a good starting place for those interested in learning more about Halloween."},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"An overview of the history and changing perceptions of All Hallow's Eve and related (sometimes assimilated) holidays. The focus is primarily on Halloween in the 20th Century, with chapters on Halloween and Holywood, Halloween after 9/11, and Halloween and the gay rights movement.Enjoyable and educational, the author's personal love of this holiday clearly shines through. A refreshing look at an uniquely American holiday (however loosely related to ancient Celtic festivals)."},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"I found that David Skal's book delt more on the cultural and less on the historical aspects of America's Halloween, and this is probably why it's a cultural history as opposed to a history. It's a fascinating overview about this prodominately American holiday as it skims through many parts of All Hallow's Eve. It would have been nice if he had added a bit more about monsters and the like (hence the rating) but overall this book is entertaining and worth the read."},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"A friend who knew I was into Halloween picked up this book for me. I'm glad she did because I couldn't put it down. I found the book a nice comprehensive look at a number of topics related to Halloween-- from it's patchwork history, modern religous signifigance (or lack thereof) and evolution into the holiday rivaling Xmas that we know and love. I was especially happy to see mention of Disney's Haunted Mansion and it's transformation with the help of Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas. Whitty, well written and very interesting book."},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"\\"Halloween, the one major holiday that was unofficial, and therefore uncontrolled, was ... [a] holiday ripe for new myths and rituals.\\"It's the new \\"myths and rituals\\" that are the main focus of David J. Skal's \\"Death Make a Holiday - a Cultural History of Halloween.\\" Other reviewers have commented on the relative lack of \\"history\\" in this book and, in some ways, that's a fair observation. The history of Halloween is covered in the first chapter (The Halloween Machine) but from there the book becomes a contemporary view of the modern celebration, in all its permutations. This isn't an historical review as much as an invitation to join the author on a fascinating journey across this peculiarly American holiday's landscape. The metaphor of traveling cross-country could be particularly apt as several chapters focus on the regional aspects of Halloween.For example, \\"The Witch's Teat\\" examines Salem, the city where it's Halloween 24/7 and 365. This is a city where the police drive cars emblazoned with witches and wear them on their shoulders! Having visited Salem in the early \`90's (and no where near October 31st) I can tell you from first hand experience that this is a municipality that's turned the tragedy of the witch trials into a ne0-goth theme park and is reaping a healthy return on investment.For some, this detailed description of Salem's fascination is too much - it somehow distracts from the genuine history of Halloween (whatever that is). For me, as a long-time fan of David's work, it's what I've come to expect. David's attention to detail is legendary and, often, exhaustive. If you haven't read \\"Hollywood Gothic\\" it's a pluperfect recounting of everything (and I do mean everything) Dracula related. If anything, I was a little surprised that David relented when he did to move on to other topics.Similarly, David takes us to Castro Street and San Francisco's often over-the-top Halloween parades and practices. Frequently not ready for primetime, this is new territory for much of America, certainly for me. (Google up \\"exotic erotic ball\\" and you'll see what I mean. Don't do it at work!) David handles the exotic and the erotic with a deft hand, addressing everything from the claiming of Halloween as a \\"gay high holy day\\" to the often disturbingly aggressive response of civic authority and televangelists determined to save the event's bohemian practitioners from themselves or an eternity in hell.And that leads me to another delicate topic that often arises in critiques of Mr. Skal's work: his supposed \\"gay perspective.\\" Depending on the reviewer this is either so over-the-top that it detracts from the topic at hand, or so minimal as to be non-existent.I'm hetero and politically conservative and I've never felt that David was stridently pushing any personal gay agenda, or, conversely, ignoring the obvious facts of its existence and influence on society. This is purely my opinion, but in David Skal I read a man who's come to see his orientation as a fact and, just maybe, a blessing. He's certainly made peace with it himself and, I think, invites others to do so as well.Personally, I've never been offended or felt put upon and I think he does justice to the notion that there will come a time when being gay or straight is no more remarkable, or remarked upon, than the color of one's tie or whether or not one chooses to drive a hummer versus a hybrid. It will just \\"be.\\" I encourage readers to put aside any consideration of sexual dynamics or politics and just read the words as they're written on the page. Your consideration of them will be more rewarding if you don't waste time mentally debating whether the author is advocating (or ignoring) any particular agenda. But enough; let's move on.Another critique is David's review of the Hollywood take on Halloween. Some think this also detracts from the \\"pure\\" aspects of the Halloween holiday and, again, I'm not sure there is such a thing. But consider: film horror is definitely David's forte, so could he have honestly bypassed the medium that's been so instrumental in forming our current concept of what Halloween was and is?In the chapter \\"Halloween on Screen,\\" David does more than just review John Carpenter's \\"Halloween\\" and instead points out the many references to the holiday in everything from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" to \\"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown!\\" (Concerning \\"Halloween\\" here's an amusing bit of trivia -the now-famous mask worn my Michael Myers was a soft-vinyl mask of William Shatner as \\"Star Trek's\\" Captain Kirk with the face painted white and the brown hair retained! Personally, I'll never look at \\"Star Trek\\" the same way again...)The one criticism I do have of the book is that it could have made more frequent use of footnotes. There's a healthy (and interesting) \\"Notes\\" section at the end, broken down by chapters; I would have liked it if this had been integrated into the text, so as to see where a particular reference was being used. But that's a minor suggestion and one I understand many readers would find distracting.All-in-all, David's book is an excellent and enjoyable read for a holiday that's, relatively, new. I heartily recommend it and predict that it will someday be recognized as a seminal and authentic account of the rise of the holiday that eclipses Christmas."},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"When it comes to HALLOWEEN, I am extremely enthusiastic about it! That's why I bought this book. This book talks about HALLOWEEN's dark history when it started 3,000 years ago with the Ancient Celts. It talks about the Witches at the Salem Witch Trials. It talks about haunted houses. Classic horror films, inspired by HALLOWEEN. It mentions a guy named Ronald Clark O' Bryan who poisoned his son's HALLOWEEN candy in 1974. It has classic pictures of how HALLOWEEN looked in the 18th and 19th and 20th century. It talks about the HALLOWEEN film series. It talks about Devil's Night when stupid teens set fire to thousands of buildings. It talks about Day of the Dead, the Mexican holiday similar to HALLOWEEN that celebrate the lives of dead relatives. All this and more is mentioned. If you are a big fan of the dark holiday known as HALLOWEEN, you'll love DEATH MAKES A HOLIDAY: A CULTURAL HISTORY OF HALLOWEEN!!!"},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"I made it through the vapid introduction and most of the way through the first chapter before skipping around and skimming here and there. Skal's writing is rather boring, and by page 40, I still had no grasp on his meandering portrait of Halloween. He seemed to be trying to keep the short-attention span crowd entertained with his whimsically peppered history lessons, but unfortunately he leaves the rest of us behind. How disappointing."},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"In this short history of America's second-most popular holiday, author Skal examines several ways Halloween has influenced our culture. After first attempting to disprove some of our favorite legends about the holiday (there is apparently no evidence that Jack O'Lanterns originated in Celtic Europe, as many assume), Skal tells us of the strange way the Salem witch trials have been co-opted by enterprising New-Agers in modern Salem, Mass. He also leads us through several decades of American haunted house building and takes us into the middle of clashes over gay rights during San Francisco's Halloween street parades. Finally, he comprehensively takes us through 90 years of Halloween at the movies and, in what are perhaps his most compelling observations, Skal examines how the attacks of September 11 affected the holiday and what it all means for America. Like any good cultural history, there are also many intertwining references to other curious information which leave you wanting to know more. An informational and enjoyable read to get you in a spooky mood."},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"I've never been much of a Hallowe'en lover, but I did enjoy this look at the different cultural aspects of the holiday, from the origins of the holiday to the haunted house industry, even the look at the John Carpenter movies, which I've never seen and don't intend to. The look at Salem's \\"witch industry\\" is fascinating. Skal doesn't make any great conclusions or add anything new to the mix, but it's an interesting take on the various ways Hallowe'en has been celebrated--and vilified--over the years."},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"This book doesn't live up to its billing.Although there is a bit about the origin of Halloween and its evolvement over the centuries;it's pretty superficial and not developed.Far too much of the book is about the degutting of Halloween and the movie industry and its horror films since the 1930's.Halloween is about one particular day ,while the stuff this book is padded with is just horror , ghost material and the version put out by the Martha Stewart mentality.An in depth effort on Halloween would take much more research than displayed and purported to be a \\"cultural history\\".This book has about as much depth about Halloween as a book about Frosty the Snowman would have about Christmas.But then again,people who see Christmas as a commercialized holiday of nothing more than festive lights and gifts might feel this book tells all there is about Halloween.A more appropiate title for this book might have been\\"The dismantling and misreprentation of Halloween since the 1930's\\""},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"Anyone who has read \\"The Battle for Christmas\\" by Stephen Nissenbaum and is looking for a companion book for Halloween...run.

Skal emphasizes in his subtitle that it's a cultural history, not just a straight history because as you will learn after reading the book that documentation isn't available to provide the necessary links between each tradition that's formed (as of yet). So, Skal makes up for the lack of information by focusing upon other aspects of the holiday such as how it was celebrated in various parts of the US, how immigrants shaped the holiday, & how it's been commercialized to the point of losing its eerie legacy underneath all the plastic & officially licensed costumes.I rather liked his efforts to the defend the holiday & to destroy the myths associated with the holiday such as the ever present fear of poisoned candy. Currently, the worst case of candy being poisoned was from a father who put cyanide into his own son's candy & let him die to collect insurance money. Now that's scary! Also, I enjoyed his analysis of Halloween films, but overall the book seemed choppy, not knowing where to go next or what to focus upon.I recommend it for its basic study of the history of Halloween, but I do hope a more complete text will be written in the future."},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"I found that this book was more like a series of articles lumped into a book, all dealing with Halloween, naturally, but in different ways. While I did enjoy the book, it just seemed to go from one point to another without a lot of continuity. While I know it is hard to really know everything there is to know about the history of Halloween, and that there's not a lot of information about it, I still think that it still could've been larger.Intro - The Candy Man's Tale - Talks about the urban legends of razor blades and poisoning in candies, and then how it eventually became a reality, and its long-reaching effects on the media's and parents' attitudes towards trick-or-treating.One - The Halloween Machine - The real history, and subsequent commercialization. This is where pretty much all the \\"old\\" history is at - the rest of the book is considerably modern-day.Two - The Witch's Teat - The chapter that reads like a Salem, Massachusetts guidebook. (The other reviews were dead right!)Three - Home is Where the Hearse Is - Behind the scenes of famous haunted houses and haunt-builders, with influences and haunted houses' effects on the holiday of Halloween.Four - The Devil on Castro Street - Halloween and the LGBT community identityFive - Halloween on Screen - Halloween-based horror movies, with plot summaries of all the Halloween movies as wellAfterword - September 11 and October 31 - 9/11/01's connection of reinstilling the fear of death into the American mindWith looking at a quick description of each chapter, do you really wonder why I would think it seems very hodge-podge? I did enjoy it, but it definitely needed a lot more cohesion to make it seem like a complete book."},{"Title":"Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween","review":"In a somewhat dilettantish fashion, David Skal's literary contribution to the Halloween universe serves up bite-sized morsels of information in a \\"something for everyone\\" formulaic tradition. However, much like the cache of \\"Trick-or-Treat\\" candy that lasts until Thanksgiving, some of the bits are definitely better than others (if ONLY there were more Milky Way bars and less DUM-DUM suckers in the bag!Anyway... I tend to view this book as a kind of \\"gateway\\" text that whets the appetite for more detailed information on specific aspects of the holiday. I enjoyed reading about the semi-opaque origins of All Hallow's Eve, plausibly reflecting prehistoric Celtic and Roman traditions. I also enjoyed some of the comparisons and contrasts that were presented between Halloween and \\"Day of the Dead\\" celebrations in Mexico. Skal's chapters on the Salem Witch Trials, and the LGBT Halloween perspective from San Francisco's Castro district were also insightful and interesting. However, I tend to agree with one of the other reviewers in regard to the chapter on Halloween/horror films; Skal myopically focuses in on the ENTIRE \\"Halloween - Michael Myers\\" series of films, when perhaps he should have just written about the initial film and then moved on.Despite having minor flaws, I felt that this book was a decent, albeit somewhat nebulous, reflection on the uncanny American phenomenon of Halloween."},{"Title":"England in the eighteenth century, (Pelican history of England)","review":"J.H. Plumb is a master historian who writes here a general introduction to the period he knows best , England in the 18th century. The book is divided into three parts, the first the Age of Walpole, the second The Age of Chatham, and the third the Age of Pitt. Plumb discusses the general social and economic background of the period, and provides real insight into its moving spirits, and their tone. He favorably cites DeFoe on the importance of Trade for England. And he gives a real sense of the dynamism of England in this time. He discusses the various economic players from the merchant princes to the simple landless agricultural workers. He provides an interesting picture of the way England looked and worked at the time, from the pot- holed broken roads to the rapidly expanding water- routes which facilitated trade. He writes of the great agricultural estates, the movement towards enclosure of the land, the hard fate of the peasants and lower classes in general. The energy of the Age in expansion of literacy and means of communication, the hunger for knowledge are also part of the picture. The technical innovations which were often sought out beforehand to solve a problem, and which in some way improved life are also written about. The craftsman and the artisans were ' the bridge of life'between rich and poor. Plumb also writes about the British relations to Ireland and India, about their foreign policy and the vast expansion of the Empire through War. He concludes with a look at the complicated and difficult situation Britain is in at the end of this remarkable period of its development."},{"Title":"England in the eighteenth century, (Pelican history of England)","review":"The book has three parts-- the Ages of Walpole, 1714-1742, of Chatham, 1742-1784, and Pitt, 1784-1815, the prime ministers. Bishops became politicians. Clerical life attracted the younger sons of the nobility, the gentry.Walpole was energetic. He sought power. His temperament and will were suited to the office of Prime Minister. Walpole reorganized the customs system. By 1726 England was more or less at war with Spain. In 1729 he made the Treaty of Seville with Spain. In 1737 Queen Caroline died. For ten years she had been Walpole's most loyal ally. Walpole resigned in 1742 and was dead three years later. Under Walpole there had been rapid expansion of British trade. Early industrialists were supported by a canal system.In the Age of Chatham there was rapid change in agriculture. There were social consequences to the industrial revolution. There was a problem with rural poverty. In the towns there were commissions to carry out governmental and social functions. London and provincial towns were clean and orderly. Factories and mines hired children as workers. They didn't have that ingrained antipathy to factory work. The factory system spread slowly. Craft and the old domestic system survived.Wesley's parents were Tories. Methodism was for the poor. Brutality of life, a constant sense of death, was an inner tragedy providing the emotional core of Methodism. It gave its adherents emotional release and a sense of purpose.Priestly and Cavendish dominated the scientific world of the 18th century, Reynolds the artistic world, and Dr. Johnson the literary world. Priestly isolated oxygen. He discovered the Law of Inverse Squares.Pitt entered the government in 1746. He had great gifts, a manic-depressive functioning as the mouthpiece of destiny. John Wilkes and George III clashed. The American Revolutionary War was a war of incompetence on both sides. By the time of Cornwallis's surrender in 1781, Britain's situation was desperate.In the intensification of the industrial revolution, roads, ships, and ports imporved. Population grew. Wealth was not diffused. Most people remained in the position of the laboring poor. Rural poverty was more widespread than urban poverty. William Pitt was one of the greatest peace ministers. By 1815, after battling Napoleon for twenty years, Britian verged on bankruptcy and social revolution.This compact history constitutes a succinct treatment of British progress."},{"Title":"Rumble Fish","review":"Rusty-James is 14 and idolizes his older brother, the Motorcycle Boy.

I've read all of her previous (solo) Witch World volumes at least three times each, and my very favorites, probably nine or ten times (the first four WW novels plus 'Year of the Unicorn'). Therefore, I feel qualified to comment on Norton's use of her previously developed characters in this volume. They came across as wooden: like someone had found a set of puppets in an old trunk in the attic, dusted them off, and strutted them across a very familiar stage. I was disappointed (to say in the least). Here were all of my old friends, together at last, and acting as though they would really rather be somewhere else.However, even if I'd known in advance that I was going to be disappointed, I still would have read the book, just to find out how Hilarion, Simon Tregarth and his family, and the Were-riders were getting along. All of you real Witch World fans will have to do the same. Buy the book. Read it. Bid Witch World 'Hail and Farewell'.More unsolicited advice for old Norton fans: Don't buy any of the imitation Witch Worlds that were authored by collaborators, even if Norton's name appears on the cover. No matter how good the writing, it's not Norton and it's not Witch World."},{"Title":"The Warding of Witch World (Secrets of the Witch World)","review":"I, too, had suspicions that Norton was not the sole author of this book. Or at least, she didn't reread a lot of her previous stuff when she wrote it, because discrepancies abound. There are names misspelt (Joison?), people's appearances and coloring change, changing backstories, etc. etc. Some things were just plain inaccurate. For instance, Kethan says that he and Aylinn are not related by blood, when in fact they are cousins, according to &quot;The Jargoon Pard&quot;. And in that book, his nature gifts were read as &quot;Magician&quot; where here he is Warrior. And so forth. We don't get much backstory on Firdun and Uta, either. It feels rushed, and repetitive. There are still some good things, though, and it is a must-read, I guess, for fans. But doesn't she have an editor? A lot of the mistakes could have been caught at the editing stage, and the carelessness looks like indifference to the fans of the books."},{"Title":"The Warding of Witch World (Secrets of the Witch World)","review":"To critique an Andre Norton book, one must critique Ms. Norton. She is a most remarkable and compassionate woman, the very finast of story tellers ( every sentence and page are action-filled with no &quot;apologetic&quot;explanmatory paragraphs that insult the reader's intelligence and delay the plot; every page continues the plot with no meandering and, Ms. Norton knows how to end a story. It crescendos to the end; it does not dribble. She, and the 100+ books she has solo-authored aremagnificent.Ward of the Witch World continues this tradition. Most all the characters and locations from other epics are brought together, and there are at least three separate tales combined; a feast for the Witch-World lover. The characters are well vexposed, internally and externally. Thwew is perhaps more &quot;spirituality&quot; accorded to them but it does not slow the plot pace. Each sentence is so packed with the explanmatory verbs, adjectives and gerunds. New is the flavor of romanmce between several of her characters; not awkwardly as some of her co-authors have attempted, but &quot;neatly&quot;.

It is wonderful to get closure on all of my friends. I wondered what happened to Hillarion and Kathrea it is great to know they are still alive and the timeline is finally evident to us.

An easier read than many of the books in the series and is true to her style of good conquering evil but the stories are a little too mellow from the Norton I first read years ago. The suspense is much shorter lived than in many of her earlier works. Evil never really seems on the verge of triumphing as it always did, you just seem to know that everything is going to be all right in the end. Add to this the fact that there are too many characters instead of the concentration on one or two that was characteristic of the Norton of old and you have a very tame book. There is no empathy because you never really get to know the players in the game.

All our old friends are gathered here, Simon, Jaelithe, Kaththea, Kyllan, Joison, Kerovan, Gillian, Herrel, Koris and more but it is their children who face the test.

Will be loved by all of Norton's fans, but I do not recommend reading this book if you have not read at least one of the other Witch World books."},{"Title":"The Warding of Witch World (Secrets of the Witch World)","review":"I think the editorial process must have been skipped in this book. Although it's great to have all of my favorite characters back in one book a *lot* of the names are spelled wrong. I saw someone else said that Aylinn and Kethan are cousins. I don't remember that from The Jargoon Pard at all so I guess people do forget some things."},{"Title":"The Warding of Witch World (Secrets of the Witch World)","review":"this book was so awful. i want to know is norton's editor? the book was full of embarrassing grammatical and spelling errors. as the story progressed, i developed some suspicion that norton was not the sole author, that it was actually ghost-written by at least two others, it was all so dijointed and choppy. there were three different story lines, each of which would have made a mediocre short story, but as a book, it just dragged on and on... i kept waiting for the book to get good, but it never did. i can't believe this is supposed to be &quot;epic&quot; fantasy."},{"Title":"The Warding of Witch World (Secrets of the Witch World)","review":"because of boredom.

However I found this Vol 2 (1939-55) an enthralling read. It covers his life during the second world war and then later in Vietnam and Africa. There is a bit too much about his lovesick affair with Mrs Walston (a peculiar arrangment and a bit uninteresting at times) The record of his war service and his time in publishing is fascinating.I guess if you have read the books and are already a fan then this biography is even more valuable. The life of G.G. is a novel in itself,full of colour,sadness and bravery.These biographies can be turgid in the wrong hands but Sherry only uses the details necessary to tell a vivid story.His prose is excellent and flows along. A very enjoyable read and it made want to get reading the novels-and Vol3 which is due in 2000 I believe."},{"Title":"The Life of Graham Greene: Volume II: 1939-1955","review":"If you grew up in the fifties reading blockbuster novels and watching hit movies based on Graham Greene's books, you will be fascinated reading about the man behind the stories.If a three-volume biography is more than you want to read about anyone, you will be more than satisfied reading the second volume of this trilogy. It covers the most productive years of Graham Greene, the man who wrote \\"The Power and The Glory,\\" \\"The Third Man,\\" \\"Our Man In Cuba,\\" and \\"The Quiet American\\" to name just a very few; these years (1939 - 1955) are also the most interesting and challenging years for the western world in modern history. The second volume does contain an introduction which encapsulates the first volume.Norman Sherry's writing is a bit uneven, some quite good, but much fairly mediocre. The good news is that Sherry tends to devote chapters to one of three facets of Greene's life: his literature; his relationships; and, his public/private world of adventures in Africa and spying for the British.If one does not particularly care to read about his relationships, it is easy to skim a particular chapter. If one is interested in additional background to the British double spy Kim Philby, one can read slowly a chapter devoted to the relationship between Greene and Philby. It is hard to believe that Graham worked directly for Philby and may have remained in the service of her royal majesty even after Philby fled the country.It is even more difficult to believe that one man could pack so much into one lifetime: trekking across Africa because of his fascination with Joseph Conrad; seeing his house destroyed during the German blitz of London; converting to Catholicism for the sake of his first wife; hobnobbing with the major authors and film stars of the era (everyone from Truman Capote to Ingrid Bergman). At the end of the second volume, after you have read about a man who packed more into one lifetime than seems humanly possible, Norman Sherry tells the reader that Graham has \\"thirty-six more years wheeling obsessively round the world, compelled it would seem to wander the earth until death.\\"I knew nothing about Graham Greene before I randomly picked up this book (I was not reading novels in the 1950's) and I was barely aware of something called \\"The Power and the Glory,\\" which, by the way, resulted in a private audience with the pope for Graham Greene. I am so fascinated by him after reading this second volume, I will now read at least one of his novels.Deeply discounted soft cover copies are readily available. Try the second volume; if you enjoy it you may want to have the three-volume hardcover trilogy in your library."},{"Title":"The Life of Graham Greene: Volume II: 1939-1955","review":"Sadly, even in death Greene, the master at secrecy, again succeeds at keeping his official, authorized biography at a much distance from himself and his life. Coming in at a bit over 500 pages of primary text, Vol. II is thankfully about 225 pages shorter than the much-too-long Vol. I. But since it covers only about 16 years as opposed to 35 years in Vol. I, each year averages nearly 30 pages. As with Vol. I, this edition needs to be pruned. The middle portion of Vol. II, covering Greene's problems in love (with his wife, first major mistress, and mistress #2) from about 1944-1950, is a jumbled, boring mess. This approximately 150 page section is filled with far too many excerpts from Greene's pathetically repetitive letters to his long-suffering wife and first mistress, and to the new love (who will be replaced in Vol. III). Instead of covering this period chronologically, Sherry separates out portions of Greene's life based on what he was doing (e.g., the period in the 1940s when he was a publisher) and then goes back in time for the next major life activity. This ensures that both Greene's work on two of his major novels (The Heart of the Matter and The End of the Affair) and even his messed up love life are not addressed in a coherent section. Sherry again relies far too heavily on using Greene's fictional works as primary sources to substantiate his suppositions about Greene's life, as well as Greene's not-to-be-trusted autobiographical works. Fortunately Sherry admits early on that Greene went out of his way to make any biography difficult. For example, Greene sometimes kept two sets of diary entries (one edited, one truthful) and often destroyed the truthful entries. So the reader is warned that the biographer's task was not one of cooperation with the subject, but attempting to cut through the subject's distortions and attempts to keep everything revealing hidden. Unfortunately, since Sherry still had Vol. III to go, it seems like he deliberately chooses not to probe too deeply about far too many interesting issues (e.g., What was Greene talking about when describing a hospitalization tied to his genitals bleeding? And the issue of cigarette-burning sado-masochism?). The best and easily most readible portions of the work are those addressing WWII, especially the various bombings of London, and Greene's travels in Malaya, Vietnam, and Kenya. Thankfully that means the first and last 200 or so pages are most readible, if not always as revealing as such a massive work implies!"},{"Title":"The Life of Graham Greene: Volume II: 1939-1955","review":"Norman Sherry did an excellent job of chronicling some of the most facinating phases of Graham Greene's personal and professional life. While I found vol. 1 to be a bit slow and often uninteresting at times, vol. 2 really gives great insight into the period of Greene's most productive and important years.I'm eagerly awaiting vol. 3 to see how well Sherry tells the life of one of the more important authors of the Twentieth Century."},{"Title":"The Life of Graham Greene: Volume II: 1939-1955","review":"Sherry's &quot;biography&quot; is saved only by its topic: Graham Greene, a man whose life was so interesting that even Sherry's ineptitude can't quite get in the way.The flaws in this work abound but of import are the consistent failures by Sherry to dive into anything that would or could possibly reveal &quot;too much&quot; about a man that even Sherry admits, was notorious for not revealing much of anyhting to anyone.Dreams that beg to be discussed are described and then abandoned as topics, health concerns (Green's hemorage surely deserves some comment, doesn't it? - or have I missed it amid the insesent repetions by Sherry that The Power and the Glory was Grenne's &quot;best work&quot; - understood that the first three times Sherry said it)and refrences to one of Green's acknowledged &quot;masters&quot; (Conrad) are offered up, and then, dropped like hot rocks.To make matters worse, one is treated to such sparkling gems of &quot;thought&quot; as (to paraphrase) that the insurgents in malaya were fighting against the &quot;benificent&quot; British and their colonial puppets - surely, greene, a man on the side of the &quot;underdog&quot; (regardless of said dog's politics)had something else in mind? Or is this more of the ex-spys double-talk? Using Sherry as a source, one will never know.Given Greene's penchent for opacity, it should come as no suprise to anyone who knows anything about the man, that having chosen his own &quot;man in biography&quot; that Greene should have played Sherry for his own purposes.As a source-work for Greene's own material, and as an illsutration of what can happen to an author upon achieving &quot;success&quot; the book is useful.Beyond that, stick to Greene's own work. You'll be far better served.Sincerely,A Reader"},{"Title":"The Image Makers Source - Madison Avenue Handbook","review":"blablablabl bla blab lbabal lablbf alsuir aldk jrua ke ueu ano seu nao sei de nada"},{"Title":"High Fit, Low Fat Vegetarian","review":"I own both the High Fit - Low Fat cookbooks (regular and vegetarian).

It won't help you either if you are looking for techniques on writing for games. However, it is invaluable for people in the business or who plan entering it, covering even ways to promote yourself and your work.I was unsure about rating it 3 or 4 stars, because other books do manage to cover both the business and the craft.

This is because it is my experience that if a piece of software does come with a manual, no matter how big it is, it usually doesn't include what you want to know, or, if it does, it's not easy to find. Sadly, I feel that this is the case with DREAMWEAVER MX 2004: THE MISSING MANUAL. I am an experienced webmaster, so I am looking to Dreamweaver MX 2004 to help enhance the skills I already have. In turn, I looked to the Missing Manual to help me unlock the things that I wanted to do with MX. With books such as these, you should be able to skip around by looking in the index and find what you want to do, which in my case was to do an image rollover using an image map. The book, looking at the listings that were in the index, was no help. Maybe if I read the book cover to cover I'd figure out what I needed to know by the time that the Red Sox won another World Series (oh let that be next year!). By contrast, I looked on the website for the Hands On Training H-O-T books (lynda.com) and they actually had a free sample chapter on image rollovers. The chapter didn't cover exactly what I wanted to do, but it did give me enough instructiion that I was able to figure everything out within 10 minutes. I have bought the H-O-T book, and suggest that before you buy this Missing Manual that you look at, and consider, the H-O-T book. You may be better off."},{"Title":"Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Missing Manual","review":"This is really a great book for learning DW. I was especially impressed with the last 150 pages or so that explained, using good tutorials, how to create dynamic sites that use live data from databases.The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the author did not mention 3 things that are essential to getting your dynamic site to work well, or even at all.1) You must make sure that you have assigned Internet Guest Account rights to the database file and folder in which it resides (&lt;machinename>\\\\IUSR_&lt;machinename>).2) You should use a DSN-less connection to your database. It is *much* more stable and reliable. Basically, you create a custom connection using a string that you can find by a Google search and forget the DSN stuff.3) Be sure that your database does not contain any field names that are \\"restricted.\\" I had a field called YEAR and it prevented me from adding or updating information. Again, a Google search will give you list of these names.If I had known these three things in advance, it would have saved me hours."},{"Title":"Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Missing Manual","review":"So many software books are so confusing and difficult to understand, I really appreciateone that is clear and truly helpful, which this one is."},{"Title":"Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Missing Manual","review":"Having created a website using Dreamweaver MX 2004 using just the included Help, I was frustrated because I couldn't figure out how to create specific aspects that I knew were possible.

Plus it gives a lot of outside the box info such as where you can get great Dreamweaver extensions which are absolutely essential to dynamic websites. It even gives instruction on using some of those extensions which you can't get anywhere else. It is the type of book that makes a lot of assumptions that you know and have used Dreamweaver and that you know your programming language pretty well. So I wouldn't advise it for beginners.

I have about half a dozen other books on Dreamweaver. I can throw them all away and just use 'The Missing Manual\\". I can't say enough about it. Well written, easy to understand, takes you step by step through many procedures that I had trouble with previously. This book was worth twice the price! In my opinion, this is the book that should be used as the text book in college. Not the overpriced manual that was required when I took the course, still have, and useless as a reference guide.If you want to learn Dreamweaver, Get this book!

There were a couple of lessons where I skipped right to the tutorial, a couple where I didn't feel that I needed to go through the tutorial, and some where I went through both.Don't be intimidated by the size of the book (800+ pages), it is not dry or boring.

Just buy it and you will see what I mean."},{"Title":"Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Missing Manual","review":"I've been designing web sites for a number of years now and my program of choice was Adobe GoLive. However, I recently decided to switch to Dreamweaver MX 2004 because I wanted to take advantage of the program's advanced CSS and CSS-P capabilities. But I waited to make the switch until I knew this &quot;Missing Manual&quot; was available. I'd heard it was going to be released, and because I already own some other &quot;Missing&quot; titles, I instinctively knew this would be the book to get.I wasn't disappointed. This book is EXCELLENT, both for newcomers to web design with Dreamweaver, but also for &quot;switchers&quot; like myself, who have experience with web design, but not with Dreamweaver. The book takes a step by step approach.Some of Dreamweaver's features overlap with GoLive's, and some are common to all visual web editors; but that doesn't matter. You'll still enjoy reading this book, and you'll pick up lots of useful tips along the way.The tutorials are PRICELESS. You simply download the files from the book's web site, and work through them, step by step, with the author holding your hand all the way. I really like the approach: learn the features, then learn to use them in a tutorial.One very small caveat is that if you are looking for EXTENSIVE coverage on CSS layouts (without tables), you won't find it here. Yes, there is a chapter on how to lay out pages with nothing but CSS positioning, and there is a tutorial, which are a wonderful start to the subject. But you'll need something like &quot;Eric Meyer on CSS&quot; in order to take your CSS layout skills to the max.This book easily deserves the 5 stars I gave it."},{"Title":"Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Missing Manual","review":"The slogan of the Missing Manual series is \\"The book that should have been in the box\\" and Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Missing Manual lives up to the series' reputation. Macromedia wouldn't want to ship this book with the software because it's a doorstop at 800 pages. Imagine what it would do to the packaging and the pricing of the already expensive software.One itsy bitsy negative, but this book is not the only one avoiding it. Dreamweaver's help file doesn't cover it and neither does the forum on Macromedia's Web site. There is a feature called download stats listing the size of the file and the time it would take to download it. At what speed? 56k? T1? What? I would assume 56k, but assumptions are not reliable.At 800 pages, you can expect all the features to be covered through step-by-step instructions, notes, and screen shots. The hard core stuff like building dynamic Web pages, working with databases, and using server programming within Dreamweaver are all there for those ready for a challenge.McFarland goes the extra mile to note differences between computer systems (Mac vs. PCs) and browsers (compatibility). Looking at the table of contents is proof of the book's completeness and all I need to do is attest to its readability. First timers to creating a Web site or to Dreamweaver as well as owners of earlier versions will gain plenty of knowledge from this one."},{"Title":"Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Missing Manual","review":"Trying to figure out how to work my Captain Video decoder ring is as close to programming as I'd ever gotten. (Dates me, I know.) So I figured I was relegated to \\"The Cosmically Clueless Fool's Guide to Dreamweaver MX\\". Until I found out about this \\"Missing Manual\\" series. Since most software manuals seem to be written by idiot savants for whom English is only marginally considered to be a functional language, I was amazed when I started with this thing. It is totally engaging, terrifically well written, very easy to follow, as logical as Spock, and comprehensive without descending into the anesthetizing world of Geekdom. In a word, it is... fun! It seems that every nuance of DWMX is touched on with patience, a total concern for reader understanding, and quite frequently with humor. The tutorials are excellent - everything laid out carefully and clearly step-by-step. I cannot imagine a manual of such breadth being more user-friendly for the rank amateur as well as for the, well.... rank professional. A total delight! My advice to anyone contemplating Dreamweaver or this manual - don't be intimidated. This is a manual written and designed the way manuals should be. Kudos to Mr. McFarland and Pogue!"},{"Title":"Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Missing Manual","review":"I am almost done with David McFarland's book. I have read through it sequentially (and done each tutorial). It is easily one of the best software \\"how-to\\" manuals I've read. I've tried a few Dreamweaver sources (Lowery's Bible is also very good) and I do agree with another reviewer that Lynda.com has a great book and online movie tutorial, also. McFarland provides, for me, the ideal mix of discussion/reference and tutorial. For example, \\"forms\\" and \\"templates\\" are really boring if you just try to read about them - but his brief tutorials really work to get you through the basics. He gives broad coverage of Dreamweaver MX 2004; unlike some other books in this category that are really about Studio, this is limited to Dreamweaver with about one chapter on Flash integration.The book is static HTML (more or less) until the last 150 pages or so, when he introduces dynamic databased connections - an area that I would NEVER understand with the Macromedia online help alone. I just finished the first couple of tutorials on dynamic database, and I am really impressed - I got through with no problems and a really good understanding. They have given the steps a real attention to detail here, little things, like noting a minor dialog glitch that might throw users off. Another great little innovation. At the end of each step, he explains what he's going to do next - a little thing that makes a big difference. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Missing Manual","review":"The Dreamweaver MX 2004 book is, as its series title says, the &quot;missing manual.&quot; The Missing Manual series is a highly respected and popular technological series, edited and managed by David Pogue, and published by Pogue Press in cooperation with O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Incorporated. This book was written by David Sawyer McFarland.The Dreamweaver MX 2004 book is targeted at beginners--or people with just a little experience--and even web design experts. &quot;The Missing Manual&quot; series of books has never failed to be good, even great, so I was looking forward to reviewing this book.Out of the starting gate, organization is a key factor in the book's layout. A clear, easy-to-follow table of contents provides a quick reference to parts of the book the reader may or may not want to jump right into or skip completely, depending, of course, on the reader's experience level. This table of contents is followed by a short introduction chapter which tells what's new in Dreamweaver, describes differences, or parallels, between HTML and XHTML, and explains a little bit about cascading style sheets (CSS).Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Missing Manual continues this great organization by separating the book into six distinct sections: Part 1, Building a Web Page; Part 2, Building a Better Web Page; Part 3, Bringing Your Pages to Life; Part 4, Building a Web Site; Part 5, Dreamweaver Power, and finally, Part 6, Dynamic Dreamweaver. The progression from Part 1 to Part 4 is a great help to beginners, and the final two parts provide much assistance to beginners moving into the expert zone of webmastering.What I found to be the best feature of the book was the supplemental material and resources offered by the author. They are available at the author's website in the form of downloadable files, tutorials, and several links to other websites for even more help and answers. However, the feature that is perhaps the most useful is the capability to link to a working example of the web pages you are supposed to build and actually see a live model in action as comparison.The fonts used, Formata and Minion, and the layout of Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Missing Manual were very easy to read and follow--easy on the eyes, at least to mine. There is one thing, though. In future editions, I would like to see spiral binding so that the book could lay open when using it at the computer, especially when referring back and forth from the book to my computer screen. I had to apply different methods of holding the book open, i.e., cordless phones, clipping heavy pens to the pages, etc., and this was just inconvenient.Bottom line: Does the book live up to its title? Yes. Do I recommend Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Missing Manual? Yes."},{"Title":"Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Missing Manual","review":"You will not be disappointed with this book. I have read about 12 different Dreamweaver books over the past 4 years, and so far this is the best I have seen.After reading this book, I sat wondering why other software books are not written nearly as well. This book is chuck full of so much important, useful, interesting and inspiring information that I will be looking for other books in this series as well as keeping an eye out for other books authored by McFarland.One of the great things with this book is that it is meat, but with a great flow to each of the areas covered - its not just information, but extremely well put together and well written. There is an intro to each section that is not overly wordy. There are many sections where there are step by step instructions. A number of the chapters have a tutorial toward the end (over 130 pages - the cover says) for the reader to practice what they have just learned directly with Dreamweaver.Another extremely helpful aspect to this book that I rarely if ever find in others is that almost ever 3rd or 4th page has a box with some very cool \\"Boy am I glad you told me about that\\" info. They are entitled \\"Power Users; Clinic\\" and \\"Workaround Workshop\\". The book would be worth it just for the gold mine of very rich bits and pieces of powerful tips and tricks to use. A great deal of thought went into each one of these blocks of info, as has the entire book.The screen prints are not overly used, but when they are they are very relavent. I have been content to read most of the book without even turning on my computer, because of the fine job of ample description and images.If you are going to be waiting around to find something related to Studio 8, keep this book in mind when they update it for that version."},{"Title":"Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Missing Manual","review":"This book gives step-by-step tutorials (comes with a CD) that walk you through everything from some basic HTML to database interfacing and CSS.

The author has structured this text in a way that allows a reader to get started using the software, and create web pages. He explains things thoughtfully and speaks to the beginner.

I see it as the Strunk &amp; White of sculling--a pithy volume that answers all your questions and then some.Boyne has a gift for explaining the nuts-n-bolts of rowing, but he is just as illuminating when addressing the more abstract and intangible aspects of the sport.The drawings by Ellen Kennelly are also very helpful and well done.I would reccommend this book to any level of sculler and any athlete."},{"Title":"Essential Sculling: An Introduction to Basic Strokes, Equipment, Boat Handling, Technique, and Power","review":"I recently took up sculling and very much enjoyed this book.

On the water as in prose, Dan Boyne never drills you with a particular rowing style. He is one of thse few coaches which adapt themselves to the rower, instead of coercing a particular style. I don't mean to imply that anything goes. Fundamentals such as correct body posture are well stressed, on the water and in the book. But for more experienced scullers, his approach to coaching is more holistic and synthetic instead of a deconstructive and analytic. Synthesizing the techniques outlined in the book, the sculler is motivated to the next level of performance. This book is great for beginners and experienced scullers alike, and especially for scullers intent on progressing in a sport which requires much practice, dedication, and expert coaching."},{"Title":"100 Q&A; About Panic Disorder (100 Questions & Answers)","review":"For those with friends, neighbours, colleagues and clients who have this paralysing panic problem, this is THE book that helps them - and fast.

Her home was in the Penna. German country and this is a work of historical fiction based on actual events in the town of Bethlehem PA during a period of unrest between the Native Americans and the settlers of Eastern PA. The town is still known for following Moravian Christmas traditions, building elaborate creches combining natural materials with figurines representing the participants in the Christmas story and celebrating with the music of brass bands and a communal meal of coffee and sweet buns.These traditions are woven into a simple but suspenseful story of a young girl who cares for yet younger children in the \\"Children's House\\" (which is rather like a boarding school and/or orphanage run by the Moravian Church). One clearly sees Moravian principles at work in this story, for the heroine struggles with fear of a possible attack and her friendship with some of the \\"Christian Indians.\\" Now and then a choice of words may jar a bit, but for a book of it's period, this is a sensitive work which uses children's love of the holiday season to break down stereotypes on several fronts without a sense of preachiness or political correctness. The charming illustrations are based on traditional folk art and will help readers unfamiliar with the period or culture appreciate that world.Useful to teachers for colonial life, Penna. history, Christmas traditions, and encouraging self understanding."},{"Title":"The Everything Cartooning Book: Create Unique And Inspired Cartoons For Fun And Profit (Everything (Hobbies & Games))","review":"I've spent months looking over all the books on cartooning I could get my hands on.

With admirable thoroughness, Patarca Montero has assembled, categorized and organized a decade of CFS research (up to the year 2000). Patarca has left no topic out, from AIDS (which has no bearing on CFS) to Yersinia (which also has no bearing on CFS). Fortunately, he covers everything in between--most of which, thankfully, does have bearing on CFS. However, it is Patarca's failing that in his zeal to leave nothing out, he makes no distinction between research that is relevant and research which isn't.If you are looking for EVERYTHING that has been published--the good, the bad, and the ugly--you will find it all among these pages. (Although, if you want to save time and energy, I'd recommend bypassing the contents and going straight to the Notes section.) To be fair, Patarca devotes most of this book to legitimate research on immune system dysfunction, neuroendocrine system abnormalities, the role of viruses in CFS etiology, symptoms, etc. However, Patarca also includes some deeply flawed studies, with a credulity that makes you wonder if he understands what he is reading. Under \\"Quality of Life\\", for example, Patarca states (without a hint of irony) that \\"quality of life correlates with the hypochondriacal disposition of CFS patients toward illness.\\" To back up this ridiculous assertion, he cites a 1996 NIH-funded study published by Manu, Affleck et al in the journal, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics. (It is well worth mentioning here that the first author of the study was a consultant for Metlife Insurance Company. Due to his blatant conflict of interests, anything Manu has published concerning CFS must automatically be treated as irreparably biased.) From a political perspective I find this sort of study interesting. Apparently, the NIH felt a greater need to spend our tax dollars proving that people with CFS were imagining things than it did to track down, let's say, a retrovirus that might have caused CFS and which, having been left unchecked for 25 years, might currently be contaminating the nation's blood supply. However,apart from documenting the woeful political history of CFS, the uncritical inclusion of such shoddy, ill-conceived \\"research\\" is shameful.It is equally as reprehensible for Patarca Montero to include \\"fatigue state\\" studies in a book about CFS. Research which is based on self-reported \\"fatigue\\" has absolutely no relevance to CFS. Aside from the fact that self-reporting is not a valid criterion in a medical study (why bother having a case definition if nobody is going to use it?), fatigue is not the defining characteristic of CFS. Post-exertional malaise, that is, a worsening of all symptoms after physical or mental exertion, is what distinguishes CFS from \\"fatigue states.\\" The fact that Patarca does not distinguish between the two simply adds confusion, and obfuscates the solid research that has been conducted using the CFS case definition (particularly the Canadian case definition, which includes physical findings).As useful as this book might be for researchers, I would not recommend it to either doctors or patients. The lack of \\"quality control\\" will leave doctors with a confusing, meaningless and often contradictory jumble of statistics. Patients will also be frustrated by the plethora of uninterpreted information. If you are looking for a fairly short introduction to the disease process itself, I would recommend Dr. Bell's book, Cellular Hypoxia and Neuro-Immune Fatigue. If you are a patient looking for practical advice, read Hope and Help for CFS as well as CFS: A Treatment Guide. And if you would like to delve more deeply into the physiological aspects of CFS, The Clinical and Scientific Basis of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome edited by Jay Goldstein and Byron Hyde is still the most cogent and useful publication available."},{"Title":"Yo amo a mi mami (Narrativas Hispanicas) (Spanish Edition)","review":"This book will keep you entertained since the start. I couldn't put it down. This is the first time I read one of Baylys books and I am going to get my second one. He is great! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Yo amo a mi mami (Narrativas Hispanicas) (Spanish Edition)","review":"\\"Yo amo a mi mami\\" remains in my mind engraved as Bayly's finest novel. As I read it, each page unraveled with a novelty unmatched in my experience as a reader. The freshness of expression and the compelling immediacy of the stories contained in this novel not only are representative of where I come from but are also emblematic of my generation and are truly a gift to the world.The novel's many captivating characters live in Peru, where I grew up in the late 80's and early 90's, watching Bayly (then in his early 20's) on TV, playing the role of late night talkshow host to millions of addicted fans who reveled as he made a fool of himself and other local and international celebrities through self-deprecation and sarcasm. Like him, I experienced directly and indirectly the social ills and wonders of Peru, which he portrays with great range in \\"Yo amo a mi mami.\\"In Peru, Bayly's TV persona has always been referred to as \\"TV's terrible child,\\" even now that he is in his early 40's. TV's Bayly is deftly sardonic but I, like many who watched him, I'm sure, never imagined that he would someday channel his unique brand of humor and powers of observation into literature, much less that he would do so so amazingly well. He never seemed to have the emotional maturity I thought was necessary to write a great novel, a comedy perhaps but not a literary novel. However, learned I have that he has whatever it is one needs to be a masterful, relevant and exciting writer, an artist who can write beautifully, insightfully and compellingly about the things he knows to be true, to depart--as he admittedly does--from his own history and nakedness and go on to construct a work of art that takes him beyond his own limitations. (One only needs to watch his TV show to realize that the writer and the TV persona are at times as far apart as wit and meticulousness are from folly and arrogance--I imagine TV's Bayly, in typical self-deprecating fashion, would agree.)In reading Bayly's previous novels, I always found that the drama and fun lied in the erratic, often self-destructive journey his main protagonists typically went on, characteristics akin to the author's own very public struggles; however, in \\"Yo amo a mi mami,\\" Bayly, like Jimmy, the novel's main protagonist and narrator, appears to embark on a journey of self-discovery. We are introduced to Jimmy's main childhood characters, divided into the two families that raised him: his financially rich but emotionally detached biological family--a rude, aloof, workaholic father and a puritanical, emotionally unreliable, seemingly drug-addicted mother, for starters--and his meek but emotionally and spiritually rich family of choice, the nurturing servants with whom he spent most of his time growing up--a fun, hard-working and often-noble bunch of characters.Bayly truly finds himself as a writer here as he decribes and contrasts, through sharp, agile and often-hilarious dialogue and prose, the faces and stories of innocence, ignorance, cynicism, kindness and grace that inhabited Jimmy's world through his adolescence and shaped who he became later--something ultimately left for the reader to imagine. The characters in this novel felt uniquely human (funny, poignant, sad, you name it), revealing and freeing to me. They, at Bayly's command, validated the reality of my childhood and teenage years--as well as my aspirations as an adult--in a credible, deeply moving and powerful way.I won't say Yo amo a mi mami is a flawless novel; it isn't. The format he uses resembles that of memoirs while the chapters can read like short stories, each uniquely captivating in its own right, but lacking a strong unifying interconnection. Also, minor narrative inconsistencies pop up, but all of these issues are merely a reminder that the writer is human after all, a good, much-needed reminder to all those entranced with the overall superb quality of this novel--and Bayly's \\"nino terrible de la TV\\" fame. It is easily one of the top ten books I've ever read, Bayly's best so far for sure, though I have a feeling it won't be his best for long."},{"Title":"Yo amo a mi mami (Narrativas Hispanicas) (Spanish Edition)","review":"I know the people of whom Jaime Bayly writes in 'Yo Amo a mi Mami' - read it and wept, and then started reading it again.

Specifically, I cannot repeat the second word in the title--even in the context of the book's title! (Same thing happened on NPR's website.) I was simply repeating the word as part of the title and in no way was using it derrogatorily to describe clandestine border crossers. But that's not good enough for Moderator Kafka! So when I protested that another favorable review ALSO included the word in question and was still on the website, Amazon goes and deletes that too! The end result is that what is actually a good book which I recommend, now has NO favorable reviews for the shoppers to read! Bad policy.Peter Laufer's unmentionable (are we in the movie Z or what?) book is a good but flawed book which many times reads like a travel book and unnecessarily stretches from Tijuana, Mexico all the way to Cairo . . . Egypt! In my original review, I was critical of its failings but also recognized its strengths. For example, a sociologist and an economist (David Coffey of the University of Kentucy and James Smith of the RAND Corp.) point out studies they undertook which demolish the Nativist paranoia, but then the author fails to include where to find said studies--and that is crucial. Also included here are quotes from nativist militia types like Arizona's Simcox in all their absurdity and paranoia. The review also served as a rebuttal to the racist, emotional, fact-free, and pathetic \\"reviews\\" of Lloyd Eskildson of Phoenix and \\"US Infidel\\" of MD. It is often amazing to see the denial and hostility toward fact and the perpetration of falsehoods."},{"Title":"Wetback Nation: The Case for Opening the Mexican-American Border","review":"Peter Laufer wants to open the Mexican-American border because the U.S. economy \\"desperately needs the workers\\" and to stop the deaths incurred crossing the Arizona desert.Former Governor Lamm, however, hit the nail on the head when he stated that the U.S. cannot absorb all the millions of poor peoples that want in.America's decades-long laxity in deterring illegal Mexican aliens from entering our nation has created nine serious, and growing problems:1)Substantial and disproportionate increase in violent and drug-related crimes - at least twice the rate of the general population, according to government statistics.2)Substantially increased crowding, traffic, pollution, housing costs, and demands on already strained natural resources.Census estimates show that at least half of U.S. population growth is due to recent immigrants and their very high birth-rates, and that immigrants (mostly Mexican illegals) and their children will account for about a 100 million population increase in the next 50 years, resulting in Hispanics (mostly illegals and their progeny) comprising about 25% of U.S. population.3)Decreased wages and opportunities for law-abiding Americans, particularly those most vulnerable - the poor.Examples: Far fewer Americans are now employed in housing than previously, even in relatively skilled areas such as carpentry, tile-setting, heavy machinery operation, etc. Other areas with substantial illegal inroads include manufacturing, transportation, hospitality, and food-service. A recent study by a leading economist in this area concluded that immigration costs U.S. men an average of $1,700/year.4)Increased opportunity for terrorists to become absorbed within U.S. communities due to their physical similarity to many within the large and increasing numbers of illegal Mexicans, and ease of accompanying them across the U.S. border.5)Increased government-funded healthcare costs - Hispanics in general are about twice as likely to be uninsured, and illegals undoubtedly much higher; their high rate of reproduction acerbates the topic.6)Increased education problems and costs due to the large numbers of illegal Mexican alien children and the children of illegals - eg. millions of non-English speaking students and dropout rates about 2.5 that of the rest of the U.S. population. (Mexico's 9 - 10 million indigenous people, about one-tenth of the population and a large proportion of illegals, have the highest rates of illiteracy and disease in the country.)7)Increased fragmentation of U.S. society due particularly to illegal Mexican aliens' general unwillingness to assimilate - learn English, accept historic American values (eg. families and legitimacy, importance of education), while also pursuing voting rights in Mexico. When combined with American's litigious nature, substantially increased claims of \\"racism\\" and divisiveness associated with efforts to increase their share of better jobs, housing, etc. will also be created.8)An estimated $10- 30 billion in funds annually sent back to Mexico - deflating the American economy and adding to our \\"trade deficit.\\" In addition, much of what is earned by these workers is not taxed - further adding to America's problems.9)All of Mexico's most lucrative corporate sectors - oil, finance, media and telecommunications, heavy industry, luxury hotels, transportation - are controlled by a small, clubby, light-skinned market-dominant minority. America's tolerance of illegals fleeing Mexican discrimination only allows it to continue. (Per Amy Chua, author of \\"World on Fire.\\")Bottom Line: The U.S. will degenerate into an overcrowded, poor, crime-ridden, \\"third-world, low-wage copy of Mexico unless U.S. border enforcement substantially improves. It is true that both Republicans and Democrats have played games with this issue. Nonetheless, illegals are a burden that the U.S. cannot afford."},{"Title":"Wetback Nation: The Case for Opening the Mexican-American Border","review":"I put this vile book back on the shelf almost as soon as I picked it up.

Let HIM pay health care costs of illegals in emergency rooms. Let HIS children sit in \\"bilingual\\" classrooms crammed with tens of Hispanic kids who don't know a word of English, who will drop out and join a gang at the age of 15.

She died with dignity and courage at the age of fifty-three, succumbing to diabetes, blindness, and, finally, cancer.It was Joyce who convinced her mother to write the famliy history, knowing she had taken copious notes about their roots from her grandmother during a bedridden bout of scarlet fever back in 1927.The story begins in 1850, with great-grandfather bringing his family from Germany and settling in Illinois - where he died of cancer in 1875 - and ends over a century later, in 1987.

In addition, the two female leads (one is the narrator's sometimes lover) are two of the most obnoxious characters I have read in some time---totally unsympathetic!! Worse than all of that, frankly, is the fact that this author just loves &quot;potty talk&quot;, in bed, out of bed, wherever!! Every bodily orifice is discussed in detail. The heroine(?) vomits on what seems every few pages. After making love she asks whether she farted all night while she slept, saying she had a flatulence problem.

What an offputting book Gorman has written!!"},{"Title":"Voodoo Moon","review":"Absolutely loved it. So many twists and turns in the story plot. I could not wait to return to reading it."},{"Title":"Voodoo Moon","review":"This book, set in a small Iowa town where things tend to move slow, progresses at a fast clip. Furthermore, unlike many of the bumpy roads of rural Iowa, the passage is smooth and efficient. Robert Payne is an ex-FBI agent that specialized in psychological profiling.Brenner, Iowa is a small town with one main claim to criminal fame. Over three decades ago patient Paul Renard burned down Sterling Psychiatric Hospital and when he was fleeing witnesses spotted him falling into a rapids where he was presumed killed, although no body was ever recovered. A young woman was recently killed and the prime suspect, a young man named Rick Hennessey, claims that he killed her but he is not responsible because he is possessed by the spirit of Renard.There are many unusual characters to thicken and muddy the plot. Two sisters, one a psychic and the other the host of a syndicated television show that exploits the psychic powers are in town. Payne has worked with the psychic in the past and they are now lovers. A producer of the show is so driven to increase the falling ratings that he shoots at Payne and the stars for publicity and is possessively in love with the host to the point where he could be considered a stalker. There is also a mysterious private detective that snoops around with no discernable purpose. An old rural clich&eacute; is developed and exploited, as there is a crazy woman kept secluded in the attic of a house and her circumstances have some bearing on the case.Surrounding the mix of unusual characters are many of the more traditional ones, a beautiful chief of police with an unsightly scar on her face, another town cop with little affection for FBI agents and the usual cantankerous people found in all small midwestern towns.Given the breadth and depth of the characters, there are many options for the storyline, including many of the usual suspects path lines. However, Gorman weaves the options so well that the reality is well hidden and not revealed until the very end. As is the case with many of the best murder mysteries with usual suspects and normal people the usual becomes the unusual. I enjoyed this book and as a lifelong residence of the Cedar Rapids area, enjoyed the references to the nuances of living in a small town in Iowa."},{"Title":"Voodoo Moon","review":"Over thirty ago, voodoo practitioner Paul Renard permanently shook up the town of Brenner, Iowa when he burned down sterling Psychiatric Hospital, killing over twenty people. The killings were as gross as anyone can remember. To the fear of everyone, the lunatic escaped, leaving behind voodoo symbols. Though seen once over the subsequent years, Renard was never caught.Just when the townsfolk started to feel safe, a new string of voodoo killings occur. TV Psychic Tandy West asks her former lover ex-FBI profiler Robert Payne to help find the murderer. Instead of a simple and clear case, Robert finds a town without pity filled with individuals who want their personal pasts burned away like Renard did to humans three decades ago.The fourth Payne tale is an intriguing thriller that stars an entertaining lead protagonist who readers will enjoy observing in action. The story line places elements of the psychological thriller inside a modern day gothic tale. When the plot veers towards a gothic, it seems to sputter, but when talented Ed Gorman stays within the psychological path, the exciting tale is faster than a SST. Overall, the return of Payne, especially glimpses into his personal side, turns this into a fine novel that fans of the series will enjoy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Building with Nature: Inspiration for the Arts and Crafts Home","review":"This is the first book to truly explore the origins of the American Arts & Crafts Movement.

His twisted mind makes many of his works enjoyable. I recommend this book to many people."},{"Title":"The Tell-Tale Heart","review":"Within The Tale-Tale Heart, a disfigured old man becomes the object of the narrator's wrath. With precision the narrator sneaks into the old man's home and kills him because of a grotesque eye that has obsessed the narrator. Through the narrator's actions, Poe destroys &quot;the external universe as usually perceived and eradicates the barriers erected by time, space and self. With the destruction of the reasoned world, the world of the imagination can take over [allowing] Poe to confuse sight and sound, sight and smell, fire and water, life and death, and the various other elements which man's reason keeps apart or regars as polarities&quot; (Ketterer 28). Through the narrator's slow creeping motion into the old man's room (which lasts hours), Poe is able to not only alter reality, but also our concept of time.As in The Black Cat, the narrator in this story also leads the police to the body. However, it is not an outside force that leads to his capture, it is his own mental state. &quot;In the conclusion of the story, the ringing in the madman's ears first is fancied, then later becomes distinct, then is discovered to be so definite that it is erroneously accorded external actuality, and finally grows to such obsessive proportions that it drives the criminal into an emotional and physical frenzy&quot; (Howarth 97). The beating of the old man's heart that the narrator hears in his mind is an distortion of his reality. The man's heart is not actually beating, but the narrator is convinced that he hears the sound because Poe has created a sound illusion. Reality and illusion in this story merge to create a new world where anything is possible, even the beating of a dead man's heart."},{"Title":"The Tell-Tale Heart","review":"The Tell Tale Heart, as many of Poe's stories, takes us on a trip through the extremities of the narrator's mind. This un-named and unexplored narrator has obsession with an old man's eye. He see's the eye as different from his other and calls it evil. His excessive compulsive disorder takes him to the old man's apartment every night at midnight and very slowly and carfully looks in to see the eye, when he doesn't see it, he goes away as slowly and as carefully as he came. He does this until one night the old man is up and hears the creepy narrator coming to his house unaware of who it is. He is shaking with fear his heart pounding, and then the narrator shines the light on the wide open evil eye. The mad-man kills the poor old man and does unmentionable things to his corpse. This is not the end of the story. Finally, the police come and start to question the narrator. To convince them, the mad-man invites them to stay for tea after they find him innocent. The narrator starts going more insane and hears his own heart beating, but thinks its the dead old man. He finally fesses up to the crime, and is sentenced to death."},{"Title":"The Tell-Tale Heart","review":"i love this kind of story even though this book's not for adult like me. the story is of disease mad man who feels that the disease has sharpened my sense- not desroyed and not dulled them. isn't it awesome ?"},{"Title":"The Tell-Tale Heart","review":"Edgar Allan Poe knows how bring the reader completly into the story.

We see the scenes through his eyes. We realize how he is mad and we sink with him in his mistakes. It's his madness which makes him hear the old man's heart.

There were something wrong with his head, that was true,he was crazy. So the policeman shouldn't put him to death, they aould send him to a doctor. What about the old man? Did he do something wrong? He died like that? I don't like the ending of the story,and I don't think it's enteresting.

All throughout the eighties, it grew, mutated, and spread like a cross between the most virulent urban legend and a cancer. Now, at the dawn of a new set of numbers on the cosmic odometer, the 'fact' that the normal behavior of Satanists is to kill, molest, mutilate, and destroy has been accepted by everyone from religious fanatics to police officers to some of the would-be Satanists themselves.As a result, we are beginning to reap the whirlwind of self-fulfilling prophecy, while innocent day-care providers still languish in prison on false molestation charges and any kid who dares to wear black to school is set upon by legions of counselors and shrinks.This book is the first and best rebuttal to the Satanic Network Theory that I have come across. If it were widely read it could do a lot towards helping law enforcement officials avoid making jackasses of themselves due to religious prejudice."},{"Title":"In Pursuit of Satan: The Police and the Occult","review":"The Communists, the traditional demon-designees, went by the wayside. Lo and behold, an alternative was found, none other than the Prince of Darkness himself! The author does a thorough job of exposing the cult-like obsession with alleged cults, Dungeons and Dragons, and various teen rebellions, which they, the cult cops and their disciples, with a comical lack of evidence, have made into a global, multi-generational conspiracy of devil-worshipping cannibals. Indeed, it's such a thorough job that this ain't no 2 1/2 hour read, but it's scholarly and well-researched. If nothing else, it may lead one to ask: at what point does government (i.e., police) intervention become inappropriate and a manifestation of a police state? The book is from the early '90s. If you think then that it's dated, note that the with hunt trial, in which a young man in Arkansas was condemned to death--partially on the word of a cult-cup whom the book exposes--because he dresses in black and listens to Metallica took place in 1996. No, the threat is still there, and gaining steam! Finally--and the only fun I can get out of the real threat the witch hunt represents--is on the obsession with the game Dungeons and Dragons: picture a group of leftists terrified that their kids playing monopoly would convert them into conservative Republicans.

The pies herein are scrumptious to look at, and I can attest to the fact that they are easy as, well, pie, to make!Chattman has a loosey-goosey, conversational style in her text, but this is clearly a woman who knows her way around the kitchen. When she tells the reader what to do, she doesn't just say, &quot;Do it&quot;--she explains her thinking and experience behind the directive. This makes you feel that you're in capable hands, as indeed you are.I really liked the additions of crust and sauce recipes. I was particularly intrigued by the inclusion of a crust recipe which uses crunched-up ice cream cones as the main ingredient--what a simple yet brilliant idea (wish I'd come up with it myself!). There are old favorites in here, as well as desserts with a new twist: Pumpkin Mousse Pie, Pi&ntilde;a Colada Pie, White Chocolate Ganache and Banana Pie, Ricotta Cream Pie with Blood Oranges, Couscous and Apricot Pudding Pie, and so on. The more traditional pies include Rich Chocolate Mousse Pie, Chocolate-Mint Sorbet Pie, Coffee Heath Bar Ice Cream Pie, and even a yumilicious-looking S'Mores Pie.This slim but well-researched volume is an excellent choice as a hostess gift for the folks with whom you're going on vacation--or as a special treat for your favorite dessert-maker. Everything in here looks do-able, and the results are very, very good in every way."},{"Title":"Icebox Pies (Non)","review":"The description of no-bake and no-fail pies is a bit misleading, since about half (if you exclude the ice cream pies) of pie fillings have to be cooked in a pot on the stove. However, it is true that these pies always work no matter how clumsy you are in the kitchen. You must leave these pies in the refrigerator or freezer for several hours to finish the recipes. Most of all, they taste good and are easy to do, since you never bake them.I am glad somone wrote this book. The whole spectrum of old fashioned pies that do not get baked has virtually disappeared; to get a recipe, you will need to consult a cookbook that is at least 30 years old. This is ashame, as many of these pies are easy to do and taste fabulous, and are definitely worth doing in your home (but probably not as a restaurant dessert). There is a lot of history in this collection of pie recipes.The first chapter has 15 recipes for pie crusts. Fortunately for us clumsy people, all of them are based on cookies or crackers that you crush in a food processor. No doughs or rolling pins here. You just press it into a pie pan and bake for a few minutes. My complaint here is that all of them are either very sweet (from using packaged cookies, which is very clever) or strongly flavored (from graham crackers). I could not find one that was relatively neutral in flavor.There are roughly 70 or so pie recipes. They include mousses and custards (20), chocolate (17), fruit (10), ice cream (17), showstoppers (7). The crusts and finishing touches are listed as suggestions at the end of each pie filling recipe, so you get to choose what you want and can vary them if you want. The fillings are mainly based on cornstarch (custards and pastry cream), whipped cream (cream pies), whipped egg whites, and gelatin (variously bavarian cream, chiffons, mousses, etc., although the author does not always use these terms as appropriate). There are many varied fillings, including a few cheesecakes and some fruit pies.My complaints are few. Some of the caption texts are pastel colored fonts which are sometimes hard to read. Some of the cooking procedures are unusual and called for extra steps, but are easy to follow and always worked. There is also an occassional lack of detail in the procedures, such as making caramel or mixing melted chocolate into a cold substrate like whipped cream."},{"Title":"Icebox Pies (Non)","review":"I collect cookbooks and this is one of the best!

I recently purchased Icebox Pies by Lauren Chattman, and have been delighted with this book.Icebox Pies has colorful pictures of numerous decadent pies, all either chilled or frozen. There are recipes for 15 easy to make crumb crusts, which are much quicker than the rolled kind. Of course there is a plain old graham cracker crust which all of us need to make from time to time, but the boring stops there and the remaining crust recipes are much more exciting. The fillings are innovative and absolutely mouthwatering - there is something for every taste here. Ms. Chattman has even included toppings and garnishes so that the pies are suitable for serving at any dinner--from a simple and casual family barbecue to a fancy dinner party.Besides the colorful pictures, I like the comments on each recipe which give suggestions on ingredients or helpful hints on each particular recipe. The book is well-written and organized. There is an introduction that gives information on the making of icebox pies and also describes icebox pie ingredients. The table of Contents and Index are both excellent.Although most of the recipes are quick and easy, they don't call for disgusting convenience foods like frozen whipped topping. Ms. Chattman is a real chef and knows what good food is supposed to taste like. She has used her imagination to come up with beautiful, decadent pies that have a minimum of ingredients and can be made ahead.

Though there are a large number of CDs of this music available, the texts, translation, and especially the scores of these songs are difficult to find, often not being included (or not very fully included) in CD liner notes. (Maybe I should insert here that my viewpoint is that of a general listener to this music and reader of its lyrics as poetry, so I can't speak on the subject with scholarly expertise.) A Medieval Songbook is the only book I know which makes a serious attempt to collect these songs with singing scores and English translations in an edition not designed solely for specialists. The selection, limited to troubadours and trouv&egrave;res,includes most of the most frequently recorded songs from this repertoire. Each song is given in the original language, with a serviceable English translation designed to match the music, and singing scores giving the melody, chord symbols, and simple accompaniment. Also included are brief notes on the songs, a guide to pronunciation, and biographical(or in many cases legendary) sketches of the composers. All in all, this book is of fundamental value to performers and will be very useful to serious fans of the music, especially if they know even a little Old French or Provencal and are interested in the literature of those languages. The book's main drawback, which does not seriously impair its usefulness, is that physically it seems rather amateurishly produced, with the scores looking obviously hand-written, though they are clear enough. If the book had been written today (it was published in 1982), no doubt the current availability of music scoring software would have made it easier to include more attractively printed scores. Most unfortunately, this book has been long out of print and seems to be available used only at outrageously high \\"collectable\\" prices."},{"Title":"Knives: Points of Interest, Book 3","review":"Jim Weyer is well known in the custom knife world for his superb photographs, most notably in the monthly Blade magazine.

But it IS appealling, a character study of delicacy and truth, so full of recognition that the pages turn themselves. Maxwell understands silences, the things unsaid in an evening of chatter, the state of armed truce that is the architecture of a respectable life, better than almost anyone. Eudora Welty calls it his &quot;integrity&quot;. It is a good word.In the suffocating provincialism of 1912 mid-western America, town lawyer Austin King is undone through his own decency. Through his patience, his sense of propriety, his unwillingness to recognise the grasping motives of others, he unwittingly betrays his family and all but destroys himself.People in the landscape of Draperville, Illinois, dream of escape, have visions of what might now be called &quot;authentic lives&quot;. But the centripetal pull of respectability, the complex web of family duty, entraps them all. The most ardent dreamer is young Nora Potter, whose infatuation with Austin King gives this story its fever and throws all other relationships into relief.The characters are beautifully drawn. Nora's obsession, which she sees as liberating, wreaks instead its inevitable destruction. Austin King, faithful to the belief that steadfast, if unimaginative goodness, will be rewarded in kind, is both noble and tragic. The minor characters are equally real. The interior world of the King's four year old daughter Abbey is the most convincing evocation of early childhood I have ever read.In many ways, though, the story is Martha's. Austin's role-bound wife, pregnant with their second child, hears the town's talk, yet copes better with Austin's apparent affair, than she could with his seamless virtue. The final page is hers, a denouement of such chilling and tender clarity it reminds me of the interior monologue that closes James Joyce's &quot;The Dead&quot;.Whatever Maxwell seems to claim, this IS a book about love, and about its many shapes. Perhaps his truest opinion he entrusts to a minor character, the horse trader Danforth, deaf from an early age, who has long abandoned all thought of human intimacy. With no expectation of it, love comes anyway. It abides, and is beautiful.So is this book."},{"Title":"TIME WILL DARKEN IT.","review":"The world is the less for the death of William Maxwell at age 91 last year. His prose is restrained and precise. He knows the use of silence on the page; his dialogue convinces both in the words and the spaces between the words. I read in a profile of Maxwell in the New Yorker that he wrote this novel's numerous short chapters by deciding which characters hadn't talked together for a while in the story, and getting them together. I liked that thought. Whether true or not, in reading this novel one enters two different times -- 1948 when Maxwell wrote it and the 1912 Midwest he recreates. I can't imagine something this quiet and directed being written in these frenetic times. It is a wander through memory, but -- thanks to Maxwell's careful rendering -- better than memory for it is sharp, accurate and sure.Still, I can't give this novel a five star rating. As much as I like Maxwell, his writing and the obvious care he took to get the language exactly right, a craftsman at work, the key characters don't really convince me. Nora is much too shallow to captivate, confuse or immobilize someone like Austin. Meanwhile, Austin himself is, in some parts of the novel, too smart, too dogged in the flashback of his pursuit of Martha, to also be as easily duped or unfeeling as he is drawn in others.Here's a final recommendation, though -- when the final scene arrives for each character, and they pass through the novel for the last time, one cares about each one and what happens in the unknown next that extends beyond the last page."},{"Title":"TIME WILL DARKEN IT.","review":"Maxwell's Time Will Darken It is among the most rewarding and satisfying reading experiences I have ever had.

The title is taken from an excerpt from an art book describing techniques of landscape painting and that is exactly what the novel is: a richly, landscaped view of life. Maxwell's imagery leaves the reader feeling such a part of the world of Elm Street that it is truly heartbreaking to leave it and return to the present. Maxwell's use of light and shadow is outstanding and even the slightest and most obscure of characters (as well as inanimate objects and even insects) are crafted with intimate details. Everyone seems to have voice, color and emotion. There is an artistic term called chiaroscuro which describes the contrasts of shading of light and dark within a painting and that term encapsulates the book as well. Maxwell's characters are rendered clearly, but without moral judgment - there is no right and wrong or black and white. In it's place are a thousand variations of emotional color. While not a novel of action - admittedly not much of great consequence actually takes place - this is a novel of intense beauty and outstanding characterization.

Maxwell's characters, so pure of heart and full of good intentions, nonetheless find themselves alone, or pining after loves that can never be, or bound up in marriages of profound, unspoken, disappointment. There are, certainly, moments of hope: the tender bond between Martha and her young daughter Abbey; the sweet story of Dr. Danforth's love affair in his autumn years; the unrequited puppy love between Randolph and Mary Caroline. But Maxwell's concern here seems largely to be with illusion and unfulfilled dreams. These are not novel literary themes, and yet he manages to put a fresh twist on them. The novel sweeps gracefully through time; the prose is as lucid and evocative as any writer's I've read, and Maxwell occasionally offers up such piercing insights into human nature that the reader is forced to go back and read passages a second, and even a third time. Time Will Darken It is a sweet, thoughtful and beautiful novel and I would highly recommend it to anyone.

Either it smothers under tons of academic pretension, or it is retailed as pop entertainment in poetry slams. It seems sometimes that Robert Pinsky is the only one with a good handle on the popular appeal of this emotional/intellectual art. But I bet you Pinsky has this book and refers to it regularly. This is the most hard-headed, economical poetry criticism, completely free of cant and pretension; equally free of stylishness. Zukovsky gives us, as Donald Barthelme once wrote, &quot;the red meat on the rug.&quot; The form of the book is disarmingly simple: Selected quotes, side by side, with the occasional footnote. Zukovsky lets you figure things out yourself, and when you refer to his notes, you are nearly always rewarded with the notion that you and he are at least on the same planet when it comes to deciding what is good and what is not so good about poetry. Some of the selections in Middle English or Scots dialect are tough going, but you soon discover that it is as much sound as meaning that is important. In any event, there are plentiful and helpful footnotes. If you're lucky, you've never read any poetry criticism and can leap into this book unbiased and unafraid. If (like your reviewer) you had to read a lot of it in college, you'll feel positively liberated."},{"Title":"Test of Poetry","review":"I agree completely with the previous reviewer. If I'd known about this book during the years I spent teaching poetry to college freshmen, I'd have adopted some of Zukofsky's gut-level approach. Throw away your preconceptions indeed! Zukofsky encourages you - no, forces you - to decide for yourself what's great, what's good, and what's not so hot. And why. It is beneficially disorienting to see poems whose titles, authors, and dates are identified only in the index: there's no subtle pressure to like or dislike. Except for Z's limited, lucid commentary, you're on your own!Zukofsky's \\"test\\" is not whether poems live up to some arbitrary set of standards of excellence; it's whether they speak to the reader and how the reader subjectively explains how they do it.The poems are well selected.

In the turbulent world of mystery fiction, it is a rarity to see a mystery novel still published after forty two years.

From the ancient rituals that used to honor her to her displacement by Druidism in the fifth century BC (and her condemnation by Christianity), The Celtic Goddess traces the decline of a divine figure with scholarly accuracy and emotional heart. The Celtic Goddess is a very highly recommended, unique religious study. Also highly recommended is Claire French's The Queen Of The Silver Castle (...) in which she retells the story of Rhiannon and Pwyll for younger readers."},{"Title":"Celtic Goddess (P)","review":"This was a very good book and I enjoyed reading it. I would have given it five stars if it wasn't for the title. The title led me to believe it would be about Goddesses from all the Celtic lands, the bulk of the book (from page 70 on) was about the women in the Mabinogion. The only other problem I have with this book is that it uses Robert Graves, whose work is deeply flawed,as a source.This leads to inacuracies in the book. For instance, the Celtic triple Goddess was never Maiden, Mother and Crone, but rather three Mothers, or three Maidens or three Crones. Despite these two problems I do recommend the book."},{"Title":"Celtic Goddess (P)","review":"The title suggests that this book would talk about the Celtic Goddess, and answer the question as to whether she is a Great Queen or Demon Witch. The book doesn't answer that question, although it reviews Celtic Goddess as they are portrayed in the Mabinogion (pages 69- 187) and Irish folklore, but in the end, I didn't think she answer the question. Another nit pick is that she relays heavily on Robert Graves THE WHITE GODDESS, and ignores the facts that the Celtic Goddesses were not necessarily Mother, Maiden, and Crone - that they might be the Three Maters.In the book she tries to discount Jean Markales WOMAN OF THE CELTS proposal that the Celts might have been a Matriarchal Society.Little things in this book just stood out like Mor Rigan (for The Morrigan). The study of Lugh/Lew and Bran-I think she spent way to much time on the Celtic Gods. And Lastly she spend time on the Legend of King Arthur. I didn't neccearliy agree with her understanding of Rhiannon - How she might have been a form of Epona-and possibly the Morrigan.Some of her arguments are very unclear and didn't complete follow where she was going. I understood that she wanted to show the development of the Celtic Goddess to Demon Witch but she fails.There are some good things in this book, but it's not the first book that I would pick up if I was to start my journey into mythology. Before you read this book you should have an understanding of the MABINOGION and Irish Folklore."},{"Title":"Piano Concerto No. 10 in E-Flat Major for Two Pianos, K. 365 (Kalmus Edition)","review":"I picked this one up after hearing the 3rd movement on the Amadeus Soundtrack.

Unlike most Bible commentators, Wierzbicka does not paraphrase what Jesus said. That is, she does not just replace Jesus' images by other new images, but in plain and simple words she makes explicit the meanings of those images, the presuppositions contained in what Jesus said, the implied negations and refutations, the implicatures, in one word: the deeper intentions of God's acting in and through Jesus. Her greatest merit is that she does not lead us, readers and believers, away from Jesus' words, but again and again takes us back to them with the fuller understanding enabled by her explications. Both for lay people and theologians her universal language, which is based on years of detailed research in many different languages and cultures, is the key to open the meaning of it all"},{"Title":"What Did Jesus Mean?: Explaining the Sermon on the Mount and the Parables in Simple and Universal Human Concepts","review":"Wierzbicka has relly succeede to make sence of linguistics with this book. She has been able to take away the layers that writers and translators have put on Jesus' words; the layers that have been influenced by time and culture. The book is good for everyone who want to know what Jesus really meant and for anybody who is interested in semantics and theology."},{"Title":"What Did Jesus Mean?: Explaining the Sermon on the Mount and the Parables in Simple and Universal Human Concepts","review":"Although this book is also concerned with linguistics, the meditation on Jesus' words is done with such evident spiritual care that the lay person looking for devotional reading will be amply rewarded. I read a lot of work on biblical criticism, and Wierzbicka is terrific on Jesus and women and on the originality of his admonition to turn the other cheek. Wierzbicka canvasses many of the arguments of biblical critics on all points and offers her own, reasoned assessment on the authenticity and meaning of the words."},{"Title":"What Did Jesus Mean?: Explaining the Sermon on the Mount and the Parables in Simple and Universal Human Concepts","review":"I am still reading this book, but have tremendous admiration for the author, being a Roman Catholic Slav, as she is, and an ANU linguistics student, with a keen interest in semantics."},{"Title":"What Did Jesus Mean?: Explaining the Sermon on the Mount and the Parables in Simple and Universal Human Concepts","review":"This is one of the better books I've read on the parables of Jesus and the sermon on the mount. It has helped me in preaching. As I read about the parable of the Good Samaritan, I felt like I was hearing the meaning of the parable in a fresh, clear, and uncluttered way or as the author says, \\"in simple and universal human concepts.\\" It helped me to preach a sermon on the Good Samaritan in a fresh, clear, and uncluttered way."},{"Title":"What Did Jesus Mean?: Explaining the Sermon on the Mount and the Parables in Simple and Universal Human Concepts","review":"It distresses me not to be able to write a rave review for this book. Linguistics and religious language are two of the subjects that I am most deeply interested in, and I'm well trained in both; the need for clarity in religious language is a cause that matters greatly to me. I greatly admire the work of Wierzbicka, who is a superb scholar. I should have loved this book. Unfortunately, I didn't. That doesn't mean that it's not a valuable and important book, with all the necessary scholarly bells and whistles. It's all those things; I'm glad I have it on my bookshelf.

The author provides professional advice, along with showing the day to day life of a writer's work. I particularly liked the &quot;readings&quot; section to give students examples to emulate.

This is an easy read, but it is also useful to anyone starting out in the area of creative nonfiction who wants to pick up concrete writing tips. Especially useful is a \\"Readings\\" section at the back of the book, containing a half a dozen essays that illustrate many of the practical writing techniques presented in the first half of the book. These essays cover a diverse range of topics, ranging from bush taxis in Africa, to visiting a dying friend. Altogether a useful introduction to the genre of creative nonfiction."},{"Title":"What if Someone I know Is Gay?: Answers to Questions about Gay and Lesbian People (Plugged In)","review":"Eric Marcus has written this wonderful book for middle and early high school kids about homosexuality. Written in a question and answer format in larger print, this book tells the TRUTH to kids who might be questioning their sexuality, or might have a gay friend or family member, or are bigoted about gays. For older kids and adults, read Eric's book, &quot;Is It a Choice?&quot; It covers the same territory but in greater depth.Homosexuality is usually not discussed at a middle school level, although children can sense sexual identity differences at this age between themselves and others. This often leads to shunning, confusion, prejudice, bullying, harassment and beatings. Some gay kids even have urine and feces thrown at them or are spit upon. If you condone or excuse this behavior you become part of the problem of gay harassment and hateful behavior.The best way to avoid negative, bigoted behavior toward gays is to be proactive: buy this book for your child, your church, school, and home library. Homosexuality is a normal, natural expression of human sexuality. Let's take the lid off the pressure cooker of bigotry and become lesbigay advocates for all children everywhere. All straight, gay and questioning kids need this book's truth desperately. I highly recommend it as an educator and Lutheran church librarian."},{"Title":"What if Someone I know Is Gay?: Answers to Questions about Gay and Lesbian People (Plugged In)","review":"It's thorough, honest, easy to read, and appropriate for teens and even pre-teens.

She was also a writer. In The Little Locksmith, one of my favorite books about writing, she chronicles her writing life, which for her equals her spiritual life. In the first half of the 20th century, she made the radical choice to live alone, and to write. Her choice was incomprehensible to her beloved family, and perhaps The Little Locksmith is an explanation of sorts. It reads like a revelation. This book helped me to find my soul as a writer.

I thought it was a child's book when I was young, but couldn't read it. I just pulled it off the shelf again, and have discovered what will become one of my favorite books about hope, determination, the power of positive thinking, and art - its struggles, its blisses, its importance. It is a must read for any writer, or for that matter, any artist who struggles with stealing time to do their art without feeling somehow guilty, or fearful, or terribly isolated. It is about transcendance despite ridiculous odds. It is an amazing, amazing book. I'm so glad I got around to it."},{"Title":"The little locksmith","review":"Katharine writes with such poetic style.

After a while the repetitions become maddening and, worse, boring. At the end, one has a command of some useful sentence patterns but a very small vocabulary. You will, also, not be able to read a street sign or menu written in Greek characters. The amount of material might ordinarily be mastered in a few days before moving on to more serious grammar. I viewed this purchase as a preliminary to buying the entire course, but I have now decided against it. Combined with an elementary grammar book and supplemented with Just Listen 'N Learn Greek, Pimsleur Instant Conversation would probably be useful, but I cannot imagine even asking directions or ordering a meal after completing this course."},{"Title":"Greek (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"It is the most convenient and easiest method of learning conversational Greek that I have ever heard and seen. The method is catchy and easy to grasp, repititious and well organized. I typed my own transliterations along with the CD's and it helped the information stick in my head. This is the second set that I've purchased by Pimsleur. Very good! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Greek (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"Pimsleur has developed a method that I would call 'properly punctuated repititon', although he has his own name for it. Essentially, it is properly timed at the (statistically?) most beneficial time for retention.Being older, I forget everything that happend before yesterday, so learning a new language is particularly challenging.That said, Pimsleur's method has been very effective in helping me to learn and remember new vocabulary.Sure, with the Instant Conversation package, you get a limited vocabulary. That is to be expected, since you didn't pay for the comprehensive package.I have a half hour drive to work and it makes the drive time to work seem to go by quickly.While they recommend 30 minute lessons, and then go to the next if you think you can comprehend 80% or better, I found that (for me) it was necessary to repeat the lessons in order for me to feel comfortable with my level of learning.Nice thing about CDs, you can repeat as many times as you want.If your just starting out, and you want to (or have to) do it on your own, this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Greek (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I am a native speaker and bought this as a gift.

Each speech of Hitler is profusely cross-referenced in an extensive index, so that the researcher can find what Hitler said about just about every imaginable topic. There are also scholarly articles and books for further study. Because they, and the book itself, predate WWII, they are not colored by it. Owing to the breadth of this work, I only touch on a few issues raised by Hitler. [Of course, analyzing Hitler in no way implies agreement with him or admiration for him, and my five-star rating is for the historical value.]Consider lebensraum. Continuing this theme mentioned in MEIN KAMPF and HITLER'S SECOND BOOK, the Fuhrer repeatedly returned to this subject, as on October 1935 (p. 913-on), March 1936 (p. 1274-on), and March 1939 (p. 1586). He also reiterated the desirability of conquering Russia for lebensraum purposes (September 1936)(p. 929).A common theme of Hitler's diatribes against Jews was the hypocrisy of western nations. They extolled Jewish virtues and expressed concern about the treatment of Jews in Germany, but generally refused to accept German Jews as immigrants. (e. g., p. 729, 740). In his infamous February 1, 1939 speech, Hitler promised the destruction of Europe's Jews in the event that the \\"international Jewish financiers\\" precipitated another world war. (p. 741).Recurrent complaints about the Church not speaking out more against Nazi crimes are out of touch with reality. In fact, Hitler had threatened the Catholic Church with dire consequences for its enmity towards National Socialism--long before WWII and the Holocaust. (August 1935)(pp. 388-389). When the Catholic Church came out with the encyclical MIT BRENNENDER SORGE in March 1937, which condemned the racism in Nazi ideology as immoral, Hitler told the Church to stop trying to impose its concepts of morality on others, and basically to avoid overstepping the boundaries of church and state. (pp. 389-390). [Sound familiar?]Hitler also made many speeches that sounded conciliatory, even favorable, towards Christianity. However, this was for public consumption only. In private, he verbalized an almost-pathological hatred of Christianity. (see Peczkis review ofHitler's Table Talk: 1941 - 1944).Nazism has commonly been misunderstood as extreme conservatism. In actually, the Fuhrer attacked the German Right for such things as its blindness to Jewish rule in democracy and capitalism. (pp. 13-14, 26-27). Nor was Nazism simply conventional nationalism. In fact, Hitler scorned \\"bourgeosie nationalism\\" (pp. 93-94)--the same phrase used by Communists. Nazism was primarily a racialist ideology, as embodied by Hitler's phrase, \\"Blood and Soil.\\" (p. 992).There is no doubt that National Socialism had actually been a form of socialism. According to Hitler, the German people had to choose between physical survival and the kind of economic liberty found in western democracies. (p. 927-on). Hitler wanted a dictatorship of the German people, not the class-based rule of the bourgeoisie under capitalism or the dictatorship of the proletariat under Communism. (p. 855). He promoted the planned economy. (pp. 910-911, 914). Unlike Marxian socialism, Hitler allowed for personal property, albeit in consonance with the needs of the community. (p. 93). Hitler believed that it was nonsensical to nationalize productive industries such as the Krupp Steelworks, but he reserved the right to nationalize industries deemed inconsistent with the needs of the nation. (pp. 111-112). Hitler and his National Socialist movement consistently observed May Day. (p. 67, 739, 891). In common with all anti-capitalists, Hitler regarded common financial profit as more important than individual financial profit and, true to socialist ideation, considered individual financial profit to be egoistic. (p. 896).Hitler's views of Poland were a mass of contradictions. The refusal of Poland to return the \\"rightfully German\\" Polish Corridor was the official German pretext for attacking Poland in 1939. Earlier, Hitler had said that the Corridor was no reason for Poland and Germany to go to war (p. 1107), that it was a matter of little importance that would be forgotten within 50 years (p. 1249), etc. A year and a half before starting WWII, Hitler had reckoned the German minority in Poland as really no different from the Polish minority in Germany. (p. 1425). Finally, the Fuhrer had repeatedly said (pp. 1424-1425, 1565), most recently six months before attacking Poland (p. 1587), that Poland was too great a nation to be denied access to the sea. [Of course, had the Corridor been the real issue, as opposed to smokescreen, Germany could've seized the Corridor and left the rest of Poland alone.]"},{"Title":"Irrationalism: Lukacs and the Marxist View of Reason","review":"This work is an illuminating exposition of the sources and legacy of G. Lukacs whose History and Class Consciousness appeared like a kind of red alert on the reds at the time of the Bolshevik revolution. As Marxism began to crystallize as an incoherent dogma called 'dialectical materialism' one the few great works of Marxist philosophy appeared, and then sank from view, living an underground existence and giving birth to so-called Western Marxism.One need not be a Marxist to profit from seeing a truly slick mind at work, and from Rockmore's history of the ideas coursing through Lukacs brain as he produced this almost enigmatic work that almost cunningly blends Neo-Kantianism, Hegelianism, and a non-Engelsian historical materialism. The tactics are so brilliant, standard debunkers of Marx have seldom bothered to critique the argument, which is no doubt beset with its own problems. What I found interesting was the connection with the Neo-Kantians (and the influence of figures such as Lask and Rikert on Lukacs, this being invisible behind his reputation for &quot;Hegelian Marxism&quot;. If nothing else it is a reminder the legacy of German philosophy is so tricky that to build a revolution on it is a recipe for disaster, nobody will know what they are talking about."},{"Title":"Irrationalism: Lukacs and the Marxist View of Reason","review":"I REALLY wanted to like this book. Being one of maybe four fans of Georg Luk&aacute;cs, and there being maybe four books about Luk&aacute;cs in existence, I was craving some insight into his masterpiece History and Class Consciousness, and some kind of discussion of his never discussed The Ontology of Social Being (published posthumously).Despite the fact that Rockmore is a crystal clear writer - which is rare for someone who studies German Idealism with his intensity - the book seemed completely directionless. The first 50 or so pages are about Marx and then Engels poor creation of Marxism. While I completely agree with every idea expressed in these chapters, they are completely superfluous. 1) People buying these books (i.e., nuanced discussions of esoteric Marxists) are already privy to the conversation regarding Engels and his perversion of Marxism. 2) It adds almost nothing to the conversation about Luk&aacute;cs in general. Luk&aacute;cs offered an ingenious perspective to Marxism, be it from the Engelsian perversion, or from Marx's works alone, this back story is superfluous to the ingenuity of Luk&aacute;cs.The actual conversation about Luk&aacute;cs is so loaded with Rockmore's personal theory, that one finds it hard to belabor the rest of the book. Rockmore is adamant that Luk&aacute;cs is sneaking in neo-Kantianism, specifically the theories of Emil Lask. Even if he is, one can comprehend Luk&aacute;cs book without knowing these back stories. And presenting the philosophy of Luk&aacute;cs as these opaque back stories that Rockmore has figured out, greatly detracts from actually understanding what Luk&aacute;cs was saying; by focusing far too much on what Fichte, and Lask were saying. Instead of analyzing a line by Luk&aacute;cs that says X, we get \\"Luk&aacute;cs is really responding to X, which goes back to a philosophical debate regarding Y, Z, P, and Q, which was addressed by A, B, C, D,\\" inevitably leading to a discourse that while pretending to focus on Luk&aacute;cs, leaves Lukas's views entirely absent from the discussion.Eventually I just stopped reading the book. Maybe it picks up after page 150, but I bought the book concerned about Luk&aacute;cs, and not Fichte nor Lask."},{"Title":"New England Days (Imago Mundi Book)","review":"New England Days by Paul Caponigro (Godine, $35).For more than 40 years Paul Caponigro has been making black-and-white photographs that teach us how to \\"hear with the eyes.\\" These 76 prints-made between 1958 and 1999-portray stones, apples, trees, and the sea.

Looking at the images in this book, it's not hard to see why. Achingly beautiful is probably an apt description for some of them. These are works of simplicity, quietness and elegance presented here by high quality printing. A real treasure and a monograph I come back to often."},{"Title":"New England Days (Imago Mundi Book)","review":"I might not be utterly blown away by this book but it is growing on me. The material inside is not about impact but slow release. The book is relatively small and intimate...just like the images inside.

This book personally is driving me nuts! Never having used Maya before, I have learned a lot! BUT!!!- It is a trial of patience for a new user to go through so much content before actually having a use for it (i.e. how to customize the menu's according to your style [for more experienced users that actually have some]). Expect to read a lot and do very little at the beginning.- I really don't think these books were ever tried out on the target market(s) before hitting the press. If you make a mistake, you'll probably just have to start all over again, or try reverting to some previously saved files. They don't warn of common pit falls. I have only been able to get about 2/3 of the tutorials done.- Even if you get the tutorials done there can be extreme frustrations. For instance you make this aftershave bottle (took forever to attach the curve's, and I never knew why it finally worked the last time), and then you look at the picture the authors put together... their picture is beautiful, but hell if I know how to make mine look like that. Spent about 2 hours just trying to make glass look like glass. The Maya file is not on the CD, just the picture! Very few of the nice pictures that show you how it can look are actually on the CD so that you can figure out why it looks that way. Same for the M tutorial in chpt 16, and all the texturing examples in chpt 17! I would go on, but you should understand by now- You're on your own cowboy.- Yeah that stupid head in chapter 5 would drive a buddist monk to slamming his mouse on the desk. There is about 2.25 pages of text telling you how to make this head... I'm still trying to figure out why I it won't let me select certain Control Vertices.- The biggest thing is when I went to the users community at Alias and they told me to just buy a new book and then ask questions! They knew of this book, they have been dealing with these poor people banging out frustrations and questions based upon this book.In summary, you can learn from this book, but it comes at a cost."},{"Title":"Maya 4.5 Savvy","review":"I checked this book out at the store to see if it had much-needed tutorial updates. I have been going through Mastering Maya 3.0 for a while, and I had thought it was an acceptable book until I got to the bit about modeling a Nurbs head. Who were they writing this book for? Other Maya book authors? The way they present information in this book is to start off with kindergarten basics, and then expect you to instantaneously go from that to advanced neurosurgery at the end of the chapter. \\"Here are some blocks with different letters of the alphabet on them.

The tutorials are only helpful if you can do what they suggest already, in which case you're better off drinking tea and relaxing instead of bothering with this book.To sum up- I have a hard time understanding who they thought would benefit from Maya 4.5 Savvy.

I am fond of the the writing style that has been associated with the publishing company and couldnt wait for the book to publish. The book is organized and enjoyable to read (and im a new to 3d and MAYA). As a student in Florida studying Maya this book has me excited and enthusiastic waiting to get back home and work on it. Other than my cell phone this book is with me at all times. I dont recommend skipping pages unless you are familiar with maya and its tools... example in chapter 12: Binding under creating a rigid skin it asks you to create a nurbs cylinder and increase its scetion to 10 its span to 6 and height to 10 step 2. in the side view create a skelton chain... if you havent read the before pages than can u really complete this excercise... again if you are new to Maya than read this book from Cover to Cover if you are an advance user i believe that this is a great reference tool which is what books are for anyways references.

I like how the author explains things, easy to follow and very well organized. The index is pretty complete so its easy to look up something that you forget later down the road.

To be honest, the reason I bought it was because the forward is by Danielle Lamothe, who is the education product manager for Alias|Wavefront - in my mind meant that there was some assumption of quality - I was wrong. I sat all afternoon with this book only to discover that the way Maya 4.5 handles dynamics is not the way it is presented in this book - they must have been working with some pre-release version when they wrote the book. I have hit a big brick wall, and the book is useless. It goes back tomorrow."},{"Title":"Maya 4.5 Savvy","review":"This is the first time I'm going to write an online review. I bought this. This is a good book to start with when you're learning Maya. This is not for beginners of Maya or 3D animation in general. It tackled most of what you will need to start off in the world of 3D animation (in Maya of course). There are gems in this book that you can actually use. for the reviewer that says don't buy this book because it's the same with Mastering Maya 3 What was keeping me from giving it a 5 star is because it didn't cover the other features of Unlimited (i.e. fur, cloth, live). That really disappointed me. But overall, I can live with this book."},{"Title":"Maya 4.5 Savvy","review":"As the reviewer from Germany had stated, - I , too , was greatly disappointed. I am in between a newbie and intermediate user of Maya 4.5 and I expected the book to clarify some issues that were somewhat uneasy for me. Well.Some books have great tutorials but lack profound detail on each command and each feature , Some other books have a great insight into the most obscure features of a program but intentionally lack of tutorials - That is OK bacause you know that beforehand and probably get to buy them both.The feeling I have with this book - that it has neither that not the other approach.when I read it I get to know that Maya can do these and other things but I never get to actually see how. I expected (and maybe I shouldn't have) to learn about some hidden tricks or features in Maya. One of the most important things to me is the REBUILD command or how to correctly use NURBS in Maya (I have used NURBS a lot in RHINO) but it just does not do it in a profound way.There are also very few images so it doesn't even serve as a visual reference.Maya is so huge that it is probably obvious that no book can cover it all but not covering the most important parts of Maya ??I wanted a book that will take me above the huge manuals - This is definetly not the book for the job.this book is authorized/sponsored by Alias|Wavefront - I can see why - after buying this book you will RUN to buy Alias' books !SKIP THIS BOOK !SKIP THIS BOOK AND wait for another"},{"Title":"Maya 4.5 Savvy","review":"I have most of the Maya books that are out there and this has got to be the worst one I've ever picked up. First of all, this is supposed to be an updated version from the previous book for Maya 3. Just from skimming you can tell that they were very lazy about updating what they wrote because the tutorials don't integrate the new features that Maya has to offer which makes some of the tutorials outdated and frustrating (an example would be the nurbs head tutorial.) They simply lumped some new stuff at the end of the book with a few new paragraphs sprinkled here and there to justify having the title of the book be &quot;Maya 4.5 Savvy&quot;. Furthermore, their tutorials are very vague and hard to follow. I have actually seen in some forums people quoting tutorials from this book asking others for explanations when something doesn't go right in the tutorial for them because they can't follow what they're supposed to do.I think the biggest problem is that this book tries to be so comprehensive that it doesn't do a good job of covering anything. The chapters are too vague and then all of a sudden they expect you to follow their tutorial at the end of the chapter without having decent illustrations or pictures to follow what they are doing.Most of the books for Maya that are out right now somewhat have this problem but I think this book has to be the worst.For beginners I would reccomend Maya 4.5 Fundamentals for its chapters and tutorials on Modeling. It has a CD included with it that is excellent because it covers all the tutorials step by step and is very easy to follow. It doesn't talk about animation too much though if that is what you are interested in. For an overall introduction to Maya, I would reccomend Learning Maya by Alias Wavefront (although it is pricey) because the tutorials are good and explains why you have to do certain steps instead of just following blindly. However, it's somewhat general and I would only reccomend it for people who are absolute beginners."},{"Title":"Maya 4.5 Savvy","review":"For the love of maya, I have embarked upon a crusade to purge the world of any and all copies of this book.

It does cover Maya in great details and takes you through the nitty-gritty steps filling you with every information you need and you do not need.

After Point of Origin, I was thrilled to see that Ms. Cornwell brought back Kay Scarpetta for another round. I was immediately drawn into the book, and especially liked the ability to see Kay Scarpetta grieving, showing that she is a human after all. I think the character of Kay Scarpetta was well developed, but after reading Black Notice, I don't think that Dr. Scarpetta would be a person I would like if given a chance to know her. She comes off as rather cold and uncaring, and I could understand how there would be others wanting to sabotage her. The Loup-Garou plot was fascinating, although I wish there had been more emphasis on this aspect of the book. I was disappointed by the ending which was very weak and unimaginative, and reminiscent of every other suspense novel or movie I have encountered. The ending certainly left room for another Kay Scarpetta novel, though, which I look forward to reading. Overall, this was not the best of the Scarpetta novels, but it certainly kept me turning the pages."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The book was good but predictable.

I have read all of the Kay Scarpetta series of books and each one is a little better than the last one. They have all been real page turners.

Black Notice was completely self-contained but, having read the entire series, I got something out of the book that someone else that had not read the series would not have gotten. Although they were well explained, I understood the references to Benton Wesley and Carrie Grethan and the history relating to Kay, Morino, and Lucy better than someone with no background into Kay's life. I would strongly recomend this book to anyone hooked on Kay Scarpetta. For anyone that has never read the writing of Patricia Cornwell I urge you to pick up her first book, Postmortem.

I love Scarpetta and wish that Cornwell would return to old form; writing a true mystery and not a novel worthy of Oprah's book club. I am left with more questions at the very speedy end of this novel than answers (why did the killer's parents hide him? Why does Kay 'not love' her sister? Why is Lucy absurdly angry??

The characters are not as strong and the same story keeps repeating. I can almost predict what is going to happen. This book seemed to contain a lot of detail, meaning research was done. I have to admit that Cornwell does excellent research. Cornwell writes so that I have to read the book. I can't sleep until I am done. I usually read an entire book of hers in a couple of hours.

Problem is, I buy the Scarpetta books to read about Kay and her WORK, not the emotional stuff, and not to see how 90's Marino is becoming.

It doesn't appear that Kay Scarpetta will ever be happy and satisfied.The scientific basis for the novel is a little out there, I thought.

This is no exception, but it has its flaws. Like other reviews, I agree parts of it are depressing. The way Kay acts, one would think she was married to Benton. At several points, the storyline bogged down when repeatedly Kay discussed Benton. The foul language was absolutely horrible. On a more positive note, the loup garou case was fascinating. I liked how she revealed what made the killer tick. The forensic detail was superb, and excellently detailed. But after ten books, I think the time has come for Marino to have a life-changing experience, such as a heart attack brought on by his eating and smoking. Excellent emotional descriptions of the characters. Let's hope the next one is more cheerful."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Too many posts---repeat of all the horrid blows inflicted,over and over.

The ending was tired and quite reminisent of past endings. It has to be hard to be original, but please..."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Having read all of Cornwell's previous Scarpetta novels, I must confess that I feel &quot;Black Notice&quot; is her finest work to date. In this novel, we are allowed into her &quot;human side&quot;. We've seen Kay in all sorts of situations, and we've come to love her, feel for her, empathize with her... But in &quot;Black Notice&quot; we see a little more of her heart, as we experience her grief with her. Readers are also enlightened as to the grief that Marino and Lucy have felt, as well. I rather enjoyed this more personal take on our three beloved characters. As for the mystery - WOW! Details of Scarpetta's autopsies have never been so in depth, and the perpetrator of the horrendous crimes is the most interesting, yet terrifying of Cornwell's creations. Not since Temple Gault has a criminal so captured my imagination. An incredibly good read, indeed!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I agree with alot of the other readers, after I finished this book I found that I was depressed. Her last couple of books have been very disappointing. I also found the book very angry and there was alot of loose ends in the book. At the end I had to read it a couple of times because it went so fast I thought I was missing something. I usually buy all her books but I think I might wait to get the next one from the library."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have loved Kay for a long time and was very distraught when Ithought Cornwell had ended the series with the last book &quot;Pointof Orgin&quot;. Now Kay is back fighting for grief recovery and dealing with life just like we all do. I do like her new love interest and found their relationship very true to life. The readers who have never gone through deep grief will have a hard time understanding why after a year all the main charaters are not &quot;over it&quot; but Cornwell has it down pat. Looking forward to see what Kay does next. Thanks Patricia for making Kay a human."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've really enjoyed Ms. Cornwell's books recently, and the Scarpetta series in particular. My single complaint has been that the author always constructs the story such that the entire world is out to get the protagonist. Understanding the controversial nature of the job, some of that conflict is inevitable, but Cornwell takes it to dizzying heights, and we can only wonder whether this reflects the author's own fears.The paranoia's tiring, the characters are predictable, and the ending's almost a carbon copy of at least two other of Cornwell's novels. One wonders whether Dr. Kay will ever learn."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Conrwell is missing the point.

Not only are they depressing but, even worse, they are boring. This book reads like a poor quality soap opera with little to redeem it.

I loved this book except for the ending - too predictable. I love reading the Scarpetta books because of the detail in forensic evidence. I also have grown to care about the characters and how their lives are progressing. In a series it's important to have a strong foundation within the characters and Kay, Marino, and Lucy are all interesting, complex characters that I enjoy to read about. I especially am enjoying Kay's new romance with the Interpol stud. Hope to see more of him in the future. Looking forward to November's release!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I thought I would see why Cornwell's books are always on the bestseller list, and after reading &quot;Black Notice&quot; I'm still wondering.

In fact, it did. Edgar Allen Poe, about 1845, wrote a much better treatment of the subject - the main subject, that is, the &quot;mysterious maniac&quot; - skipping all the histrionics, as well as the inanely convoluted and ludicrous plot elements - &quot;One-Sixty-Fivers&quot;? Yeah, right. GET REAL! Yet, I can't say the book totally STINKS. Not totally, nah. It held my interest, more or less, though there was much irrelevant drivel to wade through - these characters spend so much time bickering, spatting, spitting, spewing, flipping, and flapping at each other, they barely find time to solve the mystery... so they don't. Via &quot;deux ex machina&quot; it solves itself, quite neatly, in the last 20 pages. BTW, Kay - Gaston Glock sez it's okay to tote 'em with a round chambered. In fact, you're supposed to. I know... it's a &quot;crucial plot element&quot; that these highly trained professionals are too stupid to have their guns ready when maniacs attack. But that's always been a Cornwell staple. So why do I keep reading these things? Ah... I think Marino's funny. Isn't it time the big goof got his own series? Now...

I read most of the reviews of &quot;Hannibal&quot;, read the book anyway, and then agreed with the masses that the book was a huge disappointment. In this most recent installment from Cornwell, the opposite is true.I have read all of Cornwell's Scarpetta books and this is the best in a long time. The earlier reviewers seemed to grow cold on &quot;Black Notice&quot;, but after the terrible ending to &quot;Point of Origin&quot;, this book was great.I like the &quot;edginess&quot; of Marino and Lucy, although it is perplexing how Kay and Lucy keep bumping into each others worlds. And if Marino is being asked for by all of these higher power organizations (Interpol, FBI, etc.) why is he still whining in Richmond? And when is one of these going to be made into a movie?This is the best book that Cornwell has written in a long time. Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Reading books for entertainment is a personal choice, like going to see movies. And I never heed what critics say. I draw my own conclusions. Black Notice, was incredible. I read it in one sitting, and am sorry that I had to come to the end page. Can't anyone but me &quot;see&quot; a follow up to this? I'd like to see this &quot;on film&quot;.

This another classic Cornwell; it keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through! I'll admit, it's not as shocking as Point of Origin was, but I enjoyed this one all the same. It was wonderful to see Kay dealing with some of her grief, *and* doing a little healing. Now if only Cornwell would concentrate a little more on Lucy! :)"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This has to be one of the BEST books I have ever read. It is better than Harry Potter! Patricia Cornwell expertly portrays a realistic character, i.e. Dr. Kay Scarpetta, brilliantly.

I absolutely LOVE it."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"After loosing the love of her life, it is time for Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta to pick up the pieces and carry on.

Worth reading in paperback, definitely not worth the hardcover price."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books and find them to be intensely satisfying in regard to character development through time because she uses the same characters in each book. You need to start with her first book to get the full benefit of character development. ( These books are the ones she has written about Dr. Scarpetta, et al.)Her books will also keep you page turning much longer than you should if you read before bedtime. The information which she researches (and provides the reader while reading) is quite complete in relation to each story theme.Patricia Cornwell is my favorite author of suspense novels.READ HER! She's great!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I love the Scarpetta books. The charactors in these books seem so real, it is like you can get to know them and their habits. It almost feels like you become one with Kay, Lucy and Marino, you worry about what will happen to them next. I like how Jo's parents have to deal with her lesbianism, and how Kay tries to explain it to them. These books show just how screwed up this world can be, but how there is some good in the world, people just need to be more open minded. This book was a little bit more predictable than the others though, the plot leading up to what I knew would happen. I find that annoying, but still the book was very good. I can't wait for the next one to come out."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The Scarpetta novels started with a driven career woman who would not let anything stand in her way, she got on with her life and got the baddies with the help of Police officer Marino, in this installment, Scarpetta is a weak-willed woman, who stalls and strays on her quest for the right answers. Not one of Cornwell's best."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's Books and I was not disappointed in &quot;Black Notice&quot; It was well written, And after reading so much of her character Kay Scarpetta I feel like I almost know her, I can hardly wait for the next book! The supporting cast is strong and you can Identify with all of them, Keep them coming Ms. Cornwell!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Kay Scarpetta was interseting and intriguing in the first books of the series. But now everything seems more of the same and the characters make you madder than ever. It seems that the people in Cornwall's novel have some strange ways of showing their emotions and seem a little too fake at times. Some parts of it seem to copy one of her earlier books, Body of Evidence. This made it seem like the same old story. It's a book that is worth reading but not one that I would run out and buy the instant it hit the shelves. I won't discourage others from reading it but some of her other books are a little better. I can't wait for the next installation in the Kay Scarpetta series, regardless of this book."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Scarpetta has become so highly strung that it must be only a matter of time when she falls apart totally. Although the writing generates empathy in me for Kay, I agree with the reviewer who suggests a sabbatical. What she has to endure in each book borders on inhuman AND inhumane. All this heroine ansgt makes the book somewhat heavy and morose. I did find the office politics an interesting diversion (and for me, real life) from the usual absorption in detailed autopsies or gruesome discoveries. All that aside, I enjoyed this book more than recent previuous ones. I am slowly coming to terms with the horrendous death on Benton - this book almost helps that catharsis. I still prefer Kay Scarpetta as a character to those introduced in 'Hornets nest'."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell has become quite the disappointment. Her earlier books were all exciting; I couldn't &quot;put them down&quot;. Now I doubt that I'll ever &quot;pick another one up&quot;.

Sorry Ms. Cornwell, you've lost a fan here!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I was really NOT enjoying many of the previous ones.

I was hanging in there until about the last 25 pages or so. We got to France and the book just fell apart. It wasn't that great to start with, but some hairy guy. Please. The romance was wrong, the Lucy character is disgusting and just rude. I love Patricia Cornwell, but at the French trip I was ready to throw the book in the trash. I suffered through, but I hope this is her worst, and I will look for suggestions from you other readers for my next. I have not lost faith in this author. Even her wrost has a way of always holding my interest. To me this is a great writer, who just decided to write crime novels. She has great potential."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"In BLACK NOTICE, Patricia Cornwell shows us a darker and colder Dr. Kay Scarpetta. Though Cornwell has always been good at displaying Dr. Scarpetta's inner emotions, this time around, her emotions make for a dark book. Despite the unusually dark nature of this book, it is still worth a read.As a native son of Virginia, I always look forward to reading a Cornwell novel. This time around, a body has been found in a boat at the Harbour of Richmond. This badly decomposed body leads to the hunt for a French killer calling himself The Werewolf. This hunt is international, but even so, no one is safe. Not even Dr. Kay.This novel deals with several issues: grief, fowled up drug busts and the effects thereof, violent crimes, homosexuality, and a rare medical condition. If any of these issues bother you,then don't read this novel. If you are an avid Scarpetta fan, or a fan of books of this nature, read BLACK NOTICE."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"After writing a couple of really good books, PC started to massproduce kay scarpetta mysteries. This is really a massproduct without a single unique or original idea, and only based on the relations between the different characters of the stories. The characters also have become boring as their personalities are only getting some more details without any deeper contents. absolute rubbish"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"OK, so the book isn't perfect, but I was engaged and entertained for the duration of the book. I got the book from the library as a book on tape, so I haven't had the luxury to read the Scarpetta series in order. This was my second novel in the series (the first one being &quot;Cause of Death&quot;).One criticism is Cornwell's overly pessimistic view of humankind (people are evil and serial killers run rampant, etc). Also, I agree that she may have gone a little over-the-top in making Marino a caricature of himself, though, I thought a lot of his actions were understandable, given his personality and what he was put through in this book. Also, the relationship among the three main protagonists (Kay, Lucy and Marino) wasn't too sappy or glossed over... though Cornwell may have gone a little too far in seeing that they weren't. Also, the fate of Diane Bray was a little hard to swallow.But overall, the story was engrossing. Cornwell's prose creates a dark and gritty aura through much of the book; I thought the grieving bit was realistic, and, as always, the forensic details are well-researched and realistic as well. Not the best book I've read (listened to) but definitely worthwhile if you like dark, gritty mysteries with a lot of human drama."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read 9 of P.

BORING I read to page 349 of 415 and at that point did not care who the killer was."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The private life of Kay Scarpeta is becoming something of a soap opera. She is always troubled, angry, depressed, and fearful. This deepening examination of her life and the lives of those around her are now, in this book, and also in THE LAST PRECINCT, beginning to detract from the story. And the story is really quite good. If you like a lot of &quot;over-reaction&quot; to almost every mundane event of life then this is the book for you. However if you expect cool judgement and calculated response to the puzzles faced by a person with a scientific mind prepare to be somewhat disappointed."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Kay Scarpetta was self-absorbed and irritating. Lucy was equally self-absorbed and just plain stupid. The serial killer was an overwrought caricature that seemed taken from an Ed Wood movie. Yuck."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"A prize is surely required for the most abrupt ending! The book itself was fine - it kept me turning until 2.00am, but the end was unbelievable, with no expansion or elaboration of the plot details. Like a bad TV movie in this regard. An acceptable book with a completely unacceptable end."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The angst and psycho babble are much too much and too Hollywoody adolescent. This seems to be less a novel by itself and more her editor's strikeouts from Point of Origin - like the cuttings on a film editor's floor. The book drags and the emotional pain -- oh the pain, oh the pining, oh the melodrama, oh the psychological analysis -- pleeeze. Sophomoric. Reeks of being put together hastily for a deadline. Having read similar readers' comments about her newest novel, it sounds as if her good books are sadly all in the past. They were great while they lasted."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I got this book from the library,and read it out of curiosity. It took me several days to finish. The opening scene has Kay getting a letter from Benton a year after his death. She goes into hysterics, vomiting, breast-beating, etc. This is a grown woman, not a teen-ager. Where is her self-control? Why the angst, the agony, the foul language in a woman touted as being smart, professional, and good at her job? Her attachment to Lucy is sick, and Lucy is out of control. Where is her professionalism? Pete has lost all his smarts and is merely crude, profane, and obnoxious. Did Kay ever stop and ask herself why she has so much difficulty getting along with people--that it might possibly be her fault? I don't blame Diane Bray for wanting to get rid of her. The plot was loose, coincidental, and at times almost non-existent. The mystery of the loup-garou was solved easily and the subplot of Bray's hostility was no mystery at all. Then Jay Talley shows up after page 300 and he and Kay jump between the sheets in a fury of lust. Give me a break. Such unpleasant people. Who needs it?"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I just finished reading &quot;Black Notice&quot; and I was surprised how well I liked it. It's prequel &quot;Point of Origin&quot; was very moody and depressing and while &quot;Black Notice&quot; starts out like that as well, it gets interesting soon enough. Part of the action takes place in France and in my mind shows some similarities with Poe or Leroux as if the writing had changed with the territory. Eerie ! Lucy does not play a large part in this book (a good idea probably), Kay still misses Benton (as do I) and Marino still manages to alienate everyone everywhere.Granted, &quot;Black Notice&quot; is not as good as the early Scarpetta books, but it's a big improvement from &quot;Point of Origin&quot; where I was worried that all the lead characters would commit suicide before the book was finished. I am now looking forward to the next book and to those who gave up on Kay after &quot;Point of Origin&quot; : This one is worth checking out !One thing I noticed though : Aren't you supposed to open body bags before taking pictures of the body ? :-)"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Hi Im new to the subject of READING altogether, having never read a book since I was in primary school, because I hated it soooooooo much, I discovered Patricia Cornwell's books in the supermarket one day. Black Notice was the first book I have ever read of hers, and being employed in a Pathology unit myself, found I could easily relate to the story. I think I qualify as a NON READER, 30years between books is a long time. So after reading Black Notice in just two days, I went and brought the other 9 books in the series, and Im almost finished all of them. I say Patricia Cornwell gets a mighty big 10 out of 10 for being able to keep my interest, and for opening my eyes to the wonderful world of READING. Now I know what I've been missing out on all these years. Patricia's Books have had no trouble keeping me awake at night reading till sometimes 3am, and so far I've only had to sleep with the lights on a couple of times after spooking myself with the books :) I highly recommend Patricia Cornwell's books to anyone who is interested in the subject FORENSIC PATHOLOGY, and murder mystery, you wont be disappointed........only disappointment for me is I'm almost caught up with Patricia's abilty to write them faster than I can read them :) If you haven't read a Patricia Cornwell novel yet, your missing out BIGTIME!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Read all of her books except Winter Table, and the first 5 or so I couldnt put down, really couldnt put them down. The last few have been so hard to read, I forced myself to read them, knowing I couldnt love EVERYTHING she wrote, waiting for the old Scarpetta to return. But she only gets more and more arrogant. And like most other reviews, I too, am bored with the Lucy character. And I too, read the reviews on this site before reading the book, but read it anyway, just hoping... What's wrong with Cornwell? Her characters are now shallow, too predictable, and boring where they should be familiar, comfortable, and anxious to solve these mysteries. I dont know if I will read any more of her books. I surely wont BUY any more."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all her books and like many serial authors,Cornwell seems to feel she must include either devient sex or outrageous language.This book doesen't come close to the way people act.Three examples come to mind:the secretary suffering the loss of a husband but unable to carry on after the loss of a shopkeeper,Marino's absolute stupidity in Europe and Kay's mourning over her loss for a year.Her whole department suffers because she is in never-never land.It is too bad that she doesen't have some intellegent everyday chacters because her topic,a female medical examener, is wonderful.This will be the last Patricia Cornwell I will read"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Take a pass on this one. I've only read one other book by P. Cronwell, &quot;From Potter's Field.&quot; &quot;Black Notice&quot; doesn't hold a candle to that one. Cronwell spends two-thirds of the book analyzing Scarpetta and her loss of Benton, and allowing Marino to give everyone a lot of lip. By some very tedious twists and turns, she connects the dots in the last fifty pages. Sending Scarpetta on a trip to Paris was nice, and the INTERPOL idea is pretty good; however, these are used in a quick-and-dirty fashion, sort of thrown into the mix for good measure. An easy read, if you're interested in reading about someone's personal problems. Don't bother if you're interested in reading a murder mystery."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of Ms. Cornwell's works, and by far the Kay Scarpetta story line is one of her better &quot;mystery tours&quot;.

I didn't know who I wanted to die more--Kay or Diane Bray! Wish it had been Kay. &quot;Black Notice&quot; is simply terrible. Arguments come out of nowhere and sanctimoniousness is at full throttle. And why was it again that Marino accompanied Scarpetta to France? Did he actually do anything but clobber Kay's stud (yeah the sex scene... unbelievable, if you can even call it a sex scene... and him declaring his undying feelings after an afternoon romp? Ridiculous!) Scarpetta's holier than thou attitude is getting progressively worse. And did she have a conversation with anyone she didn't get in a fight with or have negative feelings about? The French cab driver... her poor maid who forgot to change the towels... Sheesh. Let's not even get started on Lucy. She's a lunatic. By now, we all know about Cornwell's own proclivities, but does she have to give all gay people a bad name? Please, Patricia, stop typing and start spending some of that money of yours and have a good time."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The corpse wasn't the only thing decomposing in what is the latest (last?) Scarpetta novel. Improbable, implausible, incoherent and irrational - to start with. Between werewolf disease, Marino's resurrection theory, drug cartels, Loony Little Lucy, weak and bizarre political manuevering, internet body-snatching (and a coroner's office uses AOL, come on!), walk-ons by a Senator and Interpol, and a baffling trip to France on the Concorde, Ms. Cornwell has effectively killed Dr. Scarpetta for this reader, who just assumes this is some sort of mid-life nightmare? Save your $."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Over 300 reviews so far, let's summarize the half of them (although I found many very funny): Cornwell's first 3-4 Scarpetta novels were, without a doubt, excellent. These books had a good storyline and believable characters, but in the meantime the series has hit rock bottom and started digging. I am so fed up with Kay's constantly miserable life! Lucy is a spoiled brat and she should have been killed instead of Benton (although he was pretty boring too). What happened to Marino? Come Ms Cornwell, you owe your readers more than this poor little effort. I agree with another reader that Cornwell should write a psychiatrist into her next novel and get her characters a therapy.If there's no other way then end the Scarpetta series and start something new. This is not the way to go! As far as I am concerned I won't waste money on another book. This is so depressing!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Cornwell continues to create a great story line piggy backing on her last Scarpetta novel. It is always well written and full of suspense. Her knowledge of the medical field helps to bring the novel into a more realistic and visual concept of what is read. Description of characters and their emotions generate the necessary help to keep you interest and captures you while wadeing through what sometimes is a lengthily reading. Over all damm good book."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"My friend periodically gives me bags full of books she's read and I found this one in the last batch. It's been ages since I've read a Cornwell/Dr. Scarpetta book, just long enough for me to miss them and really enjoy this one.The mystery in this case begins with a decomposing body found in a cargo container that docks in Richmond. The murderer's trail will lead Scarpetta and Marino to France and back again and will be very difficult to solve. Meanwhile, it has been one year since her FBI lover Benton's death and she has kept herself too busy to grieve, but suddenly a final goodbye letter from him is delivered to her, and she is forced to face up to her grief.In another storyline, her niece Lucy hasn't found a way to grieve Benton's death either and is courting danger as she usually turns to violence to solve problems. And if that weren't enough, a sexy-looking cop with connections is taking over the police department and threatening to take over the medical examiner's office as well. Her name is Bray, and she's determined to get rid of both Marino and Scarpetta. You can imagine, if you're familiar with the character, how Marino reacts to this.Finally, is there a new love interest for Scarpetta? Stay tuned. I had almost forgotten how caught up in this series I can get. I'm back on the Cornwell bandwagon again."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I can only echo other one-star reviewers. \\"Black Notice\\" is, indeed, a page-turner. I flipped past 20, 30 pages at a time, trying to jump-start the story...to no avail.The initial crime--a dead body inside a shipping container, with hints of werewolf involvement is, to say the least, intriguing. But that plot thread takes a back seat for most of the novel. Instead, the reader gets chapter after chapter about quasi-identity theft, a horrendous new deputy chief, sloppy lab technicians, inter-office politics and other topics that have little relationship to the initial premise.The autopsy scenes are lovingly but monotonously detailed, reminding me of Tom Clancy's insistence on using every bit of information found in his research, whether it helps the story or not.When we finally return to the werewolf story, its resolution hinges on a convoluted, implausible situation.I've read one other Scarpetta novel--\\"Predator\\"--and was likewise disappointed. Ms. Cornwell now resides on my very short list of \\"don't bother\\" authors."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The main character, detective Pete Marino, is afraid he will get AIDS from corpses and says he will 'eat his gun' if guys back at the office even think he's gay. He's not quiet about it. This book was like the opposite of everything else I've read before. I do not keep up on what's new, however. If I'm reading fiction it's likely to be something written 40 years ago. The authors approach was just too weird for me and so I was a bit unsettled throughout much of the book, and I'm 'conservative'. So is the author, Patricia Cornwell, apparently. No doubt she's a gun totting, pro choice, lesbian feminist. . . The author has worked at the office of a medical examiner before, also. That's from her official profile.Much of the book is about knowing the details of police procedure and the world of forensics and explaining them to the reader. Perhaps Black Notice is capitalizing on the popularity of crime shows? What exactly is the appeal, however? Is it a kind of hero-worship or knuckling under to higher authority? After all, police have the power to arrest us, throw our lives asunder, humiliate us and put us in jail? Should we be taught, by way of stories like these, to have a proper respect for authority, or at least the police? In this book, however, the villain turns out to be the affirmative action police chief who may have also slept her way to the top. Perhaps we should be taught respect for the right kind of cops. . . other's have suggested we enjoy seeing the guilty punished. Late in the book the author treats us to a breathless, detailed description of how this new crime fighting tool, electronic mail, works. If it doesn't embarrass the work, this lengthy passage certainly dates it.It was an Ok story, interesting and mildly entertaining. It was just so different, as I mentioned earlier in the review, I had a hard time finding a comfort zone and getting more enjoyment out of it."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Okay. This book, and the one that follows (\\"The Last Precinct\\") are to this day my favorite Kay Scarpetta books. Maybe that has to do with the villain of the piece being just so SERIOUSLY CREEPY AND EVIL...He's at once more and less than a real human being...Total psychopath, creepier than Carrie or Temple Gault (who was pretty creepy on his own)...For some bizarre reason,Ms Cornwell has, in recent years, begun playing around with the point of view in her Kay Scarpetta novels, and as a writer and writing teacher, I say if it ain't broke, don't fix it! This is the last book until last year's \\"Port Mortuary\\" to be told in first-person past-tense...(The Last Precinct, for whatever reason, is told in first person PRESENT tense, go figure)...That said,I like the story in this book, Kay is doing what she does best, getting her hands dirty solving crime. Marino is the Marino we have come to love (and hate, well, not me, I always liked him from the beginning), he performs admirably as Kay's Watson. Benton is still dead, and we see Kay's open grieving, even a year later, which feels raw and real to me.I'm not going to pick on Ms. Cornwell for playing around with POV, but I can only say that when an author reaches a place where she can probably tell her publisher that she's making a radical change in her best-selling series, well...Read her Jack the Ripper book. PLEASE. (that was sarcastic)...I hear she's not a very nice person to her fans, which I think is terrible, as nine out of ten so-called \\"famous\\" writers I have met in my life are nice, gracious, and always appreciative of their fans' opinions. No, I'm not naming names, you will have to take my word for it. I have digressed into a rant here, and I aoplogize. But it's after this book that Ms. Cornwell starts to trickle downhill. So very sad."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"[3.5 stars]First things first, 'Black Notice' is a pretty good book. BUT......'Black Notice' is the first of three books where Patricia Cornwell made her ill-fated \\"reboot\\" of the popular Kay Scarpetta series. The overwhelming consensus among Scarpetta fans (including me!) is that this re-invention was a disastrous failure, with the characters becoming cardboard thin and the plots becoming ridiculously overblown, so this book is often regarded as \\"the beginning of the end\\" of the Scarpetta series. While 'Black Notice' itself is not bad at all, it does introduce a host of plot and character devices which Cornwell would make a horrible mess of untangling in the next two books ('The Last Precinct' and 'Blow Fly'), and has been struggling with ever since.The central story revolves around a decomposing body found in a shipping container, with Scarpetta trying to unravel baffling forensic evidence such as mysterious hairs on the body and a partially-erased tattoo. In addition, a series of extremely brutal murders begins taking place in Richmond, in which young women are beaten so savagely they are unrecognisable. The story takes on an increasingly bizarre twist, with the possible involvement of an international criminal cartel, and a member of an infamous French criminal family who suffers from an extremely rare disease.However the main focus of \`Black Notice' is the characters, with Cornwell placing them all at major crossroads in their lives. With all of them still struggling to come to terms with the events of \`Point of Origin', they all face personal and professional crises; Marino is demoted into uniform, Lucy is shunted sideways into a dangerous undercover role, and Scarpetta once again has corrupt cops and administrators trying to force her out of her job. In contrast to previous books, however, the characters begin to crack under the strain; they are less willing to work together to deal with the problems, they lash out at each other for no reason, and openly declare how unhappy they are with their lot. Cornwell is clearly sowing the seeds of change here, and the overwhelming impression is that things can never be the same again. This does result in alot of childish angsting, but it is interesting seeing these characters break down and express some truly raw emotion instead of putting up an emotional wall as they always do.The melodrama does become a bit heavy-handed at times (a problem that would only increase with later Scarpetta books), but for the most part I did enjoy 'Black Notice'. The solution is unexpected but plausible, even if it does borrow heavily from an earlier book in the series, the plot takes some odd twists, and the story and character threads Cornwell sets up are interesting. But you need to be aware that Cornwell leaves most of these threads hanging, and she makes a terrible hash of continuing the series from this point on. It's your call as to whether you're prepared to read \`Black Notice' knowing that you'll have to struggle through the inferior \`Last Precinct' and \`Blow Fly' for the saga to be completed."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"From the female side of this novel we get emotion, relationships, dynamics below the surface, all making waves in a traditionally male world of police procedures, crime and avarice. Tough stuff and great dramatic contrast. But you'll keep the pages turning late into the night to unravel a macabre story that gets stranger and stranger.Cornwell is a master storyteller. I dislike watching CSI on TV but somehow her medical examiner, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, a badly decomposed body in a shipping container, a friend who's a suspended detective, internal political corruption and a niece who accidentally shoots her lesbian lover get into our blood and show us the world as we don't ordinarily see it. And let's not forget a real-life, French werewolf!Tight dialogue, sterling credibility and succinct description that sets the scene: \\"I listened to silence and became acutely aware of the sounds of it. I heard the wind, the faint clicking of numbers rolling on the digital clock, heat blowing, my own breathing.\\" In spite of an abrupt ending (that somehow seems right and very satisfying) this is a long book that seems it really should go on forever. Maybe the series will.John Lehman, Rosebud Book Reviews.com"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Not bad but at least 100 pages too long. Why do we have needless passages about Scarpetta's niece? Also why the secondary plot of the corrupt and bitchy police superintendent - with her accomplice in Scarpetta's lab?However the dialogue is good and the story does move along. Cornwell is also effective with atmosphere and her two central characters are believable and sometimes funny. There are three murders in the story so I don't consider this overkill."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I paid for a paperback of the title, but something went wrong, and they sent me a hardback edition at not extra cost."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am very happy w/my purchase.

I was, at first, a little hesitant in purchasing used books but I would recommend this to everyone who loves to read and who buys many books."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Over the years, Dr. Scarpetta has become increasingly morose, and her 'glass half empty' life is becoming tedious to read about. Ms. Cornwell certainly puts her through alot, as well as Marino and Lucy.The mystery itself was intriguing, but the office shenanigans were over the top, and instead of getting lost in her books, as I usually do, I found myself speeding through just to see how it ended. Kind of like inhaling a Quarter Pounder with Cheese, instead of slowly savoring a juicy steak. I think Kay needs to go see her shrink, or maybe just eat some Cheerios.There are too many real people who live victorious lives in spite of incredible difficulty in the real world, which makes it hard to feel empathy or sympathy for the depressing Scarpetta. Get it together Kay- we love ya!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I think it is safe to say that Patricia Cornwell has, in her most recent books, gone far astray from the excitement and originality that were exhibited in her first few Kate Scarpetta novels. In Black Notice she 'treats' us to a basically unbelievable story full of subplots about office politics and her niece's bad attitude that simply detracts from any ongoing narrative thrust. Cornwell long ago went over the top with the seriel killer theme, the neurotic Dr. Scarpetta theme, the lesbian niece theme, and the decline of Morino theme. Readers are wanting, I think, to see some new sense of life in Scarpetta and a fresh direction, but in this book we get bleak, neurotic, angry characters doing equally bleak, neurotic and angry things to one another. No fun.And, isn't the gimmic of making the FBI the bad guys and ATF the good guys a bit much? Given the publicity that has attended Cornwell's real life problems with the FBI, I believe readers would rather not see her carry the feud into her fiction. It cheapens it and just adds another dimension of heaviness the reader doesn't need to deal with.If I were Scarpetta's boss, I would insist she take a sabbatical and seek help. Since a tug of war over her position has been a theme in more than one of Cornwell's Scarpetta books, it ill behooves her to present her heroine so scattered, irrational, and on the edge.Maybe Cornwell should take a sabbatical from Scarpetta."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"While I finished this book at midnight, after only two nights, I'm not sure it's one of her better ones. The wolf theme is creepy, I'll give it that, but the interpolice agency intrigue and someone trying to sabotage Scarpetta at work (someone posing as her on email, etc) are old themes that are a bit tired.I'm not sure how Lucy and Jo got together. I must be forgetting the previous book.It's typical Cornwell, though the forensic work is not as thorough or as interesting.I supposed it's a must for followers of the series. I concur to start with previous ones, but I'd suggest Postmortem or All that Remains. Then work into my favorite, From Potters' Field (not sure if I got the title right...)"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The original KS books were great, but the last three have gone steadily downhill. I initially read the series eagerly ,one after the other, but this one has convinced me finally to never read another.Let's get real here! Someone is out to sabotage Kay's career and discredit her reputation. She learns that someone is acting as her in an on-line chat but never bothers to contact the host and refute this? Stupid connections, unbelievable scenarios and a meager plot sum up this book.The plot is negligible at best -- in fact plot lines were so non-existent that I can't even recall anything worth commenting about. The main focus was Kay's self absorption and continued whining about her misfortune while everyone around her revolves in her shadow apparently in awe of her immense talents? Oh c'mon! The reader should apparently side with Kay against her sister about her niece Lucy. Kay claims that Lucy's mother is only involved in herself. I've never seen a character as self absorbed as KS herself.Sorry, but this book isn't worth the price or the time to read it."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I bought the book despite the bad reviews I read here on Amazaon. I made a mistake. I thought, how bad could it be? The story line sounded too good to resist. But this book is populated with absolutely the most angry and anoying characters I have ever encountered. To pick just one example, Dr. Scarpetta's side-kick, Marino, is a manic, foul-mouthed police officer who always states the obvious for the benefit of readers who are just skimming. Other than Dr. Scarpetta, none of the other characters in this book had any appeal.

The title doesn't even make sense. Not only is the plot full of unbelievable coincidences; it's also full of holes! Is this due to poor editing, or just sloppiness on the part of the author? the connection between someone impersonating Kay on e-mail, and the ambitious woman police chief suddenly appeared as a plot device without any establishing details. This transtition was so poorly presented, I confess I first thought my paperback copy was missing a few pages! Characters, such as the Senator, enter the plot, hint at mysterious conspiracies or scandals, and then disappear. A subplot about an untrustworthy employee is developed as a central theme, and then suddenly fades, as if the author lost interest. Well-known characters, such as Marino and Lucy appear extremely unlikable and abrasive in this book --- as does Scarpetta herself. Characters don't communicate or talk with one another, they simply rage and argue. There is a noted uneven quality about the book --- we are given endless details about autopsy tables and lab fixtures and hotel furnishings, yet the plot details are sketchy, and characters seem to move from scene to scene without transition. The details of evidence gathering, autopsy procedure, and police work have a ring of authority and authenticity, yet the notion that the Medical Examiner's office for the state of Virginia would use AOL for their email server made me laugh out loud! This book made me feel cheated by Cornwell, as though she were dashing it off without much thought."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! I was hoping that the Scarpetta novels had gotten back to great plots and storytelling, but Black Notice would not pass a sophomore English class. It is the same tiresome characters with incoherent, wandering text that never comes together. There are countless subplots dropped into the story, yet not one makes sense. What is Senator Lord's involvement with Interpol? And what made this morally righteous, genius of a coroner think that a man she barely knows is falling in love with her after a night in the sack? Ick! And why? This book just alternates between whiny (poor Dr. Scarpetta works too hard, everyone is plotting against her, and her bitchy niece Lucy won't call to thank her for the flowers!) and just plain goofy (the online impersonator). I don't usually cheer for the murderer, but these characters are not even likable. Patricia Cornwell is capable of much better, but I doubt I'll be reading it. Shame."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Unfortunately I gave Cornwell yet another chance to return to the form that made her early books gripping and a worthy read. This one is filled with the now trite themes we've seen before: power brokers plotting against Kay to remove her from her job, internal suspicions at the office, the angst of her personal life, the sniveling and relationships of niece Lucy, and what appears to be the ever increasing stupidity of Marino. The only refreshing thing in this book is that the villian is not apprehended in the bedroom of her home. Thank you Kay for running outside. Sorry Patricia, no more for me."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was so disappointed with Cornwell's latest. I mean, could we have a more tired plot, sub-plots, and ending? I feel like I just had the lame charaters and story from Hornet's Nest shoved down my throat under the guise of a Scarpetta novel. What is with this young handsome guy falling in love with Kay after a quick fling and talking about moving to VA? And what is with her sobbing over the loss of her beloved Benton, only to then become emotionally entangled with some young whipper-snapper moments later? Umm, could I ask what was Marino's purpose in France? Did they ask him anything? Did he contribute ANYTHING, besides coming along as Kay's escort? Was he even a detective at the time, not to mention the detective assigned to the case? If all these other agencies find him so valuble why don't they freakin' HIRE HIM? And the werewolf - I'm glad we got a good view into his twisted mind - NOT! I know, let's pull in some more obscure and fantastic medical conditions to add to the total stupidity of the story, instead of creating a plot line that is actually interesting and clever. It's like you find out what's going on and say, &quot;Ooops, for a second there I thought we had some neat twists and turns coming, guess not.&quot; And Kay's lame attempts at 'profiling' then wondering what Benton would've said. Kay needs to get a grip and take a vacation, and maybe address the problems her disturbed niece is having. And why does her sister or mother always make a little appearance in the story - to fill space? Anyway, how many of Kay's boyfriends are going to get blown up? Maybe Kay needs to find someone NOT involved with law enforcement. Or put Marino out of his misery and just sleep with him. That's obviously what he wants. Or Cornwell is just confused again about where she wants her story to go. And apparently Kay has learned nothing in all her years of risky cases and psychopaths - &quot;I think I'll just open up my door to anyone.&quot; And I would have thought there was some chain of evidence rule about taking things home with you that are relevant to an open case. And the whole office problem thing was soooo lame. And her supervisor's whole role in the story was pretty ridiculous. Basically it contributed nothing to the overall story, which is pretty weak to begin with. And what happened to him anyway? I always liked her books because of the realism. But murder scenes with no detective present? Federal agencies not seeing Lucy as the loose cannon she is, and benching her until she gets some psychiatric help? Not to mention the conflict of interest between Lucy's personal and professional life and how inappropriate her behavior is. Sucessful detectives put back in uniform for no reason? No checks and balances on the processing of drugs through a morgue? And what happened to the cartel? Guess that's supposed to encourage us to buy the next book - I think I'll just borrow that one from the library."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell's novel, Black Notice, is a very intriguing read. Kay Scarpetta, Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner, is given the autopsy of a man found in a freight container on a cargo ship from Europe. This \\"cargo man\\" was found with unexplainable animal-like hair all over his body. Kay's next autopsy is a sales clerk who was mutilated by her murderer, and coincidently contained the same strange hair on her body. Through INTERPOL (international police) Kay learns that the murders are linked to similar ones in Italy. Kay has to put her job on the line so she can find out confidential information that is only known to one other. To make matters worse someone in Kay's office is trying to sabotage her identity and ruin her career. It doesn't stop there. The new deputy chief, Diane Bray, is trying to take over the Homicide department and has demoted Kay's best friend, Pete Marino. Not to mention Kay's niece, Lucy, is involved in a undercover drug shooting. Cornwells explicit imagery and thorough explanations help to set a vivid scene throughout the entire novel, \\"Every inch of skin was dried wipes and smears and swirls reminding me of finger-painting again, her face a mush of splintered bone and battered tissue.\\" Cornwell succeeds in keeping the readers attention throughout the novel, once you think no more problems can arise, something new happens. The ending of Black Notice was very dramatic and unexpected although Cornwell could have tied up a few more loose ends, but I believe that will be explained in her next novel. Overall Black Notice is an interesting, descriptive and suspenseful novel."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"It was readable and interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying: a pat ending that tried to tie together too many loose ends, somewhat cliched characters, and Kay Sparpetta I found to be almost insufferable. All the women are jealous, all the men want her, etc. I found her &quot;perfect&quot; persona (wealthy, beautiful, brilliant, famous, etc.) a bit much. Even her flaws (somewhat distant, uncomfortable with her own emotions) were meant, it seems, to make her that much more alluring. This is the first Scarpetta book I've read and have heard good things about the series. Maybe I need to go back to the beginning to see what the appeal is (besides the foresensics info, which was quite interesting)."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am still a big fan of the Scarpetta series but this one was hard to get through. Cornwell spent too much time on emotional dialogue and not enough time with the mystery. I just started \\"The Last Precinct\\" where the story continues right where \\"Black Notice\\" left off and I am wondering why Cornwell didn't just cut out all the extras and make them into one story.For readers who have followed Kay's stories from the beginning they will probably find that \\"Black Notice\\" repeats explanations from past stories that are unnecessary to the current one. I thought that Kay's relationship to Marino forced and overly done and his story line hard to swallow. I also thought the story line with Chief Bray a bit far fetched considering if she had her way, than Kay wouldn't have a job anymore.It's still the same ole Kay, but she needs to cut out the drama to keep her audience hooked. I'll give it one more try, but then I may have to give up on Kay."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Really enjoyed this one - great - just like the previous 10 Scarpetta stories!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I heard an interview with Patricia Cornwell about this book and was intrigued - and I haven't been intrigued by a Scarpetta novel for some time. Patricia said that in this book she wanted to explore Kay's own reaction to grief, bearing in mind that until now Kay has always dealt with the grief of other people. I thought this was an interesting idea and thus bought the book.My only complaint about this idea is that Scarpetta did not fall to pieces over the death of her beloved boyfriend Mark from an IRA bomb at Victoria station (one of the more sillier plotlines Cornwell has used, I might add) to the extent she has done so over Benton. But this is a minor quibble!Like many readers I share some of the criticisms about the \\"james bondisation\\" of the main characters and Cornwell's obsessions with the sexuality of her characters. It would be good if Kay could stay in Richmond for one novel at least! Lucy is no longer a credible character but Cornwell (at least) alluded to this via some of the comments made by Marino in Black Notice about Lucy's latest somewhat deranged escapades. The Diane Bray storyline seemed a bit pointless - I mean, why would Diane Bray give a rat's *** about Kay Scarpetta? She is just a forensic examiner for crying out loud!! And Jay was poorly characterised. It would also be good if next time Cornwell could drop the killer chasing after Scarpetta storyline - that really is tired now and we all know Kay will survive! There is absolutely no suspense in that route at all and as other reviewers have said, it was all so predictable.But for some reason I found Black Notice to be a compelling read and I enjoyed it much more than I have some of the more recent Cornwell fare. The murders were interesting and I did not spot the resolution of the baby hair. I think some of the reviewers have been a bit harsh on the technical aspects of this book which, as ever, were second to none. ANOTHER TIP - Patricia Cornwell said in the radio interview that she is developing an interest in archaeology and has been going on digs, looking at skeletons, etc. This reminded me of the Kathy Reichs novels where the main character is a forensic anthrolopolgist. Is this going to be a future Scarpetta storyline?

Normally I can't put a Cornwell book down. I read from cover to cover almost in one sitting.BLACK NOTICE, and it's predecessor, POINT OF ORIGIN were books that got shuffled to the back of the bookshelf for when I didn't have anything else to read. It appears that Cornwell is moving away from the stand-alone novel and moving into the area of novel-in-serial, where in order to understand one you must read the earlier works. Some of the twists and turns will be explained in the later book, LAST PRECINCT, if you can hang on for that long of a journey.Scarpetta still solves her crimes but she appears to be doing it while whining and complaining.

Don't get me wrong - she may repeat certain tones in her stories, but I have grown to enjoy the characters and their familiar relations. Still, the story was less compelling than other Scarpetta novels I have read.In the beginning, there was the body - a highly ripe one from Europe. Who he is, why he was stashed aboard a freighter, and why he is covered with animal hairs are the questions of the hour. If this doesn't cause enough trouble for chief medical examiner Kay Scarpetta, an incompetent homicide investigator, a treacherous forensic assistant, and an overbearing new deputy chief are willing to lend a hand. To top it all off, her niece Lucy is involved in a dangerous undercover operation about to go down in Miami.This is the first Scarpetta novel I read (I have since read two others). Although it is a good story, I felt it contained some excessive autopsy details (not gruesome, just a little drawn out). That, an abrupt ending immediately after the climax, and an excess of people trying to undermine Scarpetta without real cause prevents me from rating this a 4."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'm almost 16 and I have read all of her books, I love each one I can never put them down.

I wanted to skip past descriptive words, or turn the page before I was finished to find out immediately what had occurred. You could taste her fear, anxiety and worry. One must admire Scarpetta's spirit, her ability to conquer her fear, to think logically, and stay focused in spite of her entire world and career seemly about to crumble. I ended up crying with her, worrying with her and ultimately surviving despite of her great loss. Waiting for the next book in the Scarpetta series!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"My first book in the Scarpetta's series is Cruel and Usual. It was far more gory, scary and dark. &quot;Black Notice&quot; is gripping as all the other Scarpetta stories. However, the villain in this book is not so scary. The story moves mostly around Scarpetta's office politics. The subplot is actually the main plot of the story. After I read her latest book, &quot;The Last Precinct&quot;, I feel that &quot;Black Notice&quot; seems to be the book that Ms. Cornwell wrote to give us background information on the &quot;Loup Garou&quot;.The other element that almost disappears in this novel is the forensic part. I wish Ms. Cornwell writes more &quot;scientific investigation&quot; in her future novels. It is what makes her and Scarpetta different from other authors and detectives."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I felt ongoing instances of deja vu while reading &quot;Black Notice&quot; -- same characters acting the same way, and repetitive plot devices that Cornwell has used ad infinitum. The main characters do not grow or change at all during the course of the novel, and the rest of the cast is as thin as the pages they are written on.Someone needs to teach the author the difference between foreshadowing and telegraphing. I won't reveal the unsatisfying ending, but any reader will know after the first 25 pages where this one is headed. I believe several other Scarpetta books have ended in the exact same fashion.The only thing remarkable about this book is the lack of any type of suspense. And the only mystery is that Cornwell is paid so much to write so poorly. Let's hope she invests some of that cash in taking courses at the local community college. She could use some tutoring on plot and characterization."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"What a mess. The only explanation for book like this is that the author was facing a contract deadline to crank out one more in a previously sucessful series. Also, maybe that her books have been selling so well that her editor is afraid to cross her. This used to be a pretty good &quot;procedual&quot; series. Procedurals work best if the law-enforcement research and facts are detailed and compelling. The author's forays into psychological depth are amateurish and, worse, are tempting her to skimp on the technical details that were her forte.Like many of the other reviewers, I've lost patience with the one-dimensional depression and paranoia of the Scarpetta character, the rage of Marino (does it have to be pounded out in every single line of dialogue?), and the non-stop chaos of Lucy's life.And for heaven's sake, enough with the serial killers. It's getting hard to find a thriller that doesn't rely on the serial-killer gimmick to generate suspense. When will he kill again? Who cares, if even the first killing just generates a lot of random questions that the author never bothers to answer?"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Black Notice was a tolerable book until about three-fourths of the way through, when all the mysteries are basically solved.

Hard to finish and when I did I thought what a waste of time. Give me Grisham, Clancy, Patterson, Clark,Glenn but not Cornwall."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've read everyone of Cornwell's books and spent a fortune to have this shipped to HK when it was hot off the press.... glad Amazon gives a good discount since I was disappointed.Overall, the book was a bit tired...it lacks the excitement her previous books had and the story was a bit disjointed....the side-trip to Paris was a messy detour. Whatever &quot;history&quot; she provided sounds as though it came from a Michelin guide.Perhaps the introduction of a new young lover from the FBI may rev things up in the next book which should simply be termed a sequel... you can see it coming.Also, it's about time Cornwell has Lucy grow up and develop her &quot;character&quot; a bit more... her basic personna has remained the same throughout each book while Marino's shows signs of maturing although I don't think he is as &quot;90's&quot; as one reviewer suggested!Ms. Cornwell, why don't you retire your secretary, Rose, and replace her with someone who generates a little heat with Marino... love and efficiency all in one!Think Virginia West is a better protagonist than Kay Scarpetta is at this point. Kay, you should either get some of your spark back or opt to retire along with Rose and have Patricia Cornwell write about your successor!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the worst in a series of books that has been declining in quality. Same old gang - same old problems. Kay Scarpetta has to be the most unhappy person in the world. The weather is always gloomy. Marino is always testy. Lucy is always a brat. I've realized that I don't give a darn about these people and will never read another Cornwell book."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I loved the early Scarpetta mysteries. The last few have been pretty lame. It must be hard to write this type of stuff because I found Kathy Reich's second book over the top also. Who really believes that MEs are that involved in these cases that they are ever in danger? And when was the last time you saw a prominent newscast or newspaper including pictures of the ME? Implausible, hard to believe and tiresome. Kay is too self-important and claims to be an expert in everything from scuba diving to medical examining to computers to lesbians to FBI operations and now sex with the new young guy. Scarpetta is not likeable and has become so angry and paranoid that I don't want to read about her anymore. I realized in this book that Benton might be the only character I liked at all and now he's gone. And I never knew Kay loved Benton that much-- she fought with him all the time like she does with everyone else. Well it's all fiction and didn't happen-- isn't happening-- and the characters are not real. Hope her next one is better. Now I'm looking forward to Sue Grafton."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"For once I would like an original story line from Cornwell. Every one of her Kay Scarpetta novels has the same story line. Lucy and her current life partner in trouble. Marino in trouble on the job. Kay having love troubles, and job troubles. However, after reading the putrid Hornet's Nest, maybe Patricia just isn't a very good author. Stay away from this book....."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This latest book in the Scarpetta series was a big disappointment. Was this a forensic medicine story or the next plotline for Days of Our Lives? Too much emotional baggage and way too little forensics and prodedural, clever details. The plot was plodding, and when it did start to build an interesting political intrigue subplot that would take a brilliant coup for Scarpetta to emerge victorious, the author copped out with a cheap, ridiculous Hollywood ending."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I used to enjoy the Scarpetta series, beginning with the first novel, Post-Mortem. I drifted away after From Potter's Field, because I was tired of serial killers. What I enjoyed about those first novels was the realistic setting, characters and scales of the crime. I started reading again with the last novel and now this one. The characters have become unrealistic, jet-setting James Bond types, although James Bond doesn't spend so much time whining and complaining. These are really unpleasant people investigating ridiculously complicated crimes. This book's minor characters and sub-plots make no sense (Diane Bray?) and Cornwell's technical writing skills have deteriorated terribly. She also seems so focused on some kind of personal agenda about women and sexuality . . . I don't understand what's happened to this series."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Black Notice is another great Cornwell novel. As usual, you will find yourself turning pages faster than you can read. However, this book was a little more gore and less scare than her previous novels. It is definitely worth the read and leaves you in limbo eagerly anticipating Ms. Cornwell's next masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell just keeps getting better and better. With each book I feel closer to Kay, Marino,and lucy. Only Ms. Cornwell can make such characters come alive so well!! This novel keeps your interest from the start, and your heart goes out to Kay, Lucy and Marino while they fumble through their feelings about benton's demise.... But is he really gone? how did Jay find out so much about Kay? With every new novel you learn a little more about it's main characters so they become real..I for one want to feel like I've jumped right into the book and am one of the bystanders along for the ride, and Ms. Cornwell acomplishes that for me each time!!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I just finished Black Notice. It was another terrific book! I have read all of PC's books and the hardest part is waiting for the next one! She has never written a bad book, and if you missed one, you missed too many! I would like the chance to say thank you for the many great hours I have spent with Kay Scarpetta. I was so happy to see a man come into her life again!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I wondered how Dr. Kay would react to her lovers distruction. She is as human as the rest of us. We know that she hides behind a hard shell, only letting those truly close to her see her intense heartache. A modern day herione."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell continues her downhill slide. Although not as bad as her last several books, Black Notice is a big disappointment. The story line is full of holes, questions and unrealistic nonsense. The book also has an unpleasantly misogynistic tone, especially when dealing with the odious Diane Bray. I can only assume Patricia Cornwell's personal issues are spilling over into her work. Bring back the old, intriguing Kay Scarpetta and gang, not this whiny bunch."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is another great book by a talented author. She just can't write a bad one. Her main character came across as a real person dealing with real issues -- the lose of the man she loved. She shared her innermost feelings with the reader and showed she could work through it all. Let's face it, no one can be a brick all the time -- she isn't supposed to be superwoman! I enjoy everything Patricia Cornwell writes and look forward to more -- very quickly!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell dishes up another dicey case for Dr. Scarpetta. With Marino and Lucy in tow. All three trying desparetly to deal with Benton Wesley's cruel end.This books was great. Dr. Scarpetta was at her most vulnerable and best. Once again Cornwell deals us a Dr. Scarpetta who has to deal with the threat of her position, the unwanted task of dealing with her lovers death, Marino's ill manners and Lucy's need to prove she's the baddest of them all. She doen't always sidestep these encounters with deftness as Cornwell so allows her to be a real character with real emotions which are tangled up most of the time.In this case the murder is secondary to the warring emotions within the central characters which makes for an excellent read that is hard to put down.Good work Patricia Cornwell. Keep the Scarpetta novels coming. Look foward to your next."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I recently reread the Scarpetta series, after reading this one. I think *Cruel and Unusual* is the best of the lot. While others complain about Scarpetta's emotional depths in BN, I didn't mind that, although I found the book picked up speed in the second half. I've become more aware that Cornwell can be a sloppy writer - introducing references that are erroneous intrinsically or make no sense, and this has been more marked as the series progressed. Black Notice is more tightly written than previous works. I would like to see a shift in protagonist from Kay to Lucy, as an interesting evoluton in this series. Cornwell still has the gift of smooth writing"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Started out good but the plot never developed fully. No insight into the killer's mind. And the end just happened as though she just needed to stop before she wrote more than a certain number of pages -- plus the ending was predictable. Once again, her niece comes to the rescue."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book holds your interest from page 1--the best scarpetti yet--I recommend this to all--whether Cornwell fans or not(she has never been my favorite--but I am now a convert--the book is spellbinding and really a great read"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the first time I have listened to this author's book.

I actually would have put the novel down except for the fact that I was so angry for buying it in hardcover I was determined to finish it so I could give it a fair review. Don't waste your time or your money on this one. Cornwell should kill off this series and start over with a whole new cast of characters."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of Patricia's books. This book took me forever to get through. I found it very hard to believe everyone was out to get Kay. Lucy needs some new focus........I have always liked all of her characters....but this book just didn't endear them to me. Will be difficult to rush to buy the next book in this series......and I buy many books! I will read the reviews on the next one before I buy another disappointment."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I don't understand readers' negative comments--this is vintage Patricia Cornwell! The plot was well developed and intriguing, the characters were interesting, and Marino just gets better and better! He and Dr. Scarpetta remind me of a long-married couple in the way they play off each other. I actually caught myself chuckling aloud at some of their interchanges. And when the possibility began to exist that Benton might still be alive, I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Just a minor suggestion: Patricia, drop the lesbianic overtones; we know you're bisexual and it's evidently a big part of your life, but it just gets in the way of your stories...they stand up just fine without this digression!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I love Patricia Cornwell's books. I enjoy reading them because they deal with the same charaters which makes following the story line easy. However, I believe the characters need to be broadened. The have become stale. Dont get me wrong I enjoyed the book I just think it could have been better. I would still recommend it and I will continue to buy her books, at least for now. One last thing, The ending was awful. It just ended. I was really annoyed that I had read this entire book only to have that ending. I was left wanting so much more from this book. It was almost as if she just got tired and said ok THE END."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I read quite a few negative reviews about Black Notice on Amazon.com before I finally managed to get my hands on a library copy a few days ago. I must say I disagree with others' assessments that Cornwell 'sleepwalked through this one'. The first 72 pages gripped my heart and I fail to see how anyone who has read her previous Scarpetta books could not have been impacted by the depth of the character's grief over her lovers' death and impressed by Cornwell's eloquent expression of it. Reading is easy, writing is not. I think she did a marvelous job conveying inexpressible emotions--and in in dialogue, yet! I read more books in a month than most people read during a year, and I read everything Cornwell writes because she writes well. Her Scarpetta books are my favorites, and this one is surely as good as the previous books in the series. Cornwell is the mystery/ suspense author of the 90's. I give it 4 stars. You go, Patricia!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"With exception to the mandatory, but again way too much, gore this was an enthralling read. Beginning the book with the letter from Benton hooked me immediately, and having an evil nemesis like Bray was great. It reminded me of the Scarpetta of old. There was a lot less mulling over Marino's impending death. Basically, I found this book to be great and I am completely back on the bandwagon. Some advice for those who found the very descriptive, and almost nauseating, gore too much. The abridged version of the audio recording cuts it down to a tolerable minimum. Although I loved the storylines in the book, the gore almost, just almost, turned me off. So, for those with a weaker stomach than me, this is a great alternative, and you don't lose anything from the original because I read the book before I listened to it, and I came away satisfied both times"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"If you like angst-ridden novels in which the whining and crying go on and on forever, this one is for you. While the plot is a fairly decent one, the crying and whining carries on throughout the book: over the loss of Benton; over Lucy; over the loss of a dog; etc. And Marino? Formerly a gruff,but likeable curmudgeon, is now a sarcastic, pessimistic, unlikeable character that can not say two consecutive non-angry, non-swear words. Scarpetta has also increased the prejorative content of her vocabulary. The book is about three-fourths boring. Admittedly, the individual reading the book-on-tape has something to do with how the characters are cast, but the fact remains that about 80% of the angst and self introspection could be deleted without damage to the characters, for an over all improvement to a reasonable and suspense-filled plot. Unless Ms. Cornwall reverses the trend started with &quot;Black Notice,&quot; this is the last novel I will read by an author whose next issuance I formerly awaited with great anticipation."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Although I do enjoy these books, it is sometimes hard for me to get through them. I had no such problem with this one. I read it from beginning to end and have started again.I seriously related to Kay's, Lucy's and Marino's actions as a result of their grief and, in my opinion, they were very realistic. I also liked the introduction of Jay Talley to the story. I can't wait to see his development in the next book and how he continues to interact with Kay and Marino."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was slightly dissapointed with this book. There was very little character development, and the plot starts out with a bang then drags out, before it is wrapped up in very few chapters."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"After waiting for another Kay Scarpetta novel, I couldn't wait to immerse myself in the world of murder, mayhem, and pathology. As usual, Cornwell takes us down the twisting path of an unsolved murder(s). She throws enough hints to make you think you know who the culprit might be, yet keeps you guessing throughout. As with all of the other Scarpetta novels, I thoroughly enjoyed the read...however, I found myself getting upset with the behavior of Marino, and Lucy definitely needs to see a therapist. She has always been angry at life, but in this one she becomes mad at the entire world. I kept hoping that Kay would get over Benton and move on...I was glad to see a new interest with Talley, and certainly hope he returns in the future. As with some of the other reviewers, I felt I was left hanging with the ending. Very little resolution, and it seemed that everyone was still in a state of depression or anger. Too many of the plot twists were superfluous, and I would have liked to have seen more character development of some of the newer characters - like Talley. Enough of the internal anger and angst...hope that Cornwell lightens up next go round and lets Kay have a little fun. The woman certainly deserves it. All in all, I enjoyed the book, great escape, loved the loupe garu plotline!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Being a avid Patricia Cornwell fan I was a little disappointed with this creation. The character development was once again very discriptive but lacked continuity. I feel that Lucy's achievements are becoming a little far fetched and slightly unrealistic. Some characters for example Anderson and Jo seemed like add ons and afterthouchts. However it is a good read and as usual draws the reader in. However the ending was so abrupt, I was left feeling absolutely robbed and was dissatisfied, I felt there could have been a more intense ending than the one chosen."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I loved Postmortem. I have read all her books hoping that they will return to that level. This one didn't, not even maybe! I highly suggest that you should skip it unless you have _nothin'_ else to read! What a waste of paper and time!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books. I was not happy with Benton dying, but I do like Talley.

Her techinical writing is great and I enjoyed her first three or four books very much.Patricia, please go back to your previous style."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Cornwell seemed to be resting on her laurels with &quot;Black Notice&quot;. I found the story to be disorganized and hard to follow. She introduces several elements, but then goes nowhere with them. I felt the story ended with several threads left hanging, or with forced conclusions. She would have done better to simplify the plot and leave out some of the extraneous story lines."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I could not put this book down until about half way through. I had to force myself to finish it. I thought Patricia Cornwell was back to her old self with this new book. Once Kay and Marino flew to France, it was time for me to fly the coop. I enjoyed so many of her previous novels. At least this book was better than Southern Cross, but not by much."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of her books. The last two have been just terrible. She has lost her touch. Try Nelson Demille- he is outstanding!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have never read a Patricia Cornwell book before and was very &quot;unimpressed&quot; with it. First, she deals more with character interaction than the problem at hand. Second, she portrays men as pot-bellied, t-shirt wearing, foul-mouth men who care more about their social life than their job. All women are &quot;olive skin beauties&quot;, with perfect bodies, and ALWAYS in authority over men. The language was sickening, and way overdone to get the point across. I suffered through the first chapter and ended up throwing the book away.

This intriguing beginning sends Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Richmond, Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner, on a hunt for information that turns international in scope. She discovers that this is just one of a number of murders to contain those tell tale hairs.The murders, themselves, are graphic and the forensic details, as always, are fascinating, and Dr. Scarpetta's critical analysis of the pathology issues are well thought out and highly informative, as she sifts through the forensic evidence in order to profile the killer. Her assessment of the peculiar affliction of this serial killer is intriguing, providing scientific insight into creatures who were called werewolves, but who may have only been persons with a rare and unusual genetic condition, causing them to be especially hirsute, among other anomalies.Moreover, there are a number of subplots afoot. Dr. Scarpetta, who is recovering from the death of her lover, Wesley Benton, faces a number of problems closer to home.

Their repartee and dialogue is wonderful, giving evidence of their comfortable and close relationship, without saying so in so many words. They carp as if they were an old married couple. Lucy, Dr. Scarpetta's niece, however, is still a loose cannon, and it is unbelievable that any police agency would allow her to run around with a gun in her hand, given her record for shooting it off. Mercifully, this annoying character has a smaller role than usual in this novel, and the reader may only hope that she will either be written out altogether or get an attitude adjustment.The ending of the book, however, is a little too pat. Dr. Scarpetta's actions in the book's grand finale are not really believable for such an astute and normally cautious woman.

I read the next one, The Last Precinct, and loved it, too. I ordered the next one, Isle of Dogs, before I realized it wouldn't be a continuation and after reading some of the comments about it, I almost don't want to read it. Actually I have the audiotapes. I bought Southern Cross (which I am listening to now and really don't like it) and Hornets Nest (which I tried to listen to first but couldn't get interested in it--don't even like the guy's voice reading it). Patricia, stick with Kay Scarpetta!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I can understand how some people might find this latest Scarpetta read a bit predictable; but that's what endears the reader to a character--it's that predictability and familiarity to a character that keeps fans returning novel after novel. Granted, Marino is still grumpy, Lucy is still bull-headed, and Scarpetta wants to run the show. But that's the way people are in real life; they follow a pattern--they're not ever-changing. Just like that morning cup of coffee we take for granted or the evening in front of the tube with the family, Cornwell's characters have routines and it would be out of character for them to continually change. In this way, Cornwell has hit upon a very human trait. Some among us don't like this in a continued character in a book because it makes them appear stale, but alas, that is the way most of us are. Perhaps that is why some are disappointed--it hits too close to home and they don't want to admit that they, the reader, may be predictable as well.Cornwell remains true to her characters with attention to details that other writers would overlook. I've read all her books and look forward to Scarpetta's home as if it were my own; I know the kitchen, the office, the bedroom; her office and its various other rooms are etched in my memory. Marino's truck and slovenly abode reflects the gruff man who wants to be the caretaker yet longs to be taken care of. And Lucy is the wreckless child yearning for love and attention.To change any of these characters would be a disappointment. They are who they are, like them or leave them. As for the story itself, I found the details fascinating as usual and anxiously look forward to the next Scarpetta story. Thanks, Patricia, for an enjoyable read with old friends."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Ms. Cornwell wrote the latest with a chilling lack of sentimentality. She remained true to her genre and didn't allow herself to become squeamish about eradicating some intergral characters. As usual Cornwell kept my heart in my throat, my pulse racing and my mind energized. Good book, better ending."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have heard mixed reviews about this book, but i have to say that this is definatly one of Miss Cornwell's better works. Cornwell herself claims on her website that this is her best book to date.The book moves at a quicker pace than i was expecting, and the killer in this book is definatly one of her most interesting villans, right up there with Temple Gault and Carrie Grethen. I enjoyed this book considerably. It is good to see how much Scarpetta has changed since the first book, as well as Lucy and Marino.Some people argue that that the book fall short in the ending, if you other reading The Last Precinct then you will find the story continues and the loose ends are fixed.There was one problem i found in this book, Scarpetta says Dr. Anna Zenner's name as Dr. Anna Zimmer. In the previous books her last name is Zenner btu all of a sudden it is Zimmer. She goes back to calling her Zenner in The Last Precinct. Lazy editors! But overall Scarpetta fans will enjoy this outing."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have started reading the earlier Kay novels. And now that I have finished this one, I understand the complex personalities. I now realize that all of these characters relied on Benton to reaffirm their position in life. Kay has a really bad issue with trust. Her sister is not a very nuturing parent or sister. Dorothy is completely jealous of Kay. Lucy is stuck in her circumstances and is very needy. Marino is still in love with his wife and Kay. He knows well that Kay will never feel the same way, so he completely smitten with jealousy. The one thing that all these characters have in common, they are all afraid to deal with themselves. Benton was their safety net. I really like the odd twist of this book. I must admit my disappointment with Diane Bray's death. I think Kay really needs somebody to go toe to toe with. Diane and Kay would have been a nice rivarly."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've been disappointed with her last few books(especially since I mistakenly bought her cookbook) but with this book she brings back all our old friends, and leaves us with some interesting questions for the next book.

I am glad Kay was able to overcome her grief about the death of Benton. Jay sounds like her kind of guy. I thought that this book dealt better with the emotional turmoil that each character had about losing Benton and how they reacted about it. The coroners were graphic enough without being to gross or technical. I thought this book was well written and better than her last one."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I enjoy the Kay Scarpetta character but was disappointed when in the last book Benton was killed off. This book seems somewhat empty without a love interest for Kay and poor Pete Marino - he really needs to get a life already. I was also a little disheartened that the author choose to write the book with so much foul language. Overall though, it was well worth the time in reading and I will continue to look for the ongoing books of Kay Scarpetta."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Like other reviewers, I thought Cornwall spent too much time dwelling on Kay, Marino and Lucy's grief over Benton's death which seems to have made Kay much harder and given to some rather vulgar language that I don't recall her using in other books. The serial killer story and Marino and Kay's conflicts with the new deputy police chief were as fascinating as other Scarpetta novels, and I wish more time had been devoted to that aspect. I hope Cornwall's next Scarpetta book is more up to par with her others."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"What a grumpy, grouchy bunch of charaters. Beside the fact I found my self in an ill frame of mind, I,as usual, totally enjoyed this Patricia Cornwell book."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"However, my MOM loves to read Ms.Cornwells books and she is becoming more and more upset with the foul language. Why can't you continue your great work without all the filthy language????????"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"My enjoyment of BLACK NOTICE was diminished by the possibility that Scarpetta would eventually come face to face with the killer (as she has in all the previous novels). Sure enough, this came to pass. When was the last time you read about an ME confronting a killer. How refreshing had she determined who the killer was and then phoned the police to pick up the culprit. Dull? Boring? Yes..but more realistic."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwall does it again! A terrific fast-paced thriller, with multiple sub-story lines that keep the reader riveted. When reading each of her &quot;Kay Scarpetta&quot; novels, it is important to understand that these are not sequential. Therefore, one needs to mentally &quot;place&quot; each novel in the sequence of the others. This Kay Scarpetta &quot;chapter&quot; answers many questions one had with previous &quot;chapters&quot; of the saga...about various core characters and the one-year-plus grieving process Kay has undergone. One tends to forget that characters in a book, if they are to reflect reality, do not resolve grief in a day. In addition, it introduced new characters and gave modern scientific insight into an ancient terror (werewolves), plus what I believe continues to be the finest literary description of the ethical issues and techniques of modern medical science. For all these reasons, I found it to be very enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I enjoy the continuing character development in the Scarpetta series. Cornwell writes great fiction, evidenced by her books' ability to absorb readers. Some Cornwell regulars have been critical of her works of late, claiming that the characters are depressed, or not developing in the way the reader &quot;wants&quot;. I find, however, that her books are great literary fiction, and I thoroughly enjoy allowing myself to be absorbed into the scenes she describes. It is fun to follow Kay, Pete, Lucy and the others as they journey through life. Sure, things may not turn out the way the reader would hope or prefer, but isn't that what good fiction is all about? Pick this one up and enjoy it! I look forward to her next installment in the Scarpetta series."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the worst of the lot - close to Hornet's Nest. Have been a fan and read all of the books twice, but this one screamed with angry characters and predictable plot. Much of the plot seemed to come from past stories. Maybe this one was just for therapy - Kay's, Pete's, Lucy's &amp; Pat's."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Black Notice is yet another outstanding book.Patricia Cornwell is back on track with this one. Bring back her main charchters was the best thing she could have done. I sat on the edge of my seat the whole time I was reading it. Hope she has another book in the works."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Wonderful book. Nice to see Cornwell and Scarpetta back together again. I missed that dynamite duo! Marino will never change! His sarcasm, knows everything, got to be right attitude is fantastic! How Scarpetta can put up with him is beyond me. Good job on the novel Patricia. I expected a little more up close and personal suspense, but you kept my interest from front to back. No, I couldn't put it down! I recommend to everyone who has enjoyed Dr. Scarpetta and Marino! GET IT! NOW!!!!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Isn't there supposed to be at least one likeable character in a book? Every character in this book was depressing, with no redeeming qualities. Scarpetta spent the entire book feeling sorry for herself. Marino is a drunken bum. Lucy is a walking time bomb. I don't remember Benton being such a great guy. Why has his death destroyed so many lives?"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've always been a big Scarpetta fan BUT her cold materialistic nature is getting old. Neice Lucy needs some serious therapy and fighting the battle against predjudice is getting old too. There is not as much new forensic detail as there has been in the past. Over all a good book but Kay better get happy and stop the know it all attitude or I may stop reading the books."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The book started off strong. I was really getting into to it, I didn't want to put the book down, until the end. What a disappointing ending, it's as if Patricia Cornwell didn't know where she was going with the story so she decided to quickly throw an ending together. It didn't do the book justice!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell's Black Notice is a fast-paced thriller for all but the last two chapters... then she ends the book very much like her last two books -- very neatly and VERY quickly. I don't understand what the rush is to have the book conclude so quickly and what about some imagination in the ending, please! Other than the last two chapters, this is vintage Scarpetta -- lots of forensic medicine that makes you feel like you're in the autopsy suite with her, lots of scares and of course, lots of lip from Marino! This book is much stronger than her last one, Point of Origin, which made Scarpetta into a WonderWoman(is there anything that she CAN'T do?!?!) One other criticism is that Lucy is becoming a wacko and in some serious need of psychotherapy before she shoots everyone!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Excellent follow up to POINT OF ORIGIN. It's good to see that Kay is human after Benton's death. Not sure about the very-cardboard-too-good-to-be-real Agent Jay though, that will be very interesting."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is perhaps one of Cornwell's best attempts yet. Too bad the New Yorker's can't appreciate it. This is a mature mystery writer, who has mastered the art of suspense, intrigue, and delicately sprinkled a taste of Dr. Kay Scarpetta's past into Black Notice. None of the characters were ill-defined or out of place. Thanks, Ms. Cornwell, for hitting stride on this one. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell has done it again. She has outdone herself....I read this book in a day and a half. I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book but if you haven't read the entire Scarpetta series. Read them in order you'll enjoy it all the more."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Imagine escaping death at the hands of a crazed killer, not once, not twice but over and over and over again and still making the same stupid mistakes. Perhaps Dr. Kay Scarpetta has a death wish... Why would someone trained to deal with death not know all the stages of mourning, and not seek counseling?Why is it such a big deal that Lucy is gay and why is she protrayed as such a loose cannon?To say I wasn't at all pleased with this read which was slow going until the halfway point would be an understatement. Unless Dr. Scarpetta and her niece get some psychiatric help, I won't be following her exploits any more."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I don't know why the author created another new man for Kay. Her life is stressful, so she needs a help. Yes, I agree. But there are a few people who want to help her, but can't because she doesn't want them to help her. To avoid them, Kay falled in love with another man. I don't like such a way to solve the problem with people who love me and whom I love."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This author's story telling skills make any new installment in the Kay Scarpetta series difficult to resist. However, while the usual good plotting is in evidence here, the turgid interpersonal relationships between Kay and Marino and Kay and Lucy are becoming tiresome. Also, Kay is becoming a little self-indulgent and egotistical. A little more plot and less of the interpersonal stuff would be good."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It wasn't nearly as exciting as some of the earlier ones. It's almost as though her style of writing has changed over the series. I hope The Last Precinct will be better, but some of the reviews I've seen makes me doubtful."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have become hooked on the series and I have enjoyed them all. I am now reading the last of this series (the next one after Black Notice, The Last Precinct) and I find these very fasinating. The writer does a very authentic job with the Medical Examiner part. I am fasinated with the forensic medicine (having been a nurse for 28 years now this stuff is find intriging). I love the characters because not one of them is perfect, not even Kay Scarpetta, they all have their fears and areas they are insecure in. Just like real life. Nothing is ever perfect, and that is why it is so real."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have been a faithfull reader of Ms. Cornwell's for years. I have read all the books in the series. After Benton's death I was certain that because of that shocking death of a old friend I would never read another book of hers again. I know you are thinking I need help, but once you begin to read her books you will be hooked! This was one book I put off for about one month. (Okay so I am not that strong of a person.) It was worth the wait. The twist and turns keep you guessing all through out and the additional characters add so much to the familiar favorites."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Black Notice by Patricia Cornwell has an intriguing start, with Kay Scarpetta trying to come to grips with her grief a year after Benton's death. As she comes out of her fog Kay realizes that she and those she holds dear, Marino and her niece Lucy are contending with some serious problems. That story is interesting and entertaining, but then that plot line is suddenly ended in a rather startling and bizarre fashion.We are transported to Edgar Allen Poe land and the Murders of Rue Morgue. The books ends with more loose ends than tied ones and its no mystery in the traditional sense, because the killer appeared very late in the game. The killer is pesented it such a way that you feel sorry for this pathetic creature rather than being repulsed by his heinous crimes.I personally want to know why all the hairs appeared to be cut and none came out with their follicles intact. And really how could Kay be so stupid to open the door?Having said that, it was an entertaining read and I intend to read Cornwell's books again. I have enjoyed many in the past."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"What a strange plot. Scarpetta and Marino are ordered by ATF and a Senator to go to Paris. &quot;Go and go right away. We need your help.&quot; When they arrive at Paris Interpol, Kay is told, &quot;You may be our only hope.... Police can't go inside the Paris morgue and start asking questions.&quot; So Kay is told SHE needs to contact the chief French medical examiner, on the pretext she's just looking her up because they were on a symposium panel together once, and &quot;she's agreed to talk with you,&quot; and, by the way, how's your drug case investigation going? But when she gets together with the French medical examiner, the French doctor says, &quot;when you called, I knew what it was about because I'm the one who asked you here.&quot;So the French medical examiner needed to ask Interpol to fly an American medical examiner (with her police buddy for company) to France on the Concorde in order to relay a message to Interpol in Paris?!Is Cornwell the only person alive who doesn't know how AOL works? We read in the book, &quot;I brought up the menu on my computer and looked at the icon for AOL. I logged on without a problem, meaning no one else had done so first.... Ruth called back minutes later and sounded excited. 'He bought a computer and printer last month,' she reported. 'For about six hundred dollars. And the computer came with a modem.'&quot;'And we have AOL software here.' 'Tons of it. If he didn't buy his own, he certainly could have gotten his hands on it.'&quot;Of course, the killer, having shipped one of his victim's bodies across the Atlantic, decides to follow the body and stalk everyone investigating the crime in the US?!There are better books out there. Skip this one."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Having read everything Patricia Cornwell has written so far, and being a huge fan of hers, it saddens me to have to give a less than excellent review. I was disappointed that so much of this novel focuses on Scarpetta's grief. I always enjoyed reading Cornwell's books for the action and interesting plot twists. While this book has some action and some interesting points, it also focused on grief and anger entirely too much to make it an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"After I read her last book, Point of Origin, I was hesitant in buying into Ms. Cornwell again. Being optimistic, I bit for this one. And it did not bite back. In fact it gummed me to death. Did anyone else find the dialogue so cluttered a dustbuster couldn't clear it up? I do not like to *dis* any book or any author, they do something I cannot--write. However, in good faith, I cannot recommend Black Notice due to poor plot, dialogue, &amp; frustrating folly.other reading suggestions: &quot;Bleeding Out&quot; by Baxter Clare, &quot;Ashes To Ashes&quot; by Tami Hoag, and &quot;Manhattan Is My Beat&quot; by Jeffrey DeaverThanks for your interest &amp; comment vote--CDS"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This really IS a good book! From the very first page, when the letter from Benton arrives a year after his 'death', to the last page, when the murderer is identified, I was caught up in the characters, the plot, the background, and suspense of this novel. My personal taste in the mystery genre runs to novels which combine a richly textured setting with an intellectually teasing plot--with, of course, a little action mixed in. &quot;Black Notice&quot; has all of those elements along with Cornwell's evocative prose and psychological insight.In her immediately previous novels, I felt Cornwell faltered some, and I feared she was losing her edge--perhaps there were too many hastily written novels in a short period of time. But &quot;Black Notice&quot; is finely crafted and meticulously researched (except for the very bad gaffe about using AOL in a government setting)--Cornwell has returned to her previous fine form."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Oh, my. What is with this whole conspiracy thing. Let me premise this by saying that I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and was looking forward to this one coming out, but what a disappointment! Why must Lucy somehow be connected to all of Kay's cases. How realistic is that. Oh, how I wish that she would go back to the earlier storylines where there was just some serial killer out there, and Kay and Marino just went out and did their jobs instead of all of this highly implausible international intrigue that Ms. Cornwell makes us plod through. I don't know how many more books that Ms. Cornwell can put out about these characters, because they're apparently all about to have nervous breakdown's! If you're also sick of these crazy plot twists, check out Kathy Reich's books, they're alot like the early Cornwell ones. Pure science and thriller, none of this crazy mess."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I used to be able to read a Scarpetta book at least twice. Now I have trouble getting through the first read. I guess the author isn't the only one who has lost interest in the series. I'm tired of outlandish and cartoonish killers and I wish Cornwell would learn how to write endings. It's all so old. Kay's mates are killed off, Lucy is nuts and miserable and gun-happy, but always in loving relationships. Kay is always the killer's target. People are always out to get her. There are always a number of amazing coincidences to tie things together in a hasty knot that passes for plot. I'd like more crime and much less of Kay's messy, uncontrolled inner life. Now THAT is a frightening place and I don't want more than glimpses. I don't want to know how unhinged Kay is becoming. I thought I was buying a CRIME novel."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have loved the Scarpetta series from Post-mortem. I was appalled at the foul language used throughout this book and the lack of a plot. I was hoping that this book would be better than &quot;Hornet's Nest&quot; and &quot;Southern Cross&quot; but I rate them the same. Point of Origin went back to her original writings but I'm not sure I'll read another. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The feeling I had while reading Black Notice is that Cornwell has created this intriguing, fascinating world, but she's floating up above it looking down. She refuses to swim down close enough to really take in--or convey--the details. Any tidbits we did get seemed like they came off of some master Cornwell checklist. Sullen characters becoming more sullen--check. More superwoman deeds with a touch of stupdity to make it believable--check. E-mail as the source of all evil--check. You get the picture. I really think Amazon, B &amp; N, Borders, etc. need to move Cornwell out of the mystery category &amp; stick her in personal growth. There is no mystery to her books anymore. The last few have been more about Cornwell than Scarpetta. The ironic thing is she's even turning off some of her gay fans. Some friends of mine--a lesbian couple--haven't even bothered to get the last two books autographed. Even they think it's time for Cornwell to get off her soapbox and get back to plots with substance. Logical, gratifying endings would be nice, too."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The story was farfetched, drawn out, and the characters improbable. But worst-the details of autopsies on burned bodies revolted me, a surgeon of many years"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read most of Patricia Cornwell's books and I have a hard time believing that the characters just seem to stand still and don't grow in any way. Marino seems to be a cartoon character built upon every generalization of middle-aged overweight men you ever heard of, Kay Scarpetta just can't be that unaware (we all knew the suspect was outside the door and who was stealing in the morgue). A book about Lucy could be very interesting at this point, she seems to have growth potential. I was disappointed with the overall story and the complete lack of character growth - no one here seems to have learned anything from their past."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was a fan of Cornwell's very early books but in the last few years I have given up on reading them because of her poor writing. I was influenced to read &quot;Black Notice&quot; because of some very glowing reviews on this web site. Luckily I didn't buy the book but found it at my local library. I read the first 50 pages or so and couldn't believe that anyone would publish a book with such poor plot and character development, poor knowledge of police procedure, and choppy unconnected writing style.Ms Cornwell either needs to take a vacation from writing or her editor needs to edit better."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have been a big fan and avid &quot;Skarpetta&quot; fan since Cornwell's very first book. For a long time I have been to the point of not even reading her reviews, the bookcover panels, etc., I just KNEW her book would be well worth it. I was so disappointed with Black Notice. For starters, it is so unlikely that she would meet the perfect man and even care while her career lays in ruin, her neice is in danger, Moreno's job is on the line, her computer system is being broken into and she has dead bodies all over the place. But she has time to find the &quot;second&quot; Mr Right and dump him all in one setting??? Very not like Kay Skarpetta. Also, all of the loose ends are just that, loose. And at this point, I could care less if Lucy dies, if Skarpetta loses her job, and I am kinda rooting for &quot;Chuckie&quot;. But, as usual, I will probably calm down just in time for her next one."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Lucy is angry. Marino is angry. Kay is angry. I've read and enjoyed every one of the Kay Scarpetta novels up until now, but the characters have become as predictable as taxes. Even those who made their debut in this one -- Diane Bray, Jay Talley, Det. Anderson -- are cardboard. To add insult to injury, the dialogue was often inane and we learned virtually nothing about the killer other than bizarre surface facts. Looks like Patricia Cornwell phoned this one in."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I enjoyed this novel, contrary to what other reviewers thought.Scarpetta as a role model - COME ON!! She's a character in a book, whoin this most recent effort, has seemed to have joined the rest of us mere mortals in her ability to grieve, get depressed, relapse smoking, and feel out of control. I was beginning to get sick of the Scarpetta novels - I felt Kay was too much of a machine - a boring know-it-all. I think this book approaches &quot;The Body Farm&quot; and her other earlier efforts, where the characters were believable, sympathetic, and not-to-perfect. So there's a new love interest, and he's younger - SO WHAT? I'm looking forward to the next Scarpetta book - I feel like my old friends are back!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Kay has deteriorated into a poor storyteller, and seems to have become a very unstable person - was Chief Bray on the right track with her dismissal? The story jumps all over, Marino seems to have become a liability rather than a brilliant detective. Kay can't figure out who is leading the seduction, and we did NOT need the kernal about Benton's autopsy. I really used to enjoy the smooth writing of these books, but it seems to degenerated into some disjointed stream of conciousness. Time to search for a new author!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"While I have really enjoyed the first 3 books of the series, I find myself asking with each subsequent book,&quot;Who the heck will Cornwell kill off next?&quot; Maybe that annoying absentee mother of Lucy's, maybe Kay's long lost uncle, maybe Marino's hairdresser. Patricia! Listen up! You stretch our disbelief to the breaking point with all of these deaths. Mark gets blown up, Benton loses face (groan) and a friend of Kay's is shot mistakenly after her sister is claimed for a serial killer's victim in an earlier book. Other than my overall objections to the series' determination to kill off everyone Kay loves, Black Notice was a fine book. But it didn't scare me like Post-Mortem or engross me like Hannibal. And the prose sometimes gets so dense I feel like I'm launching myself into a brick wall by catapault and sliding right down. I just can't fall into the book in the techical parts."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book compounded the disappointment I felt when reading the last Kay Scarpetta novel. If I wanted to read about love, sex, anger, grief and subsequent angst I wouldn't buy a book touted as a mystery. The real enchantment of the beginning books in these series was Kay Scarpetta as a professional in the fascinating field of forensic pathology. Her character was fleshed out in a realistic way by her relationships with Lucy, Marino and Benton AND there was real mystery to be solved. Now, Lucy is a basket case and so is Kay. Benton is dead and may be lucky at that and poor Marino isn't getting the attention his character deserves. Bray and her sidekick are one dimensional (where in the world did they come from?) and the sub-plots were an annoying distraction. My overall impression is that the author is falling apart. It is my sincere hope that she gets back together. But in the meantime don't waste your time with this book."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Interesting how people feel that fictional characters must adhere to certain standards. Cornwell has decided to show us vulnerability in her strong-on-the-outside characters, which is a refreshing change. Even the &quot;bad guy&quot; was depicted as vulnerable. There are no rules on how Kay, Lucy, or Marino are supposed to be, especially given the situations these characters have been handed, so just read it and enjoy a Scarpetta novel with a little more &quot;edge&quot;."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This series has not gone the way I'd hoped. Kay used to be a great medical examiner completely committed to solving crimes. Now she's an emotional basketcase and I'm forced to read about it. Lucy is dangerous as well as an emotional basketcase, and Marino is half the cop he used to be. The plots are unrealistic and closer to melodrama than gritty crime stories.The series is getting stranger and I don't like it."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the first story that I have listened to by this author/narrator and it was wonderful. Not only did it give you an eye's view in the world of forensic medicine, it held your gaze toward's the world of Interpol and crooked law enforcement. I recommend it to anyone taking a long trip and wanting entertainment on the road."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The latest Patricia Cornwell entry is totally boring.What little plot there is concerning a killer, or the werewolf, is secondary to the soap opera antics of dear Kay."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"In keeping with the entire Kay Scarpetta series, (Hornet's Nest, although good missed a key ingredient - Kay Scarpetta), I read this book as I have every one of Cornwell's writings - while waiting at red lights, in the bath tub, loading the dishwasher, etc. It was impossible to put down! Patricia Cornwell hits the mark of intrigue, keeps Marino loveable, and picks a great psychodrama mystery. I'm not sure there was any point in going to Europe - that left me a little cold - thus the 4 stars - but I do not vote for the potential replacement of Benton as intimated in Black Notice. Let's give Kay someone up to her par......rebounds are fine, but not this one.Keep Kay active in our lives....I await her new adventure with baited breath!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I really love her Scarpetta-books, but this is a true disappointment. Wimsical, sometimes uncomprehensive. And the end are so flat and short that you wonder if you lost the last twenty pages. There's a lot of promising plots that Cornwell starts but she seems too unfocoused to give them a satisfactory solution. And please, Madame Scarpetta, stay in Richmond. The Paris excursion with the &quot;Hunchback from Notre Dame&quot;- theme are a bit too thick for European-audience."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"A good strong start with 'traditional' attention to detail in both setting and characterisation. However I am unsure how many of the Scarpetta novels have now featured the criminal at Kay's doorstep. Move house, change telephone number, get better security ..... develop an original ending? Do something to save this enjoyable character (and another Southern Cross is most definitely not the answer!)"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I heard an interview with Patricia Cornwell about this book and was intrigued - and I haven't been intrigued by a Scarpetta novel for some time. Patricia said that in this book she wanted to explore Kay's own reaction to grief, bearing in mind that until now Kay has always dealt with the grief of other people. I thought this was an interesting idea and thus bought the book.My only complaint about this idea is that Scarpetta did not fall to pieces over the death of her beloved boyfriend Mark from an IRA bomb at Victoria station (one of the more sillier plotlines Cornwell has used, I might add) to the extent she has done so over Benton. But this is a minor quibble!Like many readers I share some of the criticisms about the &quot;james bondisation&quot; of the main characters and Cornwell's obsessions with the sexuality of her characters. It would be good if Kay could stay in Richmond for one novel at least! Lucy is no longer a credible character but Cornwell (at least) alluded to this via some of the comments made by Marino in Black Notice about Lucy's latest somewhat deranged escapades. The Diane Bray storyline seemed a bit pointless - I mean, why would Diane Bray give a rat's *** about Kay Scarpetta? She is just a forensic examiner for crying out loud!! And Jay was poorly characterised. It would also be good if next time Cornwell could drop the killer chasing after Scarpetta storyline - that really is tired now and we all know Kay will survive! There is absolutely no suspense in that route at all and as other reviewers have said, it was all so predictable.But for some reason I found Black Notice to be a compelling read and I enjoyed it much more than I have some of the more recent Cornwell fare. The murders were interesting and I did not spot the resolution of the baby hair. I think some of the reviewers have been a bit harsh on the technical aspects of this book which, as ever, were second to none. ANOTHER TIP - Patricia Cornwell said in the radio interview that she is developing an interest in archaeology and has been going on digs, looking at skeletons, etc. This reminded me of the Kathy Reichs novels where the main character is a forensic anthrolopolgist. Is this going to be a future Scarpetta storyline? Watch this space..."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I think it is Patricias best book and I'm looking forward to read the rest of the stories about Kay S. If you got sad after Point of Origin you will really work through the feelings with Kay, and I think Patricia does this really well. I cried a lot with the character, but at the other hand it was also very revealing, she gets deeper into the Kay character. The nice turn in the end helped it up to a clear five star."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"We loved it especially when Kay goes international.We hope that Patricia keeps Kay 'alive' .As a medical person myself I can visualize what is happening .I love the intruge."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Scarpetta is a detail freak in her work but has no concept of follow-through in her life. Things happen that are just ignored, it seems like the plots are a pastiche of paragraphs about Scarpetta which are forced into a chronology by her editor. The woman can write; I wish she'd take a story idea, outline it to figure out what she wants to say and where she wants to go, then go there. There's brilliance, and great sentences, solid characters, good science. But what holds them all together? The binding."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The majority of the book is spent tangling and untangling relationsips that have little bearing on the plot. And speaking of plot...where was it. The book drags on forever only to have everything wrapped up in less than 20 pages. This book has no relation to the earlier solid writings in the other Scarpetta novels. Though not a total waste of time this is one book better left on the shelf or at least wait for the Cliff notes to come out."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Cornwell presents a crime and then goes way out into left field with distractions, sub-plots and too much anger.

The story takes place just a scant year after Benton is killed at the hands of Lucy's first lover, Carie Grenthorn, and Kay is still reeling from the horrific loss of her true soulmate. Out pops an unidentified, putrifying body from a shipping container that originated in Europe. To add to the already captivating story, Marino develops his own problems with a female boss who seems determined to rid him of his job and his sanity. Towards the end, the reader is tempted to forsake everything just to find out what is going to happen. I found myself warning Kay out loud in a room full of children as I supervised a lunch detention. In my opnion, this is one of Ms. Cornwell's very best efforts, and I have read them all."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"It's pretty easy to describe my feelings about this book:&quot;It's terrible - don't bother - I will never buy another book from this book series - the end has come.&quot;I used to love reading Patricia Cornwell's books. Oh well, it must be hard to keep the characters and plot lines fresh for such a long time.I'll have to find another author to replace this one."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I agree with what some other on-line reviewers have opined: most elements of this Scarpetta novel are not too bad, but the character development is non-existent. Scarpetta, Marino, and Lucy have turned into one-dimensional stereotypes. No subtlety of characterization; no surprises in the way they act and react. Readers who didn't like this one should try an earlier book in the series, e.g. Post-Mortem or All That Remains."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Any book with 275 reviews doesn't need another but--being from Richmond and all (note to author: VA State employees do not have access to AOL. Note to Readers: any comparison between Marino and an actual Richmond police captain is insulting.) Gave this two stars because the first 1/3 is paced briskly; a few new characters are introduced (non-serial killing non-monsters). Things are looking good. Then Kay goes to Paris, and it's all over. Her monster is laughable, it drags, you don't care, and your spirits lift at the end because you know it's almost over.You heard it here first. She's going to kill off the obnoxious Lucy. We'll have to suffer through Kay's spasms &amp; histrionics of grief, but it will be well worth it to never be confronted by that wretched girl again."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"i was reading the inside flaps of the summary of the book, and the words, &quot;retreive hidden evidence&quot; and &quot;carry out a mission&quot; made the book sound pretty exciting. but i am so wrong. the book rushed at the ending , was slow, and was pretty bad. although i think unnatural exposures was the worst book, this was pretty bad too."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've heard so much about this author's work, but it seems I started off with the wrong novel. Way too many subplots that weren't completed and the ending has to be one of the worst, I've come across. But despite all of these flaws, it still wasn't the worst book I've read this year.I'll try another one of her books and just hope this was a fluke."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of the Scarpetta books. Granted, it is hard to come up with new stuff after so many great books. But, this was better than I expected. The characters were developed thoughtfully, althought I agree with reviewers who felt that the story came to a screeching conclusion with many unanswered questions. I am not repulsed by vulgarity, but I did feel that the gratuitous use of profanity went well beyond what was required to establish character identity. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the read and will look forward to the next installment."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is my first Patricia Cornwell book, and I'm disappointed. The dialog is sharp and not convincing. The book reads more like a made-for-TV mini-series than of a novel. There is an excessive number of subplots, none of which deal with catching the &quot;werewolf&quot;. I'll give her one more shot to impress me."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"i thought i had misunderstood previous reviews and that this was going to be one of the better books. what a confusing plot; then to end the book as quickly and as incompletely totally irritated me. i don't think i've ever walked away from a cornwell thinking that it was a waste of time and money but this time, as much as i hate to admit it, i did. for a beter read, plick of james patterson's new: pop goes the weasal"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"OK, so the &quot;Black Notice&quot; of the title is a dead body that shows up in the first couple of chapters. By page 150 they still haven't even finished the autopsy. The plot is buried in layers of irrelevant and tedious detail presented with a tortured writing style.If that weren't bad enough, the majority of the first half of the book is dedicated not to this intruiging story line, but - and I'm not kidding here - to a burocratic power struggle amongst egotistical civil servants. I cannot remember every having read a more tedious, uninspiring, lengthy and pointless subplot (although I haven't read anything by Tom Clancy recently). And this whole subplot is based on the premise of a computer security breach that even the most novice user of AOL would find laughable.Throw in a cast of annoying, unsympathetic characters (not even Kay or Mariano are even the least bit endearing), most of whom are unbelievable to boot, and you get a read that is tiresome and pointless.Worst book I've read in quite some time."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Come on, Ms. Cornwell, lighten up! Black Notice was a splendid yarn about a Werewolf but so many sub-plots were thrown in, the character-development and his origins were buried. I have always loved big, brusque, protective Marino but in this one his disgusting behavior was a real turn-off. He typified the \\"ugly American\\" when they were in France. And where was your usual grand and glorious ending tying in all the loose ends? This one seemed to just abruptly stop.From the description of the killer, with his long body hair, ugly face and pointy teeth, it was completely illogical that SOMEONE didn't spot him long before the end."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I love Kay Scarpetta and can never wait for her character to have another book. But lately I have been alittle disappointed with Cornwell's writing. This book is supposed to take you across the Atlantic to France where Kay uncovers some hidden truths. The only problem is that she waits until the 25th chapter to start the story the veiwers are anticipating. And then she wraps it up too quickly. Cornwell includes other stories that should be included in the book synopsies but aren't. She is almost starting to read like a cookie cutter author when it comes to Kay Scarpetta books. There ins't any scary plot twists like there were in her first 3 books."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Unless you are privy to the events of &quot;Point of Origin&quot; you have no clue why Scarpetta is so disfunctional. There are too many novelettes within this piece of work to stay focused on the real story. I got blind sided too many times with confusing storylines and loose ends. This deserves to be re-written in a more focused format that does justice to Ms. Cornwell as well as Kay Scarpetta. I'm still a fan and will continue to be so as long as Scarpetta is around."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This outshines the other Scarpetta novels. I have had the pleasure of reading all the other Scarpetta novels and have always enjoyed them. I had some reservations about this one with Benton Wesley being killed off in the previous scarpetta novel but this was sheer brilliance. It was a definite improvement over the last Scarpetta novel where the writer seemed to have lost some of her feel for the character and the stories. I can't wait for the other Scarpetta novel. This is a MUST READ."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"If you like Kay Scarpetta's adventures, this is more of same. Same Kay, same Lucy, same Merino, only more so. I think some new blood is indicated for this series, the new love interest sounds like he may not last but if Kay ever perks up she may enjoy herself. I wish we could find out more about Marino's mysterious son. Anyway, I enjoyed this book even though it's similar to all the others, though I felt the villain was ludicrous and the ending was so abrupt she may as well have written &quot;end of part I&quot; for a closing sentence. One thing I didn't like - I know you have to be a tough specimen to be a police woman, not to mention Detective or Chief, but did Bray and Anderson HAVE to be portrayed as such repellent, evil, slimey, perverted SERPENTS? They were one step above the loup garrou, if you ask me. I enjoyed &quot;Black Notice&quot; but will be disappointed il future stories follow the same ol' same ol' angst of our three heroes."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I, like everyone else who reviewed this book, have been an avid Cornwell fan. I enjoyed this book and finished it in two days, but was not left with the &quot;I'm dying for another one&quot; feeling I usually have after her books. The love/sex encounter seemed totally ridiculous and out of place to me. I was ashamed of and embarrassed for Kay. I usually enjoy Lucy's character and don't mind her being &quot;difficult&quot;, but in this book she was worse than a thirteen year old pubescent. Grow up! I was also very let down at the end not to learn more about the killer and his life. We were tempted throughout the book about his affliction and backround and then left hanging. I enjoy all of the autopsy and medical detail she puts in her books and was glad to see plenty of that still there. As others have stated, I also became bored with Kay's &quot;grief&quot;. It got very old. I will continue to read her books, but hope she gets back to her usual style of writing."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Dr. Scarpetta shows some emotion over Benton's loss, and it affects her relationships with Lucy &amp; Marino. This is a &quot;fast read&quot; book that takes the reader from Va. to Paris. It's just gory enough to be fun and not too gory for sensitive tastes. Kay's search for the killer of an unidentified foreigner &amp; a local convenience store clerk pits her against the new police boss and a cartel. Interpol steps in and affects her search for truth while placing her in jeopardy."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books. I wasn't sure if this one would be good or where she would go with Kay Scarpetta since her beloved Benton was dead, but she has done it again!!! This is a page turner just like all the rest of them."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Glad to be back with Kay and all her trials and tribulations. There are parts where it is just impossible to put it down until you find out what happens, even when you know you will suffer at work the next day. You can promise yourself all day that you will make up the sleep tonight but until it is done you might as well forget it."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell researches all of her books so well, including this one. Her medical and legal background is very sound. The character development and overall plot to this novel is excellent. My only problem lies with the sense that she is getting lazy. In her most recent books the endings are all the same, and she tends to wrap them up awful quickly. She will spend 200 pages developing the plot and in 15 conclude it, but all in all, Black Notice is a good read as are all of Cornwell's books."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This latest &quot;edition&quot; of Kay Scarpetta's life was one of my favorites. It's a different kind of Scarpetta novel. This one is more about the characters with the &quot;mystery&quot; taking very much the back seat.Lucy is back and Marino and they're all sharing in the pain regarding Benton's death. Of all the books, this one moves the characters themselves further than any other (as with &quot;The Body Farm&quot;). It's good to see that Kay is, indeed, capable of depression, that she is NOT a superwoman (no matter what SHE might think). I'd recommend this book to anyone - especially the fan who considers themselves part of Kay's extended family. I only wish Cornwell would publish more Scarepetta mysteries (I'm not thrilled with the &quot;Hornet's Nest&quot; bunch). Also, I think it'd be great if Lucy got her own book! These are all characters we've come to know and love - this book will further that. Regards to all. TurTleX"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"If you skip the first several chapters of emotional blather [Kay didn't give Benton that much of her time when he was alive!!], suffer through the usual attempt at character assassination by one of her coworkers, and ignore the increasingly foul mouths of Scarpetta and Marino, AND accept that the fastidious Dr. Scarpetta will fall in love [or lust] in such a short time, this book isn't all that bad!How about more plot development and less talk? How about an ending that ends a book instead of coming to a certain number of pages [or words] and stopping? Kay and Lucy are purported to be highly intelligent women, why do they act so oddly all of the time--this is not something that started with Benton's death--Lucy is always angry and out of control and Kay needs some serious R &amp; R!!!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Although a somewhat exciting read, this is far lacking the previous polished Kay Scarpetta novels. The characters have ended up depressed and miserable, it's time to start writing something uphill. There wasn't a hint of suspense, and I found myself reading more of a soap opera drama starring the key characters in goofy dire straits. The story didn't flow, and i found many instances of descriptions that contradicted what was just a few lines or a page previous. I feel this was sloppy writing by an otherwise excellent author. We dedicated Cornwell fans could go the extra few months for a book release if it meant a tidier, more believable story."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'm more of a fan of historical fiction like &quot;Ancient Evenings&quot; or &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot;, but I ALWAYS read Cornwell's books. After a couple of less than gripping works, &quot;Point of Origin&quot; and &quot;Southern Cross&quot; come to mind, it looks like she has hit her stride again. I thoroughly enjoyed the new one, the autopsy sequences are intensely vivid, and all of the old magic that made Cornwell a blockbuster best-selling author are here in &quot;Black Notice&quot;. Maybe she's looked behind her and saw a few newe novelists stealing her thunder and decided it was high time she got down to business again. Five Stars! A great effort."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I think that this book was just about the best Kay Scarpetta novel I have ever read. It was a quick read, and I couldn't seem to put it down! The research Patricia Cornwell does for her books amazes me, and she writes with an insight that only she could have. Thumbs up from me."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book reminds me of Cornwell's earlier works in this series which I liked very much. Her last 3 books however have left a bad taste in my mouth. I was delighted to see the end of the &quot;Carrie Gretham&quot; influence and had much hope for this new book. It was a good book, but I think Patricia Cornwell is sick of the series and wants to move on. Why do writer's get so angry at the characters who made them famous? It's almost as if they are jealous. Obviously it's time to say goodby to Kay Scarpetta."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"My7 boyfriend bought this book for me...I was NOT^ able to put it down. Really keeps you in suspenders...Whoever thinks that this book is not as good as Cornwells previous better reread this book. I have given to another person and she is just about done with it. She got it this morning...Patricia Cornwell has not let anyone down with her Dr. Kay Scarpella writings...She has gotten to be a more thorough writer, more indepth. She also shows that Scarpella has felings outside of the morgue and her office which I feel is an important subject. She shows that death even close to you can be unnerving but she also shows that you must continue with everyday life no matter how gruesome it can be...I HIGHLY recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Though this book is a birth of Benton's sadistic murder, and could not exist without that having taken place, Benton's absence creates an emptiness throughout the entire story. The underlying fact that he is no longer part of the series is ever present. I feel that his death was a deadly mistake on the part of Patricia Cornwell and the idea that after Benton, Kay could be involved with a shallow, much less sophisticated playboy is absurd and so out of character for Kay. I feel that the only redeeming circumstance would be to somehow bring Benton back with the invention of a plot that was formulated to stage Benton's death. Even the DNA can be wrong. Given the many other inconsistencies concerning age and other facts in all of the books, for a writer like Ms. Cornwell, it would certainly be possible. The series can never be the same without Benton. He and Kay were soul mates, each unique and independent yet, so perfect when they were together. Considering this turn of event, Ms. Cornwell may have lost one of her greatest fans."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've been waiting for who knows how long for this book to come out, and I read in in two days...I was so happy to get back into the lives of Kay, Lucy and Marino....I know this will probably never happen, but wouldn't it be nice if Marino's arguement that possibly Benton isn't dead and is just caught up in some secret government thing is true?..I followed the story line well, and was pleased to see Cornwell be realistic in Kay's greif over Benton, even while she's sleeping with Talley. By the way, for some reason I do not like Talley, and feel that if Benton's not coming back , Kay should get with Fielding. The only thing that upset me about this book is no Epilogue. I want to know what happened to Loup Garou, with Lucy and Jo and what happened with Taffey...We need another book quick, Cornwell!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The book was great and I love Kay and the rest of the group, but felt there were to many questions unanswered and why is Kay having a love affair with someone she just meet the day before!!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The story starts with a bang. The characters are intense and the story carries great emotion throughout. The only downfall of the novel is the ending. I felt drained at the end and was craving more detail. Too many loose ends that I wanted taken tied together. The book ends rather quickly. This book is right up there with &quot;Potters Field&quot; by far the best novel of Cromwell's."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Cornwell has written a page turner. However, while glued to my seat reading the book I could not help but get a sense that I had read so much of it before. Cornwell skims the surface of so many of the characters, she left me desperate for more information on them. The ending was almost predictable and left me desperate to learn more about the prime suspect. I love the Scarpetta series but I think that this book deserves the Black Notice more so than several of the victims in the story."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"i really enjoy patricia cornwell's books. i did get into black notice, but as it continued, i was depressed by the alcohol abuse so evident in these people's lives. marino drinks himself sick constantly and even on the job. no one can eat without 4 or 5 drinks and was quite disturbing. i didn't like the way it ended, but i was impressed, once again, with cornwell's thorough medical research."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is garbage, just like POINT OF ORIGIN. I really liked the first few Scarpettas, but the series has run out of ideas. Yet another conspiracy in the workplace. Yet more scenes chez Kay with Marino and Lucy acting out the same cycle of angst. Please just stop it! If you want crime writing in which the characters keep developing, try Lawrence Block. Or if you want fresh crime writing from the female perspective, go to Minette Walters."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I disagree with the reviewers who are rather harsh in their opinions about this novel. It has all of the key ingredients to make it an excellent example of the best of its genre. As usual, Cornwell's writing is superb--the suspense is gripping, the action flows throughout the book, her descriptions are vivid, and her characters are real and complex. Unlike some of the reviewers, I find her well-fleshed out characters to be one of the strongest aspects of her writing. I enjoy seeing the continuing story of Kay Scarpetta's world come to life, and I enjoy seeing her interact with the characters that we have come to know through Cornwell's previous Scarpetta novels. I say Bravo to Cornwell, and I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an excellently-written murder/crime mystery!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Devoted Cornwell fans will hate this, but I don't care much. Patricia Cornwell writes thrillers to a formula and Black Notice reads as though she is writing without thinking. You know, been there done this so many times you don't have to think any more. Her clinical descriptions of a coroner's work are meticulous and for me, the best part of the book. However generally, Cornwell's use of language is thoroughly pedestrian, the descriptions of Dr Kay Scarpetta's grief over her lost lover overwrought, clumsily written and they slow down the action. By the end of the book I couldn't have cared less who the murderer was. My first Patricia Cornwell read - and my last. Not worth an autopsy."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was SO looking forward to reading this latest Scarpetta, but what a letdown! The entire book seemed to be little more than the author pushing (via Kay's preachy dialogue) some kind of bizzare whining, pro-NRA, rah-rah America, quasi-Republican, Anti-beautiful woman/pro-lesbian adgenda. Some of which I agree with, some not -- but none of it is what I want to read for entertainment! The worst bit had to be when Kay tells her Latin American housekeeper &quot;But, Rosa -- the police here aren't like they are in your country&quot;. A close second was her assuring Lucy's latest squeeze that &quot;Love is never wrong&quot;. When, oh when, did Kay become such a trite, pontificating bore? I'm not sure if P.Cornwell has a new editor, or if she herself is going through a mid-life crisis, but I hope the old Scarpetta comes back in the next book. And for God's sake, enough with the firearms! Paragraphs that used to go into great detail about medical/forensic procedure are now describing everyone's handguns in practically erotic sensual prose. All in all, a kind of strange read."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was startled at some negative reviews of &quot;Black Notice&quot;. I &quot;read&quot; the audio version and found it superb, as I have several of her other works in the Scarpetta series. How I love Kay Scarpetta! A physician, lawyer, scientist and person of intellect - AND a &quot;real&quot; person with heart. To get into &quot;Black Notice&quot;, one needs some familiarity with the characters - Dr. Scarpetta's beloved niece, Lucy, the now deceased Benton, and the all-too-believable Marino (what a great character!). You MUST have the stomach for sometimes excruciating forensic detail (I can't help it - I find it fascinating), but start with two or three other books in the Kay Scarpetta series first to become familiar with the characters. Please keep writing, Patricia!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I just didn't buy the premise. The story was not interesting and I had figured out what was going to happen from the very beginning of the book. I was really disappointed that Black Notice did not live up to her earlier works."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'm having a hard time believing that Cornwell fans did not enjoy Black Notice! I totally loved it. What do you guys expect? These characters are very well developed including all of their problems. That's probably why we love them so much, because they're so screwed up! Ok, I'll admit that the professional relationships between Scarpetta and members of every government law enforcement agency (domestic and foreign) seems a little......ummmm......odd, but it's fun. This is fiction and a great read."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"&quot;Black Notice&quot; brings back Kay Scarpetta, who is oneof the best female protagonists ever created for the thriller genre.She is tough when she needs to be and, at other times, quite vulnerable. This book has a fascinating plot and it delves further into Scarpetta's feelings about her family. Cornwell sensitively handles Kay's anguish over the loss of Benton. &quot;Black Notice&quot; held my interest until the end. Kay's relationship with Marino is wonderful; they're like two squabbling siblings who know each other's faults very well, and fight constantly. However, they really love one another (platonically, of course). The dialogue is believable and the forensic details absolutely fascinating. The ending is a bit cliched, but it is not over the top. For Cornwell fans, this is a must."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Don't bother wasting your time with this book. Would have rated this a ZERO if possible and unless Patricia Cornwell dramatically improves this is certainly the last book I will be be purchasing written by this author."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"One of the worst books I have ever had the displeasure to read.The only reason I finished reading it was in the hopes it would somehow become exciting. Much too descriptive when not necessary and some of the worst dialogue in print.Does this author actually talk to people or merely imagine what conversations might be?"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read most of the Scarpetta novels. I think this is the last. The author has lost her focus and this book was simply boring. Nothing exciting happened and the end was a complete contrived bust. It will take a big sell to get me into another one."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell can spin a story that keeps you reading andhas built up a regular readership with her Kay Scarpetta series.However, the latest installment, Black Notice, depends on that fact -- only regular readers will know the background regarding Carrie Grethen, the death of Kay's lover Benton, and the tortuous family relationship Kay has with her sister and her lesbian niece, Lucy. That background brings a richness to the plot that isn't there for the first-time reader. The medical mystery is also disappointing. Solving it requires more luck and coincidence than sleuthing, and readers know that the bad guy is going to turn up on Kay's doorstep -- not because he has to, but because the bad guy always does! And once again, Kay's personal life is a shambles. You have to wonder, with so many people out to get her, maybe it's not them -- it's her! She brings a little cloud of misery with her everywhere she goes. Prozac, a nice vacation, and a real romance without all the angst is my prescription for Kay!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book was a disappointment after reading all the other books written by Ms. Cornwell. It was gloom and doom from start to finish. It was extremely depressing."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"As a native of Richmond I have always loved reading the tales of Dr. Scarpetta. This one was the best in terms of really getting into her character. I hope Patricia Cornwell can give us more on Lucy and Marino too. But the ending of this book was really disappointing. The Scarpetta we have come to know and love would never open that door and you know it. Don't give up at the end like that next time and I'll keep on reading."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell should consider renegotiating her book contract in order to space her work to match her muse.The early Scarpetta novels set a justified high standard that has deteriorated--particularly in &quot;Black Notice&quot;--to soap opera and continuing unresolved personality cul de sacs for her main characters.The Loup-Garou thread is intriguing, even unique, in its development and resolution--a small gem in recent mystery fiction. Unfortunately it is nearly submerged by the continual weeping, wailing and gnashing the characters inflict on the reader for the bulk of this dark book.Certainly the issues confronting Cornwell's protagonists are gloomy and serious. Unfortunately, the histrionics are unrelenting and any early empathy a reader might feel is soon turned to impatience and irritation from the continual breast-beating and the book's frequently grating tone.I have finished all of Cornwall's mysteries except for &quot;Southern Cross&quot; which I put down early because I thought it lacked direction and commitment. I had similar early feelings about &quot;Black Notice.&quot; However, despite the screeching, self-indulgent background noise in &quot;Black Notice,&quot; I stuck with it until the end just for the resolution of the Loup-Garou case.Sadly, the payback was too little compensation for enduring the soap opera in which the mystery is packaged. The book reminded me of the old line about &quot;cramming forty minutes of material into eight hours.&quot;"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of the Kay Scarpetta mysteries. She and the rest of the gang started off as creative, interesting characters. They have &quot;evolved&quot; into just the opposite. What first intrigued me were the clinical details AND the characters. The settings and details are still of interest, but the characters have turned into one-dimensional static charicatures (Marino as overweight blue collar rough cop, Lucy as angry brainiac, etc.) There is no passion or life left in any of them. Alas...I fear I must bid farewell to Kay and Ms. Cornwell."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"As I read through the other reviews I detect a definite split between what the readers want. Some long for Scarpetta to return to her old self, while others wish she would begin a new take on life.Cornwell has certainly demonstrated Scarpetta's evolution as a character throughout all ten books. Following this, she (Scarpetta) appears to have become much more embittered as her career goes on. I suppose some evidence of this, other than her tattered life, could be her increasing use of foul language.As for Talley, I was surprised at Scarpetta's affair with him, but wondered if her actions were an example of just how deeply Benton's death affected her? I can't see Scarpetta doing this sort of thing 4 books ago and we repeatedly witness the extreme impact his death had on her throughout the book.Regardless, I found the story a good, well-plotted, entertaining read. I'm especially interested in seeing how Cornwell (hopefully)pulls all this together in the next novel."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have really enjoyed the Scarpetta series, but with BLACK NOTICE, the author continues a downhill trend. Although it was very responsible of Cornwell to deal with Scarpetta's grief in this latest novel, she seems to overextend the extent of the heroine's feelings for Benton Wesley. In addition, it is not plausible that Lucy and Marino are as devastated by Wesley's death as they are. In previous novels, Lucy and Marino were never depicted to be that close to Wesley. The plot of BLACK NOTICE is interesting. The werewolf idea works, but it does lack development. The new love interest, Jay Talley, just does not strike me as someone who would attract someone as intelligent and mature as Scarpetta. After what she has been through, it would seem to take more than a pretty face to draw her to love. Finally, Cornwell continues a trend of rushed and neat endings. During the last few novels, it appears the author is in a race to the finish. I hope Ms. Cornwell takes the time to provide more believable and developed endings in future novels."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Black Notice hints at the talent that Patricia Cornwell once displayed so effortlessly. The loup garou and Bray story lines promised greatness;rivals to Kay's throne from two different angles. I was looking forward to how Kay was going to solve the crime and deal with the professional challenge. Unfortunately, Cornwell revealed a startling lack of depth, and opted for the easy outs. She fell back to her old obsessions with Lucy and Marino; each becoming an increasingly disagreeable caricature of her/himself. And where did this sudden passion for Benton come from? That relationship always lacked warmth and compassion, nevermind passion. His death was just another convenient ending for her last Scarpetta book. This might be a good time for Cornwell to consider collaborating with another author who is a strong closer. She's petering out at third base and is unable to bring it home."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell is a wonderful writer and I always enjoy her writing, but a novel about a nearly demonic villian with an unusual physical condition, troubled niece, issues with the tragic loss of a murdered lover, a scheming superior who tries to remove our heroine from her position - this is not new.Additionally, I begin to wonder about myself and my own outlook. Why am I so drawn to this dark, anti-female, world of doomed attachments? What does this mean about us?"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Having been majorly disappointed with Hornet's Nest, it was refreshing to find that Ms. Cornwall is at her peak with this installment of the Kay Scarpetta series. I started it the day I got it and couldn't put it down. It's dark and complex and wonderful!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Unfortunately for fans of the Kay Scarpetta novels, these stories have fallen into a cookbook kind of production. I felt I could predict everything that was going to happen,i.e. Dr. Scarpetta would complain about her horrible life, Marino would eat and drink too much, and Lucy would rebel in some way. Knocking off Benton in the last book was a good twist, I would just like to see a little more growth and unexpected turns for these familiar characters in subsequent novels."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Although this was a lot better than her last three books inplaces it was very over-the-top and in-your-face. A bit of subtly insome areas would be nice!! It also reads a lot like a re-hash of her earlier books. More details about the killer would have been interesting. Think I'll stick to Dick Francis, Lillian Jackson Braun and Mercedes Lackey from now on!!!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of Patricia's books and this one lives up to the others in the Scarpeta series...I love watching the personalities of Kay, Lucy and Marino emerge. In this book we get to see a side of Kay and Lucy that has yet to be seen...the not-so-in-control side. I loved it...Patricia can't write them quickly enough to suit me!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book was fabulous. Scarpetta was so human, not a super woman. I feel better now that Benton has been replaced, at least for a little while. I was totally crushed when Patricia got rid of him last year. I didn't think I would be able to continue reading her books. Marino was his obnoxious self - his character was even better than its been before. I enjoyed him. Talley was a wonderful, delicious addition!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of the Scarpetta books and always eagerly await the next one. I hope with Black Notice we are finished with the grieving, bickering and being bitchy. Black Notice was okay but I found myself skipping the parts where these characters were downright mean to each other. For me these characters are becoming unlikeable and out of control. The book was riveting when covering the crime material but the verbal abuse these people heaped on each other got real old, real fast. Yes these people have lives outside the crime labs but those lives have become the all consuming focus of the last couple of books. Cornwell needs to get Scarpetta and company back to solving crimes, and maybe lighten up their personalities a bit in the process."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"As a fan of Patricia Cornwel, Black Notice was a great disppointment.It was an ordeal to continue reading this book, hoping it would get better. The dialogue is disjointed and the plot momentum is non-existent. The character development relies on heavy knowledge of Cornwell's past books and her characters do not grow in any meaningful way,they actually de-volve instead of evolve. The author's previous Scarpetta book and her most recent are so absent mindedly written that I assume she has lost interest in this character and is ready to move on. The book ends abruptly and leaves the reader hanging and dissatisfied. The international flavor and romantic interest is forced and comes into the book as an after thought.Cornwell's best Scarpetta novels are the early ones and end with &quot;From Potters Field&quot;."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book was so-so. Actually, I am getting tired of the Kay Scarpetta character and especially of Marino (who is at his most unpleasant in this book). The stories in this series are all starting to sound the same."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was about half way through the book before I realized I had never read a book where each character was more unhappy than the previous one. Depressing and uneventful."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Finally Kay seems like a real person. However the whole Bray affair should either be in a separate book or better yet ignored. The book was very enjoyable until the last 1/3. There were too many coincindences and the ending was too abrupt. It is time for Cornwell to retire Scarpetta and try a different character."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"After a few pretty awful books, Black Notice shows once again that Cornwell can write riveting mysteries. However, there is little subtlty in her narrative: readers know right off the bat who the bad guys are in Scarpetta's life and that they will be involved in nefarious activities. In fact, these characters were more interesting than the murderer that Scarpetta pursues, but Cornwell doesn't take the time to provide sufficient background information to make them multi-dimensional. Still, I finished this book in less than 2 days because it was hard to walk away from it for too long."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I enjoy all the books that include Kay Scarpetta ..Black Notice was okay except for the ending which came in about the last 2 pages!! I would have liked to have seen a little more thought and supense in the ending to this one !! Hornets Nest and Southern Cross really left me hoping that Cornwell would bring back the Kay Scarpetta story line...Please keep her stories coming."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the first novel I read in this series. I had heard great things about the other novels. I've read my share of mysteries and psychological thrillers to know, when I'm reading an exiciting, can't put this book down, book. This book was anything, but exciting. It was slow, tedious and it kept putting me to sleep. I couldn't read more than four or five pages, before I had to put the book down, because my mind wasn't on it. If this book is so boring, it makes me wonder about the beggining of the series. It didn't bother me that she is a Medical Examiner. I'm used to watching a British mystery series on A&amp;E about a pathologist. I've watched an autopsy, so none of that stuff mattered. There was little plot and no character development."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I loved this one. Much better than the last 2 or 3 of the series (if I can use that word). At first I thought &quot;No, not a werewolf story. Give me a break!&quot; But, thank you for saving it. Even the new lover was a great idea. Someone at work said she wishes Marino and Scarpetta would get together, but NO, don't let that happen. They need each other's friendship. Besides, he's not on her level. Scarpetta just needs to find him a companion to mellow him out!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I had read some of the previews about this book and wasn't sure if it would live up to the rest of her books. I was not let down, not one little bit. It was a fast moving book. Really enjoyed it and as with other people &quot;I am a little disgusted with the niece&quot;. I thought you had to be smart to join the FBI. I guess you just have to whine a lot. Thanks"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book was a great Kay Scarpetta mystery! She gave us more then 1 mystery in this book! I think about 3! So all you picky readers who complain about the Kay Scarpetta character who cares! She may be dramatic in this book at times but hey you would be very sad if your spouse died too! And if your niece was in terrible danger(more about that in the book.) All in all this book was worth the money and time. I simpply loved it!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and I was glad to see Scarpetta back. Even though this novel was weaker than her earlier ones, it was a far cry better than Southern Cross or Hornet's nest. Scarpetta's character was a little too depressed and drug the story down a little. Overall, though, it was enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am rather dissapointed with the weak plot. I still think Cornwell's earlier books are much better. In Black Notice, I don't quite understand why Bray &amp; Anderson are brought in to conspire against Kay only to have Bray murdered later. Though they have messed up Kay's office, but the impact was not great. Also, Lucy's inclusion in this book is rather abrupt and out of place. Personally I still hope that Benton is alive some where living under a new identity. I think killing Benton was quite a waste. Ms Cornwell, if you are reading this review, I know you could do better. I will still be waiting for your new books and look forward to a much better plot.."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I enjoyed Black Notice quite a bit, but I thought the ending was a bit lame and hurried . The Lucy chracter is becoming annoying and the new love interst (Talley) seems to come into focus much too fast, particularly after we have read many many pages of how upset and torn Kay is over losing Benton. Marino is starting to wear a bit thin. Maybe it is time to 'end' these chraacters, hopefully nicely, in future books."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's &quot;Scarpetta&quot; books and loved them all, but this one was a bit off. The story kept my attention but Corwell has 2 main characters going way off track...Lucy &amp; Marino need to be toned down a bit (I'm liking them less and less). I found myself coming to the end of the book and wondering how Cornwell was going to finish it in so few pages. The flat, unimaginative ending was my answer. A few extra pages for a better ending would have helped a lot. For the next one, I hope Cornwell brings Lucy and Marino back in line and has Kay back to her old self."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"If Patricia Cornwell's work gets any darker her readers will have to take prozac before opening the cover of her books! Overall, I was riveted by the story in &quot;Black Notice&quot;. The disease suffered by the serial killer was really eerie. Kay's sleuthing skills were right on target. Marino was as grossly endearing as only he can be. I've even gotten comfortable with Lucy and her &quot;friends&quot;. However, there were two things that bothered me with the plotting: someone is out to discredit Kay(again) and the confrontation between Kay and the killer is played out at her house(again). These scenarios are getting old. I hope things lighten up alot for Kay in the next installment. I also hope that Ms. Cornwall finds other ways to rid Kay of lovers other than killing them off. Especially in such heinous ways! Her endings could use a little more finesse as well."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is totally juicy. Am only halfway through, and have to force myself to put it down so as to stave off the end. Kay gets way more human here. I was afraid to splurge on the hard cover, but have read every other Scarpetta 2 times, having only discovered Cornwell in March. Cornwell sounds irate in this one. Maybe because everyone hated her hornet's nest stuff. Maybe she's mad she has to go back to Kay. (The thing is she doesn't have to write Kay. If she wants to widen her horizons, by all means,but don't write BADLY.) So far more marino and less lucy, and thats good. BLACK NOTICE is extremely satisfying."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery. This is the first time I have read a novel written by this author, and it will not be the last."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Living in Australia, we're lucky because Black Notice was released here only a week ago, unlike in the US where it'll be release later! It took me 2 days to finish the book - reading it at work, at lunch and even in the bath!! Just one word to describe the book; its fantastic!!! A great read and denfinately a must for all crime fiction readers."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Being in Australia I have been very lucky to be able to buy the latest Scarpetta book Black Notice. I only bought it today and already I cannot put it down. I'm 1/4 way through it and it has lived up to all my expectations so far.I only discovered Patricia Cornwell book begining of December 1998 and by the end of January I had read all of them and them read Point of Origin on the plane going to England in February.The characters come so much to life that I have cryed when Lucy has been in trouble and then when Benton died and now at the being of this new adventure my heart goes out to Kay again.Thanks Patricia for such exciting books. I can not wait to finish this new novel but then I'm sad because I have to wait so long to read what is happening to Kay, Lucy and Pete."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"i really enjoyed this book, good plot, fast moving, if your a cornwell fan it's a must, I lent my copy to a friend, everytime i call she's reading a few pages, i couldn't put it down, so read it in three days, and i'm a busy lady, buy it you won't regret it ."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"First off, I have always enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series. One for the humanizing that she does to her characters. They are not perfect and have true emotions for what they have been through. The author is not afraid to let her characters change and grow or even fight change. Two the excellent writing and plot. Ms. Cornwell has earned all the awards for writing that she has gotten for this series. She has never let me down in the category. Three, I love the way the author moves from one book to the next. Yes, Ms. Cornwell is cruel and unusual in the way she will leave a reader hanging at the end of a book. Kind of like life too. Sometimes life doesn't have a complete \\"ending\\". Sometimes it will take another whole book to conclude the story. You have to admit that to pick up a 1200 plus page book to read would be defeating. And you would have to be a pretty strong person just to get it home, let alone hold it to read. It is also fun to wait a year to find out how the story ends. In Black Notice, Patricia Cornwell is in top form as a writer. I couldn't put the book down, so compelling was the story line and characters. And I want to thank Ms. Cornwell for killing Diane Bray, I've had a few bosses that I wished would go away too. I wanted to cheer, but thanks to the author's writing I was held back by the emotions that Kay was feeling. So, no this will NOT be my last Kay Scarpetta novel. I've already started The Last Precinct, and it is turning into a wonderful book too. And I'm sure that Ms. Cornwell will hold true to her readers and leave us hanging for another year about something. Keep them coming Ms. Cornwell!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Even more unbelievable than the last. How has the earth managed to continue life as we know it before Kay and Lucy? PLEEEZ! Lucy is way too smart and pretty and computer-whizzed, blah blah blah. Oh and by the way, a lesbian. What is that about? I swore I wouldn't read another one of her books. She should have quit after the third - first three were very good. But they just get so outlandish and silly. Inane. Who cares? No more Cornwall for me - I swear."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Why does she need that angry, sullen neice in every book? I'm so tired of the Lucy character and that's the only thing that keeps me from giving this book 5 stars. But the police work and the camaraderie between Scarpetta and Marino is wonderful to read. The Wolfman from France story was really scary to read over Halloween."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was very disappointed in this book because of its vulgar language!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Ok I was reading the reviews and I think alot of peeps are giving this book a bad review. The book has twists and turns but also has a startling sense of reality. It shows that not everyone deals with things the same way. and if you think about it Kay has got a lot to deal with .... How many men in her life has she lost now 4-5 and the romances take a lot out of her because when she loves she loves with all her heart unless shes scared... and everything thats happening in the end just leads to a greater plot in the next Book I cant wait to read The Last Precient"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have never been draged through this author's sordid mind before, and I don't plan on it happening again. Her characters are the most implausible group I have ever encountered. She lumps totally opposite people together and never gives us a single reason why we should believe these people would ever have anything to do with each other. She drags us up and down the narrow streets of her mind splattering us with gore and deceit, but never gives us a reason to feel for these troubled characters. It is seemingly an after thought that she finally creates the main villian in this story. He never actually materializes though, and of course it is next to impossible to believe that he even could exist. All that is bad enough, but suddenly and inexplicably the author tires of the entire charade and ends the story so abrubtly that it took me a few moments to accept the fact that it was finally over, and be grateful that it was. Don't waste your time !"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"For the past couple of novels, Cornwell has left me disappointed on how she ends her books, no buildup at all, just the killer popping up out of nowhere to try and kill our heroine, Kay Scarpetta. This book has been the worst yet. With 10 pages to go I'm wondering, where is this going??? I was very disappointed with Black Notice and hope that Cornwell becomes a little more creative on how to wrap up her stories."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patrica Cornwell has created such a wonderful character in Kay Scarpetta, but she seems to be running out of ideas. Kay's life is getting so depressing, it's getting progressively harder to read this series. They've now killed off two of her love interests in a row [both in law enforcement], which ranks her just below Sipowicz on NYPD Blue on the unbelievable string of tragedies scale.I still enjoyed this book, but Black Notice was an appropriate name. Because the character is a coroner, and there is so much death and tragedy, Cornwell needs to add at least some reason for these characters [Kay, and her equally depressed neice, Lucy] to want to go on living.The book was good enough to recommend to Cornwell fans, but I won't read her next book unless I am in a really upbeat, resilient mood, so I won't feel like jumping off a bridge when I'm done!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Scarpetta has become so highly strung that it must be only a matter of time when she falls apart totally. Although the writing generates empathy in me for Kay, I agree with the reviewer who suggests a sabbatical. What she has to endure in each book borders on inhuman AND inhumane.All this heroine ansgt makes the book somewhat heavy and morose. I did find the office politics an interesting diversion (and for me, real life) to the usual absorption in detailed autopsies or gruesome discoveries.All that aside, I enjoyed this book more than recent previuous ones. I am slowly coming to terms with the horrendous death on Benton - this book almost helps that catharsis.I still prefer Kay Scarpetta as a character to those introduced in 'Hornets nest'."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I love to read Patricia Cornwell books. Her writing is amazing. Everyone says that her book was really bad but l think that she was just trying to totally get rid of the last story line with Benton and stuff. It seemed that this book was focusing mostly on the charactors and not on the murder. I think she was trying to make this book as a bridge to another hopefully more interesting story line. That's probably why the murder was so rushed. Yes I really hope her writing will get back to its usual style - exciting, edge of your seat. I think you should read this book just so you can follow the characters personal lives. I really hope she is using this book to lead to a better more interesting story line. I say read the book :)"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"As an avide Scarpetta fan I was thrilled to find out Ms. Cornwell had written another. I truly enjoyed Point of Origin, and each that led up to it, and was eager to find out what was to come next for our characters. Unfortunately, this new one fell a little short on my Scarpetta meter! Just when you think we're going down a new road, with infinite possiblities, the road comes to a dead end. I will not be specific because I don't want to ruin the book for other Scarpetta fans. If you truely are, the book is still worth your time just don't get your hopes up that it will be like the earlier ones. I hope the next one, and please Ms. Cornwell write more, will leave us with more answers rather than questions like this one did. P.S. Lucy needs a serious attitude adjustment - perhaps therapy next time!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Well, another Scarpetta has come and gone, and I am left wondering, &quot;where can she go from here?&quot; Hopefully, not off into the sunset with Marino. I hate that Wesley is no longer there, and I, like many others, am also tired of the Lucy deal. She is so boxed in now that nothing she does is very original or interesting. But, don't stop with the Scarpetta novels. No matter what, they are still great. This one was...OK. Not the best, but still better than most out there. I would suggest that Ms. Cornwell drop the Lady Cop novels...just not good...or interesting.....characters or plot lines. On second thought, are all these stories starting to blend, until one looks too much like the other? Read it anyway, especially if you are a Scarpetta junkie, like so many of us."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"A new book starring Kay Scarpetta is guaranteed to cause me to pull out my checkbook immediately. Unfortunately, like many of the other reviewers, I found Black Notice a disappointment for a number of reasons. Wesley Benton was a moderating influence in previous stories, and I miss him greatly in the current book. Kay Scarpetta seems less organized, more bitter, and her angst colors the entire story. Lucy has become a distraction, rather than a contributor to the storyline, perhaps she should have been the one killed off! I would also agree with one of the other reviews that the ending of this book was hurried, poorly crafted and undeserving of the hundreds of pages of buildup."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I stopped reading the Kay Scarpetta series after the first three books, and after reading this, the worst so far, I remember why: because I don't like any of the main characters. Which is a shame, because the author is skilled, the plot lines are really good, and the forensic medical detail is fascinating. Unfortunately this latest effort quickly degenerates into a weepy, whiny pity party for Kay Scarpetta, with everyone explaining everyone else's inadquacies by forcing their own patronizing pop-psychology 'insights' down other's throats. Way too much of the book is taken up with this nonsense, and the dialog becomes totally unbelievable. A hasty last-minute grafting of an international plot twist late in the book does nothing to mitigate the soap-opera quality and irritating personalities of all the people in it.Lucy, who started in the Scarpetta series as a brat who needed a serious spanking, has developed into such an angry neurotic that it's beyond comprehension that she passed the FBI / ATF psych tests during the hiring process. Of course, Lucy is now a stereotyped lesbian as well. Lucy's subplot in this book is a clumsy and needless complication that serves only to fill a lot of boring pages and never goes anywhere beyond the requisite awful-parent issues.Marino has also degenerated from an annoying but harmless redneck to a truly wacko jerk. How someone so ignorant, narrow-minded, and incompetent could make it to the ranks of detective is also beyond comprehension. In Black Notice, Marino has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and Scarpetta herself keeps telling him to be quiet and go away. Obviously she doesn't think too highly of him either, so why does she waster her time with this clown? The promising subplot with Marino's new supervisor quickly goes from being his problem to yet another poor-Dr-Kay, being betrayed by her own people issue(yawn) - the sudden resolution of which is a total cop-out, excuse the pun.And then there's Scarpetta herself, who used to be interesting in the beginning of the series, but changed into a self-pitying, sanctimonious rich witch who is more concerned with her status toys (BMW, expensive house, antique furniture), and safeguarding her official power than with doing her job, except as a boost to her overinflated ego. This is not a character your average pay-check stretching, just-getting-by reader could identify with. And it took her far too long to figure out the 'long, soft baby hair'clue - she is supposed to be a hotshot medical examiner, after all. If she spent less time trying to get back at people out to ruin her, and more on working her actual cases, she'd get these insights sooner. Of course, in a story with so many tangled, unnecessary and ultimately unresolved subplots, it's hard to imagine anyone getting anything done at all.It's a shame that this book was such a dog. I have great respect for this author's writing ability, which kept me turning the pages even when I wanted to throw the book across the room. I just hope that her future efforts focus more on plot - her great skill - and ease up on the annoyance factor of her increasingly strident characters. Surely they have some redeeming qualities. It's far past time to let them shine through."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book was an overall good book. There were a few &quot;harsh&quot; moments. I don't think this outweighed the good of the book. The investigation of the murder was exciting and suspenseful. I do think that reading these books in order will better help with understanding the characters and their actions. I would definitely recommend reading the series of books, Point of Origin being the one written before this."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I WAS a big fan but I am not anymore. What happened to the ending? Did the publisher say you couldn't go over 470 pages? You could've left out the sex-that was totally unnessasary and you got alittle too technical on the medical-we're not reading a JAMA artical here. I wanted Loup-Garou to pick up Lucy's gun and end all their misery! I'm tried of the bickering, the overprotective aunt, the unwarrented sex, the omnipotent Dr Scarpetta. I hope in the &quot;Last Precinct&quot; it is the end and Kay either retires or gets killed. Patricia Cornwell needs to move on-she's pushed this character too far and me too."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"A write must learn to end a series if they cannot keep up with strong and original plots. As a former admirer of Ms Cornwell, I am very disappointed in this book. The plot is so bizarre that it is difficult to take it seriously. There are too many references to a previous story-line (Benton) that is tiresome for those of us who have not read the Scarpetta series in chronological order, assuming that it was a recap of a previous book. The characters' flaws are so exaggerated that one wonders how sophisticated Scarpetta can even put up with a klutz like Marino, and why? Too many weird scenarios to count! Don't bother with this unless you are a die-hard fan of Scarpetta!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is by far my favorite Scarpetta book. Cornwell does an excellant job of pulling the reader into what each of the main characters are feeling in the aftermath of the death of Benton Wesley. Opening with the letter was brilliant. I read this book in 3 days, I was on the edge of my seat and thought it was a really smart read.While other people have not favored the ending, I did like it, because it leaves the door wide open for a comeback."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I enjoyed the book but felt slightly let-down by the conclusion.As ever, the plot and chacterization was spot-on and the story unfurled with ease.Richly detailed, the novel crackled with energy throughout, so was such a shame that the ending wasn't stronger."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"There are a number of very glaring coincidences in this book and I think that this is the biggest problem with the book. For example, how could a case that Kay's Lucy is working for AFTA in Miami have anything to do with a homicidal maniac in Kay's town of Richmond? But in spite of this glaring inconsistency, I still enjoyed the book. We see Kay at her most vulnerable here and to those of us who have followed her story from the beginning, it is understandable. This book takes place a year after Kay's lover, Benton was killed in the line of duty, and in typical Kay fashion, she has really not dealt with her feelings about that. She has been burying herself in her work as usual. The killer that is stalking Kay's city forces her to deal with some &quot;unlaid-to-rest&quot; issues surrounding Benton's death. This is quite a dark book, but an edge-of-your-seat thriller that keeps the reader guessing until the end. We also see some real character development in some of the main characters; particularly Marino and Kay herself. It is so important that this series be read in order, and unless it is I don't think readers get the true scope of the series, and they certainly can't see the character development that occurs in each subsequent book."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I must say, this book captured my attention. I finished Black Notice only a few minutes ago and remembered Patricia Cornell's newer books were being slandered. I must say, I find each Scarpetta novel get better and better. Her old works are interesting, especially because Benton is still alive (personally, I thought no one would be able to replace Mark's character.) Though, as the storys progress, Kay's life begin to work in a downward spiral, and people can't stand seeing their heros in such a form.Though there is not much joy in Kay's life anymore, after Benton has died, Lucy is still fighting to become better then her Aunt, and others are trying to ruin her job, it gives the reader more of a 'real' sense. That Kay doesn't have the perfect life we all wish for, it gives us something to relate to.If you've never read a Scarpetta book, I suggest you pick one up, but as far as this one goes, its the best since the three books on Gaunt."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I cannot for the life of me see why people find so much fault in this book. Admitteddly, this is not the BEST of Cornwell's wrok, but that is not saying a lot. After all, only one book is. (For me, that book is \\"Point of Origin.)The only thing i can see fault with is Scarpetta letting the killer in so readily, but if you'll notice, Cornwell does sort of explain that in the previous chapters, so that offers some redemption from the act. Otherwise, this ook is excellent. it's exciting, very original, and has Scarpetta at it's core, the woman who has been changed by the horrible things which people have wished to do to her, and the things which they have done. Scarpetta has always been an insecure woman, and this time she is fully vulnerable. It is a vulnerability that will come to the fore in PC's next novel. But there is no denying the fact that going through such hell as Scarpetta has will change a person. those who critixise that change are not criticising the actual quality of the books, but just what their own opinion tells them. And when you review books by opinion, you risk a lot.Lucy has changed, naturally so. Disillusioned with the FBI, she has been pushed from pillar to post and targeted by the cruel Carrie grethen. Would this not change you? Would this not uncover in you a desperate desire for all the death to be over?The plot is great, and the further delving into Scarpetta's personality is also great. The simple fact is, some people like it and some dont.Some say she is flawles...that is not strictly true. Her flaw is that she is flawless, and thus us cut off form most other people, is not acessible to them, nor they to her.I enjoyed this book a great deal. The quality of the prose is as great as ever, and for those that like delving into Scarpett'a character, this book is a must."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Warning: This Review Contains SPOILERS of Earlier Scarpetta Novels.This &quot;chapter&quot; in the very interesting and complex life of Kay Scarpetta was one of my favorites.It's a different kind of Scarpetta novel.This one is more about the characters with the &quot;mystery&quot; taking very much the back seat.Lucy is back, and Marino, and they're all sharing in the pain regarding Benton's death.Of all the books, this one moves the characters themselves further than any other (as with &quot;The Body Farm&quot;).It's good to see that Kay is, indeed, capable of depression, that she is NOT a superwoman (no matter what SHE might think).I'd recommend this book to anyone - especially the fan who considers themselves part of Kay's extended family.I only wish Cornwell would publish more Scarepetta mysteries (I'm not thrilled with the &quot;Hornet's Nest&quot; bunch).Also, I think it'd be great if Lucy got her own book!These are all characters we've come to know and love - this book will further that.Regards to all, turtlex"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Black Notice is the second Cornwell novel I have read.

This book is no exception and as the story flowed I found myself involved from beginning to end and had difficulty putting the book down. From the recovery of an unknown body in a container ships cargo to the streets of Paris the story moves swiftly and when it appears that a murderous psychotic has travelled to Kay's home town the intensity picks up and in the final chapters it is impossible to stop reading. The beautiful and vicious new police chief whose main purpose in life seems to be to get Kay fired provides the hurdles that Kay must jump in order to keep her job and bring the murderer to heel.Kay's niece, Lucy, whose career and love life form a significant subplot keep us engrossed in her development and we wonder if she will survive in the male dominated machismo climate in the ATF.The book opens with a letter from Kay's dead former lover Benton Wesley. Kay's struggle to deal with it forms a thread running through the story providing a sense of reality often missing in other mystery writer's works. And the burning question of all true Kay Scarpetta fans &quot;Will Kay find a replacement for Benton Wesley?&quot; may be answered."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Although I've enjoyed each of the Patricia Cornwell novels I've read, I was disappointed at the ending of \\"Black Notice.\\" I really like the character of Kay Scarpetta and the forensic science in each of novels which include her character. But, as others have stated, the forensic science in \\"Black Notice\\" seemed not to belong to the plot of the book.\\"Black Notice\\" leaves one speculating about alot of unanswered questions and remaining mysteries. It leaves me to wonder if more is to come about the killers personna, the Chardonne family, and Agent Talley. To me, the story just ended in the way I expected, but I didn't exptect it to end once the killer was captured after trying to kill Dr. Scarpetta. I wanted to know more.This is the first book by Patricia Cornwell that has left me hanging. She is a very good author and I hope more of her books don't leave me feeling this way."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Having worked with pathologists and ME's in my life. I find them interesting people. I also like to read fiction starring their profession, regardless as to how far out from reality they may be. It's fiction, right?But this offering from Cornwell isn't her best work. The whole book felt like a rehash of old sections of previous work. Was it worth the read? I suppose. I read most of it on a plane when my expectations were pretty low when it came to entertainment so it was fine for me. But the murderer wasn't very compelling and the regualr characters from the series seemed warmed over and predictable.I like Cornwell's work, but this felt more mailed in than well-thought. Don't run out to get this one, but if you find it in the used paperback bin, it's worth picking up for a rainy day."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is an intriguing and well crafted Kay Scarpetta mystery, which begins promisingly enough with the discovery of an overly ripe, dead body. Found stashed in a locked and sealed freight container aboard a cargo ship from Belgium that has landed in Dr. Kay Scarpetta's jurisdiction of Richmond, Virginia, the male, mystery corpse is covered with loose hairs. This intriguing beginning sends Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Richmond, Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner, on a hunt for information that turns international in scope. She discovers that this is just one of a number of murders to contain those tell tale hairs.The murders, themselves, are graphic and the forensic details, as always, are fascinating, and Dr. Scarpetta's critical analysis of the pathology issues are well thought out and highly informative, as she sifts through the forensic evidence in order to profile the killer. Her assessment of the peculiar affliction of this serial killer is intriguing, providing scientific insight into creatures who were called werewolves, but who may have only been persons with a rare and unusual genetic condition, causing them to be especially hirsute, among other anomalies.Moreover, there are a number of subplots afoot. Dr. Scarpetta, who is recovering from the death of her lover, Wesley Benton, faces a number of problems closer to home. It seems that she has been the victim of identity theft, with her internet screen name being used to set up a phony chat room, and personally destructive emails being sent falsely under her screen name.To add fuel to the fire, a new Deputy Chief in the Richmond police Department, Diane Bray, and has managed to demote Dr. Scarpetta's long time friend, Homicide Detective Pete Marino. Having her own secret agenda, Bray has turned her sights onto Dr. Scarpetta, desiring to get jurisdiction over the Medical Examiner's Office. Perfidy also exist among Dr. Scarpetta's trusted staff, and her niece Lucy, who is still not operating with a full deck, is on a dangerous, undercover police mission with her lover in Miami, adding yet another worry to Dr. Scarpetta's already full plate.It is the camaraderie between Pete Marino and Dr. Kay Scarpetta, however, that holds this particular book together. Their repartee and dialogue is wonderful, giving evidence of their comfortable and close relationship, without saying so in so many words. They carp as if they were an old married couple. Lucy, Dr. Scarpetta's niece, however, is still a loose cannon, and it is unbelievable that any police agency would allow her to run around with a gun in her hand, given her record for shooting it off. Mercifully, this annoying character has a smaller role than usual in this novel, and the reader may only hope that she will either be written out altogether or get an attitude adjustment.The ending of the book, however, is a little too pat. Dr. Scarpetta's actions in the book's grand finale are not really believable for such an astute and normally cautious woman. Given what she already knows about the killer, her actions in the end bespeak more of the actions of an unknowing civilian. Still, this book does not fail to entertain and is sure to provide reading pleasure for many Kay Scarpetta devotees."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"You never realize how truly disappointing a book can be until you realize that there are approximatley fifty pages left and countless plot lines flapping in the breeze. Cornwell is a master storyteller. Unfortunately, Black Notice if incredibly similar to many of Dean Koontz's books in that the author tells a great story but has no clue how to tie everythign together and end the book. Like Koontz, Cornwell chooses to simply end without tying up many of the plot lines.My advice, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am a huge Kay Scarpetta fan, but this book was in desperate need of an editor. There were several places where I had to flip back and reread, only to find that I was right the first time -- the book referred to facts that hadn't been proven or even discussed, things that hadn't happened, etc.The sad thing is, you have to read this book if you want her subsequent stuff to make any sense.

Dr. Kay will always be my favorite Cornwell character and when Kay is at her worst, Cornwell's writing seems to be at it's introspective best."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have loved and identified with Kay Scarpetta since her debut in Postmortem. This latest installment in this character's life does not really do her justice.The book finds Scarpetta coping with the death of her lover as only she can: by throwing herself into her work. However, her act of grieving is so predictable, it takes away from the story. Her sojourn to England to help with similar murders is just odd, as are the requests made of her. While I am familiar with her ability to solve murders by going above and beyond the call of duty, I had some problems with her thought processes. I really struggled with how she got from point A to point B and drew a logical conclusion (i.e. diatoms in the water, murder weapon). The long-suffering Marino and his unrequited love/lust provided more of the expected. Even the introduction of Diane Bray served more as an annoying distraction than the presence of a true Scarpetta adversary.The only truly interesting event in the book is the climactic self-destruction of Scarpetta's niece Lucy. Lucy has been the most complex character and I enjoy seeing facets of her revealed in each Kay Scarpetta tale. Fans would enjoy this book, but Patricia Cornwell fell a bit short in this one."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"You know...I really love the story lines in all the Kay Scarpetta books. I think the suspense is great, the cases themselves exceptionally interesting in their &quot;twisted-ness&quot;. Black Notice was no exception. That is why I continue to read Patricia Cornwell's books. But, and this is a big BUT, I'm am so tired of everyone always being in a bad mood. I can handle Pete Marino's character and his temperament. He's almost funny. Kay, however, is an unbelievable drag. It's bad enough that we have to put up with her SUPERIORITY over everyone (not just men)...constantly feeling the need to prove her level of authority, as if everyone need bow down to her because she is the CHEIF Medical Examiner (who cares?)...but she is also the most negative recurring character I've ever encountered. She never has anything pleasant to say, is always in a bad mood, never has a good day, and is just a big nagging crab in general. Her niece Lucy is just as hard to take. The only gentle and pleasant character (Wesley Benton) is now dead...which I think is very unfortunate for the series.Don't get me wrong...I am a fan of Patricia Cornwell's books. I just wish the large chip on Kay's shoulder would go away. It would really help the tone of this series."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Don't follow Kay Scarpetta to Paris! You might think a change of scene would do this poor, wrung-out character some good, but it simply places her in contrived relationships and silly situations. Most embarrassing: the Ile-St.-Louis is a tiny, densely populated island in the heart of Paris, a favorite nighttime strolling spot for tourists and locals at all times of year. Many times each evening the lights of tourist cruises on the River Seine rake the isle. Does author Cornwell expect us to believe that a monstrously disfigured character regularly skinny dips off the island without attracting gendarmes, groupies or paparazzi? Cornwell long ago exhausted the emotional potential of her once-compelling heroine, Kay Scarpetta. No doubt it's difficult to let go of a character who has repeatedly taken the author to the top of the best-seller list. But so much death, emotional abuse and physical torture has been inflicted upon medical examiner Scarpetta and everyone she cares about that Cornwell's narratives have become as numb as her heroine. In the early Kay Scarpetta novels, Cornwell gave us needed relief from Scarpetta's hours at the morgue by describing her passion for her home and her garden, her sumptuous Italian cooking, her enjoyment of good food, good liquor, good clothing, good friends, good students. In the recent Scarpetta novels the relentless confrontations with not-believable evil have degenerated into monotony."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"75% of the way through this book and I don't even care if I finish it. I keep giving the series one more chance but I fear this will be the last one I try to slog through. With each book the tone has become more and more one of dysfunctional Kay and her dysfunctional family/friends. Not one single character outside of Kay's secretary, Rose, has any redeeming qualities or character qualities that make me give a darn whether they survive or even exist. Lucy's the worst, but even Kay and Mariono are repulsive in this book. Given the progression history of the story line, I hate to imagine how down and depressive the final story of the series will be. Kay will be a bitter old woman, Lucy will have killed herself and Marino will have died from clogged arteries or lung cancer. Ugh! I can read the daily newspapers for this kind of &quot;literature.&quot;"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've loved most of the Kay Scarpetta series, but this is a poor offering. It reads as though someone had forced Cornwell to write this while in an extremely bad mood. Ever since Cornwell became disillusioned with the FBI, neither Scarpetta nor Lucy has had the same fire. (And Benton, of course, had to be killed off.)The tone of the book is gloomy and bitter. There is none of the thrill or dark humor of previous books, and even the autopsy scenes are dull and distracted. The book reads as though the intriguing and slightly surreal first half was written by Cornwell, then a pedestrian ending was slapped on as an afterthought by another less talented writer.The plot revolves around a serial killer with odd physical characteristics, and his deformity is an ugly and unnecessary complication; it has nothing to do with his motives or with solving the crime. Come to think of it, nothing in the book really works toward solving the crime -- the murderer literally shows up at Scarpetta's front door. (If you think I've spoiled the ending, don't worry -- you'll see this coming for several chapters). The most interesting new character, a semi-villainous police chief who would have made an interesting foil for Scarpetta, is gone by the end of the book.The Scarpetta character is more than usually self-involved and MarthaStewart-ish, detailing hotel decor and pasta recipes while plot holes go unaddressed. Marino is more oafish than ever, and Lucy comes across as a spoiled, selfish brat. Even the doctor's colleagues seem weary of her.I've always liked that Scarpetta was an imperfect heroine -- selfish, a bit patronizing, and slavishly class-conscious. In this case, however, her faults and her maladjusted grieving for Benton don't make her more human. They make her a real pain in the neck. I hope that by the next book Cornwell gives Scarpetta her life back."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the tenth Kay Scarpetta novel, and it might be time for Cornwell to move in a new direction. The early books were made compelling by the science of the medical examiner, solving crimes based on clues found on the bodies - trace fibers and hairs and intriguing wounds. However, the series has devolved into a Kay Scarpetta pity-party. This seems like about the fourth or fifth book in a row where Kay's deep and traumatic emotional life pretty much drives the story. The monstrous villain with the one-in-a-billion medical disorder is not new, nor are the attacks on Kay's house and office. But her constant whining about her emotional distress, the erosion of the Lucy character to nothing but a gun-and-an-attitude, and the cut-and-paste story line make for pretty tedious reading. Worst of all, the autopsy scenes around which the early stories pivoted have now become mere sidelines, tasks that Kay must perform between her breathless rasslin' matches with the bad guy and her teary memories of Benton. The Scarpetta series is stale, Cornwell needs to move on to a new theme. I've read my final Kay Scarpetta story."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The main story line doesn't even start until halfway through the book. There are some half-hearted attempts to tie everything together, but they don't really work.And what's with the niece and her relationship? Its as though Cornwall feels she has some obligation to include a dysfunctional lesbian relationship. WHY?? Its not as though the book's about homosexuality, and its not as though there is an integral character who just happens to be a lesbian. Its pointless. And Lucy is SO unsympathetic.I guess the worse part is that its not really a mystery. There are no clues that would allow the reader to figure anything out. Everything is resolved abruptly. Scarpetta doesn't figure anything out."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"It's not bad enough that forensic pathologist Scarpetta is in mourning over the death of her FBI agent boyfriend--just about everybody is paying some tough dues in this one. Her brilliant but troubled niece Lucy (also an FBI agent) was the one who blew away the guy's killer. Which puts her on a Charles Bronson trip where her partner gets shot. Scarpetta's irascible Sipowicz-clone detective friend Marino has gotten on the wrong side of his new deputy chief (an arrogant beauty with the soul of &quot;Homicide's&quot; Colonel Barnfather) and gotten himself &quot;flopped back in the bag&quot; (police parlance for punitive return to uniformed duty). And if that's not bad enough, Scarpetta's latest homicide case has been found in a container-ship module wearing the epitaph &quot;bye-bye werewolf&quot; in French. Earlier books in the Scarpetta series hint at a somewhat dysfunctional off-the-job life, but I've always seen her as successfully rising above them. In this book, several problems seem to be coming to a head at once, leaving Scarpetta to expend nearly as much effort combatting that side of her life as she spends on her cases. It strikes me that Cornwell is trying to do a Scott Turow noir/ psych number here, and I see this as a none-too-welcome departure from a formula that's worked for her and her heroine in the past."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I devoured the first Scarpetta books, but ever since Cause of Death, reading her books is continually disappointing. I mean come on a killer with excessive body hair, a warewolf? This is more like an X-File episode, and don't misunderstand me I love the X-Files. However, Scarpetta and Marino aren't Scully and Mulder! Also, like other reviewers have written I am little sick of the Lucy storyline.Quite honestly I think the best of Scarpetta is in the past. I am now on a new series by Dennis Lehane and it is absolutely fantastic! Try him instead."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"&quot;All That Remains&quot; and &quot;The Body Farm&quot; were classic contemporary mysteries, but Ms. Cornwell's best days are plainly behind her. In &quot;Black Notice,&quot; an absurd X-Files werewolf-chase, we learn that the wonderful Scarpetta is not only an adulteress but now a bimbo who sleeps with men half her age the same day she meets them. The insufferable spoiled-brat Lucy continues her insufferability, while the best character in the series, the once acutely-drawn Pete Marino, is humiliatingly reduced to a one-dimensional buffoon. I gave up on this one about 70 pages before the end. It is disgusting. Ms. Cornwell's incessant promotion of homosexuality and adultery is growing profoundly tedious, and the thrilling page-turner, can't-put-it-down quality of the earlier novels is completely missing. Perhaps Ms. Cornwell would be better off writing &quot;true crime&quot; books. My mother passed away a year ago. She loved Patricia Cornwell's writing, and while I mourn Mom's passing, I'm glad she's not here to have to suffer through this rambling, artless trash. This is certainly the last time I will pick up a Cornwell novel. John Sandford is now undisputably alone as the best writer in the genre."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"All the characters in this novel are continuously, gratuitously belligerent. It's one big block of road rage. Kay swears at Marino; Kay yells at her niece; Kay's niece yells back; Marino calls everyone crude names. None of the characters shows any humor, tenderness, or capacity for interesting observation. So the book weighs like an old Soviet housing project.Although Kay Scarpetta has a tastefully appointed home, her mental terrain is a mean, drab monolith. Even when she pauses in her pursuit of the sadistic killer and indulges in what could have been a little romance in Paris, she stays on the same pitch of pugnacity. Cornwell, obviously projecting herself into her Scarpetta alter-ego, has her lover gush unlikely adorations at her - between bouts of contention, of course. Her lover tells her that she is so beautiful, he can't take his eyes off of her. In response, Scarpetta hurls more invective at him, of course. And on it goes.There are a couple of passages of interesting autopsy detail here, but these CSI-like sections are becoming fewer and farther between as the Scarpetta series progresses. It was the wealth of scientific, anatomical knowledge that drew me to the series in the first place. As these sorts of chapters get drowned in the sheer dreary uniformity of character complaint though, there seems less and less reason to pick up one of these books.I had in fact decided to swear off Cornwell after the last few duds in the series. However I found myself in a small town Texas truck stop with nothing to read. All they had in the way of paperbacks was a rack of Louis L'Amours - and then, incongruously, this Cornwell novel on a shelf. Since I'm not particularly a fan of the Old West genre, I thought I'd give Cornwell one more chance. But I'm advising you, if faced with the same limited choice - even if you really don't like westerns - stick with Louis L'Amour."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I really love all Kay Scarpetta novels, and I was really excited to get to read Black Notice. I liked the plot, it' s worth reading it. The only thing I didn't like is Scarpetta being involved with a much younger man. It just ain't 'Scarpetta like'. And it seemed as though the idea was taken from two others of Cornwell's novels I also read, Horning's Nest and Southern Cross. Still, I really recommend it. and I'm already looking foward to the next one."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I thought I would see why Cornwell's books are always on the bestseller list, and after reading &quot;Black Notice&quot; I'm still wondering. There is way too much dialogue that added nothing to the plot. I also expected to find more action. Maybe I just need to read more of her books so that the familiarity of the characters becomes the important reason to read."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"As a faithful Cornwell reader, I cannot help but be discouraged by this most recent literary nosedive. The book is poorly executed, characters not fully developed, and the story line lacks Cornwell's usual spine-tingling twists and turns -- and ultimately a satisfactory conclusion. Can this reader be saved? Yes...if Cornwell's upcoming book is worth my time...but guaranteed I'll wait for paperback."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"In general, I enjoyed this book. I think its story line was much better than the last couple Scarpetta stories, though I, like many others, am sick of the Lucy storyline.

The story was great and kept me reading without stopping till the end. I have to reveiw my opinion I thought Patricia Cornwell was losing her touch, but I was wrong, no matter what other readers say, she is still capable of keeping you on a thread till it's over. I'll be waiting for her next book with patience."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"While better than the last couple of Scarpetta novels, Black Notice does not get near the excitement and interest of the first couple of novels in the series. This character has gotten so strained, shrewish and neurotic that it is hard to identify with her feelings. I'm finding myself rooting for the bad guys - wishing both the good doctor and her selfish, obnoxious niece would get bumped off so Cornwell could get on to something more interesing.Also, while we understand that there are personal reasons why the FBI doesn't play a prominant place in her books anymore, am I the only one who feels that ATF is a step down?"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I just finished reading the book and found that there were too many ends left unfinished.

I have read all of her books and this is not the best one."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have always been a Cornwell/Scarpetta fan, but this book fell short of the others. The plot takes a long time to develop and the main characters seemed to be falling apart. Lucy's character is completely out of control; maybe it's time to get rid of her. Dr. Scarpetta always makes excuses for Lucy's behavior, when in actuallity, she is basically a spoiled brat. Pete Marino seems on the brink of a nervous breakdown throughout the story, while he usually is a pretty strong character. The worst part about the story was that Kay was mooning over the death of her beloved Benton,(who by the way was one of my favorites, and one of the most well developed characters and never should have been killed off) and then Kay ends up jumping into bed with some kid she meets at Interpol. The book was alright overall, but I would NOT recommend it to one of my friends. Hopefully, the next Kay Scarpetta novel will be much better."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Black Notice was another great story about Dr. Kaye Scarperta.

I think, as Patricia Cornwell is so superb a yarn-spinner, that we are holding her to a higher level than other authors. It would be hard to top herself, but the books are still fantastic.

I'm glad I disregarded the reviews...but I had to as I pre-ordered it!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Having read all of her books I must write to say how disapointed I was in her latest offering. The subplots are poor, the perp not believeable, and the ending awful. However, her writing about forensic medicine and the world of law enforcement is as good as ever but I think I have read it before. Maybe she has run out of fresh ideas and should take a break instead of tossing her readers a lean meatless bone."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'm a first time reader of Ms. Cornwell and this novel was very disapointing. The plot was fairly plausable, but there is were all reality stopped. Moreno appears in this book to be a stupid, blundering ass who's affiliation with anyone over an 80 IQ is totally unblieveable. I can't believe Kay's relationship with this dunderhead would last over five minutes in real life. Both her and Moreno's character wouldn't last over a day if their inputs to their supervisors were what went down in this novel. Example; Moreno's presence at a crime scene while on suspension. The police wouldn't let him anywhere near it.Since this is the first novel I've read by this author, I'm going to try one more to see if this one was just a fluke. Hope so, because the writing in this one is amateurish, with dumb dialog from every charater except the French doctor and the ATF Interpol liason agent.Well...we'll see."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I had to put this book on hold at our library and the waiting list for 68 people ahead of me and the loan period was only two weeks. Once I got it, I didn't stop reading and it took me 10 hours to read this book. My mum, who usual takes about three to four weeks to read a book, finished this one within a week and had it back at the library before the end of the two week period. Once again, Patricia Cornwell keeps you in suspense until the last page and then leaves you wanting more. Is Benton &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, wait and found out? At times you have to feel sorry for Marino, for all his hard nose attitude, he is a pussycat underneath that tough exterior. Lucy is once again doing her usual I don't give damn routine, but you have to love her. Kay has once again had us all behind her, waiting for her next move. There was one part of the book, that had my so confused, that I had to read it twice just to get the gist of it, but I did. She makes you want to the read end first and work you way back, but DON'T DO THIS. Keep up the good work Patricia Cornwell. When is next Dr Scarpetta adventure coming out, don't keep us all in suspense?"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The underlying feeling when reading this book was pull yourself to together and stick to a story, not the harping on Scarpetta's innermost feelings. Most of all I wish she would drop the character of her niece. Lucy is an unlikeable, petulant nothing. I have no interest in her at all and her constant moodiness. Cut away from her and the story line is okay. Winds up too fast and I ended the book feeling like the author suddenly tired of the whole thing - as did I.Think Cornwell is churning them out too fast and not lavishing the attention on the plot as she used to. I would advise others to skip this one."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read many of the reviews and I am confused by the negative words towards PC and her characters. I was expecting to be disappointed because of all the reader reviews. Instead, I found my same old favorite characters along with a wonderful new, possible love interest and an intense and original mystery on my hands. THIS BOOK IS AS WONDERFUL AS ALL THE OTHERS! KAY, MARINO AND LUCY ARE ALIVE!!!!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I picked up this latest addition to my Cornwell collection and found myself once again reading about Kay Scarpetta. Over the years she has become like a friend. I was anxious to see how she was faring after the death of her love, Benton. Cornwell did not disappoint me. I found her there; emotionally wrecked and in the midst of another murder mystery. Once again the work is not for the weak of stomach. But I find the amount of research that Cornwell put into this novel daunting. She took me through the confusion and fear of Scarpetta and the grief that she is still feeling. And at the end left me hanging; waiting for the next chapter in the life of Scarpetta, Marino, and Lucy. In a word; awesome!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Interesting to read such mixed reviews. People either loved it or hated it. I am somewhat in the middle. I have waited anxiously every year for Cornwell's latest book since reading her first Scarpetta novel, and I have to admit, that while this one was probably my least favourite, I wasn't entirely disappointed. The mystery itself wasn't quite as interesting to me as her earlier works, but, in my opinion, it certainly wasn't as bad as some of the reviews stated. After all, we all have different tastes and criteria for really enjoying a novel. My one recommendation to new Cornwell readers though is to read the earlier Scarpetta novels first, because I am not all that sure that this works well as a stand-alone story. There's background explained in the novel, but it isn't enough to really understand the characters and if you haven't &quot;gone through&quot; all that history with Kay Scarpetta in her earlier mysteries, you may not find yourself being too empathetic or even liking her very much."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and have truely enjoyed them...until this one. Kay Scarpetta spends fully two-thirds of the book in some kind of depression, absorbed with &quot;personal&quot; problems, and in a generally weakly written personal battle with another strong female character. This novel does neither woman any favors (nor does it do any favors to Patricia Cornwell). I would, frankly, guess that, unfortunately, production speed and &quot;reaping the rewards&quot; outweighed a substantial, well thought-out story."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have been an avid romance novel reader for many years, but have been introduced to Patricia Cornwells books and loved them. I have read all (10)of her Scarpetta books in about 2 1/2 weeks. Can't wait for her next book."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"After enduring all of the author's previous Scarpetta series, I wasn't exactly expecting a diversion from her generally presented style. All of the usual cast show up, together with the requisite overbearing emotional baggage that each simply has to bear novel upon novel. Scarpetta is at her most emotional and cynical this trip around and should be either institutionalised or sent on a really long vacation. Marino continues to morph slowly but surely into Fred Flinstone at every turn, and Lucy, well - another book, another girlfriend, another job crisis.Having said all that, it's clearly not Colin Dexter, but then again, I don't think the author ever intended it to be. The strength of the book is pace, one which should keep you reading (regardless of what you may think of the plot), the author's comprehensive technical knowledge and, remarkably, the price. All in all, not that bad a value for the money."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The critics are out in full ready to cut both Scarpetta and Cornwell to pieces-probably envy at her unparralelled success and talent! Despite a continuous series Cornwell has managed to keep her storylines riveting and her characters developing. A wounded Kay is faced with enemies from within (Benton's death) and without (the vicious Diana Bray). Like a wounded tigress though she fights back, and shows she still has what it takes. Lucy is finally exposed as the unstable and willful child she is. Marino is brought up as the voice of the people. Yes the encounter with Jay Talley was unfortunate but he was on hand to display the anger so many readers have felt. Wonderful working of readers emotions-only the truly ignorant would fail to see!The critics can spew bile-but the sales figures and the real fans show that like mature wine she just gets better and is far classier than Grisham or poor immitator Reichs! Give us more please!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Okay, Scarpetta, get over yourself. Sure, your life is tough, but whose isn't? At least you're not as cranky as you were in your last go-around. And tell me, when did you stop being a simple medical examiner and start saving the world from every lunatic out there? You might want to speak to your supervisors, 'cause they're putting a helluva lot on your shoulders. And do me a favor, will you? Slap Lucy for me. I know it must be hard to be so smart and find out your ex-lover is a pyschopath, but gimme a break. And if being gay in the '90s were as tough as she makes it out to be, I and a whole lot of other people would've slit their wrists long ago. Doesn't anyone in your family find joy in anything? Maybe this new young stud of yours can knock some sense into you. I hope so, 'cause your adventures are becoming just a little too depressing for words."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Not up to her early novels, I found it very hard to get into.Her key characters have too many distracting problems that stray from the story line. Glad got the book from the local library, not worth the price."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I thought this book was excellent and one of her best yet! The usual foul language of the Scarpetta series was cut to a more reasonable level. I hope she does more on this series. It's like the old show Quincy with lots of suspense. Ended great too."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Black Notice was very hard to get into from the start but it began to turn around a little. I don't think that this novel was nearly as good as some of her previous ones. For instance The Body Farm I read in an afternoon - that kept my interest but this one took me almost a month to really start. I was so excited when I found out that there was a new Scarpetta novel but almost a little disappointed after reading it."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Scarpetta was a truly fascinating character in the first book, but in &quot;Black Notice&quot;, I believe she has become a self-absorbed excuse for a medical examiner-detective. And poor Marino! We knew he had problems and he was a sloppy dresser, etc., but Ms. Cornwell has completely stripped him of any likable traits. Lucy is a niece from Hell. And the storyline - unbelievable! If you don't know what to do with a character, kill her off! Please, Patricia, fire Scarpetta and end it!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I urge Cornwell to take a break from writing and come back to us w/ a new, fresh story line. Unfortunately, this novel continues the downhill slide of Cornwell's characters. Convince us Cornwell that you still have a story to tell."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Really enjoyed this one after having read all the other Scarpetta books. Storyline was good, it was nice to have less emphasis placed on Lucy and her issues, but . . . there were a few false notes. I was completely taken aback by Scarpetta's unprecedented leap into bed with a near stranger. I also think that if I lived in a gated community where killers routinely wind up in my home, I'd move. Finally, Cornwell copped out when, after introducing a clear antagonist in Diane Bray, she kills the character off. This storyline could have been extended to increase tension and create a better backdrop for Scarpetta to actually stay at home for her next book."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"For some reason, I stopped reading Cornwell novels several years ago. After &quot;Black Notice,&quot; I want to go back and catch up on the ones I have missed, and even the ones I have read before! Yes, it is that good.Kay Scarpetta grows and develops as Cornwell moves forward in her series about the Doctor-Lawyer-Chief Medical Officer. Based in Richmond, VA, Scarpetta lives in a niche port -- one that is not international and rarely has its cargo opened and checked. However, the stench of death and decay in an off-loaded container drags Kay to murder most vicious.Covering the corpse is the residue of downy fine human hair; it was in his clothes and clung to the body as it traveled across the Atlantic Ocean. Scratched on one of the boxes is a clue about a werewolf. The first issue is to find the identity of John Doe, and since the ship was foreign and the clue written in French, this leads to Interpol.Interpol requests Scarpetta and her detective partner Pete Marino to fly to France. It is significant that their flight is on the Concord, and that they stay in one of the most expensive hotels in Paris.Cornwell is masterful in her use of words. The character?s dialogues fit their education; I once had a teacher who called words not in every day usage &quot;ten dollar college words.&quot; That Kay Scarpetta is both an attorney and a doctor makes her extensive vocabulary help a reader suspend disbelief.Cornwell?s writing is rich with details and descriptions, and I wish I could read this book for the first time. The story is complete, and it is not until I started &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; that I realized it needed a sequel.This is an excellent suspense thriller with a great mystery. I savor words and phrases, so I do not read as fast as though who get the gist and go on; I could not put it down and I anxiously await the next installment. This is five star read.Victoria Tarrani"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is thoroughly researched and minutely detailed. The characters spend all their time getting mad.The mechanics of Cornwell's writing is generally good, and she even gets off a couple memorable lines (\\"toxic waste in tight clothes\\"). However, some of the writing is stilted. Marino, the angry buffoon, never steps off the page for me; this may be because I've read none of Cornwell's other books. The scene where the young lady pulls up to the store and shouts the murder victim's name (to contrast with Bray's coldness) comes straight from Frosh Comp: Pathos.I've never read a book so full of angry people, and I am including \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" in this appraisal. Cornwell must be an extremely unhappy person, who writes to deal with her rage."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I typically enjoy Cornwell's Dr. Kay Scarpetta character, but for some reason this book was a far cry from the usual enjoyable read. Perhaps it was the complete nonsense masquerading as a story, or the unbelievably boring details that constituted the alleged plot. Whatever the reason, upon finally finishing this painful waste of time, I literally tossed the book into the garbage. I not only wish I had my $5+ back, but also the 5+ hours of my life, wasted on this joke of a book. Don't buy it."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Loyal Patricia Cornwell readers will perhaps be somewhat disappointed in Black Notice, the 10th release in the Kay Scarpetta series, but will nevertheless purchase a copy and savor each page as if reading the last words of a great world leader. In other words, Cornwell is such a superior writer it is doubtful she could produce a bad read and, indeed, she hasn't yet.Scarpetta is a bit more fragile here than we've seen her in the past, dealing with the death of her lover, Benton Wesley, a year after the fact. It seems she has lost touch with what is going on around her, and must now begin to regain control of her surroundings and her life. Faced with problems within her office, political powers that seek to end her career, and, of course, a killer on the loose, she is forced to come to terms with the past and move forward. This includes reliving much of her relationship with Benton, accepting that he is not still alive and living out some elaborate plan concocted by the FBI for whatever reason, and finding passion in the arms of a living male counterpart abroad.Enter disappointment. The patience of Cornwell's lesbian followers are wearing thin with Benton Wesley. While Cornwell obviously agrees it is time to either put him to rest or bring him back to life, this should have been done some time ago, freeing Black Notice to be the book it could have been. In recovery, Scarpetta engages in sexual activity with a virtual stranger, which seems forced and out of character for our favorite heroine. Maybe we're just jealous, but Talley's introduction seems sudden and intrusive.Lucy, Scarpetta's openly lesbian niece, plays only a small role in the novel, which adds to further disappointment. Surely lesbian readers would have to admit they secretly hope Lucy will be the main focus, or at least a larger one, in upcoming Scarpetta tales. In this book Lucy is still dealing with the monsters that drive her to emotionally dangerous places, while readers wait to see the monsters for what they are, and how she might prevail and overcome her self destructive tendencies. Maybe in the next book.Marino is strong in this installment, as Cornwell brings his unique personality to the forefront and lets the friendship he shares with Scarpetta express itself with humor and an obvious deep caring for one another. Readers have watched Marino's life change over the years, and now he must deal with aging and his shifting importance in the world of law enforcement.The plot of Black Notice lacks the believability of earlier Cornwell novels. Gone are the strong, realistic killers of the early days, having been replaced with dramatic, almost super human qualities. Cornwell seems to be steering clear of the more forensically technical aspects of Scarpetta's work, and does not share as many interesting, if somewhat gory, details that once provided readers with clues and insight into the mind of the killer. The characters' lives and personal quandaries surpass anything the killer may or may not do in this book.With a writing style that is clearly Cornwell, and a cast of characters we have known too long to turn our backs on, Black Notice is a continuation of the Scarpetta saga, and one that is well worth suffering a few disappointments. After all, Cornwell would be hard-pressed to outdo herself, with Potter's Field and Point of Origin tough acts to follow. While perhaps not her best, Black Notice is still worth curling up with on a dark, rainy night.Sherry Stinson..."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is by far the best of the Scarpetta mystery novels. It alone deserves to remain in print for any appreciable amount of time. Everything in the series after this is likely to be anti-climatic. But the fact still remains that Scarpetta needs to get a life. She still hasn't learned how to realistically deal with her enemies. Scarpetta is herself paranoid and no wonder: she insists upon setting back and letting things get out of control. Her efforts at hitting back are at best misguided, ineffectual and misplaced."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"For readers who want a well-crafted suspense story, skip this immature, feeble attempt at mystery. In this particular selection, Kay Scarpetta is an emotional cripple as testified to by the rampant adjectives that describe her delicate condition post her lover's death. This novel was grossly disappointing because of its consistent use of similes that test the patience of any well-read reader. Similes are sprinkled everywhere as if someone wrote a prescription for this novel that ordered a certain amount making the work silly, almost laughable. For a professional cornoner, the main character is both unprofessional, consistently a blithering woman and hangs onto a detective, in Marino, who was grabbed out of the 1950's with his wisecracking, emotional outbursts, and immature and unprofessional behavior of a New York City dectective. Sorry, but this novel is just plain a waste of any intelligent reader's time."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have yet to get so disgusted with a series that I actually stop reading it, but this one is getting close. I keep reading them because I am curious as to how the author is going to dig herself out the hole she has created. I am sick and tired of Kay's perfection. She's a doctor, a lawyer, a forensic pathologist, the Chief Medical examiner, a certified scuba diver, etc., etc., etc. She is selfless to the point of being unreal. There are even passages in the book where Kay thinks to herself that she should be worried about what's coming up for her, but all she can think about is her niece's problems and feelings. And speaking of her niece, the author puts way too much emphasis on Lucy's sexual orientation. It is emphasized in some way almost every time Lucy's name comes up. I can understand pointing it out at the beginning of the book for those readers who are just entering the series, but to keep pointing it out throughout the whole book is too much (and the author has done this ever since Lucy joined the FBI). As for Marino, I don't expect the author to change him into a candidate for GQ, but his constant angry attitude, foul mouth, and slovenly looks are getting really hard to bear. How come Kay seems to be the only one who sees any good in him? Despite my rantings, I will go on and read her next book, The Last Precinct. I am curious to see where the storyline goes because she left this one so abruptly, but at this point, I can't give a ringing endorsement and would encourage people to either start at the beginning of this series or don't bother."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I enjoy Patricia Cornwell's attention to detail and all of the forensic pathology information. Her characters are not always the most likeable people and they certainly do things in this book that have you clucking your tongue. But, her characters find their way through difficult situations and maintain relationships over time. I enjoy the interaction between her not too perfect characters. Great addition to the series."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell is a good writer, however this book (if you can stay with it) was not attractive for various reasons. I use the word &quot;attractive&quot; in lieu of compelling, as in, i was compelled to continue reading the book because it was so good. This unfortunately was not the case. We are reintroduced to Marino the detective and must read through the closeness of the relationship, alluding to what they have been through together. Huh? then there is the niece, who makes a brief and angry appearance and to tell you the truth, i could not figure that out and neither could the author. A scheming police chief, a scheming co-worker and a body found in an ocean crate lead us to paris (on the concorde no less). Oh and then we get to read about the heart wrenching angst of losing a loved one. This was an attempt maybe? to branch out. However, there was no character development. There is nothing to like about the main character, who seems to vacillate between worlds. The surrounding characters we are supposed to have some following of. Go back to Lawrence Sanders who could continue with the same detective, but was not too into repeating himself. It is like watching a sequel and having to endure the parts we saw from the first movie. Not ingenous."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"After reading Amazon reader's reviews of Black Notice I was disappointed and wasn't sure I wanted to read it. It sounded like such a letdown from what I consider her usually fine writing.Boy, was I surprised! I've been a fan of Ms. Cornwell's writing for a few years now. A friend lent me The Hornet's Nest (not a Scarpetta novel, by the way) and I've been hooked ever since.While I admit that Lucy's character may be better served by taking a different direction, and perhaps the beginning of the book was slow, all in all the adventure seemed to ME to be just another day in the life of Dr. Scarpetta; is it entirely plausible? Maybe not. Is it a good, solid read with familiar and not so familiar characters? Yup, sure is!I dunno, all I can say is that I was pleasantly surprised. I hope there are others out there who agree with me :)"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I confess to having not read any earlier examples of the Kay S. series, but after this novel I am disinclined to try. The plot is so predictable it makes an epsode of the A-team look like Dickens, and the CME herself is a woeful example of author wish-fulfillment. There is no element of mystery in the entire book, except perhaps to wonder why anyone bothered to cut down the required trees. The characters frequent boozy flights of self-examination verge on humorous, other than that watch the worst TV detective show you can find."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books up to this point and have enjoyed them all. I did not, however, enjoy Black Notice. Rather than focusing on Dr. Scarpetta's work, there was WAY too much focus on who was out to get her.

All of Cornwell's previous books were full of excitement, but Black Notice dragged on and on..."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Black Notice is the beginning of the dark period for Patricia Cornwell. Don't get me wrong, I love serial killer books, but her books keep getting darker and darker - depressing to read."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is so awful, I don't even know where to start. If I could give it no stars, I would."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"One of the few books that I didn't care if I finished it or not. It is one of the Scarpetta series books and guess from the reviews that I read that the Scarpetta series is much like the Alex Cross series by James Patterson. The first few books are outstanding and then the rest are not worth buying and reading, a waste of time and money.I've never read a book so full of angry, bitter characters. I had no compassion or concern for any of the characters and didn't care if they lived or died. Cornwell seemed to throw in new characters and subplots without them leading anywhere (page fillers, perhaps?) Interpol requests Scarpetta and her detective partner Pete Marino, who is on suspension, to fly to France. Why? What was the purpose of Marino going? He didn't do anything except open his foul mouth and show how stupid he was. Many times I wanted to scream that people do not act this way. There is a lot of unnecessary detail that makes you want keep turning pages to hopefully get to a part that makes sense. Then finally there is an abrupt ending immediately after the one page climax.If you don't care about any suspense and a plot that doesn't work but instead you savor words and phrases that are rich with details and descriptions, then this might be the book for you."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is an intriguing and well crafted Kay Scarpetta mystery, which begins promisingly enough with the discovery of an overly ripe, dead body. Found stashed in a locked and sealed freight container aboard a cargo ship from Belgium that has landed in Dr. Kay Scarpetta's jurisdiction of Richmond, Virginia, the male, mystery corpse is covered with loose hairs. This intriguing beginning sends Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Richmond, Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner, on a hunt for information that turns international in scope. She discovers that this is just one of a number of murders to contain those tell tale hairs.The murders, themselves, are graphic and the forensic details, as always, are fascinating, and Dr. Scarpetta's critical analysis of the pathology issues are well thought out and highly informative, as she sifts through the forensic evidence in order to profile the killer. Her assessment of the peculiar affliction of this serial killer is intriguing, providing scientific insight into creatures who were called werewolves, but who may have only been persons with a rare and unusual genetic condition, causing them to be especially hirsute, among other anomalies.Moreover, there are a number of subplots afoot. Dr. Scarpetta, who is recovering from the death of her lover, Wesley Benton, faces a number of problems closer to home. It seems that she has been the victim of identity theft, with her internet screen name being used to set up a phony chat room, and personally destructive emails being sent falsely under her screen name.To add fuel to the fire, a new Deputy Chief in the Richmond police Department, Diane Bray, and has managed to demote Dr. Scarpetta's long time friend, Homicide Detective Pete Marino. Having her own secret agenda, Bray has turned her sights onto Dr. Scarpetta, desiring to get jurisdiction over the Medical Examiner's Office. Perfidy also exist among Dr. Scarpetta's trusted staff, and her niece Lucy, who is still not operating with a full deck, is on a dangerous, undercover police mission with her lover in Miami, adding yet another worry to Dr. Scarpetta's already full plate.It is the camaraderie between Pete Marino and Dr. Kay Scarpetta, however, that holds this particular book together. Their repartee and dialogue is wonderful, giving evidence of their comfortable and close relationship, without saying so in so many words. They carp as if they were an old married couple. Lucy, Dr. Scarpetta's niece, however, is still a loose cannon, and it is unbelievable that any police agency would allow her to run around with a gun in her hand, given her record for shooting it off. Mercifully, this annoying character has a smaller role than usual in this novel, and the reader may only hope that she will either be written out altogether or get an attitude adjustment.The ending of the book, however, is a little too pat. Dr. Scarpetta's actions in the book's grand finale are not really believable for such an astute and normally cautious woman. Given what she already knows about the killer, her actions in the end bespeak more of the actions of an unknowing civilian. Still, this book does not fail to entertain and is sure to provide reading pleasure for many Kay Scarpetta devotees."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book weaves Dr. Scarpetta's personal life together with her professional career, but lacks the ending that keeps you wanting more. I enjoyed the explanations of all of the medical examinations involved. The mystery unfolds well and the side tracks to her niece do not bother the overall flow. Yet, I was overwhelmed by a poor ending."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"For some reason when I read this title and even partially into the book, I assumed the subject was going to involve Bubonic Plague, aka The Black Plague (get it Black Plague, Black Notice...). Ok, so my brain has ceased to function in a recreational reading mode and is only turned on and processing information when I'm in class or at work (at least I hope it's processing the necessary information then!). Actually, Black Notice is a death notice, so it goes along with Cornwell's normal themes, but I could have been on to something...BLACK NOTICE continues the saga of Kay Scarpetta, the forensic pathologist and chief medical examiner from Richmond, Virginia, along with her normal sidekicks seen in previous books. Scarpetta is called into action when a cargo ship finds an eroding body in a cargo container. When Scarpetta investigates, she finds mysterious hairs on the victim, but no other trace evidence. (This is where I still thought the book was about Bubonic Plague, because Pete Marino actually gets body fluid on him, and I figured we was contaminated and could be a goner! Ok, so my mind speeds ahead and tries to figure out not only the ending, but the subplots as well, and in this case, I was way off base.) A few days later, a murdered convenience store clerk has the same strange hairs covering her body and Kay Scarpetta realizes she's once again on the hunt for a serial killer.I found BLACK NOTICE to be lacking Patricia Cornwell's normal dynamic writing style. She seemed to throw in new characters and subplots without them leading anywhere (page fillers, perhaps?). An example of the new characters would be Diane Bray, the new police deputy chief who hates Marino with a passion. Cornwell could have delved into this character more than she did and had a great subplot, but instead only hit the highlights and left the reader wanting more.Lucy also returns, but is not the same Lucy from the past. She's explosive, unsure of herself, and suicidal. Wow, who is this person and what has she done with the Lucy we all know and love? The Lucy who's kick-ass tough and doesn't back down from anyone? The walking genius with guts?Then there's Pete Marino. Since when does Marino take guff from anyone? He allows Diane Bray to demote him to a patrol officer with little comment. Ok, I can see Marino possibly going along with this since he's fairly close to retirement, but for him not to make snide remarks whenever he's around the higher-ups is something I just can't fathom! He does make a few off-base remarks, but nothing like we've come to expect and enjoy from his explosive personality.Patricia Cornwell has come up with a semi-unique killer, but I found the ending to be far-fetched. She can just wait around for this intelligent killer who has eluded police on two continents to just walk directly into her little trap? Give me a break! Cornwell blew it on this ending - it could have been so much more dramatic!I would still recommend reading this book - it's a very good read for those who aren't familiar with Patricia Cornwell's past work. Being a fan of hers, I've come to expect much better from this fantastic writer and felt disappointed that it wasn't her typical edge-of-your-seat type book with an equally suspenseful ending."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Of all the books in this series, this is my least favorite. The story was a bit too unbelievable, but it is more Kay Scarpetta for lovers of this series. At least I did finish the book so I'll say it's an okay read!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a really poor effort by Patricial Cornwell. If this had been the first book of Cornwell's that I had read, I would have been likely to not read any more books of hers. Instead of a good mystery, we are offered extreme details of office politics and a slow moving plot, with a B-movie climax. The characters are extremely caricaturized here, and there also is a lot of self-righteousness and self-declared vulnerability on the part of Scarpetta. Overall, this one can be skipped."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I found this book's premise to be totally unbelieveable. The book got off to a good start and really captured my attention but the ending was very unsatisfactory. This book dwells too much on gory descriptions of murders and autopsies and spends way too little time developing the killer character. When you finish the last page of the book you know very little more than you did when it started. I am also getting pretty fed up with Cornwell's pre-occupation with Kay Scarpetta's brilliant, gay niece, Lucy, and her lesbian love affairs. This girl belongs in a mental hospital, not the FBI. And then to top it off, Kay is now embarking on a love affair of her own with someone young enough to be her son. Am I the only reader who would like to see Kay and Pete Marino as a couple? Of course, Cornwell keeps painting a picture of Marino as such a slob this would probably be an impossibility. I recommend reading Cornwell's earlier installments in this series - the characters and plots are much better and you won't come away feeling stupid for wasting your time reading them."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"As usual, she writes with too much detail for my taste, but ifyou scan through the hum drum parts, it can be interesting. I did notlike the ending at all, it left too much unanswered. I did not like Benton dying in the last book and her falling for the young Interpol guy this time around."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I just finished listening to the unabridged audio by Kate Reading and enjoyed every bit of it. It takes a good reader to make a book exciting to hear and Kate Reading does a good job changing voices for each charactor and putting emphasis where needed. I am familiar with the Richmond area and can relate to their harsh winters and scenery. I have my own library of audio books as I do a lot of driving and have listened to some good books read by readers who put me to sleep. I recommed this book to all Patricia Cornwell fans especially on cassette."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwall has managed to turn this reader from one who could not wait for her next book to be released to one who is finished reading them. It may suprise her to learn that the sexual orientation of a person only clutters up a good story unless it has DIRECT bearing on the story being told. Lucy needs to get a life and grow up. I really miss the excitement of the her earlier books. I have found this nagging issue true of her last 3 novels."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have scrolled through the various reviews here, as well as having read this novel myself and reviewed it for a couple of print publications recently. At first, I felt badly about giving Ms. Cornwell a negative review; she's one of my favorite writers, after all, and it felt like betraying a friend. But, having read the reviews here on Amazon.com, I don't feel so badly about my negative assessments now because I realize I'm not the only one with severe misgivings concerning &quot;Black Notice&quot;. Ms. Cornwell, we LOVE Kay .... you are a wonderful writer and you've made us feel that way about her and Pete and Benton Wesley. That's why we find it so hard to believe how cardboard and one-dimensional they have ALL become. I hardly think I'd like Scarpetta were I to meet her in real life. And Lucy? That child needs to be slapped upside the head - it's high time a girl her age (and working for the ATF no less) grew up and started acting like an adult, not a whiny, petulant brat. Poor Pete - you may as well kill him off now, because with each book I feel him inching closer and closer to a heart attack or a stroke or worse. As for Scarpetta ... why is the world against her (particuarly all the serial killers in it?) Is there some literary rule that says KAY MUST NEVER EVER BE HAPPY? My God, Lucy's new girlfriend, Jo, better get out quick; otherwise she'll wind up just as jaded, one-sided and BORING as the other characters in the series. Though I found the novel's pace break-neck as usual and your forensic descriptions first-rate as always, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE read your reviews - not from critics necessarily but from US ... your readers and (for the time being) loyal fans. Believe me, much more of this and I fear our ranks will reduce quite quickly. Good luck to you - I hope for better next time."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've read all Cornwell's books - but, man, this is the last one. I thought the other series she does was boring, but Black Notice is not only poorly written it is as dull as a desk job.Maybe Cornwell could take her foot off the pedal for a couple of years - despite lost earnings (and judging from her alter ego Scarpetta, Cornwell now has Dollar Signs in her eyes). She is definitely in need of some new ideas.Harping on about Benton is pointless: Benton was boring. Giving the reader details about Lucy's sex life is pointless: Lucy is boring. The only two interesting characters, Scarpetta and Marino she has now reduced to caricatures. Cornwell wants the reader to see Scarpetta as a brilliant, incisive investigator - but she comes off as a paranoid harpy - a bit the way her creator comes off in interviews.And Scarpetta as dominatrix with her suddenly irresistible appeal to younger (but apparently gay) men? Give me a break."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was very excited when the new Scarpetta novel was released. I was very disappointed to find it the worst parts of all the previous books. In Southern Cross the Richmond PD was just cleaned up. How did a Diane Bray character arrive? If you don't know what to do with a character-just kill it off. Why is every killer personally after Scarpetta? When is Lucy going to grow up and start treating people with something more than hostility? The icing on the cake of this book was the &quot;experienced&quot; Scarpetta romancing. In the 14 years these books have covered she has only dated two people. A thirty year old is just too young for her-making him forty would have made the romance more plausible. Marino was treated so badly it was ridiculous. I won't be looking forward to a next book as much."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Sadly, Cornwell continues the careless writing of what was once an absorbing series with good characters. In this book, Scarpetta has enemies at work ... again. A killer appears in her house ... again. Marino eats too much, smokes too much and is jealous ... again. Lucy is the world's unhappiest lesbian ... again. Kaye has almost the same fight with her sister as she did two or three books ago. This book has finally allowed me to break the habit of reading every book in a series and every book to the end."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The skinny on Patricia Cornwell is that her first three Scarpetta novels were first rate and the rest aren't worth reading. Black Notice does nothing to alter this with it's poor plotting and characterization and emphasis on the characters' weepy angst. It's a shame, really. PC has so many loyal fans that anything she writes goes straight to the best-seller list and makes her another five million dollars, so why spend a lot of time on suspense, believable characters and tight plotting ?"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell's books are deteriorating rapidly in terms of quality (i.e. innovation, writing style, research, depth), their characters are gettingeven more tired than their readers and the grisly morgue details fail to arouse anyone's interest as most has been covered in previous books. Patricia should look for another set of characters (at least if she wants to retain yours truly as a reader - and I have bought and read all her books so far)."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I loved this book up until the last 30 pages. I was totally sucked in, and then she had to go and blow it by writing a rotten ending. It was almost as if Ms. Cornwell was being forced into the ending. This book is a definate read, but if someone knows Ms. Cornwell tell her to let something bad happen to Kay once in a while, she is only human after all."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Cornwell has long been a favorite writer of mine. I have followed her career with a critical eye in a literary sense. I think an odd connection could be made with the progression of her character Kay Scarpetta and the progression of her media pictures on the back covers. Black Notice, which is undoubtedly Cornwell's most overtly hard, sad, bleak novel reflects the woman Cornwell has (at least aestheticly) become. To look at her pictures on earlier novels and then the one on Black Notice and then turning your eye to Kay Scarpetta in Black Notice vs. ealier novels..the women have both hardened...both on the same strange time line. Odd. The thing that most alrams me in Black Notice is the undeniable height that Kay's paranoia seems to have reached. As an intellectual woman, I want Kay to always be strong, able to be compsed concise and clear. I did enjoy this current offering but here's to hoping Kay makes a rebound mentally and emotionally in the novels to come."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'm a Cornwell fan, so you can't expect my review to be non-bias. I like all of her work. But like I said, she has better novels out there. ******* I ordered another novel called, 'THE FIST OF GOD' by A.T. Nicholas, and that book was phenomenal! It's a great supernatural thriller. The plot unfolds through the eyes of a homicide detective. I would recommend both books."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is only an average piece of writing. It seems like her books are becoming more and more the same with a sudden resolution to the main plot in the last few pages with many loose ends to the subplots never resolved. And for the &quot;smart&quot; Dr. Scarpetta to make such a mistake to put her in danger just doesn't fit. My concentration was thrown off in the first few pages by the ATF being called the AFT--a typo that an editor should have caught! From that point on it seemed that there were many conversations that were out of sync and I never really got interested enough to find it as gripping as some of her earlier works. Take more time and care with the next one Ms. Cornwell. It's worth waiting longer between books to get a well written book!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I eagerly await each new Scarpetta novel. I read this one in 2 days, hardly able to put it down. However, I felt this one was aptly named, Black Notice. The mood throughout the entire book was black and depressing! Can someone please put Marino on a diet, and have him stop smoking before Kay finds him on the table in her morgue? I have enjoyed the growing friendship of these two characters in all the Scarpetta series, but in this one they seemed to argue too much. Friends should enjoy each other. Have I just forgotten, or have all the books in the series been filled with the F word? I'm no prude, but really, a few F's are all you need if you are trying to paint a certain personality. I was never a big fan of Benton, so no more grief over him! Enough already. Kay needs someone who can add a little joy to her life, but I don't think Talley is the one. I think Patricia left us hanging at the end of the book because she plans to continue the story into the next one. There were plenty of unanswered questions so the material is there already. Please Patricia, please take a few Prozac before starting your next book. We are ready for a happier Kay, a healthier Marino, and calmer Lucy."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This story is better than the last, but not as good as the initial Scarpetta stories. The good doctor is evidencing increasing paranoia, Lucy is overboard with her anger and Marino needs to shape up and get a woman."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I like to read the Kay Scarpetta series, but you always know how the ending will turn out - they are always the same and in about the last 2 pages the killer is identified. I mostly like them because there are 2 things she provides great detail on - computer programming and medical knowledge. Apart from that, the characters are not developed at all and the pro-gay comments are unnecessary. It seems impossible that so few people could consistently find (and usually kill) so many serial killers by themselves. And is there something about Christmas that brings them out of the woodwork? In this book, you do get more of an insight into Kay's character, although the other major characters are still mostly mysteries to the reader, except in the instances when Patricia Cornwell uses them to make social comment (like all the pro-gay comments). It is an entertaining book though."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I loved every thrilling moment of this book. Absolutely delicious escapism. Love the gritty forensics, Marino, Lucy, and all the returning characters. Enjoyed the office politics, it happens often in real life, although not in as exciting a fashion as with Kay Scarpeta. Especially enjoyed the pure evil of her antagonist, Bray. I had no problem with the grief kay was feeling or with the fact that she fell into the arms of another in the midst of it all. That happens in real life too. How many of us have sucumbed to help alleviate the pain of a broken heart. Human nature. I feel Cornwell has obviously suffered the pain of romance herself to be able to portray a totally irrational attraction so easily. Loved the excitement and look forward to tying up the loose ends in a new Kay Scarpetta novel. Bravo Patricia Cornwell!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta is back with a vengeance. I was delighted with this book. It kept me interested from the first page through to the last page. After Cornwell's last two or three disappointments, it was wonderful to pick up this exciting book. Lots of forensics, political infighting, character relations, and certainly mystery and edge of the seat scares. This becomes my favorite Cornwell (Kay Scarpetta) novel hands down. Really glad to see Cornwell back to her old self again."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This latest novel by Patricia Cornwell is indeed one of her best. We see the vulnerable and mourning side of Dr. Scarpetta as she struggles to deal with the death of Benton Wesley. All sides of Kay's mourning are revealed - sadness, anger, frustration and passion. The reader also gets a rare look at the softer side of Marino as he tries to deal with Benton's death, his demotion, and his feelings for Kay. The mystery of the loup-garou is fascinating. I found that I could not put this book down! Along with the suspense surrounding the mysterious murder of the unknown victim, there is an excellent tale of deceit from within the office of the medical examiner which eventually leads to the new police chief, a powerful and cunning woman named Patricia Bray. If you like a good murder mystery, with undertones of politics and a love lost, this is a great book for you. If you haven't read any of Patricia Cornwell's other books about Kay Scarpetta, you can still follow what has happened. If you are an avid fan of Dr. Scarpetta, this is one of the best!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I wish that I would not have read the book so fast, now I must wait a year for another Scarpetta book! As expected, the book is fast-paced and keeps the reader involved throughout. I really enjoyed the way Cornwell explored the connections between Kay and her friends/family, especially how Benton's death has affected them. Cornwell's character development in Black Notice far exceeds that in her previous books. The only drawback of the book for me is that the ending is very clipped. It left so many questions/issues I wanted to see addressed. I imagine this is intentional though, as now I will be eagerly anticipating the next book."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is one of the best books Cornwell has written. It focuses a lot more on Kay as a person than Kay the Medical Examiner. Although she is trying to solve a case it seems to be kind of the back story and the grief and pain she still feels over Benton's death seems to take center stage. I think it is one of her better books. You will have to pace yourself to keep from finishing it in one night."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Kay Scarpetta was one of the most interesting characters to enter the crime fiction genre. Intelligent, strong, independent and complex - she found herself in superbly written and engaging plots. Not any more. The Scarpetta series has been losing quality over the last few books - this is definitely a continuation of that trend. The characters that inhabit this book are cardboard cut outs of their former selves. There is no snappy dialog, no witty exchanges or brilliant, inspired detective work. Everything happens by the numbers - the only surprise this book delivers is whether you can bear to finish it. The characters, plots and climaxes are getting tired - do yourself a favour - steer clear of this one."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Scarpetta solves another great one. The mix of emotions of the three main players is great. It was good to read the human side to all three. Where will she go next?"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"BALCK NOTICE is an entertaining, intriguing, and colorful work. Yet, in the end, it's as hollow and disposable as almost all of Cornwell's books since POSTMORTEM, her phenomenal debut. After reading Ridley Pearson's disappointingly frugal THE FIRST VICTIM, I dreaded another mystery novel opening with the discovery of a corpse on the water. Luckily, Cornwell keeps things lively and moving -- as usual -- at breakneck speed. Actually, the first 100 pages or so are quite deft and concise, but Cornwell (again!) drags out tired plot gimmicks from past works such as an insider sabotaging her office and people from on-high looking to displace poor ol' Kay from her prestige position as Chief Medical Examiner. And (once again) Lucy comes off as nothing more than a grating inconvenience on the whole thing, starting out on one level and staying abrasive throughout; she's still the same stick-in-the-mud as before. Luckily, there's good ol' Pete Marino around to give this novel some class. He's a dandy creation (even more so than Scarpetta), and I couldn't possibly imagine this series without him. He gives it dignity, emotional gravity, qualities that Scarpetta (despite all her 'give-me-a-break' emotional whinings) fails to elicit. Bravo to Marino, once again. A faint round of applause for this passable book."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Ms. Cornwell's Younger Man/Older Woman obsession now rears its nasty head in this series as well. Perhaps it is supposed to be titillating, but it ends up being tedious and forced just as in her other novels: &quot;I pulled Talley into the bedroom, and he was no match for me because I had experience and skills he knew nothing of. I controlled him. I dominated.&quot;If there were some explanation as to how Kay Scarpetta and Mr. Talley &quot;fall in love&quot; after having just known each other for hours -- and after just one romp in the hay Talley volunteers to get a job transfer so he can be near Scarpetta, so it must be pretty serious -- it would be more satisfying. But that sort of thing has never been Ms. Cornwell's strength. Probably her editors told her she had to create a new love interest, and so she whipped this one up in 100 words or less.It's clear that Ms. Cornwell plans that we will see much more of Jay Talley in the future: &quot;His hazel eyes were so penetrating I felt violated by them, his dark good looks so striking I instantly knew his type, because men that beautiful are all alike.&quot; The prospect of seeing more of this cardboard thin, cartoon character is not a very appealing one, however."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Scarpetta is back not with a vengeance but with a whimper. I got Black Notice today and just finished it. It is defintely better than Southern Cross bit does not approach the brillance of Post Morteum or her earlier works. The plot is weak and there are two divergent story lines that are not related at to each other. I was disappointed with the conclusion because it seemed very contrived, I think Cornwall has reached the end of the line with this character and the body of evidence in this book points that way. I had eagerly aniticipated this book but was left unsatisified."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This like all of books in the Scarpetta series is a brillant and entertaining piece of fiction. Patricia Cornwell has a talent for writing books that you never want to put down. Although she has written many books in the Scarpetta series i have never found them to be repetative, each novel continues to get better and better which is a great achievement, as not all authors can honestly say this to be true with their books. I just hope that Patricia Cornwell can continue to write such suspenseful novels in the future."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Black Notice is a very satisfying addition to my favorite series of mystery novels. The combination of science and sensitive character development in each new adventure is a treat. Scarpetta, Marino, and the rest are like old friends now, and though at times our intrepid M.E. seems a little superhuman, she comes to terms with devastating personal loss in this novel.My only criticism of this page-turner is the uncharacteristic, blundering way that Scarpetta puts herself jeopardy in the final pages -- it almost seems that Cornwell ran out of ideas and decided to wind things up rather hastily. Or, perhaps I just hated for it to end (I always do!). Looking forward to The Last Precinct. . .If you have just discovered Dr. Kay Scarpetta, be sure to start with the first novel (Post Mortem) and read them in order!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Black Notice is another great read by Cornwell. I couldn't put this one down until I finished. I enjoyed this story line just as much as I have all the rest and I hope that she keeps the Scarpetta series going. For those out there who thought this was terrible then try reading something new, but for those who have really enjoyed all the other Scarpetta novels than you will love this one as well."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Black Notice is definitely not one of Patricia Cornwell's better Kay Scarpetta books.In this book, Kay seems even more sorry for herself and mad at the world while dealing with the death of her lover; Lucy is embittered to the point of self destruction and Marino--well, Marino is just Marino.And in this book, the mystery was not as taut as in the previous novels. It begins satisfactorily when a dead and decaying body is found in the cargo hole of a ship, but the plot does not develop. In fact, it becomes rather convoluted, especially when Marino and Scarpetta go to Paris to help the Interpol. The story then evolves into a unbelievable mishmash with spectors of werewolves running amok through the streets of Richmond, Virginia.This is not to say that you should not read this book especially if you are a Kay Scarpetta fan. Despite its faults, it is an enjoyable read, and I recommend it because of that."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Disappointing. This was the first of the series that I read. I couldn't figure out the background so I never got into the story. The end wrapped up too quickly and then just dropped off."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"EEE GADZ! What happened? Anyone speak non-sequitur-ese here? This was an angry novel which depicts Kay Scarpetta as an unhappy, nasty, witch with a B. This patchwork does not work. I am disappointed, I truly love this author and the stock characters. Kay Scarpetta needs a vacay."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"One great book. Entertaining, gripping, and stimulating. Go out and buy it."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Cornwell writes light books that are best read &quot;books on tape&quot; style. I like them, they are what they are. She seems to know a lot about forensic medicine, but not much else. Only in her books would Smith and Wesson make a seven shot revolver or an educated person (let alone an entire self respecting health department) use AOL. Outside of these little flights of fancy, it's a cool little book."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I thought this was her best work! I couldn't put it down. I love this author and LOVED this book!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of Pat's books and up until now had problems with only the first one she chose a different character, I felt that the ending was put into one paragraph. I didn't think that would happen to this one, but everything happens in the last two pages. I like a little more explanation how it all fits together. There are so many great authors out there that at least leave you feeling satisfied after spending so much time with the book. I felt letdown when everything happened so fast. However, I will continue to read her books, maybe next time we could have a little better ending."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was extremely disapointed with the ending of this book. I have read all of the Scarpetta novels and this one was.... oh, I don't know. I enjoyed the book until the end. There was all this talk about the killer and horrible they were... yadda yadda... And then when they do catch him it's like &quot;Oh well, here he is and don't we feel sorry for him and please don't shoot him&quot;. It just seemed to be a MAJOR letdown. I'm not sure if I plan to read more Scarpetta books or not."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was SO looking forward to reading this latest Scarpetta, but what a letdown! The entire book seemed to be little more than the author pushing (via Kay's preachy dialogue) some kind of bizzare whining, pro-NRA, rah-rah America, quasi-Republican, Anti-beautiful woman/pro-lesbian adgenda. Some of which I agree with, some not -- but none of it is what I want to read for entertainment! The worst bit had to be when Kay tells her Latin American housekeeper &quot;But, Rosa -- the police here aren't like they are in your country&quot;. A close second was her assuring Lucy's latest squeeze that &quot;Love is never wrong&quot;. When, oh when, did Kay become such a trite, pontificating bore? I'm not sure if P.Cornwell has a new editor, or if she herself is going through a mid-life crisis, but I hope the old Scarpetta comes back in the next book. And for God's sake, enough with the firearms! Paragraphs that used to go into great detail about medical/forensic procedure are now describing everyone's handguns in practically erotic sensual prose. All in all, a kind of strange read."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book had me reading well into the early morning hours.Exciting, thrilling, and interesting, right up to the last page."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This was a great book.

A letter from beyond the grave only sends her into a deeper depression. Her job becomes her panacea because she discards her shroud of grief for periods of time.Against the advice of her staff, Kay Scarpetta investigates a murdered corpse found inside a sealed container that was unloaded off a ship that had just docked. Marino assists her, but his boss, Chief Deputy Bray places pressure on these two individuals she wants fired. Bray plans to make the duo appear incompetent, but the two crime fighters are able to ignore her interference. Kay and Marino obtain information from homicide and Interpol that takes them to Paris where they further learn that a loup-garou serial killer immigrated to Virginia.The police procedural audience will want to rush to the nearest book store to obtain the newest Scarpetta adventure. The heroine's fans will observe a softer, more vulnerable Kay than before as she cannot stop her deep anguish from overwhelming her. Her niece Lucy and Marino struggle with the experiences from the last book POINT OF ORIGIN. Besides the investigation, BLACK NOTICE is about people and how relationships change them. This, in turn, makes for a much deeper story line and it demonstrates beyond a doubt that Patricia Cornwell still has the magic touch to produce another memorable work.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am currently in Pre-Med and I am hoping to go into forensic pathology. A classmate of mine told me I must read some of Ms. Cornwell's books. She gave Black Notice and said to give it a chance. It has sat on my kitchen table for about a month now I had not even glanced at it. 2 nights ago I was having troubles getting to sleep and I decided to open the book hoping maybe my eyes would get tired. I wasn't able to put the thing down and I read it straight through. This book is so detailed orientated and kept me on the edge of my seat. This book tied everything together very nicely. The ending was a bit predictable but it was a excellent read!!!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This was a book read from the CORBEL Book Club. As a reader of other Patricia Cornwell books I would have to say this is not her best; although, it did get better in the end (the beginning is slow to get started!) Some in our group who had not read other Cornwell books wanted Kay to get together with Marino (I DON'T THINK SO!) It made us feel as though we should have read the previous book to better understand what happened to Benton. The ending is good. Worth reading, but only when you have nothing better."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell may take you to a city street in Virginia or to a country across the ocean, but the fact is that Patricia takes you where ever she goes.

The ending of Black notice, was not up to her talents of writing. It was like she got tired of the story line and left it hanging. I'll try one more time before I quit the series."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Cornwell's earlier books were much better written than this one. I wish she would go back to the days when her books were based on real crimes committed in VA. Those were her best books. Also, her work needs better editing. There are typos throughout, and somebody from Richmond (i.e., Cornwell) should know how to spell Shockoe (NOT Shockhoe). Plot seemed contrived."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I know this is fiction, but Kay's world just isn't plausible anymore, and it threatens to overwhelm the strong forensics and the whole series. She hasn't got a single real relationship. If a person were treated the way she treats Marino, that person would be long gone. Her relationship with her niece consists of bickering. Her relationship with her sister consists of juvenile nagging with a major breast fixation thrown in. Her relationship with two of the other females in the story, Bray and Anderson, consists of nagging, bickering and at least with Bray, more breast fixation. Scarpetta's confusion and grief over Benton, who she didn't even seem to love in the last two books, ring false and Cornwell seemed to struggle to present profound grief. The result is a very slow and choppy and messy first half, where Kay comes across as lost and on the verge of losing her grip. Cornwell is going to have to decide if she's writing for us, the Scarpetta readers, or herself and her own personal explorations. While this writing-as-therapy is fine, it's not what Scarpetta has been about. The grandiosity Cornwell feels compelled to shove at us has her chief medical examiner a professor, a consultant for the FBI, a consultant for the ATF, on the staff of the new forensics institute and now, a consultant for Interpol. Give me a break. Nuclear terrorists, biological terrorists, homicidal millionaires and now, a hairy homicidal millionaire, the Loup-Garou. While I enjoyed the forensics around the Loup-Garou, the fact remains, NOTHING is normal or real in Kay's world anymore."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell is one of my most favorite authors, however, this book left me wishing for more from her. It wasn't a bad book, just not up to par for her. I had a hard time staying attentive and some of the things that Scarpetta managed to get herself into were just plain stupid. It was hard for me to believe that she would hop into bed with a complete stranger after getting a very emotional letter from the grave from her beloved Benton. I think that part could have been left out. All in all it was a good book. I still am a big fan of Marino and find Lucy to be her usual self absorbed normal. I am still considering Cornwell my favorite and look forward to her next book.

Thebook jacket talks about a transatlantic mystery, but why does it take3/4 of the book to get to France? Because we need to hear about how everyone is out to get Kay (again). I keep reading this series hoping that it will return to form (see Postmorten), but it's just getting more sloppy. At one point, Cornwell tells about how bacteria are breaking down the Container man's cell walls. Cell walls? Didn't she learn in high school that only plants have cell walls? One example of how she doesn't care enough to put enough thought and effort into a medical mystery plot. Doesn't she know that most serial killers are not freaks of nature, and the fact that they are generally perceived as just like you and me is much more scary than anything she has conjured up in a while?"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell is THE master of murder, mystery and suspence.

The ending and the story line, while it sounded like Patricia Cornwell, was very disappointing. If she writes another book with this language content I will not read it. We are so bombarded today with this type of language in life and on T.V.,I read as an alternative to T.V. What a shame that now my reading material sounds worse than my television shows. Not your best Ms. Cornwell!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell has once again swung the direction of her usually brilliant writing back to our beloved Dr. Kay Scarpetta. Reflecting a more intense and empathetic view of her complicated life as the Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia, this chapter of Kay's life is more brilliant in color and hope for her future. It is more upbeat in detail with respect to both her work and the life of her sidekick buddy, Captain Marino. I found myself actually able to visualize the characters in my mind's eye easier than in her previous works. There is more detail with respect to Kay's innermost feelings. The international aspect of the story lends more of an enticement not to put this book down too quickly. I found myself wanting to read past the point of being bleary-eyed. There is a new and most exciting character introduced here, and this person's appearance lends much hope for Kay's future. I was completely whisked away from this world back into the world of Kay and Marino, and thankfully so. Well worth the time and leaves a lasting impression. Makes you hungry for the next chapter in the life of Dr. Kay Scarpetta!!!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is classic Scarpetta. I could hardly put it down.

It is unbelievable that Cornwell has written another great book. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"After reading &quot;Black Notice,&quot; I felt I should call the NYPD to see if Cornwell is holding a gun to her editor's head to force publication of yet another whiny, confused, poorly edited and ultimately infuriating Scarpetta novel. Readers of series do enjoy growing with continuing characters, but just as in the one preceding this volume, &quot;old&quot; characters are plopped in without adequate introduction, thus mystifying new and less-devoted readers as to the details of previous actions and hence the effect on present motivations. Cornwell needs to take a long rest before tackling any more Scarpetta volumes!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've read all of the Kay Scarpetta novels.

The ending was completely unsatisfying.I've loved Patricia Cornwell's previous books but this book seems unfinished and forced.The &quot;relationship&quot; with Talley seemed an afterthought: &quot;Whoops, we need to have some sex in this book; oh, I'll just throw this in here.&quot;The Bray/Anderson subplot seems to abruptly terminate 2/3s of the way through the book, only to be resurrected and dispatched in an all-too-predictable tie-in with the &quot;main&quot; plot.The treatment of Marino is superficial (he just seems to spend the entire book being angry and paranoid). The tie-in with Lucy and Jo is beyond tangential; it seemed to be another afterthought: &quot;Wait, we have to include Lucy....&quot;If you've never before read a Cornwell novel, don't start with this one (try From Potter's Field). If you're a Cornwell afficionado, this book is good for a glimpse at the characters, but wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I found Black Notice totally riveting and suspenseful. It ended a bit abruptly but as a result I can't stop thinking about it. I personally like the character developments in Patricia Cornwell's books but I thought that in this one she overempasized Marino's slovenly nature. I also questioned the speed of the love affair between Jay and Kay (an odd choice of a rhyming name for her new lover). Within hours of theyr &quot;tryst&quot; Kay was telling Jay not to fall in love with her. I thought that was a bit much. Aside from these weaknesses I still loved the book. I love the descriptions of food and weather and details that make me feel part of the story. I love the scariness and the procedures used to gather evidence. I loved Kay Scarpetta and can't wait for the next book to continue the journey. The worst thing about reading a Patricia Cornwell book is knowing whatever book I read next will be a letdown."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I loved her moods and her relationships. She is todays woman. In this book she lets you inside and feel her pain and the way she cares about people in pain. Her buddy the cop is a real hoot. What a guy, we should all be so lucky to have a bud like him. Lucy, is a little scarey she seems like she is going around the bend. The mystery is a really good one and the outcome, well I guess you could say it was worth the read. You go girl, your my favorite.

Pete's mid-life career trouble ... a thief loose in the coroner's office ... internet fraud ... Kay learning to love again ... any ONE of these would have been a good subplot for the main mystery. ALL of them was simply too much. I enjoy learning about Kay and I think it was important we saw her greive. And I loved the bit with Talley. But I wish Ms. Cornwell would have edited this down somewhat. All this drama happening concurrently is just a bit much to take ... and too much to believe. (Does *every* Scarpetta book have to have Lucy in trouble/peril? Isn't it about time for that poor girl to just have a lazy day?)"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was very disappointed in the newest Kay Scarpetta book. Same old story line, same old ending. Really is too bad, can't think of an author who's books I have always looked forward to reading."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"A few years ago I discovered this series. Mystery mixed with forensic science made for an interesting story. Also you cared about Kay, Pete and Lucy. But something happened to our heroes. Kay became an adulterer. Pete became irrational. Lucy never grew up. And worse, the books started to be more about these characters who I liked less than about the problem to be solved. I just finished Black Notice. I think the whole story could have been told in three chapters and 40 pages. Everything else was personal problems and politics. I love a good mystery. The main characters should be interesting people who you care about but they should always be secondary to the narrative."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Predictable if you read her last 3 novels! We are first introducted to the sexual orientation of each character which really clutters up the plot. Was the plot of this novel to lead to a new life for Kay as a New Yorker who will be free to be herself! Notice how all the men in her books get killed off? It is ashame as her previous books were so good and she needs to learn to let Lucy grow up and that we do not care what the character's sexual orientation is as long as it's not necessary to the plot. Definately my last Patricia Cornwell book!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"In Cornwell's 'Scarpetta' series, drama has increasingly yielded to melodrama, and characters have deteriorated into caricature. Moreover, the characatures have become revoltingly self-important and Self-absorbed. Scarpetta herself spends a great deal of time deploring the extent to which others fail to accord her the deference she deserves. Her attitude is understandable, though, since the world (as depicted by Cornwell) revolves around her. She is the target of all the villains, and is idolized everyone else. It's sometimes difficult to remember that she's only a medical examiner. I've about given up on Cornwell. Her non-Scarpetta books were dismal failures, and her latest Scarpetta books haven't been much better."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"While I agree with some of the other reviewers that perhaps this wasn't her best Scarpetta book, I just love Kay Scarpetta! Cornwell draws her so beautifully, and I've become so involved with all the characters that I feel as if I know them personally. Like some of the others, I would prefer that there be some lightening of Kay's attitude, that after all the tragedies she could find a sense of peace in her life somehow, but I must admit this is probably a more realistic portrayal. After Benton, surely there will be another love interest that is worthy of such an intelligent heroine. For me, the mystery and details are always first-rate. Cornwell draws a powerful line in the dirt and dares us to cross."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is as maudlin a book as can be. Most of the time the characters are weeping: Kay cries when she gets a love note from the grave, Marino cries when Kay abuses him, Lucy cries when Kay cries which makes Jo cry over Lucy which makes Jo's parents cry over sin. Kay's stud muffin cries when Kay tells him not to love her, which makes her misty, which enrages Marino to tears. Benton doesn't cry because he's dead. And the werewolf doesn't cry or speak, which is too bad because he's the only interesting figure in the book. Other than that the coincidences are cukoo, Ms. Cornwell promoted a nice expense-paid trip for herself to Paris on the Concorde out of this and we have the usual Tom Clancy imitation of arcania covering up that which is really dreary detail. As her last book suggested, Ms. Cornwell is out of gas."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the first Patricia Cornwell book I've gotten, and I bought the audio version. I'm glad to see from the other reviews that she has written good books in the past. Perhaps I'll try one of them. This book is not one I would recommend. It has excessive and gratuitous profanity (yelled at you in the audio version - constantly), the characters are unlikeable (especially Marino) and react in an illogical manner (Kate opens the door even though she suspects that the &quot;werewolf&quot; is out there, and then tries to protect him from being shot even though he has horribly murdered several people and in the process of doing her too). The profanity was tiring - Kay, Marino and Lucy could have outdone the toughest foul-mouthed gang member in this one. Are we to believe that people talk like this, and often? I don't think so! The so-called &quot;werewolf&quot; syndrome the bad guy has is actually a rare genetic disorder called &quot;congenital general hypertrichosis&quot; and is basically confined to an extended family in Mexico that has black hair. (You can find the information - and pictures too - in just about any genetics book.) How she came up with a blond werewolf is beyond me. Lucy and Marino contribute little to the story - they could have been left out of this one. The parts where Kay does her medical examinations are good. Gross, but very realistic and believable. The story had a lot of potential, but fell far short of it."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"i personally thought this was one of the best, if not the best scarpetta book so far. it was incredibly moving. it dealt with scarpetta's loss of benton, her relationship with marino, as well as lucy's lesbianism, and it included plenty of suspense. the killer was excellent. a perfect villain, one that made you want to sleep with the lights on. it was an emotional rollercoaster. i was scared, i was sad, i was happy. it's definitely a book to read many times, and to enjoy."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Ever the optimist, I bought this novel hoping that Cornwell had improved over her last, disappointing Scarpetta stories. Kay has changed for the worse, remaining hysterically out of control during the entire novel; the realism and credibility of this character has disappeared. The secondary plots are distracting to the point that they overshadow the story line, making it incidental and trite. The climax was predictable and silly, and held no enjoyment for me.Scarpetta is overbearing, controlling and convinced of her own, singular wisdom as she seemingly fights against everyone else in law enforcement. Absurd. Lucy's situations are irrational and her character continues to be focused on her lesbianism (sounds like Ellen). I was disappointed- couldn't wait for the book to end.Save your money."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Black Notice is an affront to P. Cornwell's loyal readers! It quite possibly is the worst book ever written, with the most tired ending ever. The problems: overuse of hardcore profanity; confusing time frame/sense of time; Kay's men friends are always being unnecessarily killed off; the graphic, coincidental murder of Diane Bray--just rewards for disliking Kay?; obvious typos in the last chapters; Lucy is an insufferable bore; Marino should start taking better care of himself--if he loves his job so much, how hard can it be for him to want to take care of himself so he'll be around to do it and so people won't be hot to fire him?; and lastly, the main problem: I know it's fiction, and I know the stories are supposed to be about Kay Scarpetta, the main character, but must she always become a target of every killer in every book? This plot device is TIRED! It's just not plausible that a MEDICAL EXAMINER is always in harm's way of the killer. For once I'd like to see Kay help the police solve a mystery using only her expertise and knowledge. It would be quite refreshing."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The author, the editor and the publisher should all be ashamed of themselves for producing and selling such drivel. I can't determine what was worse- the irritating, one-dimensional characters, the implausible events, or the inconsistent details. Some examples: Dr. Scarpetta is a well-respected, intelligent, strong woman and she falls in love with some agent after meeting with him for just a few hours??? The author describes the doctor suiting up for an autopsy, fully covered to protect her from biohazards. And yet, after the autopsy, she showers and the water is pink because she is so covered with blood. Hmmm, what about the biohazard suit? The medical examiner that Scarpetta meets in Paris is described as having poor English skills and yet her dialog in the book is virtually perfect. Moreover, when the author attempts to write in dialect, in order to make Marino seem like a tough guy, she can't do it consistently (i.e. sometimes he says 'you were' and sometimes 'you was'). This book is pathetic."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"What I didn't like was the fact, that IMHO, one of the main persons, in this book was more or less left out...That is, details, as to his thoughts, motives, what made him the was he was...there are IMHO, a vageness, about the 'wolf-man&#34;, that should have been included...If any one has ever read &#34;THEWATCHER&#34;, by Dean Koontz, will understand what I'm trying to point out...his &#34;MONSTER&#34;, was given, feelings it expressed, how it felt, why it was angery, in short, he had substance, you couldn't help but &#34;feel&#34;, for the poor thing...this was missing here....another charector in the book, her motives, were never made clear, either, before she was 'rubbed out', near the books end.....she was nasty, but I never grasped her true motives or reasons for being that way..I think/ believe, more defining, of the story line was needed...I truly felt let down, at the ending.."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Intrigue, suspense, whatever the reader expects and more from Dr. Scarpetta and company.

I found myself invested in liking certain characters, and disliking certain others, because the character development was so well done. It was accomplished subtly, so as not to bombard you with needless minutiae.

I've forgotten what the book is about. And some say there is 'blue' language. I'd call it 'black', and you must tolerate M___F__ing on every single page, times 3, the whole book, plus extra G-D-ing, blasphemy,etc, and the only thing I haven't had to endure is a sex scene--thank goodness. Not done yet, though. Am close to the end, and this book is so boring, it's hard to get there. I don't believe Cornwell even wrote this book. It doesn't have her flow because of the constant profanities, like jarring bumps in the road, and sounds as if it is written by a younger person who is used to including constant profanities in their own language. If she has a good story, why can't she just put it together and make it a relaxing read? It makes me wonder, 'Who wrote this?'"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Even more interesting than huntig the Loup I found the way Scarpetta had to cope with personal problems (loss of Benton, the relation to Lucy, her sister and her mother), with competition (Bray) and her staff. Further I like this kind of books where you get the direct dialogs, even if the number of invectives is beyond my personal demand. Finally I appreciate the detailed descriptions of interpersonal behaviour and thoughts (e.g. they looked deep into each others eyes ... and Kay admits that Bray is extremely attractive but hates her). As in Hornet's Nets, and later novels Scarpetta involved modern media (internet, TV, radio, press). I'm sure that each european Cornwell fan enjoyed Kay and Marino's trip to Paris. So her affair could not have been predicted and wasn't really what I expected."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I just finished reading Black Notice, and I thought it was one of Patricia Cornwell's best books yet.

There were a lot of holes in her plot and relationships in the book. I think I will give her another chance by reading one of her first novels to see if I like that a little better."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The serial killing was puzzling and interesting in this book until they got to the killer and also never explained any reasoning behind the killing. But any book in the Scarpetta series would be hard-pressed to beat Ms. Cornwell's last book, &quot;Point of Origin,&quot; in terms of shock, tension, and characterization. In &quot;Black Notice,&quot; the tension between Scarpetta and the new woman police chief who is trying to make her job more difficult (someone is always doing that to poor Dr. Kay), distracts readers from what the reader really wants to see -- how Kay is coping with death in her own life.The hint that Benton may still be alive definitely adds excitement to the reader, but if Ms. Cornwell brings him back from some hidden assignment, she'll have to do a good job piecing the puzzle together.The violence of Benton's death in &quot;Point of Origin&quot; fits perfectly with the violence he has seen in life. It is reminiscent of the death scene in the movie &quot;Bonnie and Clyde.&quot; A reviewer described the way the stars and the director performed the ending, as the bodies were killed many times over by bullets, as a &quot;ballet.&quot; The end to the robbers and killers was befitting the crime. Similarly, the end of Benton's life couldn't have been more fitting, although it just about killed ME to read it. I was yelling, &quot;No, no, no! She can't do this to me!&quot; Of course, when you like a character that much and dislike the method of death that much -- that's a sign of a great plot and a tribute to the author. To bring him back now would be difficult.One more thing troubling me about &quot;Black Notice,&quot; is that when Dr. Scarpetta reads the autopsy report for Benton, it appears to only mention that his face has been burned off. In &quot;Point of Origin,&quot; Scarpetta definitely sees his face before the end. I don't want to spoil either book for the reader, and I hope I haven't. If this is to be your first Cornwell book, I'd suggest reading &quot;Point of Origin&quot; first. Actually, I'd suggest reading all of her Scarpetta books first, because the relationship evolves throughout them all."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"A cargo ship containing the remains of a stowaway arrives in Virginia's waterway. Kay Scarpetta is called to examine the remains. Why would this man hide in a shipping container, and what does the strange tattoo on his back symbolize? These questions, as well as the identity of the man are a mystery to Scarpetta.Kay's neice, Lucy, has a new lover, Jo. Lucy and Jo are working in Miami, and their latest mission has gone terribly wrong, leaving two criminals dead, and Jo, fighting for her life in the hospital.Another body is found, this time, a young woman, brutally attacked, with strange bite marks on her body.Kay and Marino, end up in France, working with Interpol on the cases of victims who have also been brutally attacked, with strange bite marks left on the bodies. Once there, the two will have to solve the bizzare puzzle of the strange killings, and make connection to the mystery man in the container.&quot;Black Notice&quot; is one of the better entries in the Scarpetta series (it takes a while to get steam, about 250 pages before things start to move, and the plot involving the wolf-like killings comes into play). Long time readers of the series will notice each new novel is taking the series in a new direction; with less time being spent on the thrill a minute plot twists, and more time being spent on various sub-plots, and character development.Patricia Cornwell is the leading practicioner of the forensic crime thriller, but over the years she has lost her knack of creating &quot;up all night&quot; reads, she is trying to balance too much in each novel, and at times it takes away from the main theme of the book. The story line is interesting in this new book, and the characters are all likable, but we want more page-turning plot twists.If you are a fan of the series, you will enjoy this book, new readers should start off with one of her earlier novels, such as &quot;All That Remains&quot;, &quot;Cruel And Unusual&quot;, &quot;The Body Farm&quot;, etc.Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Once again I am drawn in to Kay Scarpetta's world by the fascinating details of forensic science. But with with each novel I am finding the chief character increasingly annoying, self-centered and and one-dimensional. When the story strays from the police procedural stuff I find myself wading through the worst kind of melodrama involving Kay, her murdered lover and everyone surrounding her. I mean, can anyone read the dialogue between Dr. Scarpetta and Talley (at the Paris restaurant) without gagging or giggling. The whole issue of how Kay faces adversity is treated by the author without the slightest hint of (intentional) humor or irony. The book is extremely joyless. How could someone with no coping mechanisms stand to be a medical examiner at all?Tne major flaw of the book, and one that occurs in several of Cornwell's novels, is that the eventual capture of the serial killer has very little to do with the following of forensic clues to expose the criminal. Rather, once again, the villain is undone by his obsessive need to go after the Chief Medical Examiner herself, and is defeated in hand to hand combat by our heroine. Won't these guys ever learn?"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was starting to feel that the Kay Scarpetta series was getting a little tired. But, my roommate bought Black Notice, and I decided to go ahead and read it. On the whole, it is a fairly good book. The strange victim with a strange tattoo found with strange hairs starts the book off. The primary plot revolves around this death, and becomes a little too fantastic (Who's Afraid of Virginia's Wolf?) . However, the book is saved by having a subplot involving what appears to be a new nemesis for Dr. Scarpetta: a strong woman Deputy Police Chief, attempting to shake up the department and Marino, Kay's close police friend, and Scarpetta herself. Ultimately, these two seemingly divergent plots must come together.I have read all the books in this series, yet I will not profess to understanding all the complex personalaties and relationships in the primary characters. Therefore, if you are thinking of delving into this series, try the earlier books first.The secondary plot, which almost becomes primary, and solid writing help make up for an odd story and a weak ending. Furthermore, Patricia Cornwell attempts to throw some things in the mix to keep interest, such as the question of &quot;Is Benton really dead?&quot;.My suggestion: Read the book and enjoy, but don't analyze it."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I just finished reading Black Notice and am so upset with Cornwell that I had to sit down here and write out my review to exorcise my negative thoughts as quickly as possible.First of all, I really am enjoying reading Cornwell's series. I think that she very well might have the best mystery/thriller series out there today. If you have yet to pick up one of her books I would implore you to do so without hesitation. You should start towards the beginning of this series and follow the development of the characters even though it is not essential to enjoy yourself here. The quality of Cornwell's writing is so high that it will more than suffice in winning you over.I'd been feeling that Cornwell had drawn herself into a corner with her series up to this book. She has been having an on-going involvement with a serial killer team that dragged across so many books that it was becoming a little tiresome. So when I started this book, I found myself filled with an unexpected excitement as Cornwell seemingly instigated a new level to her story composition with the introduction of great internal strife with in the medical examiners offices. When you read these pages, I promise you that you will find yourself riveted to the story as it unfolds.I am so mad because this book clicked along perfectly for a good 70% of its first pages, then it stumbled a little and got a little hokey as Scarpetta and Marino traveled to Paris. But it still remained a very fine book. But the ending... my god Cornwell, how can you take such a fine achievement and desecrate it in such a predictable and uninspired manner? I won't give the ending away here. If you have read Cornwell in the past you will see exactly why this ending is so lazy on her part. Compare it to other endings Cornwell has given to us in the past and then tell me that it is not becoming a very tired gimmick on the author's part.So all of that aside, I would love to give this book the five stars it should deserve."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I liked a lot the two or three first books of Patricia Cornwell with this unusual new character, Kay Scarpetta. Pete Marino and Lucy were also well described second roles and the serial killers involved in the stories very disturbing. I was then pretty sure that Patricia Cornwell would become one of the major crime stories writers of the years to come. But with books and years passing by, I realized that I was wrong : Patricia Cornwell is a one-and-only idea writer. And the soup, more and more salted, isn't digestible anymore.So, like in the precedent Cornwell books, we have in BLACK NOTICE a serial killer on the loose, Lucy with a new girl-friend, rain and snow in Virginia ( is there such a season as spring downthere anyway ? ), a bad guy among Scarpetta employees ( this is not a spoiler, it is a recurrent theme in Cornwell's books ), pizzas and soups cooked by Kay, a deficient alarm system, Mercedes, three showers a day for Kay, a computer related subplot and a lot of scientific terms in order to remind us that Scarpetta is a doctor after all.So, if you are interested in discovering what is all the fuss about Patricia Cornwell, I strongly suggest that you read her first books and leave this one for later if you are still curious.A book zone the Return of the Son of the Mummy."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"A new Scarpetta title by Patricia Cornwell never fails to get my pulse humming. I dove into Black Notice confident that I would be adding it to my collection of all the other previous Scarpetta books in the series. Having finished it, I am deflated. Although it held my interest in the early chapters, with Cornwell's as-usual meticulous attention to forensic detail, the story falters mid-way and never seems to get back on track. This installment suffers noticably from the absence of Benton Westley, who was a calming, stabilizing eye for the hurricane of relentless activity that is Dr. Kay. I have not forgiven Cornwell yet for her lapse in judgement in killing him off, and am hoping against hope that she may find a way to resurrect him in the next book. Black Notice also suffers from an overly-ambitious scope, as Kay and Marino find themselves, incongruously, in Paris, chasing a serial killer for Interpol. Oh, yes--the killer. The resolution in this book is by far the weakest yet. After creating the most, uh, UNIQUE, perpetrator of crime since the maple-syrup guy in Postmortem--remember him?--Cornwell devotes exactly one page, the next-to-last, to his appearance and capture. After building the reader up for hundreds of pages, she leads us to expect a spectacular confrontation with the monster--and lets it drop with all the drama of soggy macaroni. It's as if, mid-chapter, she got tired and decided to quit right there. As a multiple-award winning author, she should know better. Her editors should know better. The reader expects, and deserves, a more satisfying payoff than the one she delivers in this book. We have also come to expect a more pscychologically complex villian than the one she delivers here. Scarpetta's nemesis, Diane Bray, is only a secondary character, but she is a much more interesting brand of evil than the one whodunit in this story. Temple Gault he most certainly is not, nor Carrie Grethen, either. One could almost deem him a childish creation, the cop-out of a tired author hell-bent on getting her 10th installment out. He might have retained our interest and even our sympathy if he had been given more humanity. As it is, he is as crudely sketched as a cartoon.I would hold up any other book in the Scarpetta series as ample proof that Cornwell deserves all those awards she's received. However, &quot;Black Notice&quot; falls far short of the high mark she has previously set for herself, and we have come to expect. Dr. Kay is truly a unique creation, and a role model to aspire to, but she deserves better than this. Maybe it's time for her, and Cornwell to retire and go on to more wholesome pursuits."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Cornwell's latest Kate Scarpetta crime novel, Black Notice, is so bad one would like to think it was a parody or perhaps written by an untalented Cornwell doppelganger from a parallel universe. The usual characters are there: Virginia CME Kate Scarpetta, her lesbian niece, Lucy (now working undercover for the ATF), and Richmond Police Captain Pete Marino. But they are not themselves. Marino's behavior is so erratic and clownish he is no longer believable as a smart chief detective. Scarpetta's emotional strum und drang is deafening; rage, grief, remorse, and fear played at an unremitting triple forte. Lucy's chronic case of attitude seems to have turned into something darker. The spirit of FBI profiler Benton Wesley, a stalwart in earlier Cornwell books, looms over Black Notice like the ghost in Hamlet. Perhaps his death has driven his friends mad. The book opens with a US Senator delivering a posthumous farewell letter to Scarpetta from Wesley which concludes, &quot;I ask you to do one thing for me to celebrate a life we've had that I know will never end. Call Marino and Lucy. Invite them over for dinner tonight. Cook one of your famous meals for them and save a place for me&quot;. This last supper takes place, but it can't transubstantiate dross into a satisfying novel. And Wesley, despite hints to the contrary, does not rise from the dead. Besides the loss of her sometime lover, Kate has to deal with mysterious subversion in her office, a serial killer who calls himself &quot;the werewolf&quot;, and a new female Deputy Chief of Police who does a pretty fair impression of one. Lucy is trying to shut down a gun-smuggling operation in Florida. AND IT'S ALL CONNECTED! No wonder everyone is parnoid. Even the US Senator says darkly (as well as tritely) that he has received &quot;veiled threats&quot; about his friendship with Scarpetta. Cornwell's ear for dialogue has turned to tin. Her characters either lapse into stilted banalities, as in the scene between Kate and the Senator, or else they emote endlessly and operatically at one another. Marino tells off Lucy, Scarpetta tells off Lucy. Scarpetta tells off an employee. Marino tells off his boss. Scarpetta and Marino tell off each other ad nauseum. Even minor characters speak unplausibly. Kate and Marino are summoned to Interpol headquarters in France because of their werewolf (loup garou) investigation. There Secretary General Mirot, &quot;an imposing, gray-haired man&quot; uses the American slang, &quot;not hardly&quot;, and his assistant, cosmopolitan, Harvard- educated hunk Jay Talley, says &quot;Kate, we need you to prove...&quot; Are we in Lyon, Toto, or Kansas? The plot has its share of unplausibility too. The reader is asked to believe that only the dysfunctional duo from Richmond can help Interpol solve a sticky crime conspiracy of its own in France. It seems that the CME of France will only pass on evidence (illegally) about the French loup garou murders to Kate, whom she met once at a coference years before. To strain our credulity even further, it turns out that Dr Stvan, the CME, has had a close encounter with the werewolf herself. Maintaining the symmetry, Kate tells off the hunk Talley. Then they leap into bed. It is a short leap from there back to Richmond where all the plot threads are wound up in hurried fashion. It is only fair to report that the forensic details in Black Notice are as intricate and interesting as in past Cornwell books, but contribute little or nothing to solving the case. And you can't hang out in the lab forever. Sooner or later you have to come out and face those crazy people who used to be your favorite forensic-procedure detectives."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"There was little original in this book. The subplot of a power struggle that involves the sabotage of Kay's career by computer- was straight out of Postmortem. Kay's identifying a genetic disorder in the villian by a description of how he smells, straight out of Postmortem again. The final showdown as the killer invades Kay's home aftr she stupidly opens the door- straight out of Body of Evidence. And pretty close to the final scene in Postmortem. Frankly, its an insult to the readers memories- the only new thing here is the younger man/older woman romance and thats a pretty minor part of the book since the character development of the man is so shallow. Don't waste your time reading this, Postmortem tells the same story but does an infinitely better job. In that book the characers are fairly well developed and likable, here all the characters are just pale shadows of their incarnations in previous works."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Ordinarily, I don't cheer the demise of characters in a book, but I thought that this first Kay Scarpetta novel in the &quot;post-Benton Wesley&quot; era would be a throwback to Patricia Cornwell's first novels in this series. The premise was excellent: a body is discovered in the bowels of a cargo ship with the words &quot;loup garou&quot;. Any baby boomer who ever watched Zacherley on &quot;Shock Theater&quot; or any generation X-er who ever saw &quot;Elvira&quot; could tell you that &quot;loup garou&quot; means werewolf. A case involving a serial killer that takes our heroine Kay to the shores of Europe and the office of interpol. Our intrigue-juices were just salivating. Save your appetite, my friend, there's no meal here.I did not like this book because the plot line that I mentioned only accounts for about 1/4 of the book. The remainder of it depicts the deterioration and assasination (almost) of the characters that aided Kay Scarpetta so well throughout this series. This is done through a weak and stereotypical subplot involving new deputy chief Diane Bray. Kay Scarpetta is no longer the extremely intelligent, razor sharp medical examiner who finds the narrowest thread of a clue that helps catch the bad guy. She is now a shell of what she once was. It started a few novels ago, but she hits rock bottom in this one. Benton Wesley was a sharp, intelligent, well educated, well dressed, FBI guru. Think Efrem Zimbalist on the inside, maybe Harrison Ford on the outside. Yet when he and Kay became lovers their characters became completely unbelievable. &quot;Oh, Kay, we shouldn't do this&quot; &quot;Oh Benton, I know we shouldn't&quot;. Then they promptly jump in the sack like two alley cats. They're both too smart for this. So, I thought with Benton out of the picture (hence my title), things might go back to the way they were. No such luck. Pete Marino used to be the street smart cop whose blue collar, Bogart-like personality, used to play beautifully with the clean, well educated Scarpetta. Not anymore. Marino is now an overweight, stagnant, cardiological time bomb. He has no creativity and his character is falling onto the junk pile of life. Lucy, Kay's niece, has been reduced as well. While struggling with her own sexual identifiaction, Lucy has turned from an intelligent young woman into a gal who would &quot;out-macho&quot; any guy this side of John Wayne. She is a helicopter pilot, computer jock, ammunitions expert, and she packs a revolver in her shoe. Come on. Still, Ms. Cornwell has an intriguing character in Lucy, but she insists on hitting the reader over the head with a &quot;lesbianism is ok&quot; mallet as Lucy wrestles with her sexual orientation. I want to say, ok, already, I agree with you. Everytime this happens, I can hear Jerry Seinfeld saying, &quot;.......not that there's anything wrong with that.&quot;If you're new to Kay Scarpetta, skip this one. Go to Patrica Cornwell's first novels in this series. Meet the Kay Scarpetta of &quot;Postmortem&quot; and &quot;All That Remains&quot;. I liked her (and those novels) a lot better. If your library is short on those books then try an author named Kathy Reichs, who will introduce you to the &quot;Canadian Kay Scarpetta&quot;, Tempe Brennan. Take this review as black notice on &quot;Black Notice&quot;"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"It's December in Richmond when a cargo ship is found to have the decomposing body of a stowaway on board, in a locked container. Chief Medical Examiner, Kay Scarpetta is called to the scene and personally conducts the autopsy finding a strange tatoo and blond animal-like hairs covering the body. A few days later, the same peculiar hair is found on a murdered store clerk. So begins Black Notice, Ms Cornwell's tenth Scarpetta mystery/thriller. This time, Kay follows the clues from Richmond to Interpol headquarters, Paris and back home again, to solve the case, in the deaths of these two unrelated people. But that's not all...she's having a personal crisis over the death of her lover, Benton Wesley, her niece Lucy is having all kinds of personal and work related problems and a new deputy chief is wreaking havoc with Kay's professional life. Patricia Cornwell has written a novel chock full of sometimes confusing story lines that finally come together for an unfortunately weak and predictable ending. The writing is tense and at times very compelling, but the story often gets bogged down in detail and seems more far-fetched than realistic or riveting. And her characters have become one dimensional, difficult to care about and uninteresting. All in all, not one of Ms Cornwell's best efforts. If you are new to this series, start with her terrific earlier books, Postmortem or Body of Evidence. If you're a Kay Scarpetta fan, do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am really sorry some of the readers &quot;did not get it&quot;... Once I read one of her books I was hooked, and had to devour the rest. Of course,being a Lab Tech, I am biased. The author's thorough descriptions of the investigative process (e.g. autopsies, Toxicology and Forensic testing, just to name a few)are things I deal with on a daily basis, and fascinating to read about. Kudos to the author for doing her homework, unlike others who think the readers can be fooled into believing anything they make up! A hint for those that were a bit confused...read the rest of the books on the &quot;Scarpetta series&quot;, in order. To answer one of your other reviewer's question: Yes, Marino has a thing for the good Dr! As for her relationship with Lucy, read the whole series, and you will see that having the mother this girl has, it's a miracle she's not a psycopath herself..."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am still trying to figure this whole thing out. Was this book supposed to be about a crime-solving mystery or whiny soap opera with a mixture of Days of Our Lives and Melrose Place mixed in together? There was so much WHINING and relationship problems in this book that it drove me crazy! This book does not live up to all of the other Scarpetta novels at all. Here are my suggestions to Mrs. Cornwell- Kill that little annoying niece Lucy, have Mrs. Scarpetta stop whining and blabbering about poor Benton and stop making Marino look like a stupid drunk. I certainly hope &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; is better than this novel!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"While I was rather disappointed in &quot;Point of Origin&quot;, I rather enjoyed &quot;Black Notice&quot;.Patricia Cornwell is always exemplary in her extensive research. I don't think that I have ever read an author that researches her subject matter as thoroughly as Ms. Cornwell.I was very pleased that Ms. Cornwell continued her character development in this book.I was pleased with the introduction of a new character that I am sure we will see in future books featuring Dr. Kay Scarpetta.Bottom line - I was much more please with this offering than with her last &quot;Scarpetta&quot; novel. I recommend it for any fan."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The reader reviews are more entertaining and sometimes better written than the book.I got hung up on details like the license plate number on pp 132-133, and the proofreading was bad. But the book read like a cartoon, reminding me of A Man in Full. Southern cartoon characters. Plot? What plot? She got a free ride to France to have the villain handed to her? &quot;Oh yeah, we knew all about him?&quot; I was kind of hoping that Loveable Lucy would just empty her Glock at everyone during the hurry-up conclusion.I also think Talley went after Kay because he was attracted to Lucy and got nowhere. Sloppily written and hopefully not a window into the author's experiences."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"If this were my first Patricia Cornwell book, I would have quit reading a third of the way through. So often editing seems to be a lost art when it comes to well-known authors. (Those of us who read Southern Cross know that for a certainty.) But the Skarpetta series seemed to transcend the numerous aberrations of the Judy Hammer books . . . ah, but not so anymore.Ms. Cornwell, move your stories along. (If you have forgotten how, read the first three or four books in the Skarpetta series for sound ideas.) This one bogged down for practically half the book. Forget department infighting. It's boring and you've done it before. Ditch Lucy, and please do not take this as a homophobic remark as it is not. Little Lucy that we loved and felt sorry for as a child has few redeeming qualities today. Say, you went a bit overboard with the shouted and rude conversations.The Marino that sat in on the VICAP team with Benton and the rest of that group was a top-notch dectective and was generally respectful of where he was. (Yes, he was a little crude, but never to the point that he has become in this book.) He still is a top-notch detective, and he would not have acted so surly during the visit to Interpol. Give him a break now that he (and Skarpetta) must carry the series along. Ditch the colorless (in spite of his extremely dark and handsome looks and, of course, that perfectly sculptured body . . . boy, talk about a cheap romance novel description) Jay Talley. I don't know how you pictured him in your mind, but he came through characterless and verily blah. Would Kay jump into bed with someone she knew for only 15 minutes (all right, a small exaggeration)? I think not! By the by, since when do government agencies use AOL."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have been a big fan of this series, but this book reads like a high school student trying to write a term paper due the next day. The backbiting and soap opera behavior of the characters and the plodding plots make this book extrememly tedious. The only enjoyable parts of the book were the ones dealing with the technical aspects of forensic work. Other descriptive words that come to mind are: depressing, sophmoric, lurching, disjointed and melodramatic. I do hope that this book was just a temporary lapse on the part of Ms. Cornwell and that she will produce something more palatable next time."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta books have been slipping for quite a while, and this one's reached a new nadir. The incredibly tedious, constant bickering between Scarpetta and Marino and the unrelenting hand-wringing about her niece Lucy make this a pathetic wallow. Unfit even for airplane consumption."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Get a life, Dr. Scarpetta! This book takes place a good year after the death of her lover and significant other and she is still moaping around feeling sorry for herself. The story is bad. The plot is poor. The ending not soon enough. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"What is it that Cornwell has against any woman who could be written as strongly as she once wrote Kay? The point of Diane Bray is a mystery to me. (mayhap even the real mystery of this mess) I was only shocked that Dorothy didn't get killed by the werewolf - oh well, there is always the next book. And Anderson - is this some kind of bad lesbian cop - good lesbian cop (Lucy) thing she has going? If you are going to write what I assume she thinks are &quot;avant garde&quot; lesbian characters, at least have the decency to make them more than one dimensional throw aways.. and sadly this category includes Lucy. The decay of Kay is even more accentuated by the weak female characters that Cornwell continues to surround Kay with, even though I believe the author is trying to cloud her weak characterization of her main character by setting up these straw women.Where is Anna when you need her? Both Kay and Lucy could use some serious counselling since buying booze, cigarettes, and guns sure as heck isn't doing the job. Kay's new boy toy is just a joke - and her &quot;wild sex scene&quot; has to be one of the pathetic low points of book... nahh.. that would implicate that there was a high point somewhere.But my MAIN criticism of this book has to be the aol connection. AOL MUST have been the ones to pay for Cornwell to fly the Concorde, because the sheer ridiculousness of having state employees using aol as their network has got to be some kind of inside joke. Please Patsy.. share this with us? Otherwise it's just the high point of stupidity.Is Black Notice worth reading? Yes, since it is obviously setting up the next book. Is it worth buying? No way. The problem is that it is a connective bridge book with little to recomend it other than the fact that it will be a reference for what the readers hope will be a better book.I truly expect more of high profile authors. Unfortunately, this year has shown that for many authors commerce has overshadowed any obligation they had to provide their characters with a good plot and their readers with a good book."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I thought the writing in the first 3/4 of Black Notice was some of the best Cornwell has delivered. The plot was interesting, multi-faceted and believable; and Kay was definitely, to me, a more three-dimensional, realistic and sympathetic character than in the previous Scarpetta novels. But I did find the romance with Talley, which apparently is &quot;still on&quot; at the (non)end of the book highly implausible. Not because Kay couldn't or shouldn't be able to fall in love with another man after having lost Benton, but simply because he seemed too shallow and immature...mainly a pretty face.... to attract someone like her. But the reeeeally big complaint I have about this book is its incredibly abrupt, rushed-up, totally frustrating ending. Honestly, I kept looking to see if some pages were missing from my copy! An author shouldn't treat her readers in such a cavalier fashion. After having developed the story, with lots of fascinating sub-plots, to that point and then to have Dr. Scarpetta (duh!) open the door to someone who *says* he's a policeman (when we all know who's on the other side of the door and anyone with Kay's brains would be more wary), *then* to rush things from that point to an unrealistic, frustrating non-conclusion (obviously meant to whet our appetites for the next book)...these shortcuts on the author's part combined to ruin the book for me and leave me feeling really cheated when I finished it! I think I've decided to wait and look at other readers' comments on the next Cornwell book, rather than pre-ordering a copy of my own."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read every one on Ms. Cornwell's books and I have to say that she has always kept me enthralled. Not this time! Other then the characters being the same I would have to say that this novel was written by someone else. It is possible that she needs to find another cast of characters."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"A relative of mine decided to give this book to me as a gift for Christmas. Unfortunately, I wish she had included the receipt along with it.This was the first novel by Patricia Cornwell that I have read, and the first Kay Scarpetta mystery that I have had the displeasure of wasting time on. To begin with, the book is 400 pages long. A decent size. But Cornwell doesn't really get into the actual mystery until a good 200 pages into the book. Instead, she decides to spend the majority of the book on Kay's personal life, on how Kay is dealing with her lover's death, on her strained relationship with her niece, on her tempestuous friendship with Officer Marino. There's a dead body found down in the dockyards, which isn't too strange except for the odd hair found on the corpse. Soon, women begin to turn up dead, brutally murdered and mutilated, with the same strange hairs upon their bodies. Then there's the whole business with someone tampering with computers in her office (pardon me if I'm mistaken, but does EVERY Scarpetta mystery have to have someone inside her office or associated with her office being some sort of nefarious, backstabbing troublemaker?). And she's being secretly framed as incompetent by her enemies so she'll be fired. Then, to make things really confusing, at a little past the halfway point in the book, she gets sent to Europe with Marino on a &quot;secret mission&quot; to help solve these bizarre murders and identify the killer. While there she becomes romantically involved with an American agent, and....well, to say the least, this book goes in about a thousand directions at once. And they're ALL confusing. When the climax finally comes, it has the sound and fury not of thunderstorm, but of a weak afternoon drizzle.Cornwell seems to be content to spend virtually every sentence focusing on Kay's complicated personal life. How will she get over the death of her soulmate? Does Marino harbor feelings for her? Why is it she has such a difficult time getting along with her bullheaded, policewoman niece? Who is sabotaging her work, and who wants her fired? A better question would be, who really cares? Believe me, after line after endless line of this, it's not the reader.There are a couple bright points. I've always found the technical detail that Cornwell puts into her novels refreshing. I may never become a forensic pathologist myself, but I find it interesting to learn about their techniques and the kind of duties they perform. And the killer has to be one of the most unique I've ever seen in a mystery; of all the maladies that writers have afflicted their villains with, hypertrichosis has to be a first. Unfortunately, Cornwell seems to duplicate some of her earlier work for the finale; the sudden showdown with the killer was eerily similar to the anti-climactic ending of her first Scarpetta novel, &quot;Postmortem&quot;.I think that, after sitting there and reading each and every page--about 400 pages of rambling plot--I can sufficiently classify myself as a masochist. I wish I could say that this book is worth a buy, but I wouldn't even recommend checking it out of your local library and reading it for FREE. Sorry, Scarpetta fans, but this is one mystery best left unsolved."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"After reading 250 pages or so I was thinking to myself, &quot;this is really slow. Everything I've read so far could be summed up in a paragraph or two.&quot; I was expecting something really exciting to happen but as I got to within a few pages of the end I realized I had been let down. It seemed P.C. wanted to end the book in a hurry and just let it go. I prefer Jeffrey Deaver's books. You know with his books you're in for a surprise."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the first time a have read a Cornwell novel. I hope my first time reading her is my worst experience with her novels because I will soon embark on reading three more of her novels.The sub-plots in this work, if they can even be considered sub-plots, add virtually nothing to the story line. And the addition of segments about Ms Scarpettas dead former lover, also add absolutely nothing more than adding pages. In reality these are all put in to thicken the book. If Ms Cornwell were to be honest with us, she woud admit that this \\"novel\\" could have been easily reduced to a short story.The ending is extremely disappointing. We learn nothing of what makes the killer tick. I would suggest that you selct any other novel to read. Don't waste your time on this one.

The plot is structured well enough, perhaps not as ingenious as other books in the series, but I'm glad. It takes so much more skill to NOT be a plot-based writer. It's still there, but the substance of human nature is much more solid. This book shows that Scarpetta isn't a mechanical heroine, rather, she's more human than ever. It's a splendid continuation for those that followed the series in order -- otherwise, I don't know how one can piece the puzzle together."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Contrary to some other reviews, I thought the book was very good. I like how Ms. Cornwell keeps you abreast of the lives of Dr. Scarpetta, Marino and Lucy. I feel like I know these people.

I puchased the audio tape and had it in my tape player before I even started the car for home. I was appaled at the language used in this book. The context of the storyline (which I truly enjoyed) would not have been altered a bit if the profound language would have been left out. I have not. nor will I. pass this on to my mother and I have told her why. I have read everyone of Patricia's books but will think twice before purchasing her next one.

There are so many who found her work long before I did and therefore knew long before me that this woman is a genuine American Treasure. I know I am preaching to the choir but she is so much more than an incredibly gifted writer. She is a teacher, an entertainer, a humanitarian and the list goes on endlessly.

This is also my first Patricia Cornwell book read.Overall, I felt that more suspense can be built into catching this &quot;werewolf&quot; than to circle around sub-plots which seems to make the book tiresome. When I was onto page 255, I almost gave up as our Dr Kay wasn't making much progess in identifying this &quot;werewolf&quot;. The remaining of the pages happened in such a split second, that does not gives me the pleasure of anticipation and excitment (if any, was worn up at page 255). The climax of the book. that is, when the werewolf was capture - 2 to 3 pages? - didn't build up enough suspense to make my money worth..."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've read about 3 or 4 books, including &quot;Black Notice&quot; recently. I'm quite impressed however, everytime I read her books, why is it that Lucy is always some kind of a troubled child. I agree with one of the readers, she's a spoiled brat... Plus I've noticed that to make the story long, there's always the personal problem involved... Oh well, this is only a book but I hope on your next project, it will focus more to the subject of the book, a little bit about her life is okay..."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have been a fan of the Scarpetta novels for years and have read every one.

It's time to do something else."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"In this new--and tired--Kay Scarpetta thriller, Kay's on a case that could ruin her career, or end her life (we could only hope). The story is given a shot of Romance/Horror drivel with a love letter from beyond the grave. Pleeaazzzeee. It's time for Ms. Cornwell to move on to other characters--this series has become stale reading."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"As I said before, this book was so yellowed around the edges of every page. I did contact the seller, but have not heard a word back, which is even worse. The dust jacket has more than just shelf wear. Very disappointed. Patricia Breeze"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I think Patricia Cornwell is an excellent writer and story teller and I like the Scarpetta character, but I think the book would be just as good without all the profanity. It seemed that every other word in this book was profanity."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This was my first Patricia Cornwell book and I could not put it down. I stayed up way to late reading and still could not put it down. I have since purchased all her books I could find.The book was suspenseful and kept me very interested. In regards to the other reviewers who obviously are more familiar with Corwell's work then myself, this was a terrific introduction for me and if what the other reviewers are saying is true (that this was not one of her best books), I may never sleep again.Luckily there are books for everyone and everyone has different opinions, I thought it was terrific and I would and have recommended it to several of my friends and family."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the first time I read Patricia Cornwell, and judging from the cover (which said &quot;New York Times Bestseller) I figured it couldn't be that bad. I was quite disappointed, however, by the lack of realistic plot, cheap characters and some kind of personal vindiction the author feels against beautiful women. I don't like putting books down but this one book you can stop from buying."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I thought this book was great. It was my 1st Patricia Cornwell novel, and i was pleasantly surprised. Now my goal is to read all of her novels! I also just finished her 1st novel, Postmortem. It was an excellent read as well! I believe that all mystery lovers will absolutely adore this novel because I did!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Wild and unmotivated emotional reactions! Loose ends! Illogical behavior! Now, you too can read a case study for a Jr. High 'criticism of literature' course. Wish I new who wrote the early Scarpetta novels. They were pretty good. Maybe this is a warning of what happens when you're successful."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Maybe I have read one too many of Cornwell's books but I did not find Black Notice as compelling as previous Cornwell titles. Kay Scarpetta too self absorbed and parts of this book were far too unbelievable. The story line and characters have lost some of their original appeal."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read almost all of Cornwall's book's and found this one to not be very exciting. The depressing mood and the lack of any exciting events made me want to stop reading it several times. However, I finished it only to be extremely irritated by the ending. Maybe the next one will be back to Cornwall's usual standards."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"..but coming to rest in a good tying up of ends for Kay Scarpetta.. Comfy familiars Porky Pete, Lucy (toughening up nicely) and all the gang back again, Kay nesting with a freshie, opening up the old Wesley place - why do people think it's depressing? I was picked right up by all this.Phallic object Jay Talley seems a little like a character not quite developed. His lack of reaction to the somewhat impromptu liaison with Kay brings to mind - by contrast - &quot;A Cat's Full Nine&quot;'s Virgil's shattering of the rapturous postcoital reverie he shares with Excelencia Pola Sabine de Otho with the atstonishing testimonial: &quot;Gosh, Your Grace, that was the best piece I ever had!&quot;Let's hope Jay lives to grow up and has better luck surviving than Kay's others."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"BLACK NOTICE is a &quot;page turner&quot;, but it seems the language is getting out of the bounds of decency. It shouldn't be necessary to use foul language to sell a good mystery story. With the exception of HORNET'S NEST and SOUTHERN CROSS, I've enjoyed all of Cornwell's books. This one was not as good as the others, and that was partially due to the characters becoming more shallow--maybe a bit *too* human! Merino needs to take control of his life and not be so sloppy and foul mouthed, and as far as I'm concerned, in her next book she can dispense with Lucy! And--I hope we've seen the last of Talley."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book was not as graphic as some of the others, but, no situations are the same. We need to know that Dr. Scarpetta is a real person dealing with real grief. Sometimes job situations tend to be forgotten about in our grief, just as Kay's did. The &quot;werewolf&quot; explanation was a little out there, but, maybe it was useful in the coming out of one's shell and bringing everything to the surface. Patrica Cornwell is an excellent author, who's brilliance shines through intrigue and suspense.I look forward to reading the next Kay Scarpetta novel. Keep up the good work, Patricia!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I keep wanting to like these books. I don't. Kay is not a likeable person. Marino is not a likeable person (is he even a person?). Lucy is the personification of a snotty brat. Who is the winner?"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"&quot;Black Notice&quot; involves you into a world of gothic belief in a modern day society. Bewildering the mind, with personal feelings concerning everyday job life. Consuming the weak and emotionally disturbed into a web of looking at life in a different way. She spells out grief in for the romantic lost loves. And leaves us all breath-takingly involved. The book is page turning and I couldn't put it down, being a 20 year old it caught my eye and I recommend it to anyone intersted in mystery, in my age group.."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I had been anticipating this book for months. It starts outgood but the ending is always the same. It feels like she runs out oftime and has 3 pages to end the book. The language is somewhat foul. The pro-gay themes are getting excessive. Perhaps the writer should separate her issues from her books. When Scarpetta comes out of the closet it will be the end of the story line."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've been a fan of Patricia Cornwell for years and waited anxiously for this book to arrive. Unlike her previous Kay Scarpetta stories however, this one never really grabbed my interest and too many questions were left unanswered. Why was Bray out to do her in, how did the &quot;werewolf&quot; happen upon the Inspector. Detective Marino and Lucy were such peripheral characters in this story that I was disappointed. Everyone knows Lucy is an ace with computers. She could have taken care of the e-mail bug post-haste, but no she's relegated to shooting bad guys in Florida. I finished the book but would have a hard time giving it any more than 4 stars."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was glad to see the return of the Kay Scarpetta character, but the story never really grabbed me at all and I knew the guy was at the door way before she did. I stuck it out to the end hoping there would be some twist, but nothing. I have read all of her books and sorry to say, I am ready to move on. I felt like Patricia Cornwell wrote the story without her heart and soul."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Scarpetta fans alert! This is one to avoid at all costs. This is a scattered plot that is all over the map. I feel Cornwall must have been under a contract deadline with this one. Never cared for the Lucy/Aunt Kay filler and this time its really at its worst. The romance interest falls flat too. A lot of descriptive gore that really goes nowhere. Thumbs way down!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Yes I enjoyed this one and read it within a day or two of picking it up from the bookstore, but there is something missing. I had a hard time getting into this series. I bought one, made myself read it and then didn't read another until Potter's Field which made me go back and read all the ones I'd missed. I couldn't believe Benton was murdered last time and I feel that Kay should be able to deal with the situation in a better manner than she has been doing. I guess I don't want my fiction to mirror reality quite so closely. Don't deal lightly with tragedies, but don't dwell on them either. Deal with it and then get on with life - it doesn't wait for you.Any way - read this so you have the background to enjoy the next one in the series which I hope will return to better days and more intrigue."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"After Ms. Cornwell's previous two books, Black Notice was at least an escape to her best protagonist, Kay Scarpetta. Ms. Cornwell is at her best with her medical knowledge and interesting twists on the &quot;ghastly murder&quot; themes. However, in her previous two novels, she has had a bitter and negative approach, and her characters didn't seem to come alive. In Black Notice, she is somewhat back to form, but the negativity still comes through in her treatment of characters. I always look forward to her books, but hope she gets her own life better under control. It appears to me that the author is militantly feminist, and quite probably, lesbian. I really don't care, but she needs to be careful not to let her own prejudices show through. Kay Scarpetta has the makings of a fascinating, multi-faceted character, whom the reader might like to get to know...if the author didn't keep antagonizing everyone."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Once again, Patricia Cornwell has released a riveting, on the edge of your seat mystery. In her latest work, Black Notice, she focused more on the private lives of the characters instead of just the murder case. This is a great new tactic because every case is basically the same, and it is the conflicts between Kay and the people around her that bring the reader back for more. Personally, I can not wait to see her next Kay installment in the bookstores. It is sure to be a thriller just like all of the rest."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Unfortunately for Patricia Cornwell fans, she appears to have run out of fresh ideas for plots involving Kay Scarpetta. This time it seems plausible that Cornwell's publisher wanted a book by a certain date so she delivered. Too bad, because the plot is poor, geographic details are inaccurate, character development is non-existant, and the dialogue is frenetic. For anyone who has grown to care about Kay, Lucy and Marino and who cried at Benton's demise, do yourself a favor: pass on Black Notice."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was very excited to start reading Black Notice, but as once I started I was very disappointed with it. I usually love all of Patricia Cornwell's books. This book had potential to be a great book but it went down hill with the more you read. The ended was a major disappointment."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"It seems as if the author has gotten lazy over the last few Scarpetta books. The characters have become really annoying. This book was not enjoyable. Disappointing since the early books were so good."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is so loosely written, so disjointed, so poorly edited for both grammar and flow, with conversational lines that start nowhere and end in exactly the same place, one has to wonder if Cornwell owes the higher quality of her previous work to an outstanding editor."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the last Cornwell book that I will buy. Her last few Scarpetta novels have been heavy on the personal angst of her continuing characters, and VERY light on the mystery and suspense. If I want to read about lost loves, dysfunctional family relationships and May/December romances I will buy a Jackie Collins or Danielle Steele novel. Out of 315 pages, about 200 plus are devoted to Kay and all her troubled relationships, and less than 100 to the &quot;loup garou&quot;. The ending is so predictable and perfunctory, I had to force myself to read the last 15 pages. For those of you who like to read suspense novels featuring a continuous character, I recommend John Sandford or Dennis Lehayne. They both are still putting the suspense aspect of their novels first, instead of dwelling on the histrionics of annoying characters, like Ms. Cornwell. I'm sorry Kay, but this is it for me."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This much awaited edition of the Kay Scarpetta series was a little farfetched but still worth the time &amp; energy to read. I couldn't put it down like all of her other books. The ending was a bit forced and leaves you wishing for a more developed and more plausible ending. Hopefully the characters will all get it together after this novel. They are all still grieving over Benton. It's time to move on. Obviously Kay did! Now it's time for Marino &amp; Lucy to do the same. Hopefully the next book will find the three doing less bickering and more crime fighting!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is OK...I've read all of hers, and they are tending to become much the same...In this one, her government office uses AOL as an email client...that is ridiculous...would never happen..."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"When Amazon.com notified me that Patricia Cornwell had written a new book starring Kay Scarpetta, I ordered it immediately. Bad decision! Kay is permanently pms-ing. Marino is hopelessly destroying himself. Lucy needs to go away (far away!). The story line is sappy - not scary or mysterious.I continued to read the book because I felt that Ms. Cornwell was setting us up for the return of Wesley. I expected at any time that he was killed-off to go undercover to hunt down this were-wolf out of the Paris office, and that when Kay got to Paris and went to the Interpol building, there to meet her would be Wesley. At least, I thought, that would make her quit moping around, finding fault with everyone and everything. No such luck. Kay Scarpetta needs to take another job. Maybe a new city, new co-workers, new police department, and new crime scenes would put some of the old umph back into her mysteries. Come on, Patricia Cornwell, WAKE UP! Your readers aren't fools. This one made the best seller's list on your reputation. Don't push it!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Did anyone find that the regular characters didn't seem to be &quot;in character&quot;? They all seemed to be cruder and less subtle than in the past. Perhaps it's all that curt dialogue. Much less of those seductive details and descriptions of place and people and food and clothes that say so much about Kay's emotional state.Also, it is missing connections. How did Kay and Marino decide that Bray was involved in the Kay's bogus email and chats? How come the chat was called Dear Chief Kay and later Kay tells Bray that is called Dear Dr. Kay?In the effort to create a new nemesis for Kay, how could have such a totally ridiculous character like Bray be promoted to such a prominent position? But then, I won't get into Cornwell's underlying premise in her books, that women in power are worse than men....Of course, all this didn't keep me from compulsively reading the book, like all her others."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I like mysteries that pay attention to and develop their characters' individual psychology. However, in novels so constructed, a delicate balance must be struck between character development and plot. This is difficult, and in this regard, Cornwell is now completely out of kilter.At the beginning of this series, Kay Scarpetta was an intelligent, dedicated, principled, if somewhat rigid professional woman made a trifle paranoid by her cautionary experiences in a &quot;man's world,&quot; and Cornwell's early Scarpetta novels were excellent -- balanced, focused, and plot-driven. However, her inability to provide Scarpetta with a believable personality, any insight, or sense of either humor or irony has become increasingly obvious as the series has continued. I hope that Scarpetta is not autobiographical or some sort of idealized role model for Cornwell, because I find myself wanting to scream, &quot;Kay, stop being so uptight and sanctimonious and GET SOME HELP! You've become a total prig!&quot;Cornwell herself certainly seems to be more fascinated with her characters than she has any good reason to be. Kay is not a person whom I would cultivate as a friend; poor Marino has been turned into an unpleasant caricature of Fred Flintstone; neither Mark nor Benton were ever particularly compelling characters; and Lucy is a blight on the landscape (Good God -- all this because she's got an inattentive mother? ) Why the development and perpetuation of all these negative, codependent relationships anyway? At this point I feel rather like a voyeur, because I strongly suspect that I'm really reading about a very self-obsessed author's life, and I'm frankly just not that interested.As for the characters unique to this installment, the Loup Garou is completely one-dimensional. Yet he is arguably the character that should be the focus of the story (as he would be were, say, John Sandford to write this book). I had the whole trite subplot involving Bray, Anderson, and Ruffin figured out almost immediately. As for Talley -- a 30-year-old cultured Harvard graduate millionaire sexual (gay? again?) naif who falls for a middle-aged medical examiner he's barely met? Give me a break! Finally, I am thoroughly weary of both the homosexual issues and innuendoes and the steamy sex scenes more worthy of Jackie Collins. These plot devices are merely distracting and irritating, while adding nothing to good plot development.Cornwell would do her readers a big favor if she would write a psychiatrist into the next novel and have Kay, Lucy, et al start MEANINGFUL long-term therapy. Better yet, maybe Cornwell should collaborate with Nevada Barr -- Kay and Anna Pigeon (with Marino and Frederick, of course) can solve a li'l old mystery, and Molly Pigeon can retire on the related psychiatric problems!Oh, I almost forgot. The story? Better than the last two (when you're actually treated to a few paragraphs thereof), but that's not really saying much. Do as I did, and get it from the library."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I just don't get all of the negative reviews here. I guess it is a good thing I don't read them first. I've been reading the Kay Scarpetta series in order, and find this book in some ways better than the previous ones. It is best if you have read Point of Origin first, and ideally all of the other books in the series. This book is pivotal in the character development of Kay I believe. She is not the strong, clear thinking superwoman that she has been in the previous books. The woman is grieving, and fighting it all of the way. It has been a year since Benton's death, or should I say his massacre, and the way she has acted and feels is all too familiar for those who have lost someone so close to them, especially if you have regrets about the time you spent with them.Tied into all of this is a dead body found in a shipping container on a cargo ship that is unidentified and way into the decomposition process. The details are graphic. Marino and Lucy are also dealing with Benton's death in their own ways, and a central ingredient to that grief process is anger and what people do with that emotion.Maybe people don't like this book because Kay has changed. I like it for that reason. People change and evolve. I don't like the same old formula repeated over and over again in a series book. In Cornwell's series, her characters are flawed and troubled, nobody is perfect...kind of like this human condition we live in."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"...if this is disappointing to loyal readers. I liked the first couple of Kay Scarpetta books, but I hadn't read any for a while because they seemed to go down in quality. I finally picked this one up and it's probably the last I'll ever read. I still think that Cornwell has talent, but she apparently didn't feel up to coming up with anything new or worthwhile. This book is primarily about Kay and her private life; only rarely is the &quot;mystery&quot; (a hunt for a particularly vicious serial killer) brought up. I didn't like many of her characters much to begin with, but they've turned into charicatures of themselves now. Marino has become a loathsome bigotted low-class piece of dirt, and Lucy is a crazed lesbian who wants to destroy the world. If you care what happens to Lucy, Marino, Rose, and especially Scarpetta, you probably should read this. To me, it was far too melodramatic and whiny; Scarpetta is to wrapped up in her life to be of any interest, and the rest of the characters were repellent or boring."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"What was wrong with this book? Only one thing I don't like about her books is she constantly covers the past of all of her characters in almost every book. It's probably good for new readers, but for readers who read her since the beginnng, it gets a little annoying. I thought this was a very cool story.From the start this book just keeps on gaining momentum in the classic Scarpetta tradition. The book opens with a body found in a shipping cargo box on the docks. Then Scarpetta's neice, Lucy, is involved in misshap down in Florida when one of her undercover operations goes bad. In her office, her staff members keep complaining of missing items, wierd e-mails from her, and her not getting back with people. And with Christmas around the corner, thoughts of Benton are stil fresh in her mind. To top it all off, there is a new Chief in town, Diane Bray, and she is looking to get rid of Scarpetta after she has already demoted Pete Marino from a detective. With the murders in Richmond piling up, she gets summoned overseas to discover the same MO over there. Alot of stuff going on at the same time that eventually leads up to alot of surprises and an exiting ending that doesn't really end as you will find out when you buy &quot;The Last Precinct&quot;. This is basically a 2 part story (so far as I know right now). If you miss out by not reading this, you are really missing out."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Reading one of her books gives me the choice to enjoy her style of writing (which is wonderfully rich in prose and descriptive passage) and wanting to reach for Prozac....could her characters get any gloomier? If I were Kay Scarpetta I'd turn the scapel on myself, Lucy should just join the SLA and fat old Marino just collapse from overused arteries....none of them have a good day, a good meal, a juicy relationship ...it's just one miserable moment after another.....come on!! Please!! Let these characters enjoy their life to some degree...each new book is purchased by me wtih the hope that Patricia will turn their lives around and let the characters have some quality of life....I've just about read my last chapter in these lives...it's simply too depressing."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Amen to reviewer D. Miller! Disappointing. I can believe that Captain Marino remains emotionally stuck in the mud, but I can't believe the improbable villains, or that the Scarpetta character becomes increasingly emotionally fragile, rather than more mature. This growing immaturity seems the chief driving force of the plot, and just doesn't make sense."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Read the Scarpetta books in sequence. Not only is it important for continuity of plot and character development, but the earlier entries in the series are better. This review assumes you have done so -- the rating is two stars as a standalone book.Black Notice opens strongly. Cornwell does the best crime-scene description of any author I've read. And, as virtually all reviewers point out, her description of forensic medicine is striking.However, as this book progresses, it becomes mired in Scarpetta's self-absorption. Cornwell tries to transcend the genre in which she demonstrated such skill in her early books, yet in so doing neglects it. This would be fine if the study in grief were especially believable or insightful, but it instead approaches being maudlin, excessive.As the book approaches its finish, the social developments seem better suited to pulp romance fiction. As the thread wears on, the remaining pages dwindle, leaving precious little space to conclude the principal plot.While the finish is certainly better than that of Point of Origin, it is nevertheless lacking. And as is the trend in her books, the end comes quite suddenly. Too suddenly. It's as if, during coverage of a baseball game, the screen goes blank the instant the winning home run ball crosses the threshold of the fence. Game over.Will I read the next book in the series? I've read them all, in order, to this point, so probably. But I have no problem waiting until the end of 2001, when it comes out in paperback."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell's books, while not great literature, are still somewhat enjoyable to me. Not so with this one. The plot is absurd, the characters anoying, and the ending very abrupt. Do yourself a favor and buy one of her other stories."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of the Scarpetta series and many other books that Cornwell has written. I am a writer of murder mysteries myself and hope that I have her talent. Prior to buying 'Black Notice' I thought hard about it as I was a bit hesistant based on the reviews of other customers. Now after having read it twice I believe that yes there was some deterioration of the plot, but it seemed only a momentary flicker before she got right back on track. I won't disclose the ending, but contrary to what I had been led to think by other readers, it does come to a believable and complete conclusion. Yes some of her earlier books in this series were better, but the Scarpetta character as well as Lucy are true to form."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"When the author of a favorite series dies, favorite characters also die, leaving a void that's not easy to fill. But one can always reread the old books and enjoy the stories and the characters again.What has happened to the Kay Scarpetta series is worse than the author ceasing to write. With each recent novel, and especially with Black Notice, the main characters (Kay, Lucy, Marino) have become so loathsome and the plots so unengaging that I can't imagine wanting to revisit the earlier novels. These are unpleasant people and I will not miss them."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I bought the audio version of this book - I'm 3 tapes down - and I keep asking myself if I've already read it. I came to Amazon.com to make sure this was Patricia Cornwell's latest book. Nothing in Black Notice is very original. It's all a repeat of Postmortem and Body of Evidence. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"As an avid Scarpetta reader, I was disappointed with Black Notice. There were too many subplots with the characters, and I found that the main plot of the book (i.e., trailing the &quot;werewolf&quot;) was virtually put aside until the midpoint of the book. The climax of the book was anticlimatic, and ill-contrived. Please bring back the strong, tough Scarpetta that we all love!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this novel especially since it was so anticipated. I felt that Kay was very whiney, Lucy is going out of control and Marino is just unbelievable. I also did not get even a tiny thrill of fear throughout the entire book. I hope her next book is more along the lines of the classic Kay Scarpetta that I have come to enjoy."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"this is my first go-round with ms. cornwell, and it won't be my last. i found this to be a real page-turner, and i looked foward to reading it in bed each night. i've read the complaints of those who have read her other books (that this is one of her lesser efforts,) but as an introduction to her work, i found it completely satisfying."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"What starts out as a reasonably intriguing mystery spins out of control over the final hundred pages or so, into a ridiculous ending. Lucy (AKA supergirl) & her new gal G.I. Jo are trying to shut down a gun-smuggling operation down in Florida & somehow it's all connected to the case back in VA. Isn't that amazing... Then we have Scarpetta and Marino flying off to Paris to meet w/ an Interpol agent & only Scarpetta can help Interpol solve their case. Naturally the VA case is related to these cases in France. Oh I particularly love the afternoon randev&uacute; w/ a man almost 1/2 her age while in Paris (NOT).Glad I got the book from the local library."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"We have to wait ages in England to get the latest in the series, and so to wait so long and then read this book was a real let down.Kay is self-centered and nasty-she is not the only one who loses people, and after all, she deals with death every day; it is totally self-indulgent to let everything slide.The so-called hidden agendas are laid on so obviously it is a wonder she reamins clueless for so long.Marino and Lucy are two nasty pieces of work, and Lucy's gayness is mentioned every two seconds, as is Marino's homophobia, as if any of it is actually of any interest to people who want absorbing characters. What does any of it have to do with being a good detective or ATF officer? I can't find myself liking any of the characters I once found so fascinating; they are all so self-absorbed and out of control.The book is world-weary, and it shows, and as for the 'criminal' at the end, without giving too much away for those who persist in the struggle to find anything redeeeming about this novel, well, all I can say is, pathetic and stupid."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've read several Kay Scarpetta books, and I liked them to varying degrees. This one covers Dr. Scarpetta's mourning of the tragic loss of someone very dear to her. In a way I got the impression that as tired and depressed as Scarpetta was through the entire book, the author herself seems in a similar rut. This is easily my least favorite of Cornwell's books. The plot seems loosely slapped together, the characters are cardboard cutouts of themselves, and the ending is quite (bad). I don't like most of the Scarpetta endings because it always seems the good doctor gets herself or a loved one in mortal danger every damn time, and some of the endings are so over the top, they seem like Glenn Close forever popping out of the bathtub in the final scenes of \\"Fatal Attraction\\". This ending, however, is simply (bad). I won't give anything away, but I'll just leave at that: (bad). Oh yeah, and predictable. Not a surprise to be had here.I think it might be best if Cornwell turned to writing something else for a while and maybe returned to these characters after taking a breather. It's clear that they have become stale -- this book seems to have been a real chore for her to write."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'm so surprised to see the numerous negative reviews of this book. I really enjoyed it, more so, in fact, than any of her books since Cruel and Unusual. (I have read all of the Scarpetta novels.) I didn't find it totally implausible, just a little out there, but completely riveting. The affliction of the villain was weird, but not unrealistic.The softening of Dr. Scarpetta's edges since her first few books continues in this, and I found her to be a delightful and real character. At the same time, the technicality of the novel brought back the style of Cornwell's earlier works. At any rate, it was a really good read and a wonderful way to spend a long weekend. If you're looking for absolute realism, why don't you get out of the fiction genre?"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Another disappointment from Cornwell, I am wondering if she has employed a ghost writer to whom she gives the plot and nothing else. I will not be wasting my money on any more of her books. 2 bad ones in a row is 2 too many"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I was really NOT enjoying many of the previous ones. Black Notice really kept my attention. I agree with another review, that Cornwell really limited the background information on these characters and this would not be a good first Kay Scarpetta novel to start with."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Black Notice had to be one of the most unpleasant books that I have ever read. I enjoyed the earlier books in this series - they were well written and researched, and Kay Scarpetta was edgy in an interesting sort of way. Unfortunately, she has devolved into a narcisistic, paranoid shrew with delusions of grandeur, and her sidekicks, especially Marino, are equally self-involved and obnoxious. The books are not particularly well written anymore - Cornwell seems to be grinding them out with no editorial guidance. At least she seems to have gotten over her gun fetish, but these books have become nasty and meanspirited, with little to recommend them."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've always enjoyed the Cornwell/Scarpetta books. Unfortunately, Black Notice disappoints on many levels. One other review noted the abundance of angry, bitter characters. I couldn't agree more. There was no relief from the anger. Perhaps this would have been bearable, however, this book simply is not well-written. The plot lines are disjointed, the flow is bad, buildup to certain scenes barely existed. Let's hope the next outing brings back some of the suspense as well as making the reader actually care about the characters again."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"i've read the latest reviews that are pretty bad. I'll answer at least the one saying that Marino's behavior in Europe is not close to reality. I live in France and frankly when you see how tourists behave, especially Americans, you start to wonder. I know americans are ablsotuely flawless manner wise in their own country but they definitely leave them at the airplane's gate! So his behavior does fit a certain profile! Then losing someone you love, you never ever feel the same, and for some people it takes years. so i wasn't surprised that after a year she was still out. Third, i think the story was well written and interesting enough. Plus, for once, you see a lot more about Richmond and it's plus to any of her books. and i haven't read a book so fast in ages : ). I do agree that Killing benton off was a very bad thing for me, and at one point in black notice i thought maybe it was the wrong guy they found and he would come back! and most people i know liked it, so i'm always surprised to see such bad reviews...."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've always loved the Scarpetta books, but if this had been the first one I wouldn't have read more. It's not just that the personal interaction seems to take precedence over the actual crime, or that the mood is horribly dark. It's that none of the plots in this are very well developed. Although there's a lot of time spent on the plot against Kay and her friend Marino, the motivation behind the plot wasn't very believable, at least to me. The introduction of Kay's new boyfriend gave that part of the book the tone of a bodice-ripper starring Fabio. And even the crime itself was easily solved with tips from the Kay's French counterpart - almost a deus ex machina solution. I will try to avoid reading Cornwell's next book."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I, like many of you, am a voracious reader of all the Scarpetta books, and wasted no time purchasing and reading this latest novel, Black Notice. We are reminded immediately of Benton's demise, which was painful enough when it happened in Point of Origin. Why he was killed off, I'll never understand. I only hope, for the good of the continuing story line, that he does not miraculously reappear in the next novel. Sadly, Kay is left with no one to love, or help construct a mental profile of her abhorrent killer(s). This plot line returned to its familiar inciting force murder, followed by Kay using all of her unlimited resources to solve the case. The foreign intrigue, in the guise of a trip to France to assist the FBI which was supposed to keep us interested, just wasn't enough this time. Additionally, the reader was not allowed to get into the psyche of Loup-Garou, the number one suspect, to the same extent as that of Kay's other psychopaths. The insuing murders did not heighten the climax, but instead seemed more more like a secondary vehicle which allowed Kay to meet the young FBI agent. This reader wants to know if he will be the next Benton in Kay's life. Will we see the older woman, younger man theme take place in the rigid structured life of Kay Scarpetta, chief medical examiner of Richmond, VA? Lucy, Kay's brilliant, gender diverse niece, remains the flat character she has always been. It would be nice if Lucy found a significant other with some genuine character that would help her grow up. Considering the impressive credentials Cornwell has given to the Lucy character, shouldn't she be developing into someone more than just a beautiful, intelligent, elusive, gun-toting techie? Once again Lucy puts her life, as well as her lover's life in extreme jeopardy and worries good old Aunt Kay to death. How much longer can Auntie Kay endure Lucy's elusive affect? Marino, as usual, is in conflict with an &quot;authority&quot; figure(s). This poor man will either eat or smoke himself to death or get bored with playing second fiddle to Kay. After all of these books, neither has learned much from the other. Obviously, they will never be a love match, but how long will Marino be satisfied with his role as brotherly-protector? I guess Kay and company are getting a little too predictable. Don't get me wrong, I think Kay Scarpetta is a breath of fresh air as the female heroine in Cornwell's lady sleuth yarns, but I hope to see Kay get back to the job of being the super medical examiner/lawyer/investigator extrodinaire in which unraveling the crime is the thing. A grisly millennium crime might be just the thing for Kay Scarpetta. It could start on New Year's Eve, 1999 in the middle of winter, as usual!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have her entire collection, in part thanks to Amazon's used book section.

After a long dry spell, this was what I have come to expect. I really enjoyed Potter's Field and it has not been as good since. I was fighting to finish Point of Origin, but this was spicy. Marino and the old gang are back and in full swing. They are characters I have come to enjoy when I sitdown to read."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This was a great book. Cornwell has fantastic way of pulling you in on a slow, yet great, page turner."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is better than some of the others in this series. A dead man's body leads Dr. Scarpetta on a dangerous mission. How did he get in the container? What are the hairs from? Could it be something that comes out when the moon is full? Strange twist in this one. I liked it better because Benson is gone. Lucy is still the SUPERWOMAN of all time but she is not in this one as much. As usual Pete Marino is great. I really like him better than anyone else in in the series. On page 83, (paperback) he has mustard on his shirt, his tie is to short and he has on two different color socks. Marino has be demoted by the new Ass't. Chief, a lady named Bray. This is the other plot going on in the story. Bray is after Marino and Scarpetta. Will she get either one? Have to read to find out. I lilked this plot in the book better than the &quot;hairy man&quot; plot. All in all it was fair. Not as good as her very early books."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I enjoyed every minute of this book! It is one of those you just can't put down. I encourage everybody to read this and all of her books!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"What a big stink. Definitely give this a miss. Patricia what happened to you?????"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I just received a copy of THE LAST PRECINCT and read the jacket cover. It noted that THE LAST PRECINCT is conceptually linked to BLACK NOTICE. So, I went to order a copy of BLACK NOTICE on Amazon.com. I started by reading the readers' reviews of BLACK NOTICE and it sounded like a terrible novel! After finish reading all of them, I looked on my book shelf and found my copy of BLACK NOTICE. Yes, I read it long ago but forgot I did. However, unlike many of the readers, I throughtly enjoyed this work.I've read at least 8 of Cornwell's books and BLACK NOTICE is far from her worst effort. For example, I think BLACK NOTICE is a much better story than HORNET'S NEST.I would be interested in reading more about what others think of BLACK NOTICE compared to Cornwell's &quot;Judy Hammer&quot; series. In deciding if I should take the time to read a book, such comparisons are helpful for me. I hope it's helpful to you."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"While still enjoying the gruesome forensic details, which simultaneously inform and repulse, I'm really getting tired of Lucy's punky personality and the author's agonizing over her relationship with this obnoxious niece, as well as her (Kay's) deep enduring depression over Benton's demise. OK, he was a great guy, but let's get on with the story. Many of us who simply want a a good mystery read are going to forgo future Cornwell works if this trend continues. To be sure, a realistic protaganist must show some human frailty but, it seems to me, something is lost when a protagonist (who deals with ruthless, psychotic antagonists) is in a prolonged state of emotional or psychological instability. If the heroine is psychologically or emotionally distressed, the reader, rather than focusing on the sleuthing and the unfolding of the story, is forced to be concerned with the heroine's fragile state of mind and its effect on her various human relationships, which may be of little interest to many readers.I like the portrayal of the Marino and other characters in Cornwell's books, and share in the reading public's general plaudits for her work. Just go a bit lighter on the subjective, introspective morbid side of Kay's personality (she may be in the wrong proffession), and please knock off Lucy in a Miami drug-bust gone wrong.Marino is a great character, if a bit over done."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Don't bother with this book. You'll feel you've wasted your time and money."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have never been draged through this author's sordid mind before, and I don't plan on it happening again. Her characters are the most implausible group I have ever encountered. She lumps totally opposite people together and never gives us a single reason why we should believe these people would ever have anything to do with each other. She drags us up and down the narrow streets of her mind splattering us with gore and deceit, but never gives us a reason to feel for these troubled characters. It is seemingly an after thought that she finally creates the main villian in this story. He never actually materializes though, and of course it is next to impossible to believe that he even could exist. All that is bad enough, but suddenly and inexplicably the author tires of the entire charade and ends the story so abrubtly that it took me a few moments to accept the fact that it was finally over, and be grateful that it was. Don't waste your time !"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read everything Patricia Cornwell has written. This starts out very intriguing and leads up to a wonderful climax and then falls &quot;flat&quot;. More of a wham-bam-no-thank-you ending. In comparison with her previous writings, this books falls very shot of her wonderful skill. It does not show here. Kay Scarpetta is mean and cold. Lucy has turned into some hard-core maniac and the reasoning is NOT believeable. It is time to let go of personal anger and bring back the characters that she is capable of writing about. Very disappointed, but will keep trying her again."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"As always, Cornwell puts out a really good book, sure to keepyou behind in everything around the house because you can't put itdown. I highly recommend it and all her other books featuring Kay Scarpetta as the main character."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell is one author I really enjoy. With Black Notice her talents have really shined. She shows real life family friction, deep remorse, and has taken a total unthinkable gruesome character and pulled off a great read. It was a page turner; a book I couldn't put down. Gory - yes. But her superb writing skills pulled it off. Can't wait for the next book. Love the characters. They are real with real people problems. Entwined with suspense that continuously amazes me. Go Cornwell, Go!!!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I anxiously awaited the release of this novel after reading the emotionally draining Point of Origin. Unfortunately, Black Notice wasn't as powerful as I had hoped. I was disappointed by the disconnect between the crime scenes and the new characters (Bray and Anderson). There seemed to be two different stories going on that never really came together. Nonetheless, I am still a huge Kay Scarpetta fan and am once again anxiously awaiting her next book."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patsy Cornwall is back on track in the latest Scarpetta novel.

I've read all of Cornwell's novels and have generally enjoyed them--up to this one. I was looking forward to a good read, and all I got was this.Enough mewling about the niece and the dead lover! Get back to basics, Ms. Cornwell. And lay off all the meaningless details. If a good editor had taken about 100-150 pages of padding out of this, it might have been okay, although the plot is just a wee bit far-fetched. Maybe more than a wee bit."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I just finished its 320 pages in under 24 hours. Her stories are always all-consuming.While a few critics seems to be dissappointed in the emotions of her characters, it seems to make them more real to me. Of course, Kay Scarpetta and all of Benton's friends would grieve. I would have been shocked if Patricia Cornwell had not addressed his death in this way and everyone went on with business and lives as usual.As for the &quot;crime du jour&quot;, I loved all the twists, turns and sub-plots and the manner in which Cornwell knits everything together. The ending was brief and somewhat predictible, but hey, how many ways are there really to catch a criminal?"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I hated it when PC killed off Benton.

First, it's nice to read about someone who isn't blond, in great shape, and under 30! Scarpetta is more &quot;real&quot; here than in any previous works. So what if there are some untidy loose ends?

Then, out comes Black Notice! I bought this book and anxiously poured into it....but never found that Cornwell &quot;heart&quot; that was so prevelant in the other Scarpetta works. I feel that Patricia's heart just was not into writing this novel. I was so disappointed! NO gripping suspense: she lost me after the tiny blond hairs that suggested a werewolf only to find a medical condition that allowed for normalcy in comprehension. This story would have been better off if there had actually been a real werewolf...with mysteries surrounding its existence. I only hope, Patricia, that your heart is back &quot;into&quot; the Scarpetta series as you compile your next work! If it truly is not ....then begin another fascinating series!

The sublime had degenerated into the ridiculous almost overnight, making that book a point of dishonor to the fine work that had preceded it. But desperately searching for the always-elusive great read and noting all the gushing reviews about Black Notice, I thought that perhaps Cornwell had gotten over her personal problems and recovered her muse. I was mislead, and I wish I could get my money back on this gawd-awful book. There is no plot. Dr. Kay and her bloated sidekick Marino have become hysterical parodies of their former selves. Bray's plot to get rid of them both was well-founded. And I agreed with Marino that Benton didn't actually burn to death in a fire--this top-notch intuitive realized that he'd cast his lot with the wrong crowd in Kay, Marino, and Lucy, so he devised a plot to get himself the hell away from them! I used to trust book reviews--how times have changed!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"After reading the book, I listened to the abridged version of the audio tape. I thought the book w as fine, but the audio tape was horrible.

I thoroughly enjoy her writing, detail, and characters, and was not let down with her latest. She leaves me yearning for the next Scarpetta novel. As far as Cornwell's non-Scarpetta books, I could do without them...to me they are a waste of her time...she could be writing another Scarpetta, not an off 'subject' I will not read.(after making the mistake of reading one). Overall, Black Notice sits you down and keeps you reading. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I love Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series and always await the newest one with abated breath. I feel like I know her and Pete Marino and love them both and all the adventures they go on together. Although sad about Benton's death in prior book, it gives the series a realism. But come on, Kay and a younger, snotty, stuck up, goody boy? This is NOT Kay's style. We've gone from intelligent Benton to this? Is Kay going through middle age crazies? I don't see her with this guy and didn't think it fit at all. The story line about the &quot;freaky&quot; serial killer was a little farfetched too, but interesting reading. It seemed that Ms. Cornwell tried to finish the plot too quickly. It got you, kept you, then kind of let you down at the end, it all happened so quickly. I hope Ms. Cornwell sticks with Kay and Pete for her next write, and not a story line such as Southern Cross. I couldn't even finish that one."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Stay away from this one. It's hard to be specific about thisbook's many deficiencies without giving away plot twists, but: Can'tCornwell invent a believable criminal any longer? Motivation and forensic-pathology procedures are given short shrift; Scarpetta herself goes two-dimensional. This is most manifest in the pallid, watery descriptions of Kay's heterosexual activity. Coded and overt lesbianism, however, luridly and lovingly takes center stage. Put it this way: If this were the first Kay Scarpetta mystery you picked up, you'd never pick up another one."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am a great fan of Patricia Cornwell and have read all her books to date. The latest Black Notice was disturbing to me due to the depressiveness of the characters and the amount of foul and vile language on the part of the main characters. I purchased the book unabridged in audio format and was driving to Richmond with my teenage daughter and both of us were excited about listening to the book. I was shocked by the language coming over the speakers in the car, and embarrassed in front of my daughter. The language was so disgusting, vile, and foul on the part of Dr. Scarpetta, and Capt. Marino that I will no longer purchase any new works of Cornwell. Furthermore, I will tell everyone I come in contact with how disappointed I am with the new book. It truly is a shame that a great storyteller such as Ms. Cornwell would have employ such language to get across the painful emotional state of the characters."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell still tells a great story, but her characters are shrinking -- their dimensions are becoming too narrow and unmotivated. Scarpetta is depressed and cranky, Lucy is &quot;acting&quot; strange and stranger and Pete is eating too much, smoking too much and kvetching too much. It's time for some motivated development for these folks. And Talley, whom Kay meets and beds and rejects in a 24 hour (?) period, is too shallow to convince the reader that Kay is getting it all together again by letting him into her life. The book also has a villain who's distinguishing personality feature is his unusually long hair. Hirsute is not compelling and in fact it's not believable. I hope Cornwell can bring her characters to life again, but she needs to discard the paranoia and the depression themes (and we've also read enough about bad folks manipulating the e-mail at the morgue). In the beginning, Scarpetta was a bright, resilient, indefatigable woman who shed her problems and solved the crime; we need to see her in that role again. Send Kay back to the bar at Louies Backyard and let her find herself again."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"One might think so if &quot;Black Notice&quot; is any indication. The story starts out with an intriguing premise, but it quickly sinks to a predictable litany of Scarpetta's self-absorbed waspishness, Lucy's strange mixture of super-macho behavior and emotional decline, and Marino's anti-intellectual self-carictature.The plot elements and details go from the incredible to the absurd to the impossible. At some point, Ms. Cornwell would appear to have acquired an AOL account, and she now considers herself an expert on computer crime. Case in point: Someone has swiped Scarpetta's AOL password and is posing as her online. Kay moves heaven and Earth to discover the thief's identity, but it never occurs to her simply to change her password! Then, having identified the malefactor, she orders Rose to give her the thief's AOL password, and Kay calmly logs on to his account and reads his E-mail, without the benefit of a court order; such behavior is, of course, blatantly illegal and in real life would probably result in her being fired, prosecuted, and (successfully) sued. But it gets bettter: Once logged on to the thief's account, Kay casually leaves &quot;a plaintext mail message&quot; in his mailbox and signs it with the name of a third party! Nice trick, Kay; want to tell us how you managed that one?&quot;Black Notice&quot; is definitely not up to the earlier Scarpetta novels. Let's hope Kay gets into analysis, Lucy resolves her identity issues, and Marino either has his heart attack or learns to get along with educated people."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Apparently Patricia Cornwell has never met a character she actually liked. Even her protagonists are irrasible and paranoid to the point that they can't get along with each other for more than five minutes without blowing up, storming out or otherwise behaving like emotionally stunted two-year-olds. It's unusual to enjoy a mystery and its solution without experiencing the slightest affinity for the people involved, but that's the way I feel reading Cornwell's books. Given the choice of hanging out with the good doctor, Superniece, and their friends or the unfortunate victims in the morgue, I'd choose the latter; at least they know how to stay calm and cool under pressure."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've enjoyed nearly all of the Scarpetta books since Body Farm, which was the first I read. But what a letdown this book was! It is dark, brooding, angry, bitter and -- just in case you still think you'll like it -- boring. After Cornwell became disillusioned with the FBI (in Point of Origin) she lost her focus. Worse, she seems to have lost the enjoyment of writing, and passes that mood on to her readers. None of the characters seems true to form. Marino is angry, Lucy is spoiled and selfish, and even Scarpetta's colleagues seem to be tiring of the good doctor. Never mind the plot ... you know you're in trouble when Cornwell has to resolve the mystery by having the prime suspect literally walk up to Scarpetta's front door. (Don't worry, I haven't given anything away -- you'll see this coming from 50 pages away). If you're a dedicated Scarpetta fan, you may find this book too gloomy. If you're new to the series, start with one of the earlier books."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all the Kay Scarpetta books (except Point of Origin) and I really liked her character up until Black Notice. The usually cool, intelligent, and self-possessed Scarpetta has morphed into a whiny, irrational simp. One minute she is in charge and doing her job, the next she is screaming and cursing at someone (mainly Marino). Yes, I understand she is devastated over Benton's death, but I wish she wasn't going through a new meltdown every other page. I agree with one of the previous reviewers who is tired of some of the themes (such as the &quot;Lucy is angry&quot; theme..she needs to get over it! ). The plot and the writing were fine, it was just the character changes, especially Scarpetta's, that I did not care for. I was glad to see Kay given a new romantic interest, but the fact that he is much younger does not bode well for it (I predict much Kay-angst over it in the next book). For anyone who has not read a Kay Scarpetta novel, I would recommend All That Remains. It is really good...the first one I ever read and it hooked me."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have bought everyone of Cornwell's books and they have kept me glued to the pages. Black Notice however, is not one of her better books. It was a good story but Cornwell has set such a high standard, that I expect all her books to be outstanding and I am afraid this one was not. I do not regret buying this book, but maybe it is time for Cornwell to write a new series and let Kay Scarpetta rest in peace."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Before reading Cornwell's latest thriller, I read the on-line reviews and became a little disappointed. However, after I began reading the book, I couldn't put it down. There were enough twists and turns to keep me interested, and I was delighted to see that Kay did not hibernate alone at home for too long. I lost faith in her when she became sullen and distant one year after Benton's death. I'm glad to see she's moved on. Can't wait to see what Scarpetta will tackle next!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I love the Kay Scarpetta novels, and have read all of them. The last few (this one included) seem to be reaching for storylines. There's always a &quot;bad guy&quot;, other than the murderer the heroine is after. Someone within Scarpetta's office or within the police department who's out to get her. And all of these &quot;bad guys&quot; are so jealous of the world-famous Dr. Scarpetta. Come on! These story lines have little or nothing to do with the main theme of the book and really detract from the story. I, for one, preferred the earlier Scarpetta novels."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":". . . I get the feeling that she used this book to set up plot elements for future books. That made the &quot;Werewolf&quot; plot disjointed--it was introduced well, faded in the middle, then just burst towards a conclusion at the end, making it incomplete and somewhat ungratifying. A lot of unanswered points remained. However, I think Ms. Cornwell did a spectacular job chronicling Kay's grief and her unresolved feelings over Benton's death. (And I really, really hope she goes with the younger man thing!) She's also throwing Marino off the deep end, which started to grate on my nerves even though I usually enjoy his surly personality. Actually, everyone seemed to be headed off the deep end in this one: Kay's grief and grieving is making her a workaholic, and Lucy's anger over too many things to count is turning her into a raving lunatic with a gun (ditto, Marino). A bit much, I think, but overall, a good read--I like these characters and Cornwell can always keep you engrossed, even with this not-up-to-par effort."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Unfortunately I didn't happen to read the reviews of this book before reading it, otherwise I might have thought twice about it. This was my first disappointment with one of Patricia Cornwell's books. I probably would have read the book regardless, since I like the character. Unfortunately, however, I will now wait and read the reviews of the next book before I spend my time on it. Most of the book was as an enjoyable read, however I was extremely disappointed in the ending of the book. The end seemed completely out of character for Dr. Scarpetta and totally unbelievable. My first thought was that it was a rush job in order to get it to press. Actually, I'm hoping that is the case as there didn't seem to be much thought or originality in the finale. If this is a sign of things to come, then I'll regretfully have to pass on the future books."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Once again Kay Scarpetta is pitched against the hidden monster with some arcane disorder; once again she is flung between law enforcement agencies both compelling and corrupt; once again she is threatened and vulnerable. But will she once again triumph? Here is Patricia Cornwell at her political best: she has matured as a writer and brings to the reader a consideration of the investigative process more developed than the early days of a few cobbled together FBI profiles. In Black Notice, Scarpetta has become smarter than her mentors and tutors: but is she smarter than the beasts, both real and remembered, that pursue her? Readers should not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Kay and Marino are getting too tedious for words.I bought the unabridged audio version. I rather liked the main plot, it was entertaining, but.....I am beginning to want to slap Marino..he is becoming so obnoxious I could do without him. And as for Kay Scarpetta..get a grip! She is busy feeling sorry for herself for half of the book! Benton is dead..move on! And for the life of me, I can not understand what Jay Tolley saw in her! She is busy being either rude or sappy when they are together. Cornwell is going to lose her following if the next books are of the same quality. (And I used to love all of her stuff.)Now I will only buy used versions..just in case."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"While I love Patricia Cornwall's writing, this was my least favorite of them all. Considering how brilliant the other books were, this one was still worth reading, but not up to par with her previous works. Ms. Cornwall seemed to take a different vein with this work, but I prefer her previous stategy. Scarpetta just seemed a bit out of character in this book (i.e. having the impromptu fling with the young French man just didn't seem like her at all). All in all, worth reading because even a so-so book by Patricia Cornwall is still a good read, I just expected her usual top of line story."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Patricia Cornwell has been one of my favorite authors in recent years, so when a friend praised Black Notice as vintage Cornwell, I bought it immediately. However, I struggled to get through it - not vintage Cornwell at all. The characters we have come to know so well seemed to have no redeeming qualities and that includes Kay! There was an overall negativity about this whole book with heavy focus on Benton's death. The average reader does not want to wade through technical medical terms, gore and very angry and filthy dialogue. A grieving Kay would not jump into bed having known the guy for a day! Lucy just can't be trigger happpy and out for revenge. And Marino just can't have deteriorated to the degree she has painted him. He, however, was the only one with any common sense and foresight. The plot was a stretch - is she running out of content material? So, no more Cornwell for me! I see there's are new one out in July but it won't land on my bookshelf!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read the entire Scarpetta series, and I was pleased that this book's plot measures up to her best. I couldn't put it down. The forensic medicine and law enforcement elements make each book a fascinating learning experience that complements the intensely exciting suspense. Keep up the good work, PC!The characters' grief over BW is plausible, but I do wish Kay and especially Lucy would get therapy. Lucy has gone over the edge, and Kay's emotional suit of armor is frustrating. I love the new Jay Talley character! I'm looking forward to seeing how their relationship develops. Kay will always be a mess but PLEASE let her lighten up a little and have some fun! Also, Lucy needs to get her act together so she can add her expertise to future plots. Marino just needs a good job, but a sympathetic soul mate could add a new dimension to the characters' interrelationships. Some good news in their personal lives would help to balance the professional horrors they face. Dramatic tension need not suffer, and happier characters may win more fans for the series."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"The author has developed an interesting story, but it suffers from the effects of trying to wind three plots together - the activities of the main villain, the problems/politics within a police agency, and the activities and troubles of the main character's niece. There are some technical errors that could be overlooked, but a lot of loose ends. Overall, an interesting story."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book kept me intrigued until the very end. The intricate detail the author uses to define the autopsy procedures was a bit gorey, but impressive. Kate Reading, the reader of this book on tape, was amazing. Her vocal range of characters was perfect. She really made the story come alive. I have read other Patricia Cornwell novels, but this is the first Kay Scarpetta novel I have listened to on tape. I would recommend this book highly to any true crime/thriller fans."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was a huge fan at the beginning of this series. I have now gotten weary of Kay's grief over a man she never seemed to have time for when he was alive and which seems entirely insincere and shallow now. Lucy's continued angst over her sexuality and inability to be anything but a neurotic, violent brat has also gotten tiresome and boring. Marino is the only character I still have any sympathy for but how much blustering and overeating can one character do and continue to be believable. The trend for these folks to be put in more and more untenable political situations in their work has also been overdone. Are we to believe that the state of Virginia only hires unscrupulous, self-serving criminals in everyone of their senior positions, except for the righteous Kay of course. I am sorry to say this is the end of the line for me....I will not buy or read any more in this series."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Ms. Cornwell needs to put her Dr. Scarpetta books to rest.

True fans will be very disappointed by this latest Kay Scarpetta installment. This book is poorly written, the dialogue is wooden and trite, the characters don't have nearly the depth she usually provides, and the new love interest is a total fraud, not Kay's type at all (what the heck was wrong with Benton? That was a great storyline!). I also could have done without the romance novel scenes, and Ms. Cornwell shouldn't try to write them - not her forte! Even her villains are boring and predictable now, and her forensic pathology research and descriptions are weak. &quot;Black Notice&quot; was clearly written to satisfy a book contract and doesn't even come close to the quality of her early work. Ms. Cornwell should re-read &quot;Postmortem&quot; and revisit the writer she used to be before she attempts the next one."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Having been disappointed by Cornwell's last few Scarpetta efforts, I was thrilled to read her latest. Benton is gone, Lucy is less of a focal point, and I think the book is better for it. Recent editions have been mired down with too much of Scarpetta's personal angst and not enough of the forensic detail that put Cornwell on the map to begin with. The old Scarpetta is finally back with a VERY satisfying page-turner!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Teh jacket's description of the plot sounded as if this novel was going to be more of a murder mystery than the last few books about Scarpetta have been. If I wanted to read about characters' emotional problems, I would go read a work of general fiction. When I buy a mystery, I expect that the main point of the story is solving the mystery -- not having to wade through characters' angst and personal problems. Now, yes, those can be written so as to be key to the plot. But they weren't in this novel. I WON'T be sucked in again by a misleading jacket description. And I won't be buying any more books by Patricia Cornwell!"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I think I've read all of her books, but I am not sure. When I read this one I was struck by an overwhelming sense of deja vu -- I've read this before.

The plot are entirely indistinguishable."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Unfortunately, one can see Cornwell straining to continue the Scarpetta series, when she should be performing a post mortem on the characters involved. There is no sense of urgency, only a sense of overwhelming doom and gloom as Scarpetta becomes more bitter, Lucy becomes more of a &quot;girls with guns&quot; stereotype and Marino -- well at least he hasn't changed.

It served its purpose as &quot;a good read&quot;. But like even the best tv serials, there are huge, predictable chunks one simply needs to sit through to get on with the story. Marino is a thin cliche character by now. How many times do we need descriptions of his sloppiness? Scarpetta's hard as nails facade is a bit tiresome. Lucy is not fleshed out as a three dimensional character in this book and comes across in her bitter angry presence...and is just not welcome anymore. The ending, as a few previous reviewers have already cited, is quick, not rewarding and extremely unsatisfying. But, as I say, it held my attention during a tedious flight. Is that a compliment? I don't know. I think I am going to say adieu to Ms. Scarpetta.

I read fiction to be entertained and, hopefully, feel good after I've finished the book, but that's not the case with Point of Origin and Black Notice. If I want to be depressed, I can read the newspaper!

Nevertheless, I still look forward to the next Scarpetta novel."},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"Like other reviewers, I found the love interest (Talley) and the ending of the story to be &quot;tacked on&quot;, uncharacteristic, and unsatisfying. Other than that, the story was exciting ... but, I do think Cornwell needs to broaden her ideas on plot. Not to make them implausible, but just more varied ... and having the same characters (other than Kay and Marino) involved over and over starts to grate. What about using some of the &quot;sideliners&quot; like Marino's son, Dr. Fielding, or Rose?"},{"Title":"Black Notice (Random House Large Print)","review":"I really liked the beginning of this book -- with the letter from Benton.

The versimilitude of the early novels is totally gone now, and the vicarious thrill of being tormented and threatened along with Cornwell's uber herione is all that remains.My advice is just to plow through it as fast as you can, hoot and laugh and cringe, and don't linger over the hows and whys.

There are several unfinished plots in this one. points to Chuck and Diane Bray but never really addresses this problem. Also, why does Lucy always end up looking like an inhuman machine? She is female, but Cornwell can never portray her as having any female characteristics. Lucy's problems are always left up in the air and never resolved, and let's face it she needs some serious help pyschologically. Finally, I haven't liked the way Cornwell has just abruptly ended her last several books.

It traces all the available documentary evidence for how each part of the Mass evolved, first from the Jewish liturgy, then into a distinctly Christian act of worship. The book has helped me stay more attentive during Mass, because now I can see the rich symbolism and history at each turn.

He began this book while assigned to Rhodes as an information officer in 1945, and finally finished it in Belgrade in 1952 while working as a press attach&eacute; for the British Embassy. Before publication, it was chopped almost in half by his editor, Anne Ridler. She excised most of the passages dealing with the recent war, and \\"left the descriptions of the landscape and people....She oriented the book to sunlight, blue skies, and clear sea.\\" [quoted from the introduction David Roessel].War still clings like a gray film to the bright fabric of \`Venus.' Durrell writes intense, brilliant descriptions of Mediterranean skies and dazzling Greek villages, but as in all of his works that I've read, there is also a submerged longing for past love, past history, past glory.Some of his most beautiful passages, both in this book, in \\"Prospero's Cell,\\" and in the books of \\"The Alexandria Quartet\\" take place under water. Here, the author goes for a midnight swim in the final chapter of \\"Reflections on a Marine Venus\\"---\\"The [moon]light filters down a full fathom or more to where, on the dark blackboard of weed, broken here and there by dazzling areas of milk-white sand, the fish float as if dazed by their own violet shadows which follow them back and forth, sprawling across the sea's floor.\\"Bright surfaces. Submerged longings. There is even a ghost story floating just below the surface of a trip to the Island of Patmos. This chapter has some of the most powerful and eerie descriptions in the book. It brings together the storms of the \`little summer of Saint Demetrius', a lost, lingering voice from the war, and an Abbot who presides over a monastery where St. John was said to have composed the Books of the Apocalypse.\\"Reflections on a Marine Venus\\" is one of a series of travelogues that Durrell wrote about his pre- and post-war experiences in and around the Mediterranean. The other books in this series are \\"Prospero's Cell,\\" \\"Spirit of Place,\\" \\"Bitter Lemons,\\" (which I've just begun), and \\"Sicilian Carousel.\\"Ultimately, these books defy the description \`travelogue'. Durrell wrote about the peculiar genius of a place, not bound by any moment in time, but for all time."},{"Title":"Reflections on a Marine Venus: A Companion to the Landscape of Rhodes","review":"I am not an avid reader but this book changed my way of thinking about history. it gave such a vivid picture of the setting and challenges of post wwII greece I would recc this to anyone."},{"Title":"On Job: God-Talk and the Suffering of the Innocent","review":"I am reading G. Gutierrez's book &quot;ON JOB:God-talk and the suffering of the innocent&quot; for the second time this summer (2000). I find it as refreshing and guiding as the first time that I read it several years ago. Not being a theologian, nor a biblical scholar, it helped me understand the Old Testament book of JOB, which I think is challenging to understand. There are two main reasons I liked it. First, it helped me understand the essence of religion, i.e., giving praise to God, rather than the rewards and punishment that can easily be promoted by western thinking or the petitioning of God &quot;to do our will.&quot; It also lays the basis for deep prayer - contemplation. Second, it helped me understand the plight of the poor. Until all of us recognize that each of us is broken, i.e., &quot;poor&quot; to some extent there will be incomplete or no peace in this world. As a public educator, I think this is an essential understanding for working with the young in our society. Gustavo Gutierrez's reflection on JOB helps us gain that understanding. In my sharing with my colleagues I express the uniqueness of the gift of &quot;listening&quot;. It is the best gift we can give our family, friends, or students. Gutierrez helps us see how JOB is a listener - a listener to hear the will of God. In our educated ways, whether in education, theology, business, medicine, law, etc., we miss it if we don't understand the wisdom of JOB. Gutierrez can help one understand it. A quote from the text: &quot;The men (women) are competent, even if mistaken, theologians (or put the other professions); they are convinced of their teaching but they are unaware that it has nothing to say to suffering human beings.&quot; (p.27) Often times in writings and literature reference is made to JOB, however, Gutierrez's work on JOB helps me understand the depth of the wisdom. It helps me know if the reference to JOB is correctly understood. This is not necessarily an easy book to read, but with perseverance one can gain much wisdom from it."},{"Title":"On Job: God-Talk and the Suffering of the Innocent","review":"In his book, On Job: God-talk and the Suffering of the Innocent, Gustavo Guti&eacute;rrez, an innovator of Latin American Liberation Theology, tries to discover the meaning of the Book of Job and how it can contribute to both how we talk about God and how we approach the reality of human suffering, in particularly, the suffering of the innocent. Guti&eacute;rrez shows readers how Job's experiences gradually cause him to doubt the theory of retribution and to evolve in his understanding of God's freedom, love, justice and gratuitousness.Guti&eacute;rrez helps us to understand how difficult it is to talk about God when the innocent suffer and how empty theology sounds when it refuses to speak from the harsh realities of life. Guti&eacute;rrez incorporates the works of various scholars, priests, playwrights, teachers, theologians and Latin American poets to help readers understand his approach to the topic. Guti&eacute;rrez thoroughly analyzes the deep messages to be found in the Book of Job and concludes by challenging Christians to use the insights found in its text to contemplate God's gratuitousness and live in accordance with its demands as we seek to help the plight of the innocent sufferers in the world.Guti&eacute;rrez believes that Job's suffering has made him more conscious of other innocent sufferers. Guti&eacute;rrez also insists that God's justice can only be understood in the light of God's gratuitousness. He insists that the world turns on God's gratuitousness, not the theory of retribution. Guti&eacute;rrez also insists that those who suffer and talk (or complain) about God with honesty may actually be more pleasing to God than those who, like Job's friends, worship and obey God out of self-interested hope of reward or fear of punishment. Guti&eacute;rrez insists that abstract talk of God and his love is not profitable unless it speaks from an honest and deep consideration of the most desperate of human conditions and a deep contemplation of the plan, justice and gratuitousness of God.From the outset, Guti&eacute;rrez informs readers that his approach is rooted in his experience with the social injustices he has witnessed in Latin America and that his goal is to find in the Book of Job insights, answers and approaches that will help us to \\"speak well of God\\" in the face of the harsh realities of life. I think that Guti&eacute;rrez has succeeded in his goal.I commend Guti&eacute;rrez for taking on the challenge of one of the Bible's most difficult texts, especially one that deals with the hardest of human questions: Why do the innocent suffer? Amazingly, Guti&eacute;rrez has taken on the challenge and provides readers with a brief,1 detailed, clear, thorough and concise book. I also commend Guti&eacute;rrez on his extensive research and his knowledge of the many points of interpretation which theologians have long debated in regards to the Book of Job. Guti&eacute;rrez also shows courage in his opposition to many of these traditional interpretations.Since reading this book, I have learned that the self-interested religion of Job's friends is not true faith, but is instead a subtle form of idolatry in which God becomes a predictable toy controlled by human behavior. Guti&eacute;rrez helped me to see the humanity of the author of the Book of Job and how God worked through the author to create a work of art that manages to ask the hard questions about God, faith and the harsh realities of life. Guti&eacute;rrez has helped me to see the Book of Job as a work of art that does not settle for quick and easy answers about the universal human experience but instead raises uncomfortable questions that, when asked, may open people's hearts for deeper experiences with the true God. Guti&eacute;rrez has convinced me of the importance of honest prayer and contemplation of God and that to truly understand God's justice one must understand God's gratuitousness.I would recommend this book to anyone who has questioned God's goodness in the face of human suffering. I would also recommend this book to bible study teachers (it would make for great study and discussion), seminary students, pastors, ministers, pastoral counselors, social workers, and those who seek justice for \\"the least of these.\\""},{"Title":"On Job: God-Talk and the Suffering of the Innocent","review":"Gustavo Gutierrez is a liberation theologian from Lima, Peru. In this book he discusses the connection between the oppression of Job and his questioning God for his plight, and the need for the poor to do the same. Job, however, does not abandon God but remains faithful. When Christ on the Cross asks God why he has abandoned him, Gutierrez reminds us that we must hear those words and respond. \\"Those who suffer unjustly have a right to complain and protest,\\" he says. Jesus will not be heard if \\"our tongues keep quiet about what our souls believe.\\" Yet the message of the Cross must not be forgotten and leads to salvation. \\"Only if we know how to be silent and involve ourselves in the suffering of the poor will we be able to speak out of their hope.\\" To be truly involved, Gutierrez assures us, removes us from being merely \\"sorry comforters\\" - what Job accused (rightly) his friends of being. Gutierrez's book is enlightening and profound and speaks to the poor and the faithful alike."},{"Title":"On Job: God-Talk and the Suffering of the Innocent","review":"Gutierrez does an excellent job analyzing the Book of Job and explaining its relevant theological messages. Of special importance is the refuting of the social darwinistic doctrine of temporal retribution (which is the belief that people are rewarded or punished during their lives based on their sins). The theological arguments are rather complex, but are explained so clearly that they are easy to understand. While Gutierrez makes a connection between the message of the Book of Job and poverty in Latin America, this theme could have been expanded upon more in the book. All in all, this book is a very interesting read and is a must for those who wish to understand the Book of Job."},{"Title":"On Job: God-Talk and the Suffering of the Innocent","review":"This remarkable commentary is a coalescence of both great scholarly insight on the Old Testament book of Job and a plea for the poor and weak who find their voice in Job's story. Gutierrez examines Job's situation through the lens of Latin-American suffering. This agenda, though perfectly reasonable in its aims, sometimes leads Gutierrez to some rather gratuitous conclusions regarding the actual text - none so gratuitous, however, as to be unforgivable. I will begin with a brief overview of the book at large and end with some of my own conclusions regarding Gutierrez's treatment of Job.To begin with, the book of Job tells the story of God testing Job's faith by allowing Satan to bring Job's life from fortune to misfortune. Job is brought through a number of tribulations, from the loss of his entire family to malignant skin diseases. Job's friends contend that his misery is a direct result of sin in his life. Job argues against his friends and brings his frustration and queries in direct appeal to God - even challenging God. Finally, God enters the narrative in the ending chapters to confront Job. In analysis of this Old Testament book, Gutierrez makes the beginning observation that Job's story, though written with a specific purpose in mind, seems written with \\"a faith that has been drenched in tears and reddened by blood.\\" What makes this a particularly powerful observation is that it seems readily apparent that such a description can be equally applied to Gutierrez. His words are not like those of meticulous scholars who sacrifice meaning in pursuit of its details, but rather of one who is emotionally and personally invested in the topic he's writing about.Gutierrez's treatment of Job can be broken down into four prominent themes that carry from beginning to culmination. First is the idea of disinterested faith. Can one, even in the midst of wanton cruelty, abject suffering and every violation of human dignity, still profess faith in God? In other words, is it possible to have a faith that is wholly not contingent upon outward circumstances - no matter their extremity? Job, as Gutierrez points out, is an exemplar of this disinterested faith. Gutierrez supports this theme by referring to Job's steadfast devotion to God, refusing to curse God, no matter his painful circumstances. Though Job's language often has the shade of vituperative despair, he never abandons God in language or action. Of course, this sort of faith amidst suffering directly relates to how we talk about God. This \\"God-talk\\" is the second theme. Gutierrez suggests that our language of God is directly influenced by the situation we happen to find ourselves. He specifically develops this theme by looking at how Job's language matures within the progression of his dialogues with his redundantly circuitous friends. Job's speeches are thoughtful yet filled with complaint and a tinge of anger. Job shows us that it is okay to be angry with God so long as we give him our faith. Job becomes abundantly aware, not of solely his own seemingly gratuitous suffering, but of the suffering of others. The language of Job is sharpened between two stones, the belief that he is innocent and the acute awareness that he suffers nonetheless. Gutierrez argues that Job is not seriously contending that he is innocent to the degree of having never sinned, but rather that Job is aware that his suffering far outweighs any such sin. Gutierrez did not expound upon the references that indicate that Job was aware of his sinfulness - innate or otherwise - or why we should agree that Job's claims of innocence were merely reflective of the magnitude of suffering in comparison to the degree of sin. However, upon reading his references, I think the case is firmly in Gutierrez's favor.The third prominent theme has to do with temporal retribution. Temporal retribution is the idea that all those who are healthy or unwell, affluent or poor, carefree or suffering, are as they are in accordance with their deeds. The fact that Job's life went from healthy affluence to destitute misery was a sure sign of his moral failing. Gutierrez makes the wise assessment that many current Christian paradigms either explicitly or implicitly affirm this harmful doctrine (think prosperity gospel). Job, based on his experience of innocence, ardently disavows this seemingly sound and well established doctrine of temporal retribution. As Job's friends continue to talk in circles, endlessly repeating their tired arguments in favor of temporal retribution, Job slowly shifts from a self-centered defense of his innocence to something greater. Job begins to point out the fundamental error in the doctrine of retribution, the abject suffering of the innocent. Job no longer bases his case on his experiences alone, but rather joins in chorus with all the poor and forsaken of the world. It has been wisely said that \\"a man with an experience is never at the mercy of a man with an argument.\\" Gutierrez brings this quote to life in the story of Job - showing that our experiences inform our theology. This theme allows for the fourth theme - God's incomprehensibility - to percolate until coming to full boil in ending chapters. Gutierrez allows his readers to struggle with the tension of the third theme. If God does not operate under a methodology of temporal retribution, how does he operate? Why does he allow essentially good people to suffer so unjustly? God's appearance at the end of the story, as Gutierrez contends, was precisely to answer this question. God conveyed to Job that his ways are fundamentally incomprehensible to human beings. Our inability to see answers is not indicative of there being no answers. We must have faith that God has our best interests in mind - bringing us right back to disinterested faith. Gutierrez is right, the best way to understand God's justice is to steer clear of, \\"...the temptation of imprisoning God in a narrow conception of justice (91).\\"The concluding remarks is where Gutierrez brings the firm connection between the story of Job and current Latin-American suffering. The massacres at Auschwitz have relevant bearing on how we do theology, but there are those who still suffer grave injustices and wallow alone in weakness, unable to bring their voice to a crescendo loud enough to reach our ears. People of Latin-America are wounded, stripped of their rights, tortured and abandoned on the wayside of a road we tend to avoid. And when finally approached, one must not be scandalized upon hearing their bitter complaints against the God in which their faith remains. They have right to voice these words and maybe they will say as Job said, \\"I spoke without understanding marvels that are beyond my grasp.\\" Either way, we have a responsibility to adjust the sensitivity of our hearts, rendering them attune to the suffering of the innocent. How many people suffer, not because of the action of the malevolent, but because of the inaction of Christ's followers. Gutierrez notes that just as Job's friends were at their best when silent, so we must avoid becoming \\"sorry comforters\\" and instead involve ourselves in suffering and bear the \\"mystery of the cross amid that suffering (103).\\"It must first be admitted that my initial assumptions about this book turned out to be completely false. I thought that Gutierrez's agenda regarding Latin-American peoples would hamper the scholarship and be used to manipulate the text. Gutierrez's agenda, however, only made him more acutely aware of the subtle yet important nuances in the story of Job. What stood out most in Gutierrez's commentary was his apparent familiarity with current philosophical discussions on the problem of evil. Gutierrez is no doubt familiar with the oft-repeated logical problem of evil (think J.L. Mackie). Gutierrez surreptitiously sneaks the wrench into that argument by contending that an \\"all-powerful God is also a \`weak' God (77),\\" insofar as God's power is limited by human freedom. For those familiar with the philosophy on this subject, it is hard not to see this as reminiscent of the great Christian philosopher (notoriously responsible for refuting the logical problem of evil), Alvin Plantinga's claim that, \\"there are things even an omnipotent God cannot do.\\" Gutierrez's language betrays his familiarity with other variations of the problem of evil - most notably the evidential versions. This can be clearly seen in his constant reference to God's gratuitous love. William Rowe and other prominent atheistic philosophers are wont to suggest that since gratuitous evil probably exists, it is also probable that theism is false. Gutierrez's use of gratuitous love seems like somewhat of a backlash to this strand of criticism. Nevertheless, this sort of love-language felt a little gratuitous itself - inasmuch as the text does not seem to warrant its use. We can certainly infer this gratuitous love based on other sections of the bible, but the story of Job, in my opinion, is not a confirmation of this inference. This is one area where it seemed Gutierrez was pandering more to a particular theology than partaking in serious scholarship.On the other hand, Gutierrez's fourth theme - the incomprehensibility of God - does ultimately eliminate the tension between God's goodness and the suffering of the innocent. Not only does it show that as humans we have no supra-divine standard of Good by which we may judge God's actions, but it shows that our perceptions of evil may be false at any given moment. Take for example a man who slowly awakes to find a woman cutting into his stomach. The man will rightly fuss that such an action is evil! But say he finds out that the woman is a doctor who is trying to remove a malignant mass that will ultimately kill him. Will he not then realize that what he perceived to be evil was not evil at all? This is the problem of our limited perspective and our inability to comprehend the actions of God.But Gutierrez's familiarity with these philosophical problems grows ever more apparent. Gutierrez reminds us in his book that there is pedagogical value in suffering. This is redolent of another important philosophical treatise, namely John Hicks's idea of soul-building. John Hick has pointed out the errant presupposition held by many propagators of the problem of evil. They assume, like David Hume, that the purpose of an omni-excellent God is to create a \\"hedonistic paradise.\\" Hick's analogy of their thinking is a human with a caged pet. In any respect that the animal's cage falls short of the veterinarian's ideal, then it is immediately attributed to a lack of benevolence, limited means, or both. David Hume talks of an architect that builds a home and if the economy of the home led to any discomfort or misfortune (e.g. noise, darkness, fatigue or etc.) then we would not hesitate to blame the architect. But Gutierrez, like John Hick, knows that God's purpose is not to give us whatever we want, but rather to give us the means to build ourselves up towards Christlikness. Gutierrez was able to take one of the oldest books in the Bible (Gutierrez obviously disagrees with many scholars who believe it is the oldest book as he sees the author as borrowing material) and show how it has prophetically refuted even the newest arguments from the problem of evil.Most importantly, however, Gutierrez shows us that though we are great at remembering the atrocities of the past, from the crusades to the holocaust, we are poor at identifying them while they occur. I hope this message will not be lost. I will no longer read Job and think about his solving the problem of evil, but rather his identifying the real problem: innocent people suffer while others idly pass by. Jesus' face is with the poor and weak, yet here I am amidst the healthy, sheltered and rich. Something needs to change."},{"Title":"On Job: God-Talk and the Suffering of the Innocent","review":"The Book of Job is surely one of the most beautiful and important pieces ever written. It addresses issues of human suffering, justice, evil and goodness. Read the Old Testament Book of Job first. With the preceding qualification, without hesitation I highly encourage you to purchase and study Gustavo Gutierrez's \\"On Job: God-Talk and the Suffering of the Innocent.\\"Gutierrez's interpretation is comprehensive, unique and insightful, and highly accessible. This is a book anyone interested in the story of Job, from the layperson to the scholar, can enjoy and learn from. The essence of Gutierrez's interpretation is that Job's singular suffering links to the universal suffering of the poor and underprivileged throughout human history. Gutierrez's interpretation suggests that it more the moral responsibility (Gutierrez suggests a moral imperative) of human beings to reduce this suffering than it is of God or the universe.In the biblical narrative the righteous Job is made to suffer. There is no apparent reason for his suffering. Job's three friends and \\"comforters\\" attempt to convince Job that he must have sinned, knowingly or unknowingly, and his suffering is God's wrath and punishment upon him. In other words, as Gutierrez emphasizes, Job's \\"sorry comforters\\" assume suffering is retributive justice. Gutierrez shows Job's also had assumed the universe to be ruled by retributive justice, i.e. good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people.If the universe is ruled by retributive justice, then Job's suffering is proof of his wickedness and evildoing. Job (and the reader) unambiguously knows something his accusers don't know, namely Job is innocence, righteous, and just.Gutierrez's interpretation suggests that this knowledge of Job provides him a very important insight. In short, the insight is the universe is not ruled by, nor is God necessarily committed to retributive justice (at least not to retributive justice as interpreted by human beings). Job only comes to this realization begrudgingly. Job endures 11 accusations of evildoing by five different people. Throughout these accusations Job does not give up on his innocence, but does begin to doubt the existence of justice itself.Gutierrez's interpretation maintains that Job realizes his accusers' beliefs about the relationships between good and evil, and between good, evil, justice and suffering must be wrong. This takes Job on a spiritual journey. Important for Gutierrez, Job comes to understand if he has been falsely accused, surely others too have been falsely accused. Job develops a spiritual alliance with all who suffer, the poor and socially underprivileged. Job realizes suffering, poverty, and oppression is not something that is necessarily warranted.Through this realization and via a spiritual journey, Job rejects retributive justice as the rule of the universe, and attempts (and successfully accomplishes) to get closer to Truth and to God. Through this spiritual process Job realizes he, and human beings more generally, are even more \\"free\\" than he had realized."},{"Title":"On Job: God-Talk and the Suffering of the Innocent","review":"An intriguing take on the issue of suffering and God's justice from a liberation theology (social justice) perspective.

Gustavo sees Job's author's as emphasizing Job's faith which is \\"disinterested, \\"\\"for nothing.\\"\\" Gustavo says that this \\"disinterested religion alone is true religion.\\" Gustavo also epmhasizes another theme of Job: innocent suffering. These core themes drive Gutierrez to emphasize the importance of \\"God Talk\\" that is real; that engages the God of mystery and the mystery of innocent suffering and not the stagnant God of one's own theology.Having never read a commentary on Job, I found this work quite interesting. Being approximately one hundred pages, the work was engaging, informative and readable. The aformentioned emphases, are concerned with Theodicy, how to rectify all of creation's suffering with the existence of God, and Gutierrez desires to inform others of the suffering of the innocent and how to foster meainingful dialogue and action between their experience and faith. The work offers no concrete answers in regards to suffering, rather it emphasizes the mystery of suffering, even God's sufering. Job is truly a mysterious work with various meanings, but Gutierrez \\"On Job\\" reveals a human heart's attempt to reconcile innocent suffering and disinterested religion with the existence of the divine. For anyone interested in Liberation Theology, it is a good introduction to Liberation Theology's core concerns and values. Also, if you are simply interested in Job, it is a good accessable work which holds your attention and perhaps may give you some new and alternative ways of thinking about Job. It is not a must read, but is certainly a good one."},{"Title":"On Job: God-Talk and the Suffering of the Innocent","review":"Fr.

Snow, among other things, was a social historian. Tom Orbell is younger than Lewis. He is a Fellow at the Cambridge College to which Lewis's brother Martin is attached. It is 1953. Lewis is introduced by Tom to Laura Howard. One of the younger Fellows has gotten caught in a case of scientific fraud. The man concerned is Laura's husband Donald. Laura wants Tom to reopen the case. Tom casts Lewis as a sort of elder statesman. He may be able to talk with his friends at the college. Laura decides that Lewis is no good at all.At the college, visiting his brother, Lewis sees Francis Getliffe. Lewis learns that Howard had been a moderately well-known fellow-traveler. Howard has damaged his case with college personnel by blaming his elderly advisor for the lapse. The man, very distinguished, has died recently.On Christmas night Martin and Lewis eat at the college to spare their wives the trouble of preparing another meal. Lewis is surprised to learn there that one of the Fellows, Skeffington, believes that Howard's case merits re-opening because a page received in the last batch of notebooks of the deceased scientist may support Howard's explanation of the discrepancy. When Lewis approaches Francis Getliffe to support re-opening the case, he discovers that Francis is inclined, with no particular urging of Lewis, to recommend that the matter be reconsidered. Getliffe's position in the matter is bound to sway others.In the course of taking testimony it is inevitable that Nightingale, the Bursar, be suspected of secreting a crucial photograph, (the notebook in question passed through his hands first). Fact-finding does not end neatly, but rough justice prevails.Snow's careful recital of the fictitious controversy and its solution is of great interest.

This volume is eminently readable due to the clear font and font size, it is portable, and it is the best available version of the LXX at this time (the Goettingen Septuagint, which is composed of more-recent [than Rahlfs] critical editions of most books in the LXX and is preferred by most scholars, is not readily available outside of the academic world).I became interested in reading the LXX after mastering enough Koine Greek to be able to read the Greek New Testament (GNT). It took me only a few verses to realize that there are many more vocabulary words in the Septuagint than in the GNT. As this is the case, I recommend Lust, Eynikel, and Hauspie's \\"Greek-English Lexicon of the Septuagint\\" (available on Amazon). There are few LXX tools available at the moment, and this lexicon covers every word in the LXX; Muraoka's lexicon, for instance, only covers the Pentateuch and the Prophets. This lexicon is not to the LXX what BDAG is to the GNT, but it is the best there is right now.The LXX has a mix of classical Greek, Semitisms, and (mostly) Koine Greek that makes it a more difficult read than the GNT. The versification is also different in some of the books than in English translations of the Bible (most of which are based on the Hebrew Masoretic Text [MT], which differs from the Septuagint in the just-mentioned instances). Karen Jobes and Moises Silva have written an excellent volume, titled \\"Invitation to the Septuagint\\" (also available on Amazon), that anyone should read before actually attempting to read the LXX itself. In addition, they supply a helpful appendix that gives the differences in versification between the LXX and English translations; the version of the LXX they use is Rahlfs' edition, which is why I mention the book here.I believe the Septuagint receives short shrift in biblical studies circles. The usual assertion is that it is likely to be less reliable than the Hebrew text because there are so many different versions that were written and revised by so many different people (Jobes and Silva discuss the multiple texts of the LXX). However, the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) have shown that the Septuagint may actually be more reliable than people previously thought, since many passages in the DSS agree with the Septuagint over the Masoretic Text (that is, in cases where there is a discrepancy); it appears to be obvious that the Hebrew text underwent some changes as well before it was standardized into the Masoretic Text (although Jobes and Silva provide useful and necessary information about the dangers inherent in trying to use the LXX for textual criticism of the MT). If you are interested in this line of study, I recommend purchasing a copy of the \\"The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible\\" by Martin G. Abegg et al. (again, available on Amazon) and comparing passages from the DSS, the LXX, and a Masoretic-Text based English translation (or, better yet, the Masoretic Text itself, if you also read Hebrew).Additionally, there is a group in Oregon that completed a new interlinear translation of the Greek Bible in 2006 that includes both the LXX and the GNT. Their \\"Apostolic Bible\\" includes both a Lexical Concordance and an English-Greek Index, which are invaluable tools for study of the LXX (they are currently working on an Analytical Lexicon, which also will be immensely useful since Bernard Taylor's \\"Analtyical Lexicon to the Septuagint\\" is no longer in print). This work does have two unfortunate shortcomings: 1) The LXX is missing the apocryphal books, and 2) They translated both the Old and New Testaments from the Complutensian Polyglot (rather than using Rahlfs' edition for the LXX and NA27/UBS4 for the GNT; the Complutensian Polyglot, like the Textus Receptus, contains many erroneous readings in the NT). Their volume (which is also available on disc) is only available on their website (sorry, Amazon, but I'm trying to help folks out here), which can easily be found through any internet search engine.Other books which may be of varying degrees of usefulness are: 1) \\"Concordance to the Septuagint Versions of the O.T. (including the Apocryphal Books)\\" by Edwin Hatch and Henry Redpath (this concordance is in Greek only, so it is meant for those who are fully versed in the language); 2) \\"Grammar of the Septuagint Greek with Selected Readings from the Septuagint\\" by F.C. Conybeare and St. George Stock (see my review on Amazon); and 3) the newly-released \\"A New English Translation of the Septuagint\\" edited by Albert Pietersma and Benjamin G. Wright (see my review on Amazon). Of course, there is also the older \\"Septuagint with Apocrypha: Greek and English\\" by Sir Lancelot C.L. Brenton to help the reader who wants/needs an English translation alongside the Greek text.There are additional books available that look at the history of the Septuagint and its use by both Jews and Christians, but there is a still a dearth of study resources on the LXX at this time (unless you are a professional scholar and have access to all of the scholarly literature); however, there are some helpful websites that are available to all. Again, internet search engines will enable you to locate such sites. I hope that both LXX websites and this review will be of help to those interested in studying the Old Testament in Greek."},{"Title":"Septuaginta. 2 Volumes","review":"The here presented new edition of Alfred Rahlfs's critical pocket-edition is not a fundamentally revised edition, but a moderate revision of the first edition published in 1935 by the Privileged Wurttemberg Bible Society in Stuttgart.

I am very happy with my purchase so far.As far as the presentation and binding, the book is solid, pleasing to the eye in a similar blue to the NA27, and appears durable. I originally was not too enamored with the Greek font, as it almost resembled (very neat) handwriting compared to the bolder NA27 font I am more used to. However, I have grown very fond of it, and now find it to be elegant and readable. The German Bible Society really does produce some lovely volumes!It is very enjoyable to read through the LXX text. At present I do not have any related study aids such as Lust, Brenton or NETS, so I have been using an NASB for reference until I have something better - though this has actually had a side benefit of showing me just how divergent the LXX is from the MT upon which our English Bibles are usually based. As soon as I grow an extra arm and leg I plan to trade them in for further enlargement of my Greek library, including some of the aforementioned LXX study aids.On a practical level, I am finding that reading the OT in Greek has the considerable benefit of adding shades and nuances to my understanding of the OT scriptures, and also providing a good reference point for the Greek of the GNT.Note: The German Bible Society website offers the texts of the NA27 and LXX (among others) for free online reading, though without the critical aparatus. You may want to read some of the LXX text on their website before deciding whether to spend the money on the book itself.If you know Koine well enough to get through the GNT and would like an additional challenge, this might be something that would interest you.

I explained her that the Septuagint must be seen rather as a very important historical document, being not, even at the time of its first appearance, circa 170 B.C, subject to any type of such approval, because it was mostly the work of Jewish wise men intent on providing its dispersed people with the sacred content of the Holy Book, being Greek the language of choice even among dispersed Jews, not enough familiar with Hebrew.Also worthy of notice is that Septuaginta is a misnomer for 2 reasons: first of all, there were in fact 72 and not 70(then Septuaginta) wise men charged with the task of translation; and secondly, they were devoted to the translation of the Pentateuch (285 BC) , the first 5 books of the Bible, who forms the core of Creationism, being the rest the work of countless people from various origins, as is conveniently explained by the multilingual and very interesting (in Modern Greek, Latin, German and English) prefaces and history of the Septuaginta that initiate the book. The prospective buyer has to take notice that this is only an Old Testament edition.I would say that this is not standard Greek and you will need sometimes an ecclesiastical Greek dictionary due to the lack of standards in the Greek language.

Omar Tyree's story needed some work but he tried. I loved Pearl Cleage's story as well and Margerette J. Hodge touched my spirit. She's a great writer too. I liked Tonya Marie Evans story.

Each story had a moral from an African proverb or saying and the stories were woven magnificently around them. These stories helped me relive some lessons I have learned in my life and also opened my eyes to a lot of things that have yet to happen to me. The people who breathed life into these characters should get a standing ovation.Well Done! You will not be disappointed. By the way, I am a 20 year old college student so age doesn't matter.

The diversity of the authors and the stories they wrote with strong lessons that jumped from the pages was nothing short of amazing. My favorite stories were &quot;Women Drive Buses too&quot; and &quot;Consequences.&quot;I recommend this anthology and applaud the efforts of the authors and diversities."},{"Title":"Proverbs For The People: Contemporary African-American Stories","review":"We have all heard proverbs at some point in our lives; little truths that teach morals, tell stories, or teach us how to live. In PROVERBS FOR THE PEOPLE, authors take insightful African, African American, and Biblical proverbs and utilize them to create extraordinary short stories that depict truths and leave marks on the heart.This unique anthology contains stories from well known authors such as Travis Hunter, Omar Tyree, Margaret Johnson-Hodge, Pearl Cleage, and others, as well as stories from up and coming authors. Like the proverbs they represent, the stories are diverse and full of emotions. Although all of the stories were wonderful and touching, some of personal favorites were Gwynne Forster's \\"First Thing Monday Morning,\\" which taught the morals that actions speak louder than words and to be careful what you wish for, because you just may get it, and Robert Fleming's \\"A Crisis of Faith,\\" about a man who is wrongly incarcerated.PROVERBS FOR THE PEOPLE is a wonderful novel that will teach, inspire, and entertain. It has a story that everyone can relate to, and will make a wonderful addition to any book collection.Reviewed by Latoya Carter-QawiyyThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Proverbs For The People: Contemporary African-American Stories","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

For example, one of the most phenomenal stories is by a 15-year old recently published, young lady named Tierra French with \\"A Difficult Lesson\\". I read each story and the ones I really dug include: \\"Something Special\\", \\"Flimsy and Raggedy\\", \\"Not Tonight\\", \\"A Crisis of Faith\\", \\"Senseless\\", \\"Queen\\", \\"First Thing Monday Morning\\", \\"If He Didn't Go\\", \\"A Difficult Lesson\\", \\"Back Then\\", \\"Dancing at Esperanza's\\", \\"The Consequence\\", \\"Young Ballers\\", \\"Panhandling\\", \\"John Q's Blissful Journey\\", \\"Trick Dice\\", \\"The Cycle\\", \\"Pass It On\\", \\"Felicia and the Prodigy\\", \\"Ultimate Forgiveness\\", \\"Dead to the World\\", \\"Detour\\", \\"Colours\\", \\"The Day Chano Died\\", \\"Charitable Roy\\", \\"The Fire This Time\\", \\"The Willow Tree\\", and \\"She Planted Faith in her Dream\\". You may be thinking that I liked every story in here, but believe me, there are quite a few I didn't care for. One example would be the very twisted \\"The Bag Lady\\" that I did NOT appreciate the humor about killing a dog because I am crazy about dogs the way most are crazy about babies. I thought \\"Sink or Swim\\" was an excuse for women to not lose weight. Yeah, the husband's explanation was rude but the theme behind this story is why the black community has such bad health now--we try to excuse everything. And \\"My Momma Said...\\" was a great story for golddigers. A prize is a man with money? It's like the main character didn't learn a damn thing. I hated that story. \\"Death of a Salesperson\\" needed the editor to catch that the main character said she worked at the company thirty-two years (twice!) but then switch to thirty years. And I don't know what's on Omar Tyree's bird but the use of the n-word really bugs me regardless of whether he switched it up in the end and \\"Playin' the Role\\" EMBRACED the word. Guess some people still got a lot to learn!Anyway, I ended up joining a book club so I could buy books from each of these published authors. Thank you for all the hook-ups and the people to avoid.

Several of the chapters had actually been published first as short stories - later the author built the rest of the novel around them, which may account for the criticism of inconsistent writing by one reviewer. On the whole, I lkied this book very much and would recommend it as an insightful book that compels the reader to consider the impact good art has on our lives."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This book was based on a very interesting idea of tracing back the history of a painting. When the book starts, we are introduced to a painting and its origins are in question. Through a series of short stories, we see each of the previous owners of the painting and find out where it has come from. The transition from owner to owner was choppy until later in the book. Because it is a series of short stories, I found it difficult to connect to the characters since they were only part of the book for a short time. The painting was well described, but the one on my copy of the book didn't match the description contained within the novel. A decent read for anyone who likes historical fiction."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Susan Vreeland and has written a small and lovely gem of a book.

The stories set in Holland were especially beautifully written and among my favorites. I also greatly enjoyed the depiction of the inspiration for the painting. A little book, but one that truly touched me."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Vreeland's novel &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; is at times sad, at times uplifting but always beautiful and poignant. The novel traces the odyssey of a fictional Vermeer painting from a mathematics teacher back to Vermeer's daughter.

A masterful study of human emotions and motivations."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Unusual story traces a suspected Vermeer painting back through time into the hands of each of it's owners until you find out whether it actually is the real item.

The story never resolves with the introductory chapter, which seemed to be the most logical and interesting step to take. It's nothing but a collection of flat short stories, each predictable and hurried. Only one or twice did I care what happened to anyone, as the writing style rushed along -- I understood that the painting was supposed to be the &quot;main character,&quot; but I found myself not empathizing with why the human characters would risk so much for this object. I suspect that the movie &quot;The Red Violin&quot; did a better job accomplishing what this author set out to do."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Perhaps I wanted to find some of the delight I feel when I look at a Vermeer painting or reproduction of one. But instead I found a technically accomplished work which overall relentlessly focussed on the 'brutal facts of life', which has so little to do with the qualities of love, beauty, light and mysterious intimacy which I find in Vermeer's work. A depressing and disappointing read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"If you have time for only one book this season, make it this one.

Basically the author sets out to show the journey of a paitnign from boring and cliched owner to boring and cliched owner... and tell you the exact meaning of life while she's at it. The only problem is this profound and deep understanding of the meaning of life which Ms. Vreeland is trying to convey to us seems to be something along the lines of &quot;Stop and smell the roses.&quot; Oh yeah, and &quot;Love one another&quot; is a big theme too. Anyway, the writing is didactic and sentimental. The fruits of research seem to be to pepper the writing with weird words that you have to research to understand.

I always judge booksby their covers. The quality of the story is often reflectedin the amount of effort the publisher went to to present thebook. The best part of this book was the perspective it gaveon past periods of history, as it traced the provenance ofa purported Vermeer painting. I don't know how accurate theauthor was but at least the reader can get a sense of beingplaced into a world not of one's own immediate surrounding,which most good fiction does. On the other hand, the sense oftimelessness was stunted by that all-too-common contemporarypolitically correct characterization (female writers seem tofind this irresistible) which dictates that all the virtuouscharacters be women. Once again, most of the men arefoolish, misguided, or clumsy. I'm glad I read it nevertheless."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I can't believe that noone (in 47 reviews) has commented on the fact that &quot;after all it's been through&quot; the painting gets destroyed! To me that is the most intriguing issue. Cornelius, who supposedly loves the painting, is willing to destroy it in order to avoid the shame over his father's actions. The knowledge from the beginning of the novel of the painting's &quot;end&quot; really colored my reactions to the other stories of it's history."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This book has all the feeling of a book of essays cobbled together into a book so the essayist can get paid for the same work a second time. The thin thread of the painting fails to provide a way to sustain the reader's interest from episode to episode, and the device of working backward in time leaves the uncomfortable feeling of knowing in advance what will happen to this painting that some have loved and some just possessed. I would rate the book even lower but for the wonderful description of Vermeer's technique in the first chapter! The book's small redeeming grace is that it can be read so quickly that not a lot of time is wasted on it."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The first hundred pages of this book were fairly monotonous.

Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I might as well read my own juicy but amateur stories for some entertainment.

Don't let us die on this page as bland imaginings!\\"Her creations and ideas were unrealized and her abilities (hopefully she has more abilities) unutilized. It was more like reading a book of genealogical studies, except I have often laughed and cried more at a family history book than I did with Vreeland's story. Read Girl With A Pearl Earring instead!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue, a book of historical fiction by Susan Vreeland, is an amazing read. Though there are eight separate stories in this book, they are all connected. It all takes place in the Netherlands, a believable setting since that is a real place. Also, each detail Vreeland includes about the villages and cities for settings make them seem very real.The story begins with a teacher at a boarding school who has inherited a painting from his father, and he believes it to be a Vermeer painting. The first chapter tells how this painting affects the man and what he feels about it. Nearing the end of the chapter, it is unsure what will happen to the painting, if it will be kept or destroyed. After being introduced to the painting, the following seven chapters tell a story of many other people connected to it. They have all been affected deeply by it in some way or another.Susan Vreeland is very descriptive in her writing. As I read, I can just paint a picture in my mind of each thing as she describes it. I also liked the way she divided the book into eight stories that are all connected, because you get to see how an object that passes through numerous generations can really affect people more than it seems to. It's also fun to explore all different times in history, as this book begins in the present and goes back to the late 1600's.Susan Vreeland especially develops the painting, the Girl in Hyacinth Blue, as the main character. As I read through the story, I could eventually just imagine every detail of the painting and was amazed at how an object could be such an inspiring character. The painting affects every supporting character in some way, and really makes this an enjoyable book. Also, the other characters use plenty of dialogue, making it easy to imagine each person as they came along and know how they talked and felt about things.I would recommend this book for teens or above. This would be an especially good book for people who enjoy art. However, the topics discussed in the book are ones all kinds of people could relate to. The book covers many of the things that people go through in their life, which includes love, natural disasters, and death. Overall, I think lots of people would find this book exciting and interesting to read since it is very different from any book I have ever read. It has eight very different and amazing stories that make this book a fast but very awesome read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Wonderful look at a piece of art and its history. Makes one wonder about the &quot;history&quot; of any particular piece of art or antique. If you enjoy this book, check out the movie &quot;The Red Violin&quot; - another &quot;history&quot;. Loved the writing style."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Though built upon a promising premise, this collection of short tales woven around a single \\"lost\\" Vermeer painting gets off to an objectionable start that I found difficult to get over. The suggestion hinted at by the ending of the first story, that somehow the painting itself should be destroyed because it had once been stolen by a Nazi, is unconscionable. A work of art acquires no inherent guilt through the actions of those who handle it; the suggestion is all the more inappropriate given the Nazis' own penchant for destroying art.Otherwise, most of the stories in the book were originally written and published separately, and this perhaps accounts for their somewhat uneven execution. I found the two middle stories, \\"Morningshine\\" and \\"From the Personal Papers of Adriaan Kuypers\\" to be the most compelling tales in the book, each more for the personal stories they tell than any protagonism of the painting itself."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I enjoyed this book, but had to keep reminding myself that it was written going back in time. I think I would have really enjoyed it more had I read the first story last - I actually went back and re-read it when I finished the book. While I do not believe in hauntings or possession, the painting had a curious effect on the last owner (first owner in book) and I am sure it was as a direct result of his feelings for his father and not the painting itself.I recommend this book - it is a beautiful story in my opinion.Kate"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Johannes Vermeer, the great Dutch painter of long ago, didn't alway sign his work. As of date, there are alledgedly thirty-five definitive paintings. From time to time others have appeared only to be found to be fakes. Given this, the author has proposed that there are now thirty-six of these gems, and this is where the book takes off. The story is really a collection of short stories (the way McCrae uses the technique in his &quot;Bark of the Dogwood&quot;) and each one concerns itself with the &quot;immaginary&quot; painting by Vermeer titled GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE. The author uses this painting to bind together the stories by telling us about the different people who have owened this alledged work. She begins in the 1990s and goes backwards in time.This fast-moving and ingenious work is bound to catch you off guard and of all the books I've read recently, this one was one of the more unusual. If you like the idea of this book, you might also enjoy two other books I've recently come across. The first is &quot;The Jane Austen Book Club&quot; and the second is &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood.&quot; Both unique and entertaining."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"\\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue,\\" like \\"Girl With A Pearl Earring,\\" explores the legacy of Dutch master painter Jan Vermeer. It is a fictitious account revolving around the discovery of a previously unknown Vermeer painting as viewed from several historical eras as the painting falls into the hands of new owners (done in reverse chronological order). The novel begins in the present, with a German math teacher confiding to a colleague about his father's stolen Vermeer, dubbed \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue.\\" The rest of the novel is a series of short stories that trace the lineage of the painting: the Jewish family in Antwerp that Otto Engelbrecht (the father of Cornelius, the math teacher) had stolen the painting from, an adulterous Frenchwoman in exile, a husband remembering his first love, a Dutch family in 1717 that rescued an infant in a flood, the father of the infant, and finally Vermeer's inspiration for the painting.Full of lush details that bring the various historical eras into sharp focus, Vreeland's descriptions paint the fictitious \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" not only as a remarkable painting (\\"certain brush strokes subtly changed their tint,\\" \\"the russet of the girl's skirt glistened like maple leaves in autumn sun,\\" \\"creamy yellow light the colour of the inner petals of jonquils illuminated the girl's face and reflected points of light on her shiny fingernails,\\" \\"the blue in the girl's smock, which hung in graceful folds of that luscious deep blue of the early hyacinths when the blooms are just beginning to open\\"), but as a captivating presence in the lives of its owners. Sweeping across several generations and owners from all walks of life, \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" is a fascinating read about the impact of true art on daily life, and the legacy of a truly gifted painter."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"A lovely novel which traces a painting believed to be a lost masterpiece by Vermeer from its present day owner all the way back to the painting's inception and creation. Vreeland sets the novel up as a series of short stories, each about the painting's respective owners and the spiritual/emotional impact it has on each of their lives. She succeeds in letting each story flow naturally, with imagination and gentle creativity, plucking out a moment in time in the life of each owner and allowing the reader to experience fully the circumstances of their lives, the circumstances within which the painting has comes into their possession, and the direct impact the painting has within that context. It's a daring piece of writing for a relatively inexperienced author (I believe this is her second book) and, to her credit, she handles it quite well, even if some of the vignettes are stronger and more passionate than others."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"It would be difficult to improve on the thoughtful and eloquent reviews already given, but I would like to add that this (blue, paperback) version also contains an interview with the author and some ideas for a book discussion. The latter are only marginally interesting, but the interview was very nice.I really enjoyed this book. Too often novels emphasize a gimmick rather than the story but while this novel used the device of going backwards in time, the content justified doing so, and it enhanced the impact. It gives the idea of an object's provenance new depth. Also, the cover was well-done and tied in nicely withthe idea of the book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This book is a masterpiece, like the painting (real or imaginary) which inspires it. Each short story has a life of it's own and yet when read together all are interwoven by the common thread of the painting. Some stories will appeal more than others, some are haunting and painfull; all are beautiful, evocative and real. Anyone who has pondered the relationship between beauty and money, the creative urge and the need to make a living will find this work poignant. It brought to mind Orwell's &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot; and Mary Gordon's &quot;Spending&quot;. The former is realistic, the latter utopian. &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; portrays the subject from all angles.

I wanted to read it backwards when I was done... to get all I missed... I still may! Especially recommended for artists!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Susan Vreeland, in what is to me, a very unusual format, brings to life a fictitious painting of Vermeer. So expertly is it done, that you find yourself yearning to stand in front of \\"Girl In Hyacinth Blue\\".There are a mere eight chapters...expertly and artistically created.Each one is a story in itself. Starting with a mathematics professor who is hiding a painting he believes to be a true Vermeer. His obsession with its' beauty has driven him away from the real world.He works and returns home, no friends, no socializing..his only world the Vermeer, locked in a back room.We are led in each succeeding chapter, backwards though time, in a tale of how the preceding owner gained possession and the story surrounding that particular acquisition. A fascinating journey further and further BACK in time until we witness in the last chapter the actual painting of the picture and not only discover who the artist actually was, but also the identity of the \\"Girl In Hyacinth Blue\\".I was taught in my writing classes to \\"paint a picture with words\\"...and indeed Ms. Vreeland had done just that.From a figment of her imagination, by the end of this beautifully conceived and written novel, we too can see the brilliant hyacinth blue of the young girls smock, the half-filled glass of milk, her brother's shirt in her lap awaiting the first prick of the needle as she sowed on the buttons to make it whole again, the sunlight in her hair under her starched white cap and her lovely hand which\\"had fallen palm upward on the shirt, her delicate fingers curled.\\"Ms. Vreeland has truly created a gem in the literary world.Her novel has won three awards and hopefully she will give us many, many more moments of reading joy!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"A painting hangs secretly in the basement of a professor's house. With fervor, he swears it is a Vermeer, a rare canvas by a 17th century Dutch artist. In the following chapters, Susan Vreeland skillfully unfolds the story behind the painting, gradually peeling away the years in layers that trace the work back to the artist. What is most striking is Vreeland's use of reverse chronology to build up the plot progressively. In the present, controversies created over time shroud the professor's painting. However, a journey back in time clarifies these questions as each chapter brings the reader one generation closer to the date of production, and the reader is kept in suspense until that moment. In these final chapters, the model for the beautiful painting is revealed, and the reader discovers that she is actually a plain, ordinary girl. Vreeland emphasizes that even the ordinary can have great significance and beauty. This beauty has a cost, however, as many of her characters discover. Through their experiences, she reminds us why we continue to reach for it all the same. These characters are extremely well-developed and possess strong personality traits. Rather than building her characters with obvious statements, Vreeland uses a blend of dialogue and thoughts. These illustrate the characters as thinking, feeling humans that are capable of mistakes Summing up the entire novel in the last paragraph, Vreeland concludes with a very powerful ending that shows the subject of the painting mulling over the permanence of artwork, of the fact that she herself would be stared at for centuries, but none would have known her. This theme had been repeated throughout the previous chapters, with people who had done exactly that. There is also a further emphasis that something ordinary can greatly impact others. As each chapter brings the reader farther back, a new section of history is revealed. However, the focus is less on the history itself, and more on the painting and its impact on people through centuries. Historical fiction and art fanatics may enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Maybe I'm suffering from selective perception, but is seems there has been an upsurge in books on Holland, Tulips, Dutch artists, and other Dutch lore.Having had four great-grandparents born in the Netherlands (Groningen and Sint Maartansdyke in Zeeland), who immigrated to the United States to settle in Holland Michigan in the 19th Century, I'm a big fan of all things Dutch.I'm also a big fan of Dutch art. I've visited many of the major musuems in the the U.S. and Europe, and seen much Dutch art. I've also had the wonderful experience of seeing a Vermeer retrospective and many of Vermeer's 35 paintings, some of them many times. I've also studied art history. So, I was primed to like this book.However, I didn't. It's not a bad book, it just doesn't live up to the hype on the jacket and in the reviews posted here and elsewhere. Maybe I should be glad it was so short and not terribly expensive, but Susan Vreeland writes well, and I wanted more--more plot OR more character developement OR more art history.I'm a very big fan of short stories. Either this book is a collection of short stories strung together with the artful device of a painting passed from owner to owner. Or, the book is a novel. If it is a collection of short stories, the plots are lacking. If it is a novel, character development is an issue.Maybe the book would have worked better if there had been fewer stories, or the plots were less predictable. Perhaps it would have been better if there had been more of an overlap in the various plots so that what is a subplot in one story becomes the main plot in another.Since the book is short, it can be read in one sitting but it may leave you wishing you had devoted your afternoon reading another book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This book is an &quot;odd fish&quot; offering both less and more than its promise. The first chapter &quot;Love Enough&quot; sets the stage for a book very different than what follows. This story is one of guilt over the father's role in the holocaust and the looting which obtained the picture. The story is open ended - will the art instructor accept the authenticity of the painting, will it be destroyed in an act of redemption; this open-endedness leads one to expect resolution in the subsequent chapters.The structure of the book, however, is each chapter as an independent story - some connected only by the painting, two pairs that connect only to each other. &quot;Morningshine&quot; and &quot;From the Personal Papers of Adriaan Kuypers&quot; are a pair that are an excellent piece of narrative. The first tells of a farmer's wife disappointed with the lack of beauty in her life who wants to keep the painting rather than sell it to provide for the family - including a baby it was meant to support. The second is the tale of the parents of the baby. Within these chapters, the author succeeds in presenting the conflicts of life - especially well done in the case of the farmer's wife who nearly misses her husband's expressions of love for her dreams of beauty.The second paired tales are &quot;Still Life&quot; and &quot;Magdalena Looking&quot;, the tale of Vameer selecting his daughter Magdalena as the subject and her encounter with the painting years later. The strength of these stories is the presentation of the mind behind the paintings - the drive for truth and what truth means in the context of art and what thwarts the drive to present truth through art. The characterizations of the Vameer family are well done but not the defining point of these stories.&quot;Hyacinth Blues&quot; is the weakest story, a story of an unsettled marriage of a French official in the Netherlands. &quot;Adagia&quot; is an excellent story of a long term and loving marriage - of what can and cannot be said and of actions speaking what cannot be spoken. In this story, the painting has come to be a reminder of first love. The remaining story &quot;A Night Different From All Other Nights&quot; is a well-crafted coming-of-age story of a young Dutch Jewish girl for whom the future, even a future, is an uncertainity.Throughout the work, the description of the picture by the various characters provides insight to the picture itself, to the character contemplating it, and to the relationship of art to the viewer. This later item is truly to art in general not specifically to visual art.While the construction of the book is flawed, the first story raising expectations inappropriate to what follows, many of the stories are excellent and the exploration of the art-viewer relationship is superb ... hence four stars."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Vivid, simple, and poetic, Girl in Hyacinth Blue reads like a collage of perfect little Vermeers as the author paints brief moments in the lives of several different owners of a haunting painting. Spanning the years from the present backward to the creation of the painting in the 1660's, the book is as intricately and subtly composed as one of Vermeer's paintings. Each episode illustrates two different kinds of love-both personal, private love and a larger universal love or sense of responsibility. At the same time, each episode also traces the ownership of the painting and gives glimpses of the role of art in the lives of ordinary people. Beginning with the dilemma faced by a teacher who acquired the painting from his father, a low level Nazi functionary during World War II, it then moves successively backward to the stories of the Jewish family which owned it, to a father who bought it to commemorate an early, lost love, and backward still to an the unhappy French wife of a functionary stationed in Holland and enjoying an erotic interlude. Ultimately, it regresses to the life of the Vermeer family and the daughter who sat for the painting. Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a literary gem of understated complexity."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Intriguing and engaging, this book draws the reader backward in time, following the history of a Vermeer painting. Working backwards in time to Vermeer himself, each of the owners has a different relationship with the painting, which reflect something about the individual and the time he is living in. Two months after reading this, my mind keeps coming back to the people, the painting, and the times.Girl with a Pearl Earring makes a nice companion book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I discovered this little gem by browsing the Amazon web site book review of Girl with the Pearl Earring. Susan Vreeland takes an unusual approach in tracing the life history of a fictitious artwork back through four centuries to its creation. In the process she gives us some marvelous glimpses into the lives of its varied owners. This perspective results in a very interesting and uniquely different read since the book is actually a volume of short stories connected only through ownership of the painting and the owners' interactions with that object. As we learn its history, the imminent threat of annihilation in the opening chapter becomes all the more poignant to the reader. This fact speaks to Susan Vreeland's skill as an author. We too have developed a relationship to the Girl in Hyacinth Blue, although we have never seen the painting. As with any volume of short stories there are stronger and weaker links. The whole is well worth the effort. For those who develop the yen to read more novels set in 17th century Holland, The Girl with the Pearl Earring ( Tracy Chevalier) and Tulip Fever(Deborah Moggash) make good companion books and a visit to the Metroplitan Art Museum's Vermeer exhibit this month is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"An object does not choose to whom it belongs and yet it has a history however long, however short. For in its stillness, stories are stirring. If only a painting could talk, oh, the stories it could tell. So is the case with The Girl in Hyacinth Blue. With the unraveling of each story, Susan Vreeland unveils the depth of an imaginary Vermeer painting while offering me a sense of my own history. Of German-Dutch descent, I felt like I was reading a part of myself. Somewhere along the way I suddenly knew why blue was my favorite color, itself a symbol of calm. Just like the Red Violin, each story stands in its own strength. The sentiment, the sacrifice, the suffering, the savoring. I was at once entranced and then released to another equally moving story. Walking the streets of Amsterdam, sitting in the attic with the pigeons, wanting, as the girl in the painting, so desperately for life to account for something. The stories reveal what it is to love deeply and how to let go when it is time. An appreciation for art and its history has been forever transformed for this reader. As a teacher I would highly recommend this for English teachers of all levels who want to teach the craft of short story writing and to Humanities professors who wish to use literature to breathe life into the history of art and the art of history."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a quick read -- I read it in one evening -- but, though slight in words, it is dense in images of beauty, sadness, bravado, and love. Each vignette has a different character and mood, yet all of them share a quiet clarity and poignance that draw the reader deeply into the story. True, some of the chapters are better than others (the French woman's affair with the violinist was the weakest), but all are well-worth the reading.It isn't necessary to be familiar with Vermeer's work to enjoy this book, but I strongly recommend looking at his paintings if at all possible. Being familiar with Vermeer's style will make it easier to visualize the well-traveled painting in the book. I can see the painting so well in my mind's eye now that it's almost as real to me as The Milkmaid or Girl With A Pearl Earring. If only it really existed!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"It took a while for this book to grow on me. At first I thought I was caught in another Nazi nightmare--and I really cannot stand Nazi books. But the evil fades quickly as the book follows the stolen Vermeer painting as it changes hands backwards in time from a captured Jew to a simple farmer to a haughty Parisienne all the way to Jan Vermeer himself.The novel by Susan Vreeland is a series of short stories. It becomes obvious in many places that she has cobbled together existing shorts with filler. This is the only downside of the book. Points to recommend it are the pure brilliance of her description of the painting, her meditation of the role of the artist (a subject that becomes downright depressing when the novel comes to Vermeer himself), and the descriptions of the flat and often-flooded Dutch countryside. Some say she's described a \\"beautiful\\" Dutch scenery, but having been there myself, I think Vreeland has written honestly about what the low country is: flat, unforgiving, and forever at mercy of the dikes and the sea. It's a hard country, and for that reason, beauty is so much more astonishing when it emerges from the land."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This simple story was easy and entertaining to read. It's art, it's art history and history in general. I liked the reverse timeline and having to think back to the last chapter read to see how this new chapter comes into play. I liked that each chapter was it's own story and even though the chapters were brief I felt I got to know the characters well. Being an artist and having studied art history I enjoyed the perspective of this book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Vreeland does a wonderful job with this book, which follows the life of a painting, from the present day back to its creation. The style of the story is reminiscent (albeit in reverse chronology) of the movie Tales of Manhattan (Ginger Rogers, Cesar Romero, you remember), which follows a tail coat through its remarkably adventurous life. What makes such a journey insteresting is the way the painting is bound inextricably to the scandals, loves, secrets, and desires of the characters who, at various times, own it. Reading the frankly personal chapters, I almost felt like a private eye, tracing the painting's history and linking the characters together.While Vreeland doesn't claim to be an art expert, she does a wonderful job describing the nuances of the painting, and she clearly has admiration for the craft of the artist. I very much enjoyed this book, and it reads surprisingly quickly. You can easily finish it in one or two sittings. A real gem."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This book traces the history of a lost Vermeer back to its inception in a series of short stories that hang together as a novel.It is a small book, no bigger than a video case, finely crafted as the Vermeer it is about. Although I usually am not interested in historical novels, I found the historical details about Holland very interesting.For such a small book, it resonates in the mind clearly."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"a lovely novel of art, love, faith and history that envelopes you into it's embrace the further back in history you go"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The reason I liked this book so much is because I have taught &quot;Vermeer&quot; in Art Masterpiece to third graders for the past five years, and it made the art and the artist much more real for me.I am scheduled to teach art masterpiece this week and I plan to tell the kids about this book as a modern example of how art can be used in literature. (I usually tell them about the place in a book by Marcel Proust where a character with blood poisoning falls to his death while in a museum looking at &quot;View of Delft&quot; and exclaiming, &quot;The little yellow wall, the little yellow wall!&quot;)I also liked the way Vreeland structured the story from present to past--a clever technique that made the reading fun.

The characters capture your sight, and you feel as though you can experience the depth of their emotions. The characters literally come alive on the page.

It leaves the reader with something to ponder."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Creatively, Susan Vreeland's book is pretty special. Eight stories that move backwards through time that revolve around a Vermeer painting. Through each of the stories the painting manages to evoke particular feelings in each of the narrators, demonstrating the power and allure of art. As much as I appreciated her craftsmanship in the storytelling, the stories themselves left me a little cold. I didn't really have any kind of emotional attachment to any of the characters, so consequently I found myself being more of an observer and less of a participant.Still, it's a fast moving and easy read, and for people interested in art and artists, this would probably be an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"In her book, Girl in Hyacinth Blue, the author Susan Vreeland presents her subject matter in a unique way. Focusing on an unknown Vermeer portrait, the author takes her readers from the present back to the time when the painting was actually done. But this premise isn't conveyed in the traditional manner of a flashback but rather as a series of inter-related stories as the painting goes backwards from the previous owner's hands to the next previous owner's hands.Who knows what treasures lurk in an ordinary home? When an art professor is invited to a to the home of a colleague, he is shown what the owner says is an original Vermeeer which nobody knows anything about. How did this professor get the portrait, wonders the art professor and why is there no provenance or mention of it anywhere in the art world? Could this in fact be the 36th portrait done by Vermeer which somehow became lost over the centuries? And now the author has set us on a course as wevhead backwards in time. And among the periods of time we travel to are the early days of the rise of Hitler, then to the court of a count, to flooded areas of Holland and finally to Delft where we first meet Vermeer in the home of the man who has bought most of his paintings so that Vermeer can feed his 11 children. And finally we are there as Vermeer begins to paint his daughter Magdalena. And it is up to Magadalena to tell the story of what happens to Vermeer, her family, herself and and what happens to this very portrait in the future.While I enjoyed this book, I did have some reservations. Close on the heels of reading Girl With a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier which also focuses on Vermeer, I felt that Girl in Hyacinth Blue lacked some of the wonderful descriptions of the artist and his craft. Whereas in Tracy Chaevaliers's book one could smell the paints and see Griet who served as Vermeer's model for the portrait with the pearl earrings and turban, Girl in Hyacinth Blue, seemed to gloss over these aspects concentrating on the characters in each story. And while the characters were well drawn, some of the stories failed to hold my interest as much as the others. But all in all, these were minor reservations and I would recommend this book to others who also enjoyed Girl With the Pearl Earring, the movie The Red Violin and even Jerry Seinfeld's espisode which also began with the end."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I really enjoyed the book, especially the descriptions of places. however, sometimes I was confused on the timeline because of the changes in each chapter.

Lovely and enjoyable, with fascinating details of Vermeer's technique and life in The Netherlands."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a lovely historical fiction with a twist~the tale is told backwards starting from the present and working its way back in time. The main character is a painting~supposedly a rare original by Vermeer. Knowing nothing about art history, this means little to me. Luckily, you don't have to know art history to enjoy the book. You just need to enjoy reading.The painting currently hangs in the home of a man whose father willed him the painting. The man anguishes over the idea that his father got the during a Nazi raid on a Jewish home. I thought that was going to be the story line, but that is not really what the book is about. The plot follows the history of the painting back in time to when the artist painted the portrait of his daughter.The brief glimpse into each family's lives is just enough to make you wanting to learn more about that group of people. The idea of a painting (or any object for that matter) touching so many people throughout history makes me even more intrigued by the idea.The characters are gentle and endearing. The story kept me reading~I finished the book in two days. The setting (Holland) makes the novel a bit exotic.I think you will enjoy the beauty and gentleness of this unusual historical fiction.Melissa"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Is it, or isn't it? That's the question the painting Girl in Hyacinth Blue: is it a Vermeer? The history of the painting is traced backward from present day to its creation in a series of vignettes, each of which could stand on its own as a short story. The painting has an impact upon each of the lives of the owners, and Ms. Vreeland spins each tale deftly. It's highly enjoyable and entertaining, a wonderful, fresh, and unusual read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The thought of a newly discovered (or suspected) Vermeer painting would be an art world wonder. This book is a string of stories connected to the painting, tracing back through the years of how the identity papers were lost, etc. to make it a giant question at the beginning. The tales are more of the people around the painting than anything else, and it is interesting to see what a painting would go through to make it into modern times.However, something just lacks in this book. Dry writing perhaps. The ultimate hook never really latches onto the reader and no motivation to continue the book once one of the stories is over. It never really grabbed me as a reader.I'd suggest this to art lovers. Personally, Chevalier's 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' was much more entertaining."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I know the comparison is odd, but since I just saw Memento a few weeks ago, I find it appropos -- both the movie and this book start in the present and work their way to the past. This style works well in the book although it may disorient the reader momentarily as we slide back into time. The author does a nice job researching the time periods so that the book reads with a fine sense of historical plausibility. I enjoyed the various intertwined stories although at times they read more like separate vignettes than a novel (but they were separate stories). Overall I preferred another current Vermeer book, Girl with a Pearl Earring because it focused more on Vermeer and less on the side characters. This book focuses on the effect of a Vermeer painting on various families which is at least an interesting take on events. A short book, well worth reading."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This is a small and pretty book full of secret surprises. The author takes us backwards in time, tracing the origin of a (might-be) Vermeer painting. The players in each of the eight stories have full character development and each describe the beauty that has come into their lives along with the painting - you almost might be rooting for one or the other to be able to hold on to this precious work of art. An unanswered question looms for the reader at the end - and whether the painting was destroyed or not is a secret the author has kept from the reader."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I hate this book. I had high hopes because some coworkers raved, and I enjoy Vermeer and art and all that. But please...this overwraught, oversentimental thing made me yawn two pages in. The language is cheesy and even the interesting premise--following the painting's life from end to beginning--couldn't save it. The love scenes are laughable and the sad parts made me cringe. I suffered two weeks worth of bus commutes trying to wade through it."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This was an extremely disappointing novel that did not flow well and was not well written. It did not live up to my expectations AT ALL.I found out by reading the interview at the end of the book that the chapters were actually short stories that had been published at different times. That explained why they did NOT seem to flow well at all.She wanted to keep the reader in suspense as to whether or not it was a Vermeer. The first chapter was the most recent and it worked back to when the painting was painted, but. . . That didn't flow well either. It seemed jerky and confusing, having the backward chronology, plus the last chapter wasn't actually the &quot;last&quot; if the chronology was being followed fully.The idea for the story line was good, showing the power of art and following a painting from conception to now, but that was overshadowed by the unexceptional writing. There was, for me, only one memorable character and I've already forgotten most of the plot. I really think this book could have been so much better.If you want to read a book about a Vermeer painting, skip this one and read Girl with a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier. I can't recommend that one enough--it's been well over a year since I read it and the plot is still as fresh in my mind as Girl in Hyacinth Blue should be."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The concept behind this book is great: how many times have each of us seen a painting and wondered where it had been and what kind of lives and hands the art has passed through?

The book is a nice journey through history."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Susan Vreeland beautifully tells the fictitous tale of a piece of artwork by J.

The stories are not connected very well although they build on each other, the transitions from one story to the next are not very good but the concept works if you treat each as a standalone story. Where this novel really shines is in Vreelands descriptive prose. She excels in evoking the emotions and feelings evident in a piece of art work, even if the art is fictional.

Centered around one Vermeer painting, the book retraces the lives the painting touched--from modern day to its creation--and takes the reader on a remarkable journey, painting a perfect picture of each moment in time. I was particularly struck by the level of detail the author incorporates into each story. The amount of research Ms. Vreeland must have done to create this book is awe-inspiring, and yet it never feels like she was merely reciting facts or including details just because she had done the research. From the mixing of Vermeer's paints, to the workings of a Dutch windmill, to the tragic history of the Jews in The Netherlands, the author fills each segment of the novel with rich authenticity and depth of emotion. Ironically, the one phony thing about the book is the Vermeer painting it's centered around--but then, I suppose the ultimate fate of the painting made it necessary for it to be an invented Vermeer. I felt as if I had been on a trip through another world after I finished this book and I will never forget how the author shows the reader, as we look through Vermeer's eyes and through the eyes of the painting's owners, to look for beauty in commonplace things."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I needed a little book to read after I've been taking on two mammoth novels that I have yet to finish, and I found almost near perfection in this \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\". Sometimes I'm a little sketchy about reading short books, for a lot of them cannot fit a really good story in such small a package. I was proved wrong in this case.The story is about a painting a math teacher received after the death of his father. Letting a student in on the secret, the teacher swears it is a Vermeer, and from then on the story is about the past owners, eventually tracing back to the daughter of Vermeer that posed for it. With each story, the people who loved the painting so, experienced damnation or salvation in its presence. It saved the life of a little baby in 1717, and brought a new beginning to a French woman trapped in a loveless marriage in 1800. However, in 1900, it brought sorrow to a wife, for her husband was reminded of a past love because of the girl in the painting. And during WWII, the last owners, a Jewish family in Holland, were deported to camps soon after the paintings purchase, and it then fell into Nazis hands.This book reminded me how art can be fascinating beyond the picture itself. Besides what it is of, it also tells us how far it has traveled through the centuries and across borders, from artist to buyer, and from family to family. Perhaps that eventually helps make it so priceless and valued.Anyways, a great book for anyone who loves art, and especially the painter Johannes Vermeer.

You can feel a little bit of yourself in each of the stories as they see the painting from each of their own unique perspective. A great read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This bittersweer yet vibrant novel has many highlights that reward the reader throughout. Author Vreeland paints an amazing history of a mysterious and hidden work of art, making character after character come to life as she describes their various ownerships of this painting. The journey of the painting throughout the text will fascinate readers with an appreciation for classical art or art history. Vividly depicted scenes demonstrate the heart-felt desire for artistic beauty felt by many, despite social class standing or unbringing. As with any commodity, art and art collecting is deeply intertwined with monetary considerations, fashion and power. All these factors influence the owners, and the history of the picture.Written originally as several related, but separate short stories, each chapter takes you back to another tale of the painting and its possessor. Supplimental naratives were written to fill in historical gaps; each story remains a complete tale in itself. Put together in reverse chronological order, this literary device works to stunning effect in this novel. The mystery of whether or not this painting was actually created by a famous old master, and how it began its long, fascinating journey are kept under wraps until the final chapter, when all the pieces and emotions rendered throughout come to a sad and realistic climax.This is not necessarily a happy work. The focus is frequently on sadness and loss, but always realistically portrayed. Sometimes life is wonderful, but sometimes life is something else. The author was fighting a potentially terminal illness at the time of writing, admitting later that it heavily influenced her style during the writing process. Like Newton's Law of Action and Opposite Reaction, she really connects with the fact that most times, where there is a gain by one person, there is a loss by another. Or to get something, or keep something that you need, you have to give up something else with tremendous value. That's life.This book is highly recommended for its originality and honesty, the exceptional use of reverse chronological order, and a beautiful and fluid story. There is an interview with the author at the end of the book, as well as a brief reader's group guide with discussion questions.

I stopped reading on page 17 (MacMurray & Beck 1999) where Cornelius quotes a character as saying, \\"So I shoved my boot up to the Jew-boy's dirty ass.\\"Vreeland says that \\"Cornelius would never now be sure...\\" [if this quote was from] \\"...memory or his own swollen imagination\\". What is sure, however, is that the scene and the words were conjured up by Vreeland. Not remembered; conjured.I see no intrinsic need for the author to have planted a fictitious story involving true history, great art and a young girl into the particular ugly framework she chose. To be sure, there is a documented case of Hitler lusting after a Vermeer painting (one he eventually bought), and of Nazis en masse plundering valuable artifacts under the banner of anti-Semitism. I understand that we must remind ourselves of history lest it is allowed to repeat itself. But in Vreeland's hands, to use such language and such imagery as artistic devices appears to me incongruous, gratuitous, and shamelessly exploitative."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Vreeland skillfully takes the reader on the wonderful journey of a painting.

Set mostly in Holland and The Netherlands the Dutch names for places can be a bit difficult to pronounce but do not detract from the overall power of this small book.Each individual story line is easy to follow. My only question would be what ultimately happens to the current owner of the painting (who is afraid to show it to the world since his father obtained it through his position with the German police during WW II).I highly recommend this book.Marion Marchetto"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"A wonderful book with unexpected surprises and twists.

And in my opinion, each short story gets better and better (I did not like the first two.) I was also slightly disappointed because I was expecting another Girl With a Pearl Earring, which I loved.

It is short and simply written, but the concept behind it is so wonderfully intriguing. The book moves backwards in time, telling the story of a Vermeer painting from the current owner, a college professor who obssesses about its beauty and provenance, through to the girl who was the subject of the painting.Every chapter deals with the picture not only in a different time, but also from a different perspective. The actual painting is described by the characters each time, through their own aspects and interpretations.A refreshing, compelling and rewarding read from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This is the first work by Vreeland I have read, and I enjoyed it immensely. The progression from the present day backward in time is unique and it works well. A very pretty little package, too, making this a natural choice for a small gift. You won't regret buying it."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"In the opening of this moving work of fiction, an undiscovered Dutch master's painting, circa 1665, is shown in secret to a professor of art. He is qualified to classify it as a genuine and theretofore undiscovered work of Jan Vermeer but is reluctant to do so because of the shady auspices of its acquisition: it had been seized during Nazi occupation. Since the acquisition is less than honorable, ownership of the painting is both a blessing and a curse. This theme is beautifully woven throughout the story.The impact of this simple portrait of a young girl is immense. Admirers are drawn to the blue of the smock she is wearing, the \\"pearl\\" of her eye, the luminescence of the light streaming through the window near her. And, although the subject is depicted engaged in the simple task of hand sewing, it is obvious that there is something very, very different about what was going on when this painting was being made.Through eight gorgeous and historically detailed chapters, author Susan Vreeland masterfully follows the ownership of the painting backward through time. As she plants and waters the seed of exploring the human ability to become attached to inanimate objects, we are given a view into the life and relationships of each successive owner.The challenge of the first set of characters is an awesome one: how to adequately enjoy something which is, technically, forbidden to own. Immediately, the reader's curiosity is piqued on many levels: Of course, What is the origin of this painting? But also, How does one come to terms with ownership of artistic property gained by questionable means? How can one enjoy it? And, of course, we ask ourselves again and again, if the work is authentic, if the work was actually done by Vermeer. And, if it was, what was the origin? Who is the subject? And, as we may ask ourselves in the case of the famous Mona Lisa, what was the subject thinking while she was posing and how did the composition come about?The challenges of each of the subsequent owners are as awesome as the professor's. And while each has a unique story, all of them are similarly enamored of the same stranger's work. And the delight and the pain of their human drama connects their stories while demanding our attention to a poignancy and delicacy that is unforgettable.As the author draws us in tighter and tighter to the humble creation of the painting, we can fully appreciate how one person's work can impact the lives of many strangers.With wonderfully human characters, a highly engaging and thought-provoking story line, and beautiful, painterly prose, *Girl in Hyacinth Blue* is a glorious and fresh work of fiction, and a book capable of entertaining while also having a deep, marvelous impact on the reader."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"As a professor of literature, I can attest to the grandeur of this little book. Here is a series of eight short stories that are more than discrete tales, they represent a backward tumble into the history of a painting. If you have a narrative prejudice that requires a main character struggling against fierce odds, you will probably not understand the power of this book. The main character never speaks, never acts, never does anything. Rather, the \\"lost\\" painting of Vermeer compels fierce emotions from all into whose hands it falls. But there is more to this tale-told-in-pieces. As we travel back to the moment of inspiration that created the work, we understand something central to the concept of art itself. In the modern world that opens the novel, Vermeer's painting is viewed as something ethereal. Almost unreal in its beauty, the painting has acquired something of a soul of its own by the twentieth century. As we travel back through its owners, the painting diminishes ultimately to a piece of commodity, something with value to be sold that will do nothing more that financially enrich the holder. The questions raised by this little gem of a novel (to what degree is beauty determined by future generations? what of our world will be stripped away for the convenience and through the prejudice of our children, grandchildren, and their offspring? what is the nature of art?) will keep you pondering this book, and its hearfelt, tightly written chapters, for many weeks after you set it down."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Well researched historical fiction at its best. The most appealing aspect of this book to me is the unique manner in which it is presented. The author tells the story of the painting by giving us as an account of each owner, leading us back to its creation. The question in the back of the reader's mind is always whether the artist was actually Vermeer. Intelligently written with a clever use of language and a vast array of interesting characters, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Vreeland will be an author I add to my list of favorites. I would give this book 4.5 stars. Kelsana 8/27/01"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The book traces the history of a possible Vermeer painting through history. As we follow the painting's past, the reader is given a glimpse into the very different lives of its owners in eight short stories that are linked through the painting. Vreeland characterizations and ability to convey emotion are excellent. She is also convincingly perfects each story so that it is its own universe, yet part of the whole. Each story is distinct and each story rings true. Of the stories, &quot;Adagia&quot; shines. It is simply outstanding in its depiction of a long-married couple. Unfortunately, I didn't give the book five stars because a few of the stories can really drag and are a really a chore to get through. Still, an interesting read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Susan Vreeland \`s Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a most unusual novel. Positing the existence of a 36th Vermeer painting, the book explores the power that art can exert upon us to the point of obsession.The book is essentially 8 different yet interrelated short stories about the circumstances of the historical owners of the painting in question, the Girl in Hyacinth Blue. The transition between stories is accomplished through a series of interlocutory vignettes concerning the circumstances of Vermeer's life and the actual creation of the painting. Although I actually like Vermeer's work, I knew next to nothing about his personal life and found these passages quite interesting.On the whole I found the stories quite compelling as well, though there were a few that would have benefited from a bit more development and a more thorough presentation.However, on the whole I found the book quite riveting and entertaining. In the end I was left wishing the painting did in fact exist-even without knowing what it actually looked like--the cover illustration aside-I felt a bit obsessed with it myself. That Vreeland could evoke such a feeling says a lot about the quality of her book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This was the third novel I read about Vermeer's paintings At First I was unsure of how related all the stories were,but I was not disappointed. Each story transported me to a world of struggling people and how a work of art affects or transforms their lives. The final story in \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" is narrated by the daughter of Vermeer. Although fictitious, her dreams,desires, and longings are so natural for a young person, and I was so moved with it that I was in tears by the end. If you want to be transported to a faraway time and place...and yet feel your can identify with each character, read this book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Susan Vreeland has written a lovely and thought provoking novel with well developed characters that will remain with you long after the final page.

After thoroughly enjoying GIRL WITH a PEARL EARRING (Tracy Chevalier), I was intrigued by this book by Ms. Vreeland.Despite their major similarities, the general plot idea and structure was quite different and unique. While Ms. Chevalier's novel dealt with the life story of Greit, the fictional subject of Girl with a Pearl Earring, GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE begins in modern times with the current owner of the painting. Each chapter is a short story unto itself and yet they are all connected by ownership of the painting as we travel back in time to the time when Vermeer actually painted the masterpiece. Throughout the story, the power that the painting had over the emotions and actions of its owners is explored. Therefore, it is ironic when Vermeer's painting subject doubts her own self-worth and her ultimate importance in the world.A very helpful companion to both this novel and Ms. Chevalier's novel is VERMEER: THE COMPLETE WORKS (Arthur K. Wheelock, Jr., 1997) because it features all the Vermeer painting discussed in these tales.This was a very entertaining short novel and I would highly recommend it, especially if you truly appreciate the power of art!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The concept of this novel, tracing the history of a painting by going back in time chapter by chapter, is just my cup of tea. Susan Vreeland has done an excellent job in transferring this unique notion to paper. I've always enjoyed antiques and wondered about its origination; Girl in Hyacinth Blue was like a dream come true in that respect.The story begins with math professor, Cornelius Engelbrecht. He was bequeathed a painting from his father, who claims it a masterpiece by the Dutch artist Vermeer. There are no papers to prove this statement; however, the bigger picture is the way Cornelius's father obtained the painting...a way that has haunted him all his life.Each chapter moves back in time to the previous owner of the painting. Readers follow the painting from the wall of Cornelius's father to the actual inspiration and creation of it. Each vignette houses new sets of characters with the painting as its central core. Slowly, with each turning page, we reveal another part of the painting's history, layer by layer, and what it has meant to the people whose lives it touched.Girl in Hyacinth Blue made for a wonderful reading experience. I recommend this novel to those who enjoy lovely period pieces or like getting to the bare bones of a story. A very in depth and beautiful premise. I have Susan's next book on my list."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Susan Vreeland lovingly pieces together a quilt of provenance in this book; instead of cataloguing a dry list of names and dates of ownership for the imaginary Vermeer painting of a young girl sewing at its center, she provides the reader with interwoven stories beginning in the present and traveling back in time to 17th-century Delft that explore the circumstances of its inspiration, ownership, secrets and renunciation. In doing this, she succeeds in exploring the emotional, aesthetic and sensual ties that bind people to art and to each other across time and place. The strength of this book is its core of tenderness, which sometimes teeters on the verge of sentimentality, especially when Vermeer is the subject, but thematically anchors the disparate stories. Vreeland's language, however, does not often match Vermeer's delicate pictorial vocabulary; she is often awkward and overwrought and her sense of period detail is spotty. Read this book for its insight not into Vermeer's art and his milieu, but the human heart and its everlasting craving for beauty and connection and peace."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot;,eight short stories of a possible Vermeer masterpiece, is a work of art in itself. Vreeland paints with artful, descriptive thoughts, as her palette and brushes. She takes the reader backward through time on an adventure that gives an inner view of the families that have owned &quot;The Painting&quot;and how it's beauty touched there lives. Her detail makes one think that she must have lived through all of these times. She skillfully renders, the artist who,&quot;Painted Her&quot;, and his turbulent struggle of balancing his duty with reality as a father and husband........... and as an artist, struggling to focus at the center of his Art. Vreeland touches that vulnerable part of every artist who feels that they are alone in that same struggle. The feeling at the end of the book is ,&quot;Just one more story....&quot;"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"When a shy, private-school math teacher, Cornelius Engelbrecht, discovers a canvas thought to be a Vermeer, Girl in Hyacinth Blue, a touching and beautifully-written book, begins a fascinating journey back through time to trace the history of the painting.Engelbrecht's father's dying words had been, &quot;An eye like a blue pearl,&quot; referring to the female figure in the painting, that of a young woman in a blue smock and rust-colored skirt, standing beside an open window. Although Cornelius feels captivated by the painting, he also feels a sense of shame at how it came to be in his father's possession.From the revelation of what, exactly, the elder Engelbrecht did, we then move backward through time from the point of view of one owner to another, all the way back to the painting's point of origin. Each time the painting changes hands, there are high hopes, a time of optimism, until it finally falls into Cornelius' hands and he realizes how it has been tainted by history. The single thread running through each story, the one that connects each character, is this lovely painting, the painting of the Girl in Hyacinth Blue.One of the most fascinating things about this lovely little book are the details of family life and the history that can be found in each vignette. Like the painting, each &quot;story-within-the-novel&quot; seems to be a frozen moment in time and Vreeland's language in painting her own word portrait is both formal and concise as she offers lush detail and wonderful insight. Much in the book is tender and sad and it truly touches the heart. We feel the pain of these characters and identify with their suffering. They are real people and we can almost believe the painting is real as well.The central section of the book, and the one that is most fascinating, is called &quot;Morningshine,&quot; and focuses on a Dutch family who are isolated in their farmhouse and surrounded by floodwaters. The following passage is indicative of Vreeland's beautiful, but rather spare, prose:&quot;Saskia opened the back shutters and looked out the upstairs south window early the second morning after the flood. Their farmhouse was an island apart from the world. Vapors of varying gray made the neighboring four farmhouses indistinct, yet there was a shine on the water like the polished pewter of her mother's kitchen back home. Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear, and it was so, she thought. But it wasn't so. And the cow would have to stay upstairs with them until it was so, however long that was, stay upstairs messing the floor and taking up half the room.&quot;The above-passage clearly shows Vreeland's talent for evoking a sense of time and place. This is in evidence throughout the book and makes it highly atmospheric and charged with the energy of the times.Moments of serendipity are scattered through Girl in Hyacinth Blue as are the harsh realities of the times: hunger, poverty, misery. At one point, in Saskia's story, she is scolded by her husband for feeding their hungry children the seed potatoes he intended to plant in the spring.This is a fascinating and extremely well-written book, a little masterpiece, just like the Vermeer it creates. It is a book that will appeal to readers of popular literature and those with more literary tastes as well as to art lovers everywhere. Beauty, says Vreeland, is necessary to life. Judging from the beauty of this book, beauty might be just as necessary to life as are next season's seed potatoes."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Susan Vreeland has magically grouped a series of short stories and takes the reader from the present day owner of a Vermeer painting back in time to 17th century Amsterdam and the young girl who was the artist's subject.Along the way, the reader is treated to magnificent insights into the effects paintings have on those who view them, the bonds people make with art, and the joy and hope that a painting can give to even the most destitute.The story of Vermeer's rendering of a young girl gazing out the window begins at a posh boys' academy. The current owner, a professor, is considering destroying the work to make amends for his Nazi father's sins. The future of the painting remains in doubt, but its history unfolds in a remarkable series of vignettes. Most notable to me was the story of a young farm wife who, in the midst of trying to survive a great flood, finds the painting with an abandoned baby boy in a boat. An attached note says &quot;Sell the painting. Feed the child.&quot; The reader is also treated to other stories including that of a young Jewish girl, a middle-aged man who remembers his first love that he lost, a couple whose marriage dissolves---all these events and more witnessed silently by the young girl in the painting.If you enjoy period pieces and revel in being part of the poignant moments in the lives of people, you will enjoy this remarkable little story."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"All I did was open the book. From the first page I couldn't put it down. Never have I appreciated Vermeer so, until I saw his work through Susan Vreeland's eyes. Novels that transport the reader to another time and place are rare these days. This one does. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I was very impressed by this book. I admired the author's ability to handle multiple time periods with such fluidity. And to express the full range of human emotions and complexities without hystrionics. There was a touch of restraint throughout, a quietness that mirrored the contemplative nature of the painting. And with every story, the painting was described differently so that I never tired of hearing about it, and the painting meant something different to each protagonist. One of the most important aspects of visual arts is to touch the viewer somehow, and the author brought that out beautifully. She also handled major historical events as well as intimate family relationships, the micro to the macro, with such confidence. I feel this was one of the best books I've read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"There is so much more to life than mere existence and the everyday requirements of survival if only you strive for it. That's what I feel after reading this little gem. There is beautiful art; there is the joy and love of those around you; and there are amazingly beautiful lovely books like this one. Everything is right about this wonderful novel. Most good books tell a story that doesn't leave your mind right away. This book has a handful of them! Every chapter is a complete world of real characters. Each one could be a novel to itself. But Vreeland has woven them together into a beautiful storyline and has an amazing ability to fill every word, every sentence with meaning and vision.I commute to work, and I read books on the train. I finished this book last night, and today I did not bring a book with me. Instead I stood with my eyes closed and thought about this book the whole way, and the opening sentence of this review is what it led me to. Now if that is not a sure-fire way to tell you that this book is special and lovely and memorable, I don't know what is.Buy it. A true gem."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I bought this book as a Christmas present for my daughter and ended up stealing it myself. It is a small book in a beautiful package, yet the content is large, complex and serious. I learned about history, art, and writing as I read. I travelled in time as I followed the painting back to its origins. This was a perfect book to escape into, and a lovely book to own."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I recently reviewed &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; by Tracy Chevalier. That book was a wonderfully realized account of what may have transpired in the life of the great Dutch artist, Jan Vermeer, at the time that he painted the lovely work named in the title. Susan Vreeland's &quot;Girl in Hyacincth Blue,&quot; is a painting that also may be a Vermeer (we don't know for sure until the end). She traces the history of the painting's owners starting in the 20th century and going back to 17th century Amsterdam. The owners of the painting include, among others, a repressed professor whose father obtained the work under questionable circumstances, a married man who looks at the painting and remembers his first love with longing, and a poor woman who loves the aesthetic qualities of the painting but needs to sell it to support her family. Vreeland explores the themes of how a beautiful work of art has different meaning for different people and how great art has a timeless quality that can survive for centuries. She also explores the price that an artist must pay in order to fully realize his vision on canvas. One problem with this novel is that Vreeland's vignettes are not equally involving. For example, one chapter that deals with a marriage in dissolution is less interesting than the others. In addition, as soon as the reader gets involved with one set of characters, the chapter ends and the characters disappear. This constant change of cast makes the novel a bit choppy. On the plus side, Vreeland beautifully brings to life the relationship between humanity and great works of art. She also skillfully depicts aspects of the culture and landscape of the Netherlands over the past four centuries. One chapter that focuses on the very difficult struggle of Dutch farmers to keep the sea at bay is particularly vivid. Vreeland's &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; is, overall, an uneven but often fascinating look at the creative process and the meaning that art brings to our lives."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I wish I had read this before I read The Girl with the Pearl Earring. That book overrode any references this book makes with regard to Vermeer's genius.But that is not to say the books are similar. It's just that, particularly in the final chapters, Vermeer's genius is too shallowly presented.The Vermeer in this book is a fictional work, and the treatment, following its provenance back through time, is a worthy idea. How much do we wonder at the hands throughout time that have held a masterpiece? Consider how rapt we were at the history of The Red Violin.Each chapter explores the times and personal hardships of its historical owners, but each owner, I think, is dealt with in a summary way. Each life could have been dealt with more thoroughly. But I found that one could easily leave off reading this at the end of a chapter and that's why I called it a good vacation book.I also found that Vreeland used the painting as a sort of talisman, bringing good fortune to the good, and bad luck to others, with a couple of exceptions.All in all an interesting idea, well worked."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Susan Vreeland has given us nine gifts wrapped in one book in Girl In Hyacinth Blue. Each of the 8 stories is in itself a wonderful gift - a story complete and rich and thoughtful. The the ninth gift is the book itself. The total of these stories is greater sum of its parts.

Notably, he left few paintings, less than forty, and died in poverty, leaving his family full of monetary debts. Since Vermeer usually didn't sign his paintings, it's hard to tell if they are authentic or fakes. Many paintings believed to be Vermeers were discovered to be fakes, and vice-versa.Susan Vreeland's book is in fact a collection of short-stories concerning one immaginary painting by Vermeer, named \\"Girl in hyacinth blue\\". Using the painting as the binding element, she tells the various stories of people who possessed the work of art, beginning in the late 1990s and going back to the time Vermeer painted it.I noticed that many people believe that this book's main theme is to know if Vermeer was really the author of the painting or not. This is wrong. This book is not a whodunnit, but stories of relationships, loss, fear, forgiveness and love. The painting is only the central artifact, but each story has its own distinct characters and situations. Each story is complete in its own way, but I think the author could develop them some more. Or maybe not, maybe the most charming aspect of the book is that it's short.Anyway, a fast, emotive and very enjoyable reading.Grade 8.6/10"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The Girl in Hyacinth Blue offers a unique perspective. The main character is not a person, it is a painting and each chapter is about one of the lives it affects. Because each chapter is about a different person and the book goes backward in time it can be a little confusing. I also did not like that some of the chapters have been previously published as short stories. The book felt pieced together until the end which flowed a little better. Despite this, the book makes you think about what it means to really know someone and about the things you value in your own life."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This book fascinated and pleased me.

The eight stories which vaguely map this history challenge the structures of human relationship by delving into the private world of the observer...and hovering there in the tension between passion and perspective.To read the stories in the context of chronology (ie, backwards from the end of the book) is to read of the decline of the personal in favor of the proprietal. To read them in proper order is to join Vreeland in a conspiracy of engagement in human love and passion for life against chronology, current culture and the 20th century's most heinous crime."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This is not a book or genre I would normally have picked to read, but a good friend recommended it to me and I was amazed myself by simply loving it. What made the book so interesting and special is the way Vreeland structured the whole story. It is very innovative and refreshing to read such a well written story.They story revolves around a possible 36th Vermeer painting - there are only 35 in known existence. Vreeland makes the painting, in a sense, the main character and whole book revolves around the people that have been touched by it. I don't want to give too much away, because I read it without knowing anything about the book and that makes the unfolding of the story extra special.I like the compactness of the story, but was amazed by the writing. It's one of those books you don't want to finish."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"What is the role of art in life? To anyone who loves Vermeer and can identify with the magic of his paintings, this book will touch a chord. but, even if you don't know Vermeer, the book is touching in how it focuses on how art, a single painting can transform even an &quot;ordinary&quot; person's life. I saw the Vermeer exhibit in Washington, D.C. a few years ago and I came away tremendously moved by his ability to capture a single, private moment on canvas and let the viewer share in that moment. I can see how some might be bored or impatient with this book. The stories are uneven, I probably would have given it 3.5 stars. It is a quiet book. It raises some thoughtful, important issues."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I am a reader's advisory librarian and am putting this book on my recommended list right now. This book is a compilation of eight short stories that all come together because of the character's fascination with one painting.Unlike some other reviewers, rather than the issue of &quot;If It's a Vermeer,&quot; I truly feel that the heart of this novel comes in understanding that though we are all different, we can each be affected in the same way by art.It's a beautiful message that I feel is especially poignant in this time where we often seem to look for differences more often than similarities in our fellow human beings.This book is an easy read (I read it in one evening) and should appeal to readers who enjoy historical fiction as well as art."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I had read Tracy Chevalier's GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING, which I absolutely loved, so it was with trepidation that I began to read GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE - I was worried it wouldn't be as good. Shame on me. The two books are extraordinary in their own right, and deserve not to compared. GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE is a marvelous reverse pentimento of a little known Vermeer painting - starting with a completed work of art, and tracing its byzantine provenance back to the moment of its creation. The interweaving threads of human tragedy and joy surrounding the painting make for a rich and emotionally charged tale. I went out and immediately bought a book of Vermeer's paintings after reading this, imagining the utter absorption and family chaos that surrounded his life and work - a life and work that Susan Vreeland brings to glorious life in this lovely, lyrical book. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"A beautifully written book about so much more than a painting. The author gets across the love and pull of art, and the importance a piece can have in a life. The only drawback to the book was the time shifting was a bit confusing."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Susan Vreeland's novel &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; is a short, entertaining read, but I found it to be slightly disappointing and very lacking in character development. The dialogue that the characters used with one another sometimes seemed to be on an elementary level, and I didn't feel that Vreeland fully developed the feelings of awe and adoration that her characters supposedly had for the mysterious Vermeer painting that touched their lives. In fact, the painting's beauty was glorified much more than the reactions to it, which were sometimes hollow, empty and cliched. While the idea of going back in time to observe the lives that the painting has touched was indeed an interesting one, I felt that Vreeland did not do enough with this concept - she seemed so overeager to group a bunch of lukewarm short stories together into a novel that she missed the greater and more rewarding challenge of expanding on the storylines that she created. There were characters in this novel whom I wanted to get to know, but never did! It was as if I was being hurried along toward an ending that had no particular purpose. However, Vreeland had some great storylines in this novel, but she just didn't go anywhere with them, and this reader was left feeling a little shortchanged. I have to admit, the glowing reviews that this book had received both from critics and avid readers surprised me in the end, but nevertheless I give it three stars for the potential it had, and the occasional stirring images it drew."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Not only is the writing style unique as Vreeland takes us backwards in time, but her word choices are well crafted. I had to read the book again within a 3 week period and planned to skim it. I just could not skim. Every word is perfectly chosen. To read the story was like creating a painting of people, landscapes, hopes, heartache, history, and love in my mind. As a lover of art and words, the combination of both I found very moving. If you enjoyed it the first time, read it again. Although we never know if the painting is destroyed, we have the opportunity to see how many peoples' lives it touched. That idea is so much more important than the outcome. The story teaches us that a work of art often outlasts its creator and can touch many souls well into the future. As a mediocre artist, this book gives me the desire to continue to create. Touching, uplifting, sweet, and executed with devotion."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The book follows a Vermeer back through history, with little stories about how it touches the lives of the people who see it, own it, or love it. Vreeland does a great job creating a history of the painting, &quot;tracking&quot; it from the present-day owner back to Vermeer. In every instance, someone's obsession with the painting changes their life, sometimes for the better, and sometimes not. While of the stories are gripping,others just fail to engage you. It's a neat idea for a book, but the realization was a little spotty in places. Definitely worth reading, but be prepared to stick out a couple of chapters that may sag a little."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This book is a masterpiece, like the painting (real or imaginary) which inspires it. Each short story has a life of it's own and yet when read together all are interwoven by the common thread of the painting. Some stories will appeal more than others, some are haunting and painfull; all are beautiful, evocative and real. Anyone who has pondered the relationship between beauty and money, the creative urge and the need to make a living will find this work poignant. It brought to mind Orwell's &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot; and Mary Gordon's &quot;Spending&quot;. The former is realistic, the latter utopian. &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; portrays the subject from all angles. Illuminating and perfectly balanced, quite beautiful."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This is truly fantastic collection of stories. The fact that Susan Vreeland focuses not on technique or the actual process of painting allows the reader to focus on the emotions and actions of each of the painting's owners. The slightly disjointed nature of the stories and variations in writting style reflect the variations in characters themselves. The most wonderful thing about this entire book lies in the fact that all our questions are not answered and every thing does not tie up into a nice, neat little package. As a result, this novel a reflection of real life."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I loved the way the author was able to capture the poignant vignettes in the painting's past--but more than that, she is able to describe what the painting *means* to each of these past owners and viewers of the work. The book can really set you to wondering about the histories of some other famous works of art: Did they ever fall into a river? Did an owner add some details on a whim? What moments of history have they been witness to? I found myself turning to the jacket artwork time and again, wishing I could see this painting and share in the extraordinary experience."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I really loved this book. I do have to admit though, at the beginning I kept having to remind myself that the stories were going backward in time.I really do not love short stories, but this really attracted me, each story related to the one painting, and each story so connected. This is my first book by this author, she writes with such beauty and insight....I look forward to reading her others."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This is the first time I've ever read anything by Ms. Vreeland and I found her topic and storytelling to be very entertaining and very descriptive. This story tracks the path of a painting thought to have been created by Vermeer and we follow it from present day to back to the day it was created. This is really a story that is made up of several short stories each standing on it's own and the different effects this one painting had on each owner. I found this to be a very entertaing read and look forward to reading my by this very talented author!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This is an excellent and unusual novel which chapter by chapter and layer by layer exposes the history of a fictional Vermeer. Each layer of the story is unique and interesting and keeps the reader guessing as to both the authenticity and origin of the painting as it is passed from owner to owner. The languge of the book is fluid and the concept a refreshing change of pace."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Susan Vreeland's Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a thoughtful, richly historical tale about the fortunes of a Vermeer painting. Read in tandem with another popular novel about the great Dutch Master, Tracy Chevalier's Girl With a Pearl Earring, any reader would have an enjoyable and literary short course in 17th century Dutch painting and culture.One of the finest artists of the Dutch Golden Age, Johannes Vermeer painted ordinary people, often women, bent over their sewing, reading letters, pouring milk. Unexciting to imagine, but riveting to view. Besides the dazzling colors--said to contain the \\"dust of crushed pearls\\"--he illuminated life's smallest moments, making them seem less sentimental than profound.Which is also the task of the best short stories, and Vreeland's novel is really a collection of short stories. They are bound by common themes and characters, all possessed by a striking portrait of a young woman looking out a window, lost in thought, brilliantly clothed in hyacinth blues.Beginning in contemporary times with an owner who came into the painting from his Nazi father, the story goes back to the 17th century and the very day of the picture's inspiration. A lot happens in what is essentially a quiet and literary book. There are floods, witch-hangings, infants abandoned in rowboats, and adulterous couples caught with their breeches down. Historical backdrops include the Nazi occupation of Holland and the era when Dutch ships bullied the high seas, looting and colonizing the East Indies and sending slaves to the Americas.But the story's rich characterizations override the outward dramas. You feel the stony grief of the young Jewish girl in an Amsterdam no longer safe for Jews; the turmoil of a great painter harassed by domestic pressures and the impossibility of perfection.If the first chapter is the book's weakest--melodramatic and unlikely--the final two chapters are heartbreaking. The girl who inspired the painting is Vermeer's daughter, who would rather be a painter than a muse. But he is blind to her desire and ambition.Vreeland conveys the poetry of the Lowlands' landscape--the humped, iron bridges, gently hued marshes and lively skies. By telling us the first words taught to a baby-- \\"cow\\" and \\"water\\"--she captures the dominance of agriculture and the sea on Dutch life.Girl in Hyacinth Blue accomplishes a great deal in its compact canvas. What it has to say about human beings--our lost potential and the ways in which we let beauty slip from our grasp--is unbearably sad if you're in a mood to notice.Reviewed by Rebecca BurkeAuthor of When I Am Singing to You"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This book was recommended to me by my mother and typically, I adore the books that she suggests. However, this book left me wanting more and was not as good as I was expecting.The story follows the path of a Vermeer painting from present time to when the picture was created several hundred years ago. Through the story, it passes through 7 owners. The painting is described as a beautiful young girl, who is looking out a window day dreaming. She has sewing materials as well. Each owner relates to the painting and has a philosophy of what the girl is thinking; and for some, it also reminds them of loves lost. Most of their stories were sad, but all felt a connection to the painting. Each chapter shares the story of a different owner as well as what was going on in their lives. The last 2 chapters is Vermeer painting the girl and his story and the girl's story 20 or so years later.Vermeer only painted 30 or so paintings and most of the owners recognized its great value.While the premise of the book (hearing the story of each of the 7 owners) is interesting, the beginning 2 chapters were so intriguing that I wished that the author would have continued further with this line rather than jumping to the next owner. The next 2 owners didn't feel connected to the rest of the story as the other 5 owners. For those middle owners I felt that there were details missing in how they came about owning the painting so it felt disjointed at times. The last 4 chapters the story felt connected. However, after 2 chapters of somewhat a disconnect, I felt the book lost much of its momentum.While I thought the book was good, I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars if chapters 3-4 had more details so that the reader could more easily follow the path of the painting."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The title of Girl in Hyacinth Blue could also be titled Life of a Painting. All who read this book will enjoy art more because of the wonderful description of the painting and the way the owners of it enjoy its beauty.Set in Amsterdam from 1939 to 1945, the story gives a wonderful history of the life of the people during WWII. Since the story gives the historical account of the painting Girl in Hyacinth Blue from present day to its beginning, you're reading a memoir backwards to find out how the painting came to be in the current owner's home.Enjoy an easy read while you learn."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"When reading the book Girl in Hyacinth Blue, by Susan Vreeland, I found that it was a good and interesting read. The book takes place in the 1800's and although it isn't very modern, it was still relatable to modern times and easy to understand where the characters were coming from. The book wasn't a challenge to read, it was very basic and straight-forward with what was going on. The plot itself was based on a rare painting and how it affected each different person who gained possession of it. It wasn't a page turner and it was easy to guess what was going to happen next. The characters all had this sadness that came from their attachment to the painting while it was a part of their lives. I enjoyed how the author made all the characters different and the only thing they had in common was their unique attachment to the painting. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys rare paintings and anyone who wants a good quick read. Overall, the book has a pretty interesting concept. When analyzing each of the stories separately and then putting them all together, you begin to realize how one painting can so powerfully affect many different lives."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I loved this book. It starts in modern times and goes back through all the owners of the painting to Vermeer who painted it. They all loved the painting and tried so hard to hold on to it but alas, were not able to. They were all mesmerized by its beauty. All of the owners found something about it that made it all their own. I would whole heartedly recommend this book!!!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This book is a gem, like any and all of Susan's novels, it is superbly well written and carefully researched. The characters are engaging and the story compelling. A delightful read!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This is the story of how beauty affects those around them. The main character is a long lost painting of a young girl, barely into her teens, sewing, but also staring out a window and daydreaming. About what? Would she like to be out and about instead of confined to her domestic duties? Is this a Vermeer painting? Vermeer was known for painting quiet domestic scenes. This seems to be a search for beauty among the ordinary, the joy of life or joyex d'vivre as the French would say.Some of the paintings owners would have like to keep it, but weren't able to.The present owner of the girl's paiinting was a strange mathematic teacher in a private boys' school. He shows it to an art teacher, another of the schools' instructors and tells him how he obtained it. The painting is kept hidden in the teachers' house and the only one to know about it is the art teacher. The math teachers' father has left it to him. The man was a low ranking Nazi officer who stole it from a Jewish family when they were sent to a concentration camp. The painting was akways to be kept secret.The next story deals with a man whose wife wants to give the painting to his daughter and her soon to be husband as a wedding gift. Laurens doesn't want to part with it. He was busy watching his daughter and his soon to be son-in-law together and is jealous of their youth and new beginning in life. He confesses to his wife that the girl in the painting reminds him of the long lost love of his youth. He treated his love badly so she left him wanting to never hear from him again. Digne gets over her anger and tells Laurens to be happy for who he now is. Digne keeps the painting and the couple realizes how lucky they are to have each other in their later stage of life.Then further back in time a French woman steals the painting from her husband and sells it in order to pay for her trip back home to France. She does not like the Netherlands, it is too provincial, she is tired of her cheating husband, she does not like the lifestyle of this country, and she wants to go home. So she does.Further back in time, possibly in the year 1717. The dykes have flooded the countryside close to the ocean. A family is living on an island surrounded by water. This is their home now, a mother, father, a boy and a girl. Then a basket containing a baby and the painting has been placed in their boat. Who is the baby? Who is the girl in the painting? Could the girl be the baby's mother? The home she lived in seemed to be a wealthy one. The housewife looks at the painting and wished her home was so fine. But hers was crowded and wet animals and everything else crammed into little space. The family decided they would have to sell the painting in order to be able to live. The mother would have loved to keep it, but couldn't. Food was more important than beauty. So off she goes, gets into her boat, floats to shore and goes from town to town trying to sell the painting until she gets a decent price. The painting had been stolen by a young man from the home of his aunt. Why?At the same time a witch was hanged for killing her child.The mystery ends at the close of the book. The reader finds out who the girl is and who the artist is who painted her portrait.This is a great and different way to tell a story begining with the present and ending back to about 1670-73, a time of approximately 300 years. The story is beautifully told, with good and well writen sense of time and place.and also good characterization.There is a video about the story of 'The Girl in Hycinth Blue.' This video made me want to read the book. Both are done excellently."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Some people might be disappointed with this book after reading Tracy Chevalier's \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring.\\" Yet like a Vermeer, Vreeland's book drew me in with elements of mystery. And also like a Vermeer, it gave no straight, linear \\"story\\", but rather allows us to decide for ourselves the significance of its portrayed themes and emotions evoked in us. The vignettes are incomplete, but just allow enough of a glimpse into the pivotal moments of people's lives and how they interact with beauty in their lives.This idea of interaction and response to beauty, also introduced via the opening Keats poem \\"Ode to a Grecian Urn,\\" is key to why it differs from the Chevalier book. Chevalier presents an interesting plot, but it is like a picture book illustrated by Vermeer and more visual than cerebral. Although accessible to those reading only for a plot, Vreeland's book seems to more of a meditation on art, timelessness, and beauty. Its depictions of the 17th century Netherlands, the physical qualities of Vermeer paintings, and the bittersweet juxtapositions of people's external troubles and their solace of finding that inner quiet space via Vreeland's imagined Vermeer painting add extra layers of complexity.The book's weaknesses, I found, lay in the overly sentimental narrative, the unconvincing shifts in some of the character voices. And it panders to the book club crowd with its inane discussion questions. Yet the last few chapters of the book are exquisite in some of their insights and language. Overall, it's a well-crafted book that may grow with you if you reread at different stages in your life. I read it for the first time 7 years ago, and rereading it for the second time a few weeks ago, I discovered new things to appreciate.If you enjoy reading poetry for its visual images, are moved by the beauty of simple, seemingly mundane moments in life, or liked the movie the Red Violin, you might enjoy this book too. As Vreeland illustrates in her book, our response to books and art is often a reflection of ourselves and not always of the book's externally deemed \\"value\\" or \\"worthiness\\" of your time."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I like the idea that the history of the painting is traced back through time to its conception.

I did have difficulty realizing when the the story shifted from one family to another at times. The chapter titles did not help...perhaps a time line with the chapter title. I wish the painting was real and we could gaze upon the young girl's face in the painting. Her countenance seemed to mesmerize the viewer and cause much reflection within the various stories. I certainly wished that Vermeer had painted more. Not only did the book cause the reader to reflect on the richness of the character protrayals, but to think about how art can impact our own lives. The story is also study of historical events and how they relate to the families in the book and a small biography of a wonderful artist. I invite everyone to read this book. It certainly has made me reflective. I think this will be a great discussion book for book clubs."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This book is an excellent example of life in Australia during and after World War 11.

I did enjoy it, but gave it only 3 stars because there were several things that I didn't like about it. One, is that the stories were almost overwhelmingly sad and depressing. Someone mentioned that the author wrote this book while she had cancer--well, that all well and good to get your emotions out, but couldn't she have done it in a journal instead? Of 7 stories, 5 of them just take the life out of you. No resolution to them, just despondancy. The other two weren't as sad, but still, the characters suffer loss or are living with unfulfilled dreams. What was the purpose of doing this? To put all readers on Prozac?Second, was that the dates were hard to figure out on some of the stories. She might have just put the date on the top, so we know when it was taking place. In one story, the farmer speaks of \\"this new century\\" so I just assumed, judging from where it was in the book, that is was the beginning of the 20th. But how beginning? Did the story take place in 1900, 1910, 1920? Same for the story before it. I assumed the date to be early 1800s, trying to piece together the hints the narrator gave, but why not just tell the reader when it takes place. Also, the story of the flood. You don't know it's 1717, or have a clue, until you read the next story, which dates it. Very poor technique.Third, not all of the stories flowed together well. The first two were connected, but then we skip back to presumably, early 20th century, and we have no idea how the owners came by their painting. And then it seems to skip back in time 100 years, and we have no idea what it was doing in between, or who own it. It then skips another 100 years...there is no connection between the first flood story, the Frenchwoman in the Hague, and then the farmer in the early 20th century. There are approx. 100 year gaps between them, and we have no idea what happened to the painting in between.Fourth, there is no resolution. I was hoping that we would return to the original narrator and find out what Cornelius decides to do with the painting, or if it does officially get declared a Vermeer. The story just ends with the painting being auctioned in 1696, and that's it. There was nothing to tie this all together and made for a very dissatisfying ending.Finally, it is hard to believe that Cornelius would think of burning the painting just because his Nazi father took it from the home of Jews who had been deported. It was a bit melodramatic, that this painting has totally controlled his life. Yes, his father was a Nazi, and he took the painting. So Cornelius can now turn the painting over to the Dutch government if it torments him so. To preserve his anonymity, and the memory of his father, he can ask someone else to do it. I don't know, there were a lot of ways to deal with this, but the story of the son living a tormented life is just so cliche by now. But at any rate, this book did need a resolution.And the end of the story broke with the backward chronology. The last chapter should have come before the one before it.It's a good book, entertaining, and Vreeland is a good writer. But it leaves you empty because you want to know more about the characters. Perhaps if she had limited the number of stories, and revisted each one several times, it would have been a more satisfying story."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I had high hopes, but I expected more of a literary quality in this book.

There is nothing new here for anyone who has heard the word &quot;nazi&quot;, and mediocre prose to convey a listless and painfully forced story."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"It is quite possible the first time you actually stop reading and put down the short-fiction book Girl in Hyacinth Blue by Susan Vreeland may be as you complete this wonderful tale. For me this was a &quot;one sitting&quot; book.The story in the life of a lost masterpiece by Vermeer and the souls captured by its very existence is extremely compelling.Vreeland's narrative is as smooth and refined as a layer of varnish applied by the master artist himself. The words within each of the related stories are rendered in such a fashion that is is almost impossible to avoid feeling you are an active observer of history being made."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I don't normally submit reviews, but I found this book to be good enough to write one. It is actually a series of stories about a &quot;lost&quot; painting by Vermeer. The author's style is such that she varies the tone of each story to match its flavor, which was refreshing. The painting and the lives of those whose hands it passes through are skillfully depicted in her telling. I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Susan Vreeland's novel begins on a simple note: an art teacher is invited into the home of a colleague, and is shown a breathtaking painting of a young girl staring out a window, her sewing forever arrested in oil on her lap. The colleague claims the painting is an original Vermeer. The art teacher cannot quite accept this as truth, despite the erudite proof of the colleague, because the painting has no provenance, or line of succession, to prove its origins. Its existence is undocumented and therefore suspect. Thus the novel is launched. Vreeland takes her readers back in time to each of the painting's owners and their heartbreaking stories that lead to their surrendering it. The line leads back to Vermeer himself, with the girl who posed for the painting having the final word.I read this brief novel in one sitting and yet felt completely satisfied upon its finish. The comparison to Tracey Chevalier's GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING is inevitable given the subject matter, though in my opinion, Vreeland's book has greater depth and is told more skillfully. Because she weaves a history of the Netherlands into her tale, one gets the feeling of the sweeping changes that accompanied the eternally wistful expression of the young girl with &quot;an eye like a blue pearl.&quot;I highly recommend this book for general readers, particular those interested in fine writing, art, and historical fiction."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"A collection of short stories told in reverse chronological order and held together by the presence of one painting. The earlier vignettes, or the later chapters of the book, are captivating as the Dutch lowlands and windmills take center stage in Vreeland's narratives. Characters have short-lived moments in the book, but that is okay once it becomes clear that the central character is the painting. The book is not long and it is easy to complete in a short time. An enjoyable result from reading the book, is that I found myself constantly looking at objects that have been around for a while, old coins, old buildings, and reflecting about the connections and stories these objects could tell about earlier times and people that have long departed. I found the book worthy of recommending to my middle school age kid, so it is fine for young teenagers."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The concept behind Susan Vreeland's GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE is an interesting one -- a beautiful painting, claimed by its present owner to be a previously-unknown work by Vermeer, is followed back through time, through its various owners, to the time of its inception and inspiration. A challenging premise -- but in the hands of Vreeland, it works very well.The novel starts out in the present day -- a reclusive university professor invites a fellow faculty member (an art professor) into his home, after the funeral of a dean. There, in his study, he reveals to his fellow teacher his most prized possession, a beautiful, luminous painting of a young girl looking out of a window. The art professor admires the artist's skill, calling it 'remarkable', a 'beguiling imitation' of a Vermeer. When the painting's owner reveals his belief that it is, indeed, a Vermeer, the art professor presses him for information as to how his father (who bequeathed him the work) came by the painting, and we are off on our journey.Along the way, we encounter many people who have possessed the painting over the past 300+ years -- and, as a microcosm of humanity itself, we find that they are simple, pure, pretentious, generous, scheming, talented and manipulative, in turns. It's a fascinating way of looking at the world 'around' this work of art - and, ultimately, many ways of looking at the work itself.The book is both well-written and entertaining -- and, overall, very illuminating, both in relation to art and to human nature, a highly recommended reading experience."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I loved this book! Vreeland's language is luminous, like Vermeer's paintings, and though each story effectively stands on its own, the sum total is greater than each of its parts. I am looking forward to her book THE PASSION OF ARTEMESIA due in 2002."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"What a wonderful little book! As I was reading this, I couldn't help but make little comparisons between it and Girl with a Pearl Earring, a book which was quite a disappointment to me. Both books tell a (fictionalized) story of a Vermeer painting; Girl in Hyacinth Blue, with its backwards timeline, managed to grab my attention with the first story, and once I started, I ended up finishing the entire book in almost one sitting!I definately know what I will be recommending that people read, instead of Girl With a Pearl Earring!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this story. Each chapter is a story within a story. The common factor between each chapter is a beautiful painting of a sewing girl. The author starts the book in present times and introduces the reader to the current owner of the painting. Each successive chapter links the painting to the various owners of the painting, and traces its roots back to the artist. This was a very quick, relaxing read. I was intrigued by the cover of this hardback because it almost shows the entire painting, but not quite. Much was left to the imagry provided by the writer. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I found this story to be enchanting and wonderful. One of those books that was hard to put down and I was sad to reach the ending. Searched for Vermeer's paintings to see which one might be the subject of the book. Would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue proposes the existence of a 36th Vermeer painting among a professor's possesions. Vermeer was a famous Dutch painter who lived in the 1600s, and he often painted girls with a simple description in the paintings' titles: \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\\" for one. \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" features a girl in a smock the color of the sky of Heaven.The novel is composed of chapters that look like short stories (at least, that's how I interpreted it). It starts in the present and goes back in time, an interesting literary technique. Cornelius, the professor, had obtained the painting from his German father, who rounded the painting up during a raid on a Jewish house during World War II. The stories trace the painting's history back to Vermeer himself, and among the characters that the painting touches, there are resilient housewives, maturing young women, illegitimate babies, and the Vermeer family. Especially in the beginning, the stories do not seem to have any meaning or any connections to the other stories, but some keen observations point out that yes, all the stories are linked together.Some stories are better than others - I really liked this one: a family finds a baby and a painting in the river with a note (\\"Sell the painting\\"), but the housewife cannot bear to sell the lovely painting because in the dismal farm life, there has to be some beauty in it, too! As the food supply dwindles, she struggles to part with the only beautiful thing she has for money. I could feel the anguish and the longing glances she had toward the painting in this short but lovely story/chapter.The following story/chapter was also breathtaking. The chapter demystifies the lingering question of where the baby came from and depicts a haunting love story that tragically ends in death. Perhaps this is the chapter that gets me to love short stories again because I think this can stand by itself as one.These two stories are what left me amazed, but the so-so quality of the other stories is what prevents my giving this book 5 stars. The other stories were, in writing style, somewhat bland and lacked good transitions, and I saw that other reviewers took note, too. Nevertheless, for a good book on tracing a lineage (here, a painting's), I do suggest this one, simply because of the two stories I found so enchanting in here."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"What does a college art professor from the modern age and an 18th century witch have in common? Susan Vreeland weaves a truly wonderful story backwards in time, exploring the history of one picture as it passes from hand to hand and century to century.This is a beautifully written book that tells the story of a single painting by Dutch Master Vermeer. Tracing it's movement from hand to hand, the author brings to life each individual story surrounding the owners of the painting. As a reader I was immediately drawn into each individual story.A wonderful book and one I would highly recommend. I look forward to reading more of Susan Vreeland's work."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a creative &amp; charming novel of a fictional Vermeer painting. The novel details each of the lives of the various people who have owned the painting-either how they came to get the painting or pass it on and what importance the painting comes to play in their lives. Each chapter is a short story of it's own, beginning in the present and working it's way back in time through the actual creation of the work of art. I really enjoyed how Susan Vreeland took us back in time and the creative way in which she pieced each of the owners together. In the end I was left with a powerful feeling for many of the characters, both the artist, his subject and several of the owners. Not only was the story entertaining, but the themes that run through out the book are very thought provoking. The story touches on differences in perceptions of beauty, appreciation for the fun in life and the importance of love-how each of these play into giving one a sense of meaning and purpose. After finishing this book, it is still provoking much thought within me."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I know what you're thinking. Is this going to be one of those artsy &quot;literary experiences&quot; where almost nothing happens? NO! Incredibly, this book is pretty much of a page-turner, with a group of inter-connected stories about a fictional Vermeer painting. The book is done backwards, with the contemporary story first, followed by the World War II story, the turn of the century story, etc. It works beautifully! The characters are so well drawn that you'll come to know them well in only a few pages and you'll CARE about them. You'll also care about the painting, so remarkably word-painted by Ms. Vreeland that every nuance of it is indelible in the mind. When you finish the book, you'll turn back to page one and start again. One of the best books ever, and I read evrything from Sidney Sheldon to James Joyce."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I am a reader's advisory librarian and am putting this book on my recommended list right now. This book is a compilation of eight short stories that all come together because of the character's fascination with one painting.Unlike some other reviewers, rather than the issue of &quot;If It's a Vermeer,&quot; I truly feel that the heart of this novel comes in understanding that though we are all different, we can each be affected in the same way by art.It's a beautiful message that I feel is especially poignant in this time where we often seem to look for differences more often than similarities in our fellow human beings.This book is an easy read (I read it in one evening) and should appeal to readers who enjoy historical fiction as well as art."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This was one of the best books I read all summer! It develops wonderful characters, creates a marvelous plot line, and emphazises the theme of the influence of art on lives. When a man shows his beloved painting which he believes is an original Vermeer to his friend, the friend claims it could be a fake since Vermeer's work had been copied in the 1930s. With that the chapter ends, but the book just begins. With each chapter, Vreeland creates another short story, with different, but always real characters. Only one thing stays constant - the painting. Each chapter/short story takes the reader back in time to the previous owner of the painting until at the end, we learn if the painting was a real or a fake. What a wonderful premise for the construction of a novel. This book is a delight and we need to hope Susan Vreeland continues to write more books!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I have never seen a Vermeer in my 21 years of existence, But now, I would love to see one and appreciate it. Appreciate art and beauty for what it really is - magnificent and large. That's what this book meant to me. In all its richness - stroking like a paint brush on the canvass of the readers' hearts - Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a winner all the way!The 8 Stories are woven around the imaginary painting of Vermeer and of love not being enough most of the time. From a father's misgivings to Vermeer's Daughter's Passions and so much more defines this 242 page, according to me masterpiece.It could have been any painter, any artist - because Ms. Vreeland's style is so unique and new that she could have given words to any painting. Any picture that speaks a thousand words, that touches the lives of so many, is sometimes so isolated and unappreciated. The girl in the picture, as the story progresses represents beautiful things for different people. It portrays poignancy heightened by the mysteries of giving and losing. Only in the end to seek the truth- beauty for what it really is!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I was awed by this book, by every facet of it.First the concept, to trace the history of a fictional portrait painted by a real-life great master by writing separate vignettes tracking backward from the present over the course of centuries to the work's creation.Second, the effort that went into each of these vignettes' background. Author Susan Vreeland did enough research to have written a dozen distinct novels.Third, the imagination Vreeland displays in her various stories. Each story has its own voice and the author--without question, deliberately and successfully--fails to signal her own feelings on certain moral issues she examines.Finally, the language, which consistently is lyrical, though the tone changes with each vignette.THE GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE is writing at its best. Susan Vreeland deserves every accolade for this fascinating book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"What an interesting book! How cleverly Vreeland creates a fictional story based on, but not exclusively about, the Dutch artist Vermeer. The premise is this: Starting in current times, she traces back through the ages the various owners of a painting that may have been painted by Vermeer. Vreeland takes what is clearly insightful knowledge of the life and work of the artist and creates a series of separate stories in which the common thread is the ownership of the painting entitled, &quot;Girl In Hyacinth Blue.&quot; It's a fascinating approach, and one that sparked my interest in Vermeer's life, thoughts and intentions in painting. It also explores the relationship between an owner of a work of art and the piece; this painting, the one consistent &quot;character&quot; in the novel, takes on a different significance in the life of each of its owners. This is a very enjoyable read, and a perfect lead-in to another Vermeer-based novel, Girl With A Pearl Earring, by Tracy Chevalier."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"What really threw me at first was that this book travels backward through time -- it really is like unpeeling an onion to get to the inner layers. The first chapter starts in the present, with a painting that may or may not be a Vermeer. How did its present owner come by it? Why does he hide it from view? These questions are answered in the next chapter, which is about the previous owners. And so it goes, each chapter moving backwards through the painting's parade of ownership. Some owners believe it a Vermeer, but most believe it's a copy by one of his contemporaries. It is not until the last two chapters that you learn not only the origin, but the inspiration for the mysterious painting and how it came to start on its journey.I thought this book was marvelously written. Each chapter was like a short story in itself, connecting with all the other short stories until the final product was a very complete and fascinating view of the history behind a single painting. Each chapter was very much its own little world, painstakingly drawn to be different from every other place. You will never be able to look at your simple objects again without wondering what stories they might tell, if only they could!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; is a testament to Vreeland's ability as a writer. She uses her words to paint eight very different stories about the people who have owned this painting throughout time and their struggles in life. Some, such as the math teacher who owns it in the first story, have deep psychological secrets to face. Others, like the French diplomat's wife in Holland have boredom in a shallow world with which to contend. Yet what ties these very different stories together, besides ownership of the painting, is the way in which Vreeland makes the painting itself the focus for all of these characters.I especially enjoyed the way she was able to create a sense of time and place over the centuries and still make the individual characters come alive within the space of a chapter. I had just prior read &quot;The Girl with a Pearl Earring,&quot; and found it interesting to see how she would develop the character of Vermeer himself. His aloofness from the day to day concerns of life, even his making of the paints in the attic, were very similar to his depiction in &quot;Pearl Earring,&quot; suggesting that the historical research of this artist was thorough. &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; is the type of book that one will want to savor, yet at the same time find difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The concept of this book fascinated me from the beginning. However, the telling fell short of my expectations to be amazed. It's worth the read for the history involved in the handing down of an unknown masterpiece-just don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"While I found this novel to be well written, I didn't become emotionally moved by it as a whole. I have a problem when novels don't give me a truly in-depth look at the characters. Because this book pretty much consisted of several short stories based around the theme of a painting, it was a hard for me to become emotionally attached to many of the characters. While I appreciate art, I wouldn't consider myself an art lover. Maybe that's why I had a hard time being attached to an inanimate object as the main character of this novel. I did like a few of the stories. The last story which focused on the creation of the painting was my favorite."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I don't like short stories (I read so quickly that by the time I'm really into one, the story is already over), and in fact, I read this book in about half an hour, but I had a strong feeling of wishing it were longer. Each story is carefully crafted and there are a variety of themes that run through all of them and connect them. The author has a really effective way of describing art without it sounding &quot;artsy&quot;, so that even non art buffs can imagine why this painting was so meaningful in the lives of the people who owned it."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I loved how the story was about the painting and how it has touched so many lives through time. So often in life we do not think about how our actions will affect other people, and this told the story of a painting that did."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I loved this book. It was fascinating how she tracked the painting back to its origins. I wish she could have expanded on each of the stories - they all seemed so real to me."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The reason I am rating this three stars is that I felt that there was an inconsistency in the quality of the writing and at times the stories were weak. Each chapter is a different short story about the owner of the painting at various times in the last few hundred years. Some stories are great, interesting and page-turners while others are not. Some stories are boring and I felt no real connection to the characters as people. I put down the book about half way through and had a hard time picking it up again. What saved this from a lower rating was that the end contained several great short stories that I feel were the best stories in the book, so it ends with high quality page-turning stories.I found it fun to find out the origins of the painting, we do find out who the girl in the painting is, however, I honestly cannot say it was suspenseful throughout. I found myself captivated by some stories and not wanting to put the book down, but then bored and wanting to skip the chapter of the next story.Lastly, I was frustrated at the idea that the first character in the book was contemplating burning the painting. Although it was stolen by his Nazi father from a Jewish family, despite his disgust at his father being a Nazi and guilt over how it was attained, he didn&#65533;t want to return the painting to the Jewish organization that takes back artwork stolen by Nazis. That he would consider burning such a lovely piece made absolutely no sense to me! The painting should have been returned to the Jewish organization."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This is a wonderful book that is a quick, easy read but hard to put down. I read this right after reading some Hemmingway short stories and was reminded of &quot;Short Happy Life...&quot; by Vreeland's &quot;A Night Like No Other&quot;. I think the more reading you have done, the more you will see in this book. I've attended countless lectures by the author (at taxpayer expense) as an English Lit student of hers (way back) in High School. This book struck me as very personal in that I was reminded of Ms. Vreeland's intellegence, passion and playfulness at different points in the book. This book belongs on your reading list."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"A choice for my Book Club this month (Sep 2011), I too found it - frankly - boring. The only part of the book that I liked was the opening chapter. Thereafter, it was a chore and I did not finish it. Although I tried skipping ahead, skipping back again - no amount of skipping made it any more interesting or appealing. I just skipped reading the rest and closed it (mercifully). Fortunately, I lost no money on this book but simply returned it to the library.Girl With A Pearl Earring was far more interesting and imaginative IMHO.If I am the odd (wo)man out at our Book Club meeting, might be time for a new Book Club.

So I then decided to purchase this book to read for my class. It was eight short stores about Vermeer masterpiece. Her painting was very artful and with descriptive thoughts. The book is basically about the historical backgrounds about a painting, having it passed down to different people with different meanings. It shows that in each different chapter, it tells a different perspective from a different person point of view. She also takes you back in time in an adventure that gives its own beauty and how it had touched their lives. One of the most fascinating things about this lovely little book is the details of family life and the history. It is a little confusing in the beginning but once you get use to the writer's style, then you'll have a better understanding. If you like to read about a detective story trying and out the true meaning of a painting, then I recommend this book for you. If you're not into the whole detective stuff, then maybe this might not be the book for you. Overall, I had a chance to see a different style of writing."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This is an excellent portrayal of a rabbi in ancient Israel who has a crisis of faith and searches for proof of god in secular studies. It is an easy read. Many of the hero's thoughts can be applied to agnostics today. What made this rabbi's crisis so difficult was that he was one of the most esteemed rabbi's in Israel. Many of the conflicts which occur in this book can be applied to the tensions between today's secular and reformed jews and the orthodox and fundamentalist jews. It sheds some light on the reason fundamentalist jews fear and forbid secular studies among their members. They are afraid that those who study secular subjects will desert the fundamentalist movement. This notion is particularly understandable today because studies in modern secular sciences etc. are likely to defeat even the most sacred traditions among the orthodox such as keeping kosher. Students who study modern science,medicine, and technology are likely to desert the orthodox and fundamentalist movements and so sadly such studies are discouraged in favor of torah study etc. The rabbi in this tale returns to his belief in god but he is shunned because of his exploration. His situation at the end of his quest is one of horrific conflict and anguish. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone of any religion,because it is an engaging and well written story."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"If you've ever held and antique in your hand, and wondered about all the tales it could tell, this book is for you. I understand each chapter was written as a stand alone short story, but put together, Vreeland weaves an incredible tale about one of Vermeer's paintings.

Delightful."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"It is a bumper season for Vermeer books. The book sketches in the provenance of a fictitious Vermeer painting, chapter by chapter, which work like brief glances into a Vermeer moment in our lives. Tracy Chevalier in her &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; achieves a better result overall in terms of characterization and atmosphere - her Griet is flesh and blood, her Jan Vermeer convincingly elusive. However, notwithstanding her wooden prose, Susan Vreeland does manage to make a point: why are we drawn into Vermeer scenes? Why do we impart our own longing and solitude into his canvases, more than those of any other artist? Why do we care? The book is not only about a Dutch painter and his mystery, but about beautiful things we cherish, the moments that render an ordinary life memorable, the truth that all too often goes buried beneath the years."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Many of us complain that in our hectic lives, we have no time to read. I don't buy that flimsy excuse, however, if it does apply to you, take my advice and read Girl In Hyacinth Blue by Susan Vreeland. This is truly time well spent in reading for pleasure. The author has researched the facts meticulously, and her style is spare and moving. Art and beauty play a major role in our lives;this is well proven by this book which traces the provenance of a purported Vermeer painting. Stories go backwards in time, characters are introduced, speaking the language of their era. Your mind is constantly engaged in reading this book. It goes on my list of 'Unforgetable Reads.'"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a brief but charming novel that illustrates the significance of a work of art for each of its successive owners. Within each chapter, someone considers the painting to be intrinsically valuable but is forced by circumstances to part with it. Although the mystery set up in the very first chapter motivates the reader to read on to determine if the painting really is a true Vermeer, it lacks the emotional impact that results from identification with one particular character. Instead, the reader is moved from one group of characters to another, and is left dangling when the painting changes hands. I did enjoy, however, the informative historical descriptions of Dutch life from several different perspectives, dating as far back as the mid-1600s. The characters that Vreeland has created are extremely realistic and reflective of the individual's struggle with personal issues and the times in which they live. Vreeland's characters are sensitively and at times, comically, portrayed and that is perhaps why I longed for each story to continue. Overall, I believe the book accomplished what it was probably intended to do: to illustrate the importance of a work of art upon the individuals with whom it comes in contact."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"After falling in love with Girl with a Pearl Earring some time ago, it was with great pleasure I discovered there were another Vermeer painting book out. This one is about a fictive painting though. There are 35 known paintings today, Girl In Hyacinth Blue is the 36th one, and fictive. In the book we follow it's history from today, and back through the ages and the paintings several owners till the time when the painting was painted.A wonderful, fascinating story, written in the crisp and also dark Vermeer colors. Several stories are told inside the story, everyone better than the other. What if a painting really could tell it's story. How fascinating that would be. And Susan Vreeland has done a masterpiece in this book. A painting will never be the same, from now on I will look at every new painting with the glasses of history - what can this painting tell me, what has this painting seen.Britt Arnhild Lindland"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The Girl in Hyacinth blue is a classic example of Susan Vreeland's favorite type of story telling--where an object inspires and determines a course of story. One writing assignment we had in highschool was to write a story based on an object that we randomly chose out of a box. In the case of this novel, the Girl in Hyacinth blue is the object and in some regards, the protagonist. I love how the story unwinds itself back to its origins, to see just how it is that the painting arrived at its final owner. The theme of an objects life melds perfectly with the mission of Book Crossing.On a side note, I found it fascinating that Ms Vreeland is still teaching creative writing. When I took her class back in 1990-1, her carreer as a writer had only just started. She had gotten &quot;What Loves Sees&quot; published and was working to get a second book published. It wasn't until joining Book Crossing that I learned that she had done well for herself as a writer. I'm very pleased that she has because she was one of the best teachers I ever had."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I just finished The Girl in Hyacinth Blue- and I loved the time I had reading this interesting, heartfelt, and nicely written little novel. The type text was a very easy read size, so I just flew through the pages. The story pulls you through, even causing you to hesitate and figure out how this amazing painting, at the point of near destruction in the first chapter, slowly traces it's roots right back into the home of Vermeer as he paints this amazing girl (his daughter) which was immortalized and fantasized through the inheritance of this picture.I am no history or art buff, although I enjoy both, and so I can not support or destroy the history portrayed in this novel at all, but to me as I read, the validity didn't seem to matter. As the painting is passed on in the amazingly tragic and amazingly simple lives of the book you see longing and wonder, dreams and realities, and the affect these dreams have on us and those around us. The writing is beautiful and honest, yet simple and true.While I love giving 5 stars where deserved, I am picky on my personal likes in a book. I do not like too many loose ends to wonder about later, but more- a book that ties things to together yet sticks to you anyway- this book will stick, but there are few little situations that aren't answered. This very well may have been the intent of Vreeland, to keep your imagination churning, but for me it is not my favorite element of style, thus the lack of one star. Overall, though, this is a great read and a great recommend- I have told many of my friends who enjoy reading- &quot;Don't pass this one up-&quot;It is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This is a pleasant simple read. What is wasn't (at least for me) is the literary blockbuster that I read about in the critical reviews. There just isn't that much meat to this work. I liked the format of vignettes going back in time. At the same time, that format left me hanging without resolution on some of the stories and thinking &quot;why bother&quot; about others. The writing has all the earmarks of modern, slightly pretentious literary fiction. Her writing it for creative writing classes comes through, unfortunately.Our book club struggled to find a half-hours worth of material to discuss in the book. We'd hoped for more."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a small book that lets us into the &quot;timeline of ownership&quot; of a painting. (real or imagined). Like most of Vermeer's paintings, it was painted in his home with the usual window and table. The painting is presumed to have been sold at auction in Amsterdam in 1696. We could see a similar painting in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, &quot;Woman in Blue Reading a Letter&quot;. In this painting the woman is pregnant, perhaps Catherina, Vermeer's wife. The Girl in Hyacinth Blue may be wearing the same smock. Susan Vreeland brings 17th century Delft to life for us. The book reminds me of &quot;The Red Violin&quot; following the theme of ownership."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"A great read for those with little time to indulge in massive-length books. An alleged Vermeer painting is traced back through the centuries. Its impact on various lives is explored. I really have to thank the myriad reviews on it, because I noticed this book at the library, and began reading it without any prior publishing info. on it. (There's not even a real book jacket explanation). So the first two chapters were confusing. After I read a few reviews, I understood the author's concept. The later chapters, centering on Vermeer's family, were especially intriguing and delightful. This book was such a fresh, welcome difference from another Vermeer-inspired book, Girl with a Pearl Earring -- Watch out! That book seems to have an intense fan club that seems intent on pooh-poohing those who didn't like it, even though the latter were very helpful to me, explaining their positions clearly and making good points, influencing my own reactions. Susan Vreeland seems to have more insight into Vermeer, and I found her depictions of characters more absorbing than the rather dull main characters in Girl with a Pearl Earring. Here per this book, I also found it enjoyable to browse through, concurrently, a book on Vermeer's life and paintings, to lend &quot;atmosphere&quot; to the reading. I've never read anything by this author, but I'll be happy to check her future work."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"As much as I love the paintings of Vermeer I loved this book. A very interesting way to cite the provenance of the painting. Most of the stories were so touching and involving that they moved me tremendously. As a librarian and as a person who holds a Masters of Fine Arts degree, I found the synthesis of art and literature extremely moving. Vreeland writes with a passionate poetic touch and her sense of historical detail is extraordinary. I recommend it heartily."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I always love stories that go back in time,especially ones which revolve around a particular object or location.This is a story about a fictional painting which was looted by a nazi soldier during the clearance of the Jews from Holland in WW2.The soldier goes on to lead a decent life in the U.S. after the war,but can never quite absolve himself from his guilt at the theft and all the horrors that surrounded it.The story unfolds like the peeling of an onion--layer by layer until we come to the life of the artist who painted the picture of an innocent young girl.I found it to be a moving book,easy to read and with great descriptions of the details of everyday life."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"You *can* judge a book by its cover. Ms. Vreeland skillfully weaves together through time the stories of the various owners of a Vermeer painting. Interestingly, she chooses to start in the present day and work backward. I was inspired to do more reading about and viewing of Vermeer's work after reading this book. I finished it more than a month ago and still think of it often. I was sorry that the stories of the various characters and the story of the painting had to end. The last vignette-about the &quot;girl&quot; of the painting was one of the most poignant, especially when she has grown old. I concur with one of the other reviewers here that it would make a lovely gift for someone you know who loves art and books."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Not only is the writing style unique as Vreeland takes us backwards in time, but her word choices are well crafted. I had to read the book again within a 3 week period and planned to skim it. I just could not skim. Every word is perfectly chosen. To read the story was like creating a painting of people, landscapes, hopes, heartache, history, and love in my mind. As a lover of art and words, the combination of both I found very moving. If you enjoyed it the first time, read it again. Although we never know if the painting is destroyed, we have the opportunity to see how many peoples' lives it touched. That idea is so much more important than the outcome. The story teaches us that a work of art often outlasts its creator and can touch many souls well into the future. As a mediocre artist, this book gives me the desire to continue to create. Touching, uplifting, sweet, and executed with devotion."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"An officially unauthenticated, previously unknown Vermeer surfaces in an unlikely location: a chilly, locked room in the house of a secretive college professor. An art professor colleague of the painting's owner narrates the initial story in this linked series of stories tracing the &quot;life&quot; of the painting back to it's creation in Vermeer's studio. We meet each of its owners only briefly, but the painting itself (necessarily unseen, of course) grows more and more vibrant as the timeline grows shorter.It was a very quick read, surprisingly so. The writing is affecting and vivid, yet the stories are strangely forgettable - what remains is the description of the painting, and what it meant to the characters (security, money, plunder, etc.) during the time they lived with it. When I finished the book, I had that familiar feeling of fond loss that comes when you have to leave a character you've come to see as a friend - but, of course, it was the painting I felt that way about.It's really not fair that it doesn't exist."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Read this book right after you read &quot;The Girl With The Pearl Earring.&quot; Examined side by side enhances the reading experience. The juxtaposition of comparing and contrasting the way in which two women chose to approach writing about two different Vermeer paintings is interesting. Adding weight to both books, which can be quickly read. &quot;The Girl In Hyacinth Blue&quot; is like opening up a chinese box which unfolds another layer of interest with each turn. For further interest in the area, next read &quot;The Music Lesson&quot; (completely different,a good read, also addresses a Vermeer and written by a woman). The fourth one I have found and next on my list, is &quot;The Red Hat.&quot; I certainly have a richer appreciation for Vermeer. Catch the exhibit in NYC at the MET, through May."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I recently finished this book and have since passed it on to friends. I can't say that it was a masterpiece, but there was definitely something about it that captured me. The mysterious path that each individual story lead me down kept me wanting to turn to the next story to learn of its relationship to the previous one. Some of the vignettes were definitely better than others (and I especially enjoyed them as they went further back in history), but I enjoyed the &quot;quickness&quot; of each story and meeting each new character. Any monotony with a particular character might be quickly replaced by an entirely new character. The insights of &quot;the girl&quot; in the last story were especially compelling.My only difficulty with this book, and the reason that I bought it after borrowing it from the library, is that I need to read it over again and reexamine the stories' connections (in praise of the author, I have never considered reading another book twice). The book, as a whole, tells the story from present to past; however, each individual story takes place in it's own present time or is a short journey forward in time. At times I found this confusing and often found myself thumbing back through a previous story just to understand their relationship. I would have loved for the author to have spent more time telling about the actual transfer of the painting between each story's characters instead of the keeping the stories so distinctly separate.On the whole, I would definitely recommend reading this book. It is pleasant and enjoyable and a quick read. A short escape from the present."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I was in a reading rut before I picked this book up. You know how it is, sometimes nothing on your usual book menu really works for you. I had turned to biographies and historical novels to break me of the rut. I picked this up last week on a whim, having passed it by many times before. I read it in exactly two sittings, and just highly recommended it to two of my closest bibliophile friends. This was just a delight to read!Vreeland has designed the book as a series of short-stories which all trace back the history of a 36th Vermeer painting. (It is held that Vermeer painted only 35, and this 36th is of Vreeland's creation). What I found most interesting about the individual stories is how well Vreeland depicted the difference in value, both emotional and monetary, the painting had for its different owners over the years. For some, the painting was priceless and something to be coveted or hidden or cherished for familial or emotional reasons. For others, including the painter and his family, the painting was worth food and survival.In addition, I came to &quot;see&quot; the painting more clearly with each passing chapter, as I came to know how the painting was seen by its owners and how their feelings towards it affected me. I have much to think about now that I can digest the painting's chain of ownership in total.I was entranced by the atmosphere of the Dutch regions in which Vreeland set the stories. This book has a definite feel to it, and it is mesmerizing; you will have trouble putting the book down. Not a bad way to break out of my rut!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Susan Vreeland's lilting prose traces the history of a painting-a Vermeer, perhaps? That's the assertion made by its current owner, a secretive high school math teacher who unexpectedly invites the art teacher over to view the painting and validate its authenticity.What gets in the way of such validation are the burning questions: How did you get it? Where are the papers? There is also the fact that Vermeer did not leave many paintings and he had many imitators. Without papers, without a credible explanation, who could assert that its creator was Vermeer?Yet validation is the only thing that will relieve Cornelius Engelbrecht of the burden of his inheritance. He knows but cannot tell how his father got the painting. He knows but cannot prove the painting is a Vermeer. He has devoted his life to researching Vermeer, the uniqueness of his style, the history of his works, in short, to proving the genuineness of Girl with Sewing Basket to himself. He has kept the painting hidden, showing it to no one before the art teacher. He has protected it like a lioness protects her cubs. He has denied himself all normal social interactions to keep people out of his life, out of his house, out of view of the painting, out of range of questions about its acquisition.In the second of Vreeland's eight linked stories, we learn of the painting's previous owners. With each successive story we travel further back in time, learning of the life of each earlier owner, the reasons for acquiring the painting, the reasons for parting with it. At last we reach the painter himself, and finally the girl in the painting.Each story can stand alone, but only when they are linked does the full story become evident. Only then do we understand the power of art, its ineluctable pull on the artist's soul, its ability to soothe and inspire the viewer's psyche. An engrossing, well-written book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It didn't simply write the history of a painting by a well known artist; it looked at the history of a fictional work of art by Vermeer and, in so doing, drew you into the lives of each of its owners. A lovely way of thinking about art from a different perspective and a thoroughly enjoyable journey through the centuries!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The simplicity of this book should not be underestimated. What seems at first a simple history of a painting's provenance becomes, in the end, the acknowledgement of the precious moments and visions of everyday life.Moving backwards in time, from owner to owner, Vreeland offers a unique perspective of those who possess this small Vermeer painting. To some a source of pride of ownership, to others a distant claim on the past, many are touched by a longing to keep this painting near as it finds a spiritual nest in their hearts.Following this backward continuum, it is difficult to understand how men can dispose of this work of art for need of finances, though they must, while their wives try vainly to excuse keeping such a thing of pure beauty in their usually impoverished homes. The painting shines like a jewel where there is little to make daily living bearable.When we meet the painter himself in the very act of creation, we begin to understand the power of his need to paint. Vreeland gives us insight into Vermeer's struggle for validation in his work, the deep need to justify such an existence, which so relentlessly lays claim upon the soul.Fine-tuning once again, we are introduced to the girl in the painting, the model, who is Vermeer's daughter. This young woman has the gift of her father's eyes, the vision of the artist. She herself longs to use the brushes, to mix the vermillion, the ultramarine, the burnt umber, with her own hands, her own vision taking shape on canvas. How fragile and unrealistic her dream; nevertheless, she cannot relinquish this small corner of herself.In the careful recreation of the story behind Vermeer's painting, Vreeland honors the gift, the act, the opportunity to create art. Perhaps only time validates the true artist, but this author eloquently reminds us to honor the artist in each of us, the importance of the moment, the beauty in simple detail. The &quot;artist&quot; reading THE GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE smiles in recognition, gratefully accepting this affirmation."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"An enchanting, fascinating, wonderful book. The book itself is like a Vermeer painting.

Marvelous."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"An artist paints, a writer writes, and the work passes out of his/her control and becomes part of history.

He insists it is a vermeer, an original and lasting one at that. We are then taken on a journey back through time to the previous owners of the painting and how it effected their emotions and lives, all the way back to the painters first ideas and beginnings of the work. Through these remarkable people, we have a revival of our own emotions, and how we can grow to love other things more than we can love ourselves.Not a collection of short stories but not quite a novel, Vreelands book a work of art, a book to be cherished and savored and threatens to burst with the luminous moments that bind it.

Each story woven together creates a masterpiece. Though I found it hard to keep track of how the painting had switched owners occasionally, it was for the most part understandable. I loved how each chapter was almost a stand-alone piece, yet tied in with all the other parts of the story. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"The novel was a beautiful idea, tracing a fictitious painting back in time. Unfortunately, the execution was not as lovely. Though each chapter is a beautiful snapshot (the farm family in the flood and the youth losing his &quot;witch&quot; love were especially moving) the passage between chapters was choppy and not nearly as elegant as each chapter itself. It was difficult to keep pace as the novel moves so abruptly through time. Where did the slave-traders' wife get the painting? How did it come into the hands of the older farming couple? These and many questions come up but are not answered. The novel is a case of the whole being less than the sum of its parts."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"This is a small book, and only about half of every page is used. I thought I could read this book in about an hour, but I had to keep stopping. Nearly every story is heartbreakingly sad.

Central to that past is the manner his Father acquired the painting and the same past that so haunts the son. This book cannot escape comparison with \\"Girl With A Pearl Earring\\", and while it does not compare poorly, it certainly finishes second.Some of the eight stories are good, and some are very good, but they remain just that, pieces of eight, not a unified tale. I would have liked to have read this as a single work, one that was not broken apart, shuffled, and left for the reader to thread a non-sequential storyline together.I enjoyed the book, and the read is certainly worthwhile. It does not make great demands upon the reader, but unfortunately it does linger either."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"I loved this book. The style was unique, even though it was a little puzzling for the first 3 chapters. The book provides brief snipets in the lifes of several owners of the same portrait. Vermeer may be the artist, but the portrait is unsigned so it's authenticity is questionable. Chapter one takes place in modern times. Each successive chapter takes place further into the past. The last chapter is about a brief time in Vermeer's life. I felt somewhat disappointed at not being able to follow a direct line from the last owner back to Vermeer, but that disappointment added an facet of interest--it makes me long for more.

This is an author who writes well. The reason behind the three stars was the format of the story. It starts in the present tense and goes backward through history. It's a beautiful way to tell the story of the painting and its journey through time, but I found myself losing interest as the book continued farther into the past. Events that I might have enjoyed reading earlier in the story seemed to lose meaning as I turned more pages. While I understand the reason behind telling the story behind each owner of the picture, I kept wanting the make it full circle and return to the present day characters.The ending isn't as sad as some novels I've read, but the book left me with a depressing perspective.

Have you looked at beautiful art and wondered about that?

Yet all are tied together by a fascination and a reverance for the skill of the artist and the subject of his work.A young girl sees,\\"The face of the girl in the painting almost glowed, her blue eyes, cheeks, the corners of her mouth all bright and glossy, the light coming right at her across the space between them.

Easy reading for a quiet evening."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"In the opening of this moving work of fiction, an undiscovered Dutch master's painting, circa 1665, is shown in secret to a professor of art. He is qualified to classify it as a genuine and theretofore undiscovered work of Jan Vermeer but is reluctant to do so because of the shady auspices of its acquisition: it had been seized during Nazi occupation. Since the acquisition is less than honorable, ownership of the painting is both a blessing and a curse. This theme is beautifully woven throughout the story.The impact of this simple portrait of a young girl is immense. Admirers are drawn to the blue of the smock she is wearing, the \\"pearl\\" of her eye, the luminescence of the light streaming through the window near her. And, although the subject is depicted engaged in the simple task of hand sewing, it is obvious that there is something very, very different about what was going on when this painting was being made.Through eight gorgeous and historically detailed chapters, author Susan Vreeland masterfully follows the ownership of the painting backward through time. As she plants and waters the seed of exploring the human ability to become attached to inanimate objects, we are given a view into the life and relationships of each successive owner.The challenge of the first set of characters is an awesome one: how to adequately enjoy something which is, technically, forbidden to own. Immediately, the reader's curiosity is piqued on many levels: Of course, What is the origin of this painting? But also, How does one come to terms with ownership of artistic property gained by questionable means? How can one enjoy it? And, of course, we ask ourselves again and again, if the work is authentic, if the work was actually done by Vermeer. And, if it was, what was the origin? Who is the subject? And, as we may ask ourselves in the case of the famous Mona Lisa, what was the subject thinking while she was posing and how did the composition come about?The challenges of each of the subsequent owners are as awesome as the professor's. And while each has a unique story, all of them are similarly enamored of the same stranger's work. And the delight and the pain of their human drama connects their stories while demanding our attention to a poignancy and delicacy that is unforgettable.As the author draws us in tighter and tighter to the humble creation of the painting, we can fully appreciate how one person's work can impact the lives of many strangers.With wonderfully human characters, a highly engaging and thought-provoking story line, and beautiful, painterly prose, *Girl in Hyacinth Blue* is a glorious and fresh work of fiction, and a book capable of entertaining while also having a deep, marvelous impact on the reader."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue (Highbridge Distribution)","review":"Is it possible that two different writers wrote two different novels about the same painter in the same year? I must admit that Vermeer is new to me, and introduced first through Girl With a Pearl Earring, and now through Girl in Hyacinth Blue. I found both novels exquisite, and well worth the time. Anytime a book makes me want to learn more about something...a place, a person, a time in history...i consider it time well invested. I have since read up on Jan Vermeer and his life, and find his paintings to be truly beautiful. And although I know that this particular painting is fictional, the story is completely believable and intriguing.

Appreciate art and beauty for what it really is - magnificent and large. That's what this book meant to me. In all its richness - stroking like a paint brush on the canvass of the readers' hearts - Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a winner all the way!The 8 Stories are woven around the imaginary painting of Vermeer and of love not being enough most of the time. From a father's misgivings to Vermeer's Daughter's Passions and so much more defines this 242 page, according to me masterpiece.It could have been any painter, any artist - because Ms. Vreeland's style is so unique and new that she could have given words to any painting. Any picture that speaks a thousand words, that touches the lives of so many, is sometimes so isolated and unappreciated. The girl in the picture, as the story progresses represents beautiful things for different people. It portrays poignancy heightened by the mysteries of giving and losing.

It is an easy read. Many of the hero's thoughts can be applied to agnostics today. What made this rabbi's crisis so difficult was that he was one of the most esteemed rabbi's in Israel. Many of the conflicts which occur in this book can be applied to the tensions between today's secular and reformed jews and the orthodox and fundamentalist jews. It sheds some light on the reason fundamentalist jews fear and forbid secular studies among their members. They are afraid that those who study secular subjects will desert the fundamentalist movement. This notion is particularly understandable today because studies in modern secular sciences etc. are likely to defeat even the most sacred traditions among the orthodox such as keeping kosher. Students who study modern science,medicine, and technology are likely to desert the orthodox and fundamentalist movements and so sadly such studies are discouraged in favor of torah study etc. The rabbi in this tale returns to his belief in god but he is shunned because of his exploration. His situation at the end of his quest is one of horrific conflict and anguish.

If someone knows the material, they wouldn't need this review book. In addition to typing errors that referencing sections of the UBC that do not exist, the sample problems are poorly organized and confusing. The ability to mind read is a prerequisite. For example, sample problem # 6 shows a solved force diagram that is not calculated anywhere in sample #6. After wasting valuable time asking yourself &quot;what am I missing&quot;, you will give up in frustration and continue reading. Only the find the solution five pages later...in sample problem #10 which references back to #6. Essentially, you are given solutions to samples BEFORE you are introduced to the theory. The author makes too many assumptions and takes too many shortcuts in explainations. If you want to fill your mind with confusion and headaches, buy this book.

SORRY FOR THE PREVIOUS ATTEMPT. jack troy &lt;jgaylordt@yahoo.com&gt; wrote: Elizabeth Evans Baker's Quest for Peace Reviewer: jack troy from Huntingdon, PA USAElizabeth Evans Baker (1902-1990) led a full life as First Lady at Ohio University, founder of the Monomoy Theatre on Cape Cod, as an actress, mother, patron of the arts, and poet, but her inner tuning-fork vibrated for the cause of peace. She struggled with an ancient human dilemma - how to discover and use moral imagination as an alternative to violence in resolving conflicts. Because she and her husband were in a position to put their ideals into action, they were instrumental in funding peace studies programs at a number of colleges, but Elizabeth was the driving force, as Marta Daniels documents in her well-organized, and clearly-written book. Elizabeth Baker was in a position to do something about the sad fact that America has a War College, but no Peace College. Her response was not only personal (as Daniels shows, through excerpts from EEB's diaries), but far-reaching, since she helped fund and organize peace-studies programs devoted to what has become known as &quot;irenology&quot; - the systematic, interdisciplinary study of the causes of war and the conditions of peace. Her dedication helped establish and enlarge an awareness that has materialized so that nearly 200 U. S. colleges now offer courses and undergraduate degree-granting and certificate-granting Peace Studies programs. As I read this book I was struck by the degree to which Mrs. Baker's idealism found pragmatic expression with enduring effects, as authenticated by her persistence for 20 years to make possible Maya Lin's Peace Chapel at Juniata College in central Pennsylvania. Visiting the site helps me realize what this book documents: that art and peace can be as linked in locale as they were in the mind and spirit of Elizabeth Evans Baker."},{"Title":"Peace is Everybody's Business : Half a Century of Peace Education with Elizabeth Evans Baker","review":"Peace is Everybody's Business focuses on the peace making efforts of Elizabeth Baker and her husband, peace advocates and educators who proved pioneers in the field in the last part of the 20th century. Readers receive both an excellent biography of Baker and a focus on the establishment of peace studies in higher education. The latter is especially important as few books have examined this process."},{"Title":"A Valentine Waltz (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Three stories, by three fairly respected authors, and none of them worth even a used book price. My Dearest Daisy, by Jo Ann Ferguson, might possibly earn the one star I am forced to give here, but the plot is not only worn out but has been done so much better - niece (complete with limp) of actress falls in love with young lord but is afraid to tell him who she really is. He, of course, returns her regard, for reasons which remain wholly inexplicable. Maria Greene gives us the story of two thoroughly disagreeable people who behave like immature brats. I could barely read it, it was so bad. And last of all Kate Huntington gives us what may just possibly be the most unlikeable 'hero' ever created in a regency romance. The 'other' man was so much better, I kept waiting for the heroine to realize it, but she was no great prize either, so I guess they were well suited. I really resent having spent money on this book! Awful!"},{"Title":"A Valentine Waltz (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Ferguson's story contains some major errors regarding the social mores and customs of the period (like kissing -twice- in front of the maid). The characters, however, are strong & likeable. The plot, while well-used, is all romance and moves swiftly. Ignoring the historical gaffes, it's a 3 star piece. By far, the best of the lot.Greene's entry is a very mixed bag. Lucien is great; he really changes over the course of the story. Angela starts out well, but is later seen as self-righteous and unforgiving. It's a great idea for a story (the wager and its effects), and the secondary romance is good. BUT Angela's intractable spirit dulls the execution and enjoyment; she doesn't deserve the changed Lucien. She knows what it's like to be treated badly but does it to him mainly because of his reputation; she's quite rude. She seems no different from Lucien's friends (and what he once was). There are also some plot problems. The resolution was way too fast and utterly unbelieveable. I'll give it 1-2 stars, primarily for Lucien.Huntington's attempt is ... how to put this politely? This is the worst story of the 3. The heroine is generally likeable but needs to be better developed. The hero is charming but wholly vain; he is not a likable romantic hero. And at the end, he seems an entirely different person. The last page refers to his usual expression before Caroline was \\"haughty and closed,\\" but that was never in evidence in the story. He repeatedly disavows marrige, even to her whom he admits he loves, and then suddenly proposes out of the blue. Even his compliments are sickening -- flowery, overdone, and insincere. Moreover, the reader constantly gets the feeling that she's missing something, that this story was plucked out of another or out of a series to which this story repeatedly refers with a heavy hand. This one rates a zero!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish Edition)","review":"Bradbury is without a doubt one of the strongest writers of our time and this book is arguably his best work. All the usual elements of vintage Bradbury are here--captivating prose, rich characters and a plot that never drags.

Highly recommended reading for anyone and a great place to begin reading Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish Edition)","review":"A classic tale by a master of the craft of metaphor. Bradbury uses the fireman in a world where they MAKE fires instead of putting them out, to explore the phenomenon of censorship in a world obsessed with being \\"good\\". Scenes in his book were reminiscent of what the Nazis did in Opernplatz, Berlin. In fact, of this event Bradbury made this poignant statement: \\"It follows then that when Hitler burned a book I felt it as keenly, please forgive me, as his killing a human, for in the long sum of histroy they are onein the same flesh.\\" I met Ray Bradbury and he is a gentle, humble soul."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish Edition)","review":"A very elegantly written book with a strong message about technology, censorship, and control/freedom. Bradbury writes in a beautifully poetic way that is not only layered with meaning, but also gripping from beginning to end. I could not stop reading this book until finishing the last page. A great social commentary and story, and perhaps even more relevant today than when it was written. Highly, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish Edition)","review":"This book, Fahrenheit 451, is about a fireman in the future, an age of mechanical hounds and virtual reality families that argue about nothing, who instead of putting out fires, starts them instead. He burns books and the houses in which they are found. He is very happy with his job even though all of the citizens are frightened of him, until he meets a girl who is \\"17 and crazy\\". His walks with her and her strange ideas and interesting views make him question his job. He starts to steal and read books, which change his life forever.I really enjoyed reading this book. I absolutely love reading (anything) but especially love books about what our future could be like. This book, 1984, and Brave New World, among others, are books that imagine and predict an awful future (Imagine a world without books!) which is even more interesting because it kind of gives us a warning.The author, Ray Bradbury, has a really interesting writing style. One characteristic writing device he utilizes is description. He shows the reader exactly what is going on by giving lots of detail, for example \\"climbed slowly back into bed, arranged the covers over his knees and across his chest, half sitting\\". I think he does this to both create tension and to prolong and emphasize a moment. At this point in the book, the reader is wondering if Montag, the main character, will be safe, but they have to wait. Another unique characteristic of Bradbury's writing is how he uses lots of metaphors and similes (\\"face as bright as snow\\") which add more detail, making the scene easier to imagine. A third characteristic is that he writes about really scary happenings in pretty, flowery, flowing language which makes it seem less frightening and more normal. This helps the reader really get into Montag's mind because they aren't so scared off.I would recommend this book to anyone (over age 12) because it is a book you have to have read to live in today's world and understand what people are talking about and referencing. Also, this book is just a really good read that can be enjoyed on many levels, as a suspenseful story, or as a warning about our future. There are also themes of love and camaraderie. Everyone can find a character to identify with."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish Edition)","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is a science-fiction novel set in a futuristic United States where books are illegal and firemen set fires, rather than put them out. The story follows fireman, Guy Montag, as he battles himself, the people he to whom he thought he was closest, and society in a race against time, and a race to preserve the knowledge shared in books. Written in a serious tone, with inklings of sarcasm, Bradbury creates a short novel that has a straight forward message.What makes the book five stars is the message that it shares with the reader, especially since it was originally written in 1953. There are many parallels to today's society that have the potential to make a reader change his/her lifestyle. It warns readers of the consequences of censorship, of life under a government that controls all of the information, and warns of how shallow we may become in a self-centered, media-focused, reality-show-based society. After reading the book it is easy to see how one might feel guilty about turning on the television for an evening of brainless entertainment, for this is what the book is preaching against!Some people are turned off on this novel because so many of the characters appear so shallow and flat. That is, I believe, Bradbury's intent. He intentionally created characters that are superficial and fake to reinforce his ideas of what it would be like to live in a society such as this one. He illustrates the metamorphoses of one of these flat characters in Montag, who changes dramatically from the beginning to the end of the book.Other than short stories, I haven't read any other Bradbury novels, nor have I ever been a big science-fiction fan. However, the style of writing is very similar to other pieces I've read with long sentences that are full of imagery, but still simple in their meaning. He makes it easy for the reader to escape into the distorted reality of his settings. In the case of this novel, it is not clearly stated where it takes place, but I imagine a city on the east coast of the United States, like New York or Boston.Although Fahrenheit 451 is a fairly quick read, I would recommend it to readers who are mature enough to handle the underlying messages of this book. When I've spoken with people who read it quickly, just because they heard it was a good book, they were often disappointed. If you like to be pushed in your thinking and perception of reality, you will like this book because it will challenge you to look at how you are living your life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is a book everyone should read. It's not a long book, or a complicated one, but the ideas expressed are worthy of great philosophical discussion. It seems an almost surreal world that these people live in, and yet it could so easily be something into which our world could turn. In this book the brainless wife is obsessed with her \\"parlour family\\" - a very television-like scenario. In this I see the preponderance of \\"reality shows\\" peppering the airwaves and entrancing viewers in mindless activity. Before you start screaming at me, there is nothing wrong with a little mindless activity - it's a good diversion from the stresses of daily life (I, myself, cannot stand reality TV, but watch a lot of sporting events as my \\"mindless drivel\\"). But when that mindless drivel becomes your life, it's time to step back and reassess how you are living. When people stand around all day chattering about the latest developments on a reality TV show but are unable to even relate one current event, conflict, or idea - then we have a problem. And so many people find \\"Survivor\\" more fascinating that the fact that our country is at war (regardless of what side you are on, you'd think you'd have an opinion!) that I think we are starting to have a problem. So today, take a moment, read a book, express a though, or have a meaningful discussion (about anything) and cherish your ability to do so."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish Edition)","review":"By brother-in-law had me read this book way back when. He's the kind of guy that sees flying saucers in the sky at least three times a day. Well, maybe he had something there.This book was thought provoking, intriguing and disturbing in its time. Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" seems to have foreseen and foreshadowed what is occurring in our current society. We live in a push button society, a world where a constant onslaught of audio and video information has engulfed our senses. Children graduate school and are not even able to read. And nobody really seems to care. Nobody cares because we live in a world full of the mundane and emptiness where we just want instant gratification of whatever will fill our empty lives. We are without substance. We are empty souls without higher aspirations for the ability to explore the capabilities of our minds. We seek not to nurture our appreciation for nature or the mind's ability to create visual associations to stimulate thought through the written word. We are doomed, each of us, to see the same vision on a tube and not think beyond the surface. We are doomed to conformity trapped in a visual nightmare where the mind's eye will evolve into oblivion."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish Edition)","review":"This book was in Spanish.

TV's that cover four walls to make it 3D; fireproof homes; \`news radios' which fit in your ear for convenience; etc. There is just on thing missing - books! It is against the law to read/own a book. So, they are burned. And who does that burning? Why, the firemen.It turns out that once houses got their fireproof \`shells,' the firemen ran out of a job. Therefore, they were given the job of burning books, which the public had rejected. The people had forgotten what it used to be like. When Montag, a fireman, was asked: \\"Is it true that long ago firemen put fires out instead of going to start them?\\" he assures her that houses have always been fireproof.In the end, Montag, the main character, meets people who are books. They have memorized books of the Bible, or chapters of a novel, thus saving literature. Their plan - to pass on the books by word of mouth until they can legally print and spread them once more.This book intrigued me so much. I really appreciate Ray Bradbury's sense of fantasy vs. reality so we can avoid such mistakes in the future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish Edition)","review":"The title to this review may be lame but the sentiment is not. This book is still incredibly relevant.The story of a futuristic society that controls its inhabitants by squelishing free thought is told through the eyes of the fireman (Montag), whose desire for truth is at odds with his pre-determined role to destroy those desires by burning books. .It is surprising that a book written over 50 years ago still has such startling parallels today. From the entertainment consisting of reality shows (taken to the next level), to the misinformation of the government, to the use of fear to control behavior; it is almost creepy how some of Bradbury's commentary on how we can be controlled is sharply visible in our world today.The story has a good element of suspense and the characters are fascinating. My favorite (of course) is Clarisse, the free spirit and non-conformist that is a risk to the government and the catalyst for Montag's awakening. Her behavior and attitude contrasts starkly against Montag's wife Mildred, who walks around in a daze of drugs and television. Between these two opposite women walks Montag, who connects us to these two differing existences, and must make his own choice about what footprint he wants to leave behind.The book still plays very well today as an adventure story (I was reminded of the Running Man during Montag's escape), but it is also still a strong social commentary on what could be...or is?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish Edition)","review":"This book is called Fahrenheit 451 and is by Ray Bradbury. This book is internationally acclaimed with more than five million copies in print. Fahrenheit 451 takes place some time in the future. Many things have changed since modern time. The speed limit is around 100. The billboards are really long, so people can see them as they drive by. Buildings were fireproof. Television shows are a couple of minutes long. Being a pedestrian was illegal. Books are illegal to read. Since buildings are fireproof, the Firemen do not have to save buildings and the people inside them. Instead of that, their jobs were to find book, and burn them. The main character, Guy Montag, was a fireman. He loved his job, and enjoyed burning books. He was married to his wife, and didn't seem to love her at all. Everything was fine, until he met this strange girl, who told him about how the past the houses weren't fireproof, and firemen used to stop flames. Then he found himself smuggling books into his house. With the help of his friend, Faber, he learns more about these books. Then he knows what to do. Faber is a professor who Montag caught reading a book. Faber was really scared of Montag because the thought Montag would turn him in. Later Faber and Montag became close friends.The books in this book were connected to drugs today. No one is allowed to read book, but people do anyways. Just like drugs, some drugs are illegal, but people still use these illegal drugs. The firemen are like policemen. They look around for people using illegal drugs, and arrest them. The firemen do the same, after they burn all the books. This book is kind of similar to The Matrix. In both of them, there are some people who are rising up against the suppressor. In this book it is the government. In The Matrix it isThe machines.The only reason I picked this book up was because I needed something to read for English class. I wouldn't recommend this book as something you would buy, if you want to read it just check it out of a library. I liked the plot of this book. It was interesting how so many illegal things are inconvenient and seems like there is no reason for it at all. I disliked the figurative language. Sometimes I couldn't tell if they were speaking literally or just figuratively. I also didn't like how the book would be really confusing unless you put some thought into it, and reread it a couple of times. I didn't think this book was very good for reading for fun.

It was my favorite because the lady yelled and she lit the kerosene and killed herself. She did that because she didn't want her books gone. She wouldn't be able to live like that if her books were gone and not her.This book was one of the best books ive ever read. If you like that kind of book than you will like it. Ray Bradbury is an excellent writer that book is good.montag is a good guy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish Edition)","review":"Ray Bradbury wrote this book, Fahrenheit 451. It talks of a fictional world of rules and restrictions. Laws ban learning, reading, and diversity. Intense firemen run the world that start fires instead of stop them. Censorship and brainwashing are ordinary things to see in the daily life of the people of this fiction.Ray Bradbury is not famous for any other book besides Fahrenheit 451. This book was written about fifty-five years ago, about five years after the end of World War II. This was a time of tensions between America and Russia. The last war ended with the deadliest blast known to man, and now to rival powers were plotting to use that type of bomb against each other. Fear of the other nation kept the two nations in check but a nuclear war was not out of the reach of reality at that time.This book shows a world that only appears in the nightmares. At first glance, this world looks like a utopia, everyone is smiling, and nobody is angry. Everybody has a job and there is no crime. But when the layers of the society are pulled back, the world is content but they are not happy. The whole story starts when the main character is asked if he is happy. He comes to the realization that he is not and he searches to find happiness, which turns into a fight against the society.I believe book excellently show the fear of the people that lived during Bradbury time. The fear that the world would turn into a society filled with over controlled life styles and fear and censorship. Through the book, Bradbury shows his concerns for the future and what a possible outcome could have been. His fear of nuclear war and the development society that destroys humanity is shown in the book.I like how Bradbury used great descriptions in the book and those alone are worth reading the book. The suspense is only topped by the action at the end that it leads up to. It is a thrill to read because of how the plot sets up the climax using suspense. It was interesting to see the layers of that society pulled back and dissected through the eyes of Bradbury. Seeing how this society was formed and how that world became what it was mind-boggling. The book puts you into the story, and takes you through a world that is disturbing, but the most disturbing part of it is that if a few different events occurred or will occur, we could be living in a society just like the one in the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish Edition)","review":"Fahrenheit 451, one of the worst books i have ever read in my life. I disliked this book so much i didn't even want to finish reading it but sadly I was forced to by my English teacher if I wanted to pass the class.

It is kind of like a really, really, really bad movie with an inexperienced actors. You know, like those really really old black and white movies. Second, the book jumps from one thing to another. Most of the time you don't even know what is going on. Then all of it gets mixed up in your head. third, the book is about people burning books. How stupid is that. Also, everyone acts crazy. Especially the teenagers. Teens might be bad but not that bad. I have never seen one act like they do in this novel.I think the author's purpose was to inform the reader that sometimes what is taught and what is the law isn't always right. It could even be dangerous. This is about the only thing I agree with.I think the author handeled conflict the best in this book. The man versus man. Montag versus Beaty and Montag versus other things made by man like the mechanical hound.This book was written in 3rd person point-of-view.

Aside from serving as the pretext for a novel, there is really no good reason for this regime to bother with book-burning at all: they have marginalized literate culture so thoroughly that book-loving will soon die out, and poses no threat to anyone.The protagonist, a \\"fireman\\" who burns one library too many, winds up reciting poetry to his wife, who bursts into tears at being depressed so cruelly, and wants only to return to the din of commercialized sentiment flowing 24/7 from the TV that fills an entire wall in their home. She snitches on him, and he goes into hiding with the book people, who live way out yonder past the railroad tracks, helping each other memorize books as their copies disintegrate.

If you are easily offended by the d-word, G-D, or h-e-l-l then this book probably is not for you, also if you have difficulty reading such as following the flow of words then this book is not going to make it any easier on you. Speaking of being difficult to read, the end of this book is a pain, it leaves you hanging, wanting to read more but you cant because there isnt a sequel and it the book ends on a very tense moment that does not have time to cool off with."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish Edition)","review":"Fahrenheit 451 follows Guy Montag in a futuristic society where knowledge is scorned by the public. Montag's occupation is a fireman, though the job is quite different than one would expect. In this society, firemen do not put out fires, but they initiate them. Books are forbidden, and it is the firemen's job to burn the houses of those who are in possession of books. Montag's journey throughout the story leads him to question his work and the morals of a society that does not value intelligence.This is a great book for those that enjoy to read and possibly for those that have trouble finding a good book to enjoy in their free moments. The description is thick and layered such that it might be difficult for younger readers to understand. Often you will have to reread sentences in order to decipher their metaphors. Strong vocabulary is used throughout and the feelings of the characters are not explicitly stated but rather implied through their actions. The start of the story is slow, though intriguing enough to keep readers interesting and in anticipation for more to come.The basic theme of the story is similar to The Giver and other stories where human society has changed drastically to the point where it is often hard to understand. While there is not much action in the story, there is enough excitement peppered throughout the tale that it remains interesting.The characters often speak in dialogue that seems bland and bored, reinforcing the strong feeling that emotions are virtually nonexistent in this society. The characters are neither happy or nor sad, but simply content. Humanity's attention span has been shortened to just a few moments, as television shows last for a mere two or three minutes. Another interesting aspect of life it is the law that the vehicles cannot drive below a minimum of 55 miles per hour. Many of the characteristics of this society seem to not be enforced by government, but rather by the general acceptance of society as a whole. A few people in the story have not conformed to the rules set before them and consequently are either ignored or, in the case of owning books, their houses are burned. Many people are poor and few occupations are mentioned other than firemen. In fact, the job of librarian no longer exists and all of the known library's have been burned.Though this was written more than half a century ago, much of the futuristic predictions still stand as plausible. The author does an excellent job of molding a society into a believable yet terrifying group of people.I would definitely suggest purchasing this book, as it can be read and reread and still be an interesting story. You will make new connections each time you read Fahrenheit 451. I would give this four stars out of five, as it is overall a great story though it has a few dry spots and some confusing scenes."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish Edition)","review":"Guy Montag, the main character of Fahrenheit 451, is a fireman, who doesn't put out fires: he starts them. He burns books, because they are, as Captain Beatty puts it, \\"a loaded gun in the house next door.\\" Books cause people to be different, books make people question things-- books make people unhappy.This book is astonishing in its implications of where society is headed (or maybe already is at). Sensory pleasure dictates everybody's lives: they obtain their pleasure out of violence and live for nothing important at all. As Clarisse, a girl in the story who is the impetus for Guy Montag's complete 180, states: \\"People don't talk about anything... They name a lot of cars or clothes or swimming pools mostly and say how swell! But they all say the same things and nobody says anything different from anybody else.\\" Even children do not escape the horrible condition of the society-- they are violent, and frequently kill each other.F 451 is full of such psychological subtleties that turn the story into a tangible, beleivable being. Ray Bradbury writes with such passion, you cannot help but to feel his anger, loss, and hope as it were your own. Unfortunately, those same qualities that make this book so stunning also make it difficult for those of a lower reading comprehension level to understand. The style of writing, which is almost entirely stream of conscious, can put less adventerous readers off. This story, also, takes a level of maturity and experience that a lot of high school readers (where a lot of people read this book) find very difficult to manage.F 451 is still an adventure through the human psyche like no other. This book causes you to stop and look at the world around you in far more detail than you ever would have otherwise-- and it definitely makes you think about the disease that is ever present today in a society like America."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish Edition)","review":"I had to choose a science fiction book for my English class and this left me many options.

The sole purpose of Montag's job as a fireman is to burn books because in the future owning or reading books has become illegal. One day when Montag is walking home from work, he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan. Clarisse is a seven-teen year old and a free sprit. She is intrigued by the ideas in book and asks Montag questions about him. One question that she asks him is if he is happy. This question makes Montag think about himself and thinks his happiness is in reading books. Yet Montag's wife Mildred is more concerned with an alternate reality of television and her \\"family\\". This is upsetting to Montag because he has realized the \\"family\\" works just as a blanket, and it covers up truth and knowledge. Montag is finally pushed to the edge when he has to burn a woman and her house of books alive. Montag at last realizes that there must be something in books to cause people to sacrifice their lives for them.I enjoyed this book very much and I would rate it in my top ten of favorite books. I like it because its message of censorship and knowledge's importance in society. I viewed the portrayal of censorship like that of George Orwell's 1984 in that both books portray a limit of freedom of speech and the suppressing of original ideas. This is shown in Fahrenheit 451 by the burning of books and the over-sized televisions. Burning books stopped flow of opinions. This is shown when Montag asks Mrs. Bowles and Mrs. Phelps their opinions on the war; they do not even care anything about it even though they have relatives in the war. Mrs. Bowles and Mrs. Phelps are more concerned about the \\"family\\" and the size of the television sets than anything else in the whole world.Although I like this book very much, I do not think this book is for everyone. This book can get confusing at times with all of Bradbury's use of foreshadowing and symbolism. It is also hard to follow Montag's constant reflection on past experiences. Overall I think that everyone who likes reading books that are cynical about the future or who care about it should read this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish Edition)","review":"Ray Bradbury is an awesome author. He uses excellent description for this futuristic world. I love how he uses his creative mind to form this really good plot with the whole book-burning thing and the firefighters actually starting the fires! I also enjoyed reading about the different futuristic devices that he uses in his \\"new world\\", such as the wall-size television screens, the Seashell Radios that hook up on your ear, and the speeding cars. It was a great pleasure reading this book.

The army has been accused of having poor morale, poor leadership, poor tactics, poor operational strategy, poor equipment, and just about anything derisive that could be written about an army. Some of these accusations are well supported by historical evidence, other accusations have little basis. David French's RAISING CHURCHILL'S ARMY presents an assessment of the British Army in the Second World War, that is strongly supported by historical evidence. He disproves many accusations against the army while concentrating on its principal failing, an inadequate indoctrination of combined arms tactics. Anyone interested in understanding (or attacking) the British performance in the Second World War should read this book."},{"Title":"Raising Churchill's Army: The British Army and the War against Germany 1919-1945","review":"I was expecting a book about the expansion of regiments, brigades and the creation of new divisions but it's a lot more in depth than that. It's about the creation of an army that could defeat the Germans, through changing tactics, communications and weapons. It's somewhat of a dry read but the argument is very strong that the British, despite their best intentions simply failed to develop their soldiers in a fashion that could beat the Germans. In the end the army had to go about things within its limitations.There's quite a bit of good detail to support all this. The difference proper communications made is very well argued. I also learned, after reading about it for years - why British tanks had such a limited turret ring. Another quote that stuck in my mind was a British officers dismissal of a German exercise in the 1930s with the comment - when in 'battle' all the German responded \\"in the same way\\", implying that British flexibility made for superiority - except the Germans were actually showing the strength of drill, which allowed even junior officers to attack/react quickly in appropriate manners - whereas the absence of drills in the British army and the wide variety of interpretation of the 'manual' was actually a significant weakness. Montgomery saw this and drills, common to all units, became a focus as the war went on.There is not a great deal of battle accounts but more the findings that followed - again, in the authors opinion, often misinterpreted by the British command. He does look at weapons and the use of artillery in particular and does discuss the manpower issues that the British faced. As I said a bit dry but I liked it. It was informative and looked at things from angles I had never considered.The blurb on the back adds this \\"the first serious analysis of the combat capability of the British army in WW2. It sweeps away the myth that the army suffered from poor morale, and that it only won, by adopting Haig WW1 type tactics. Interwar strategy identified technology as the means to reduce casualties but shortages and \\"doctrine\\" were great weaknesses\\""},{"Title":"Raising Churchill's Army: The British Army and the War against Germany 1919-1945","review":"If anyone wants to understand why the British Army fought the Second World War the way they did, this is the book for you. In fact I would say it is essential reading for anyone interested in the British contribution during the war.French looks at how the British Army learnt from the lessons of the First World War and applied them in the inter-war years but points out how they did not go far enough and establish common doctrine. He analyses how the various factors of the inter-war years, lack of common doctrine, lack of the needed equipment, economic and political factors played their role in the setbacks the British Army saw during the first half of the war; but also how they played their role in the few successes the army was able to achieve at the same time.French then examines the second half of the war and when the equipment the army needed finally started to arrive in the numbers required, how manpower shortages effected the operational and tactical ability of the army, and how key personalities, such as Bernard Montgomery, asserted their influence on the army and began to correct the flaws within; leading to a force that was confident it could take on and defeat their opponents, which it did."},{"Title":"Wine Country Architecture and Interiors","review":"Just like all the other books in Whitesides' books, this one is artistic, beautiful, and unique.

It is part of the core curriculum for an M.A. in New Testament or Old Testament Exegesis at Wheaton. I am a pastor who preaches regularly. This book has impacted my entire understanding of the Old Testament in a powerful way.The logical format of this book gives the reader a simple and effective way to slowly enter into the worldview of ancient people. The author is very good at giving readers hinge concepts to help understand the distinctions between our worldview and their worldview.The book categorizes ancient near eastern thought into topics that are actually enjoyable to read. Each topic could easily overlap with other topics, and Dr. Walton does a great job of separating the topics without distorting them (in my opinion).This book tackles thorny issues that separate Evangelicals from Liberals in the land of scholars, without alienating either side of the issue. Walton's premise is that we should abandon the old approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Thought and simply understand what they believed, and how it was different from or the same as Old Testament thought.One concept that emerges as the book develops is the idea that some Israelite prophets argued for the support of the covenant with God rather than for the reinforcement of the Kings authority (as the prophets of other cultures and sometimes Israeli culture did). This sets Israeli prophets who held to the covenant with God at odds with everyone else who prophecied in Israel and around Israel. Coupled with the exclusiveness of the Jewish religion, and the people soon became alienated from those around them and sometimes from their own religion or people.Probably the most helpful aspect of this book is his excellent approach to comparative studies without labeling certain parts of the bible as extensions of other cultures or vice versa. His approach, when properly understood, is actually what both sides of the historical divide on this topic ought to be doing. I find it not only full of wisdom, but extremely helpful in preparing sermons from the Old Testament.A nice companion to this volume is The Bible Background Commentary of the Old Testament. I think that this book shows you how to use the Bible Background Commentaries.One criticism that I would like to mention is that some of the charts in this book are a bit difficult for me to understand. That's an area that the next edition may have to improve on. However, there are only a few pages like that and the rest of the book is really a very very good summary and introduction to Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament.Some of the topics he covers include but are by no means limited to:The Ancient View of the World.The Ancient view of the heavens.The Ancient view of TemplesThe Ancient view of Omens and Magic.I think he has around 13 topics in all. This book is well worth reading and if you plan to teach from the Old Testament over the years, you might want to pick up a copy for your personal library. It's packed with helpful references also."},{"Title":"Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament: Introducing the Conceptual World of the Hebrew Bible","review":"Walton provides the reader with an excellent synthesis of the broad reaches of ANE study and the biblical text through the presentation of essential documents from the ANE (including Egypt). His aim is not to prove or disprove any aspects of biblical truth (polemics) or to establish the ANE as the father for the Old Testament's text and traditions (borrowing). Rather, he succeeds in laying out a framework of thought (\\"cognitive environment\\") that existed in the ancient world and seeing how these elements are shared by the people of Israel (contextualizing their culture and community). He interacts with leading scholars for each respective field (Assman for Egyptology, for example), but keeps the work from scholarly minutae, opting instead for a readable, well-documented and defended work on the way in which people of the ancient world percieved themselves (anthropology), their community (sociology), their god(s) (theology) and other key topics. An excellent work and a must read for anyone who desires to teach, preach or learn about Mesopotamia and/or the Old Testament."},{"Title":"Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament: Introducing the Conceptual World of the Hebrew Bible","review":"Divided into five distinctive sections, this book provides an introductory look at the conceptual world surrounding the Hebrew Bible. The five sections are Comparative Studies, Literature of the Ancient Near East, Religion, Cosmos, and People.The section on Literature of the Ancient Near East is is a good, although very brief, survey of the literature of the ancient near east including Egyptian, Sumerian, Akkadian, and Hittite. The author has included a good cross section of ritual texts, letters, chronicles, legal collections, hymns, wisdom literature, and prophecy.The section on Religion is subdivided into The Gods, Temples and Rituals, and State and Family Religion. Here the reader is exposed to ancient thought on these subjects with the intent that they come to understand the common beliefs and practices well as beliefs and practices that differentiated them from each other.The section on the Cosmos examines both the geography of the cosmos and the beliefs surrounding them. The section on the geography of the cosmos is excellent and includes an examination of the structure of heaven, the earth and the netherworld. I found this section to be particularly interesting and very informative with an excellent exposition on the Hebrew word \\"bara\\" and the functional aspects of naming.The final section on People provides an excellent examination of the various concepts of creation of the human race as well as what it means to be human. It also includes a very good explanation of the interaction between the people and their religion including prophecy, oracles, and their perception of history as a nation. This section ends with a discussion of the beliefs about the future of the earth and what happens after death.Throughout the book the author has included excellent side-bar sections offset in shaded boxes that further illuminate related ideas and concepts. These often contain some of the best and most interesting observations of the material if you are already somewhat familiar with the subject.Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament provides a solid comparative study of the various literature from the ancient near east showing both commonalities and differences with the beliefs of the nation of Israel. The book clearly sets the culture of Israel in the Old Testament times alongside those of its neighbors and allows the reader to better understand the mindset of the time. Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament: Introducing the Conceptual World of the Hebrew Bible","review":"Despite having taken 8 seminary courses in Old Testament (OT), I found Walton's book allowed me to make a quantum leap forward in my understanding of the OT. It is like all these years I've been \\"watching\\" the OT on a 13 inch black-and-white TV and since reading Walton's book, I'm now I'm watching it on a 40 inch high definition color TV! It has really helped that much!You can see from the other reviews how great this book is. I only want to reinforce two points.First, in addition to the general understanding you will get from this book, there are two specific things that may happen to you as you read. If you take the Bible reverently, you may initially feel uncomfortable to learn about how much similarity there is in thought, behavior, belief, and even religious customs between the OT and its Ancient Near Eastern neighbors. However, by contrast, you will be delighted and amazed to see many of the most important, distinctive aspects of OT teaching stand out from that ancient background in a way you could have never before imagined. Both types of information, by the way, increase our understanding of the meaning of the biblical texts - that is, both types of information will provide you with many, many \\"Aha\\" moments.The second point is this. As I write, this is the 12th posted review, and 11 of the 12 are 5 star reviews. The only 4 star review complained that the book seemed much like a college textbook (which I believe it is!). If, like that reviewer, you find it a bit tough going, I encourage you to stick with it! There's a lot to digest. But aside from some strange sounding names of \\"gods\\" and names of ancient practices, Walton writes in a clear style which the general reader can enjoy.If you read the OT, or ever plan on doing so, get this or you are destining yourself to understand much less of it than you otherwise could."},{"Title":"Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament: Introducing the Conceptual World of the Hebrew Bible","review":"Walton's book is an invaluable resource for reading the Old Testament in its context. Bible students clearly recognize the importance of context - but often ignore the cultural, historical and theological contexts in which the Scriptures were written. Conservatives tend to err toward docetism in their view of scriptures (it's all Divine so what do we care about the human side?) while liberals tend to err in the opposite extreme (it's all human). The reality is, the scriptures do contain cultural terminology that must be understood in its original cultural, historical and religious context.Walton's book does just this. He opens the ancient mindset to the modern reader. This is critical for reading the OT in its true context - particularly the creation accounts in Genesis, the Exodus stories, the interactions of Israel with the nations, et al.Bible believers of all stripes owe a great debt to the research of conservative scholars like Walton, Matthews, and others who do not simply take a knee-jerk polemic stance against the scholarly world simply because some conclusions do not jive with conservative presuppositions & assumptions (many of which are equally modern presuppositions). This is not to say Walton is a 'liberal.' He is a scholar in the best sense of the term: He seeks to explore what the Bible really is and how it came to us."},{"Title":"Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament: Introducing the Conceptual World of the Hebrew Bible","review":"I am not a scholar, nor do I hold any degrees, but I have read many a book on various ANE topics, and I do not know if I have ever read a more thoroughly researched book. Walton's chapter on ANE ontology of deity is worth the whole book. Additionally, how that that ontological understanding impacts certain Old Testament cornerstones like the Decalogue and the 10 Plagues is astounding.As a long time Christian scholar, Walton avoids the all to common mistakes of simply saying that all of the OT is merely borrowing from the ANE, and the other mistake of saying that there are enough differences that we ought not busy ourselves comparing the two.This by no means an easy book to read and I would not recommend it as an introduction to this kind of field, but if you can handle the footnotes, if you have a basic working understanding of some of the major ANE myths, and are interested in how the Hebrew Old Testament fits in all of that, it will be well worth your time.On a final note, I hunted down Walton's email address at the university where he teaches, and wrote an email thanking him for the work put into this book and how thoroughly I enjoyed reading it both times I read it. Believe it or not, I got an email back from him the following morning! Five stars for that alone."},{"Title":"Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament: Introducing the Conceptual World of the Hebrew Bible","review":"I bought this book thinking it was dealing with one thing, only to find when I started reading, that it was not. It is a comparative type study of the Old Testament and the surrounding near Eastern teachings. Many \\"scholars\\" today say the OT has borrowed its \\"stories\\" from other pagan nations, and that there is nothing really new or unique about the religion contained within. This book seeks - and accomplishes - proving this to be incorrect.There was much in this book that kind of went over my head, and was more technical than I could fully grasp (either that or I wasn't fully able to concentrate while reading), but for the most part the book is filled with details of surrounding nations that really shed some new light on our understanding of the OT text. Some of the most striking revelations to me were looking at the first four of the ten commandments.After understanding how the other nations looked at deity, worshiped their deity, and made images of them - and what those images were there for - it really altered my understanding of why God said what he said in the commandments. My understanding of the intent and purpose of those commands has changed, not drastically or in direct opposition of what I believed on the topic, but I understand better what they were specifically worded to address, and how some of my application of them was not necessarily accurate.Another very interesting section was in dealing with the temples of a deity. Everything from how they were created, what they suggested, how they were described, and what took place there, it really gave some major depth to a lot of things; things that I really need to study further after re-reading part of this book again.Other than that highlight, just understanding some of the complex things the other nations believed, and yes, even seeing how some of that was common in the OT belief system, just gave depth and detail to my understanding of the ancient OT world. I think books like this should be required reading for all pastors; in order to bring the OT to life in sermons, they need to understand the culture and issues that surrounded the writings of it. Likewise for the NT text, the culture, context, and local issues - audience relevance - is the key to understanding the text.So, I gleaned quite a bit from this book, but would love to take the time for a more detailed reading to grasp more. I recommend this book as a great source of study for a better grasp of OT thought and practice."},{"Title":"Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament: Introducing the Conceptual World of the Hebrew Bible","review":"This is an important book! Students will commonly find books about the cultures of the Ancient Near East, but this book is about how these ancients thought. No, this is not a volume about the psychology of the ancients but about what Walton calls the \\"cognitive environment.\\" Useful throughout are sidebars in which Dr. Walton makes \\"Comparative Exploration\\" of the various topics between the Near Eastern cultures and that of ancient Israel. There are 41 of these. But the general text treats of ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian, some Canaanite and, of course, Israelite thought. The author is well aware of the pitfalls of his approach and readers who enter this with suspicion should read Walton's postscript before reading the book itself. It is there where he emphasizes that this volume is a \\"generalization\\" and a \\"synthesis.\\"I do have some minor structural caveats which do not affect my overall view of the book itself. Walton lists 22 photographs. There was no apparent crediting of the photos until I found, in very small print on the copyright page, the attributing of these selections to Zev Radovan--whom students of Biblical Archaeology will recognize for his wonderful photographic contributions in other venues. These were apparently downloaded, with permission, from his website, \\"Zev Radovan's Bible Land Pictures.\\" I checked some of these at random--for example, on p. 63 (photo 2) Walton has selected a shot of one of the registers of the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III. Although the caption is minimal, the text nicely ties in to the photo with a reference to Israel's king Jehu. But some of the other photographs are a puzzle. On p. 119 the photo 8 caption simply reads: \\"Arad Sanctuary.\\" But nowhere in the text on that page is the Arad alluded to. And many other photos are similarly left for the reader to deduce why it was placed on the page. In this case, Walton is discussing \\"Sacred Space\\" and I assume the Arad Sanctuary is provided here to illustrate that sacred space structure is similar in Israel to other Mesopotamian temple structures. But I would have preferred that Walton not leave this to guesswork and either provided a fuller caption or direct mention of the photo within the context of the discussion on that page. Moreover, I was not able to discover this particular photograph on Zev Radovan's website so I still don't know if this was supplied by him or not. I would also have preferred to have information on the exact location of each of the photograph's object of interest. In some cases this is obvious, but in others the museum where it is kept would have been of value.There are actually 23 photographs. The one on the cover, of the sun god Shamash, is given separate treatment and full credit is given to the Museum of Oriental Antiquities, Istanbul, Turkey where it is part of their collection. Interestingly, on p. 100 there is a different picture--this one Zev Radovan's no. 1362-2--of the sun god Shamash but taken from the Tablet of Sippar and kept at the British Museum, but the latter information is not provided for the reader. The photo caption simply reads: \\"Sun God.\\" I will return to this sun god depiction further below. This is a small quibble but Walton's book is otherwise a marvel of resources for the student and a fuller caption would simply have strengthened the resource information.Beginning on p. 343 there is what Walton calls \\"Bibliography.\\" In fact, this should be entitled \\"Selective Bibliography.\\" The reader will soon discover that this bibliography often does not match the reference data provided in the copious footnotes. The literature on the topic which Dr. Walton has pulled together is vast but it is clear from the literature he has selected that the book is directed toward an American audience of scholars and students--or, at the very least, to an English readership. 98 percent of all the material he provides in either the Bibliography, or in the footnotes themselves are from scholarly publications in English. I found at least one reference to something in French and several others to German material but they are few. This is not to say that Walton does not draw from English translations from their French or German originals. He knows that Americans--by and large--are monolingual and thus, he is concerned to place the broad selection of materials conveniently at the hands of English speaking students. Nevertheless, for ease of use, I would have preferred to have seen a master bibliography at the end of the book that would have incorporated all of the material found both in the footnotes and the collection of materials Walton provides at the end. However, it is not an \\"impossible\\" situation because the author has provided a thorough author index and if someone wishes to track down an abbreviated reference in any given footnote, he or she can resort to the index and find the fuller reference.Even generalizations must have limits. Where are the boundaries in Walton's book? Quite clearly the author takes in Mesopotamian - specifically, Sumerian and ancient Babylonian as well as Assyrian as well as some Hittite and Canaanite (Ugarit). Ancient Egypt is also very nicely covered. Walton's \\"Levant\\" takes in Moabite and Aramaean. But whereas on p. 66 the Cyrus Cylinder and the Behistun Inscription are mentioned, no discussion of Persian thought patterns or the impact it had on the exiles of ancient Israel--for what would later become known as Judaism--appears in the book. This is an area that would be well worth a separate book to continue the theme Dr. Walton has developed here.The topic of \\"creation\\" has been addressed throughout Walton's work and, while it could have been expanded considerably, Walton has published a separate treatise, The Lost World of Genesis One: Ancient Cosmology and the Origins Debate, (2009) to better address the matter.There are some areas I could wish had been expanded in this present work. First, the topic of \\"chaos\\" is one. The picture on the front cover and that of the Tablet of Sippar on p. 100, of the sun god Shamash on his throne, showing it founded on water--water being an ancient symbol of chaos--could easily have been expanded to include the dais in the throne room of King Zimri-Lim at Mari. That dais was designed to simulate water. Surely Psalm 29:10 \\"The Lord sitteth upon the flood; yea, the Lord sitteth King for ever\\" draws on the same cognitive environment where Yahweh's rule keeps chaos in control.Second, on p. 169, n. 14 Walton says: \\"If wordplays are to be taken seriously, the Egyptians may have believed that the heavens were made of meteoric iron, since pieces of it fell to earth...\\" There is no reason in the world why wordplays cannot be taken seriously. There are, in fact, so many different facets of this topic. Walton, on p. 207 alludes to word play in both the Akkadian word for god \\"ilu\\" and in the Hebrew name for Adam, etc. On p. 254 Dr. Walton recognizes that research must continue on this topic. Puns, in America, are often said to be \\"the lowest form of humor.\\" But the ancients saw homonyms and even similarities as representing \\"identity.\\" It is on this basis that the \\"Execration texts\\"--a kind of magical way of \\"destroying\\" ones enemies, much as voodoo dolls were used in some Caribbean cultures--\\"worked\\" for the ancients. The same thought mode must be behind Jacob's request for the name of his \\"wrestling partner\\" in Genesis 32:24-30 where Jacob gave his own name but could not obtain the name of the \\"man\\" with whom he wrestled. It implied power over that person whose name became known. And it is very likely that when the ancients were given names at birth, that name became synonymous with the actual biological person. By \\"destroying\\" the name, one also (supposedly) destroyed the real being. And it must have been in this same vein that when a person was given a new name (note \\"Saul\\" in the New Testament became \\"Paul\\" after his encounter with the Divine). In the Old Testament, therefore, Abram became Abraham, Jacob became Israel. But the evidence of serious word plays themselves make their appearance, for one example, in Jeremiah 1:11 where the word \\"almond\\" produces the revelation that the Lord is \\"watching\\"--the consonants of the word is the same, only the vowels in the Hebrew are different.Aside from the indices on Scriptures, on ancient literature, on authors, and on subject matter, there is also a convenient appendix giving a summarizing list of the gods of the ancient Near East.Walton's book is a rich and fertile exposition of the thought world of the ancient Near East but proves that there is so much more to explore."},{"Title":"Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament: Introducing the Conceptual World of the Hebrew Bible","review":"I honestly wish I could shake John Walton's hand for writing this scholarly treatment of the ancient Near East. This book illuminates the cultural world that the Israelites were living in. With objectivity Walton surveys almost every concievable aspect of ancient Near East culture. The reader is illuminated to the mindset and understanding of the ancient cultures and as a result gains a deeper understanding of the Israelites of the Old Testament. This book is crucial for Old testament study and comprehension. Some believers might be surprised by how alike the Israelites were to their surrounding neighbors; however I think believers will also feel enlightened to see just how unique Israel was in many aspects.

Instead, I desired to sift through the information provided by the specialists who have diligently made the literatures and cultures of the ancient Near East available to us,...\\" John Walton.Prologue to Hermerneutics:Half a century past, when I read the Old Testament in the city where it was first translated from Hebrew, now then, in its cousin language Arabic, much of the biblical narratives seemed stories from an ancient mythical past to me, the young Psaltos. However, when I started to formulate inquisitive questions, the most refreshing though troubling replies came from my father, a specialist in comparative civil law, a professor in the French Lyceum and a former Viennese student in the European enlightenment milieu of the thirties, the young teenager was then introduced to comparative criticism through JH Breasted, Gardiner and Lang when I began to understand how ancient Egyptian viewed the world, the Old Testament becomes more clearly a book that stood \\"within its ancient context, while also speaking against it,\\" in the words of Wheaton's J. Walton.Renewal of Biblical Studies:\\"The rediscovery of Egypt began in earnest in the eighteenth century AD and of Mesopotamia in the mid-nineteenth century AD. With the decipherment of the ancient languages, the tens of thousands of texts that were being unearthed began to be translated and analyzed. ... Initial studies were inclined to be defensive of the Bible, even if such a stance required the dismissal or distortion of the cuneiform texts. The flurry of activity in connection with the relationship of these texts to the Bible had reached a critical mass of sorts by the turn of the century; and, consequently, widespread attention was attracted by the series of lectures presented in 1902 under the auspices of the German Oriental Society and attended by Kaiser Wilhelm II.\\"Israel's Intellectual Milieu:John Walton suggests three main roles that a comparative study could play in Hebrew Bible interpretation: critical analysis, defense of the biblical text, and exegesis. He focuses on exegesis and its particular importance for guarding interpretation against applying modern world-views. Walton offers a thoughtful introduction to ancient Near Eastern literature and the common milieu of 'cognitive environment' that rediscovers the world of ancient Israel. He evaluates concepts of ancient beliefs on gods, views on people and history, about religion, the cosmos, after surveying types of literature, after a survey of the interface between the ancient Near East and Israel, clarifying the analogies and non similarities between them.Comparative Biblical Study:This book provides an excellent introduction to the field of comparative Biblical studies and integrates many specialized studies by Coogan, Chavalas, Currid, Kitchen, Redford, and Yamauchi on Israel's neighbors. He makes use of extra biblical resources to enrich their understanding of ancient Israel and its Scriptures. This is very well explained by Peter Machinist, of Harvard University, \\"Comparisons between the culture of biblical Israel and the other cultures of the ancient Near East have long been a fundamental part of biblical scholarship, but more often than not, they have been presented in piecemeal, isolated fashion. In his new book, John Walton offers a much broader reach, giving us arguably the most extensive review of these cultural comparisons now available together with a serious meditation on what the enterprise of cultural comparison is all about in biblical study.\\"Analytical Book reviews:- \\"... excellent survey of the interface between the ancient Near East and Israel. I especially appreciate his sidebars on 'Comparative Exploration,' which enable readers to 'zero in' on the comparative topic of their choice relatively easily.\\"--Mark Chavalas, U. Wisconsin- \\"... an important and useful guide to entering into some of the major worldviews and value systems found in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Israel. ..., bridges the gaps between ancient Near Eastern texts and the perspectives of the Bible.\\" Richard Hess, Denver Seminary- \\"Walton penetrates beyond the simple comparisons often made to bring back intelligence about the contexts and constitution of the ancient world, stressing the ideas Israel and its contemporaries held in common.

The common cultural assumption is that the OT is simply a Jewish retelling on ancient myths and stories. This MTV view is false. This book provides a rigorous overiview of the literature of the Ancient Near East cultures and while there are similarities here and there, the differences provide an amazing vista of a new ontological horizon - the revelation of a transdent personal being who intervenes in the world history.Thoroughly recommended, complete with photographs, summary tables and clear non-technical language."},{"Title":"Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament: Introducing the Conceptual World of the Hebrew Bible","review":"For some few years now, I have been working through language, symbols and scripture studies in effort to understand ancient constructs; meaning, the way in which our ancestors understood and viewed the world. The author, Walton, does an excellent job of explaining the importance of grasping ancient world views relative to the study, and therefore understanding of biblical scripture. He emphasizes the usefulness of a comparative analysis; looking at the 'mind-set' of the ancients who were living within a world of longstanding paganism. For example, how did the ancients view the cosmos, the role of dieties, the role and function of man on earth as a reflection of the cosmos? Through his comparative and contrasting analysis, Walton in no way diminishes the substance of Christian or Hebrew faith, but rather, expands and illuninates the documented basis of scripture by placing the writings into their proper setting--into the thinking of that time. I highly recommend this book for anyone who would like to attempt to more fully understand the history and nature of man; the history and nature of the relationship of man to diety--God. Therein is a type of 'retro-psychology'--figuratively 'getting into the heads' of our ancestors. Many thanks to Mr. John Walton and to those contributors he cites as sources. A job well done."},{"Title":"Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament: Introducing the Conceptual World of the Hebrew Bible","review":"This book contains details about the period of interest that supplement what I know about the period.

After reading this book, I am interested in learning more about feminist theory and how it relates to sex work. Jill Nagle compiles a various assortment of different kinds of sex work from stripping, to S&amp;M, to phone sex operators. As a woman, as a feminist, as a man, as a critical reader, as a sexual being, please do read this book. highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Whores and Other Feminists","review":"As a journalist from the San Francisco area who knows nearly half of this book's authors, as a lifelong feminist, and as a sexworker for over 20 years, my perspective is widely encompassing. This book expands the boundaries of feminism beyond the conservative boundaries of the women's movement of the Seventies. After decades of the bipolar assault on womens' sexuality, from Andrea Dworkin to Phyllis Schaffly -- two sides of the same conservative coin -- it is refreshing to see a new generation of women not only claiming their own bodies but also taking charge of them. This book helps give them a voice.Certainly, there are sad cases in the adult industry, and perhaps some of them do end up in sexwork because of a difficult past, yet to suggest there would be few sexworkers if every woman in America were happy and well-adjusted is a fallacy in logic. I have personally known many brilliant, self-actualized women who have done and continue to do sexwork. You'll find some of them in the pages of this book.I can easily understand the negative reviews, however. Many Americans are so rooted in the Puritanical yet hedonist nature of our culture, there is a prevalent sexual ambivalence in our society: we're fascinated and titillated by sex, yet also afraid of it. We're simultaneously obsessed and fascinated with bodies (ours and others') yet also ashamed of them. Then there are the reviews clearly sent by female Rush Limbaugh \\"dittoheads\\" -- people who use the word \\"feminazi\\" with a straight face and secretly believe a woman is a second class citizen. Forgive them, Mother, they know not what they say.This is an excellent book on sexwork as the new radical, leading edge of feminism, and I highly recommend it to any woman (or man) with an open mind who isn't afraid to think for herself."},{"Title":"Whores and Other Feminists","review":"The perspectives presented in Nagle's revolutionary book made me re-think a lot of my politically correct feminist assumptions. I realized that perhaps prostitutes are not victims. In fact, they may possibly be the most empowered women of all. Men are charged for every minute they spend with them, the smart ones carefully screen their clients, and they don't sugarcoat the services they provide with dishonest romantic rhetoric.I was left with the astonishing conclusion that misogyny's victims are most often housewives, mistresses and girlfriends. These women allow men free access to their bodies, while often serving as maids, cooks, nurturers, escorts, masseuses and companions. Whores prove that a woman's time and sexual attention has real and significant economic value.This book is a must read for any critical thinker. It will change you."},{"Title":"Whores and Other Feminists","review":"I am mystified by some of the negative customer reviews of this book. Jill Nagle's anthology of essays across the sex worker theme did nothing short of smash every stereotype I had ever held about prostitutes, exotic dancers and other sex workers. These stereotypes have undoubtedly been created by the alternate over-glamorous and sub-realist portrayals from Hollywood. While any critically thinking reader will understand that Nagle doesn't cover the seedy underbelly of child prostitution and harmful sex services, what she shows is voluntary sex work on an equal par with any other skilled profession, though with a healthy dose of self-reflection, feminism and personal growth on the part of the workers themselves. I probably bought five additional copies to send to friends. It's an eye-opener."},{"Title":"Whores and Other Feminists","review":"What is most fascinating about the war for sexual equality is that sex itself is the principle battlefield. The average American male idolizes Hugh Hefner for having seven girl friends all one-third his age and enjoying a lavish life style that was paid for by the fleshy attributes, surgically enhanced and otherwise, of thousands of women. Yet if a woman claims to have had hundreds of sexual partners and profited from those ventures, she's a social outcast whose potential husbands or boyfriends are silently held to \\"you're not going to get serious about her, are you?\\" As far back as the middle 18th Century, the most lascivious of the mainstream women's rights campaigners, Wicked Victoria Woodhull, who coined the term Free Love, was written out of feminist history by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony as an embarrassment to the more serious elements of the struggle. Jill Nagle's book challenges the debate on its most fundamental playing field: is sex part of sexual equality? Is profiting from and enjoying one's sexual skills and powers only a male option? This book is funny, entertaining, sexy, provocative, uncompromising and above all, marvelously intelligent and insightful. Yes, that woman in the Eros Guide ad has a master's degree and finds more freedom, fun, and financial gain in tying up and spanking the bank president than she once had fetching his coffee and dodging his ass-grabbing. Really, not all women who strut about in high heels and nothing else at the Mitchell Brothers theater are the victims of sexual abuse. And yes, if a woman has the right to say no, she has the right to say yes to whatever might feel good and look good and accept the array of consequences without selling out anyone else's political expectations. I loved this book: any man who feels threatened by smart, sexy, independent women has missed the best of them. Read and enjoy, and while you're at it, learn a few things. It will stay on my book shelf for a long time.

The women in this book have made these types of sex work (and many more) into careers, and it's fascinating to read their experienced take on the sex industry and on American cultural attitudes. If you've ever been curious about sex work and sex workers, Jill Nagle's book is for you."},{"Title":"Whores and Other Feminists","review":"I am a firm believer that anyone involved in the politics of sex work (pro or con) would benefit from reading this book. The writing in this collection puts a human face and name to what often gets boiled down to semantics and political warfare. These stories and essays are all well written, personal and provide the reader with an easy familiarity and way to feel some empathy where, that might not have existed before.

I had a stern talking to from a 'concerned' female gynocolgist when she found me reading it in the waiting room (she recommended I read Andrea Dworkin.) I bonded with my former best friend, the first other ho I met when I moved to SF, over our similar experience of revelation and realization when we read this book. I have recommended it to many intimate partners (and colleagues) over the past six years, to give them insight into my feelings and ethics and motivations regarding work.

After reading several books relating to people (mostly women) in the sex industry, Ms. Jill Nagle presents a very good picture. The only problem is that she only gives us a taste of this or a taste of that. This book could be bigger giving the reader more insight into what it is to be a sex worker. Because there is only enough information to answer some of the basic questions, when the book causes you to ask more, it is doing what Ms. Nagle probably intended to; break the reader of what they have known and perceived of pornography, prostitution, peep shows, and strippers. The next phase is to educate the public outside of an industry that we may all be participating in anyway.The public needs to redefine what it is we find objectionable because the sex industry is a part of who we are. It is a commentary on all of us and questions why we define women and sex as dirty or bad here in modern America."},{"Title":"Whores and Other Feminists","review":"This book is very helpful to people in the sex industry who don't have a voice. However, the stories are more gory than they are informative. Sometimes it reads like a Jerry Springer show and it causes the women to loose their voice of dignity. I doubt the book would sell decently if it were not for the glorifying of the ugly, but that element in the stories dilutes the message that the title purports to convey. The story of feminism is lost in a blur of Jerry Springer exagerations of the profession. Overall, the book is still a big contribution to sex worker literature where very little exists, but the book fails to express any firm notion of real feminism among its expression of the bizarre."},{"Title":"Whores and Other Feminists","review":"The oxymoronic title of Nagle's book, \\"Whores and Other Feminists\\" signals from the start that this is just another entry in the disingenuous genre of books about prostitution that redefine feminism as what it is not. Feminism doesn't sugar coat sexism, or try to make women comfy with it. Feminism analyzes what John Adams smugly termed \\"our masculine systems\\" - of which prostitution is a primary example - and fights back because sexist systems pay off for men at women's expense. And telling the hard truth about the political meaning and lived realities of prostitution is not \\"blaming prostitutes\\" - it is holding men responsible for what they do to women, something that handmaidens to misogyny like Nagle et al. are afraid to do. Nagle strategically ignores a key fact - women don't write the script for whores - men do, and if calling misogyny feminism broadens the market for prostitution, hey give the customer what he wants. That's what prostitution is all about."},{"Title":"Whores and Other Feminists","review":"Only women who need feminist bravado to feel secure in their womanhood will find this bok useful because it repeats what these sad women need to hear.

Wasserman's range of knowledge and interests was wide, and his sardonic view of the world is as refreshing as a glass of lemonade after some overly-sweet candy.These were newspaper columns and thus topical, but they have lost little interest over the years. The Wasserman touch remains individual, the quotations marvelously apt, the conclusions clear.

I not only \\"watched\\" the action, drama, and comedic scenes of this down and dirty, yet heartfelt mystery, I became a part of its life. Mystic Island is the kind of \\"Who done it?\\" that makes noise, because you get to interact with the characters, - and there are certainly some shady, as well as laugh out loud (LOL) characters on \\"Mystic Island\\". The author's knack for this type of storytelling is salient, - I will be looking for more by Mr. Whitford."},{"Title":"Mystic Island","review":"\\"Mystic Island\\" is a book filled with comedy, mystery, sex and violence. It is a little hard to follow, and there are many story lines but you still get pulled into the story. His style of writing is also a little primitive. It is based in \\"Mystic Island\\" which I'm pretty sure is code for Jamestown, RI. Finding a fiction book based on summers in Southern RI has long been a dream of mine, which came true when I received this book as a gift. It is mostly written through Environmental Police Officer (EPO) Nikki O'Connors view, and her dealings with the campers and fishermen of Seabreeze campground.If you are into World War II history, especially in Narragansett Bay, I recommend this book. It even mentions Walter Schroeder's book in the middle of the story. HOWEVER, do not intend to read this book as if everything is true.. because it is a FICTION novel.

Though about where to find a long lost Rooselvelt-Hitler letter at the begging, it quickly turns into who is stealing lobsters from ocean traps. The majority of the novel revolves around this lobster mystery. To bolster hisory, the author shows his ignorance by incorrectly bringing in two (2) historical inaccuracies: Radio Free Europe was founded in 1949 with a first broadcast on 4 July 1950 to Czechoslovakia, not 1945 as he says; Joseph Goebbels was never in the military because of his club foot, therefore he was not a General as the author says. He was the Propagamda Minister for the Third Reich (and a very good one.) My biggest complaint is the very short chapters (mostly 2--3 pages, which comes out to 80 chapters for 229 pages!) I believe this author needs to take college creative writing courses."},{"Title":"Famous Problems of Geometry and How to Solve Them","review":"Bold has a gem of a book here. It's only a little bit over a hundred pages, but it's packed full of the great geometry problems that occupied the minds of the world's greatest thinkers for the past 2000 years.The title describes the book perfectly. These really are &quot;Famous Problems from Geometry&quot; and he does indeed explain how to solve them.The book has four major sections/chapters. He discusses in detail the three problems from antiquity (one section each): squaring a circle, doubling a cube, and trisecting an angle. Furthermore, he spends significant time with constructions of regular polygons (the fourth section) - which ones can be constructed and why. He also discusses which ones cannot be constructed and why.The reader will be expected to understand concepts from Modern Algebra, particularly the concept of a Field. While Bold does spend time explaining what a Field is, his definition is quick and is assumed to be more of a refresher for someone who has already learned about them. Bold also has a section on Complex Numbers where he derives one of the formulas used later in the book. Again - this section is assumed to be a refresher on Complex Numbers. High School Geometry or Algebra students would have significant trouble understanding his explanations and proofs.Bold provides problems for the reader to work along the way. These are problems that logically lead to the proof of the problem being studied. The problems are good. As a third year college student majoring in mathematics, I found the explanations/solutions to be sometimes hard to follow. He assumes a great deal about the reader's level of proficiency in math and in geometry. As a result, he liberally skips steps in proofs that are assumed to be &quot;obvious.&quot;If you're expecting simple proofs to these problems, you're not going to find them. If they were simple, they wouldn't have taken 2000 years to solve. But they are explained clearly here in terms that anyone with a college degree should be able to understand.Overall, a superb book. A must have for anyone interested in the famous problems from the history of Geometry."},{"Title":"Famous Problems of Geometry and How to Solve Them","review":"The principles of geometry are both elegant and timeless. One cannot help but understand why the Greeks considered it a pinnacle of intellectual achievement. This book sets down several of the classic problems, explaining them in such a clear way that it is easy to forget that it sometimes took centuries of work before the problem was resolved. Of course, those who first toiled on the problems did not have some of the additional machinery that we so take for granted today.The problems covered are trisecting an angle, squaring the circle, constructing regular polygons and constructing a cube whose volume is twice that of a given cube. The background needed to understand the problems and solutions is nothing more than a solid grounding in basic algebra and trigonometry. Calculus is mentioned, but not used. Problem sets are included in all chapters and solutions to all are in the back of the book. They are well-posed, solidly reinforcing the points made in the text.This is a book that covers several thousand years of progress in geometry in a little over one hundred pages. It is done well and it can be used as a supplement in any course in geometry, from high school to college."},{"Title":"Famous Problems of Geometry and How to Solve Them","review":"Although not reasonable for most high school students, this book does bring to light the background of modern geometry through its treatment of impossible and hard to solve problems.Excellent background reading for a teacher!"},{"Title":"LORDS OF THE SKY","review":"Lords of the Sky is one of the best books I've ever read.

The story boggs down a bit during the middle but overall it was a great read."},{"Title":"LORDS OF THE SKY","review":"I don't read books for literary style, I read them for enjoyment, and I throughly enjoyed this book. I would recomend it to anyone. It captivates its reader all the way through."},{"Title":"LORDS OF THE SKY","review":"I am sorry but I was never able to appreciate this book. I found the plot boring, the characters uninteresting and no ingenious ideas whatever. It was not unconvincing; there simply wasn't anything to grab your attention. Moreover, I thought the style a bit similar to the unfeelingness of cyberpunk -- and since I take great delight in fantasy, cyberpunk is the last thing I'd like a fantasy book to remind me of. The problem is that I read &quot;Lords of the Sky&quot; immediately after Zelazny's Amber series -- how is it possible to rate these two works equally? (Also, if it is REALLY better than the rest of Wells' books, you'll have to introduce negative values on your rating scale.)Anyway, you should try it (as well as any other book) yourself. Judgements are always subjective; and tastes vary extremely."},{"Title":"LORDS OF THE SKY","review":"The quality of writing in this book is above average. The book starts out with beautiful prose that distracts somewhat from the story, but the distraction soon passes.The story is set in a world in which the existence of magic is fairly well integrated into the history of the milieu (as opposed to just being slapped on, without thought to historical consequence of people having access to power that doesn't exist in the real world, as most writers do).This is a story about racial prejudice, injustice, loyalty, morality, and ethics; with the issue of the ability to create life thrown in for good measure. I think the author does a stellar job in dealing with all three.Three races are wrapped up in affairs relating to this issue (there is a fourth race, but they are of less importance to the story overall). The first race, humanity, has simultaneously moved into a geographical area, discovered magic, and created a new set of races from domestic animals that look like humans, but have little thought capacity. Humanity does this because the fourth race, dragons, are eating humanity up at a frightening pace, and the humans throw the new created races to the dragons as food (and a few of these new races are kept around as servants). This group of humans migrates away from the dragons, and discovers a more primitive race of man, and promptly enslaves them and destroys their temples. Some of this more primitive race escape to a new homeland. There, this third race rebuilds, and thousands of years later have begun an ongoing campagin of revenge against the first race of humans in a quest to regain their homelands. Into all this is thrown the twinkling of an idea that maybe the second race, created by the humans as dragonbait and servants millennia ago, isn't as bovine/dog-brained/catlike-independent as the first race has been thinking.So many books end abruptly, with the characters either winning through their problem (one way or another), and then &quot;everything is all right&quot; and the world continues on. Not so for this book. The book goes on to the end of the last character's life. We see all the consequences of their actions and decisions during the story.This book has a strong single viewpoint that I found enormously entertaining, the author almost never leaves the main character.

Not wanting to make the commitment to a series, I picked up Lords of the Sky. All in all I was very pleased. As has been stated by nearly every other reviewer, Lords of the Sky, by Angus Wells, is very well written. That is to say the writing style flows well, is colorful, poetic and romantic. The characters - Daviot the Storyteller, Rwan the Mage, Urt the &quot;changed&quot; servant turned leader and Tezdal, the warrior (male, female, male, male, respectively) - are immediately appealing, interesting and identifiable. The reader gets to know them quickly and intimately. Things are explained well and not just taken as is. You feel for these people and their rich chronicles. It has every aspect and characteristic of a great fantasy epic except for one key element; It's only one book. A long book (650 pages), but one book. If one is going to spend so many, many pages establishing characters and histories - in an engaging and exciting way, mind you - than one should spend at least a decent amount of time bringing all of these pieces to closure. At the end of the book there is a lot of telling about what happens and a less amount of showing what happens. Wells spends the last 15% of the book closing the first 85%, and it ended up being a little, just a little, rushed. Still, all questions are answered. No loose ends. It has all the potential of a Stephen Donaldson or a Robert Jordan series. In defense of Angus Wells, he did mention in his closing notes that the book was originally longer and that his editor had him chop it up a good amount. Perhaps she should have let him keep it the length he wanted to write it. Also there was a jolting change of point-of-view segue right in the middle of the book. We read through the main character's eyes - Daviot - when suddenly the storyline changes. We need to know this new information, yes, but Wells completely stops one to start the other. There are no back and forth chapters, which I myself prefer. There is 300 pages of this POV, then there is about 100 pages of that POV. Fortunately the storylines converge perfectly. Finally the main characters, at the end of the book - characters we've grown to care for - go through a major, and rather de-humanizing change. In all the best books characters do change, but it's along the lines of &quot;something lost, something gained.&quot; In Lords of the Sky, the characters, at the end, gain much, but they loose much more; they lose what drew us to them for the first 500 or so pages. With all this said, I still HIGHLY recommend this book. It's intense, deep, powerful and resonant of excellent storytelling."},{"Title":"LORDS OF THE SKY","review":"I've read a few hundred fantasy books and while I prefer series to single books, I found that I liked this one extremely well. In multiple book series, you get to know the characters and see them change. You grow to like/dislike these characters. This is one of the remarkably few books where you get to see all this happen in only a few hundred pages in only ONE book. This is my favorite book in only one volume series. It evoked emotions which only a dozen other books have done. I suggest this book to anyone who wants a true classic in their possession."},{"Title":"LORDS OF THE SKY","review":"I did like this book, probably more than many because I didn't pay $25 for it! But that's not the correct standard to apply. It's a fun read. But it's also a frustrating read. I typically don't enjoy first person fantasy, find it needlessly restrictive. But, it does help the story move along, so you take the good with the bad.I had problems, though, with switching perspective from first person to third person...call me old school. Really bugged me in a couple cross-country updates.I did think there was much to praise about this book. The notion that if you forget your history, you're bound to suffer. The idea of \\"changed\\" human/animal beings doing tasks with a basic level of intelligence and then rising up against their masters. The characteristic that being kind to everyone, regardless of station, has unexpected rewards. If it wasn't for the sex, I'd recommend this to my daughter. I also really enjoyed how much his character from a fishing village enjoyed taking baths! An interesting detail either of the character or Mr. Wells! Most authors skip this, which I find annoying, but again a necessary component of first person writing.Anyways, it's the first Angus Wells I've read. And I will read some more from him. I liked his approach to the story which was to make this an adventure without letting \\"craft\\" drive things to a crawl. I liked the pace and wished the end wasn't quite so chopped. Won't be mistaken for Kay, Martin, Hobb, Eddings, Lawhead, Farland, etc. But definitely stacks up with some of the GOOD books out there."},{"Title":"LORDS OF THE SKY","review":"This was the first book that exposed me to the world of fantasy fiction. There was a mixture of love, hate, power and struggle amongst the characters and not only did Wells did a superb job at bringing the characters alive in my mind, this book provided cues to our every day lives, especially when dealing with people of different cultures and races. The description of the sceneries was vivid and the romance between Daviot and Rwyan added spice to the story. Read it and be captivated !"},{"Title":"LORDS OF THE SKY","review":"When I started this book I didn't think I was going to like it. It wasn't bad or anything but it was moving at a slow pace early on and I was itching to read some other authors books that I had on my shelf. I am glad I didn't put this one down. It is told almost entirely in first person and while that sometimes doesn't work, I feel this book wouldn't have worked if it wasn't told that way. It is also a stand alone fantasy novel and that originally turned me off as well as I have often found fantasy novels work best in a series form where we truly get to know the world we are reading and the characters.But this one was wonderfully descriptive and had suprising depth. I truly liked the characters and the idea of the main hero of the storyteller not being a warrior, wizard or a Knight but a Storyteller was intriguing. The storytellers are known in the book as a Rememberer or a Mnemonikos, and it is a prestigious rank as they can never forget anything. I found it original and not boring in the least as there was plenty of action to go around.Again this book does start off a bit slow in the sense that you don't really feel any attachment or interest in the main characters until about 60-100 pages in. Or maybe it was just me. But either way, once I got into the book I could not put it down. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"LORDS OF THE SKY","review":"The book is very great, and invokes all sorts of emotions.

There isn't anything that is glaringly wrong with \\"Lords of the Sky\\", but there isn't much that's right with it either. The story is one that any fantasy fan must know by heart. We start with a young boy named Daviot who lives in a quaint seaside village and knows that his people are threatened by sinister invaders known as the \\"Sky Lords\\". Daviot soon learns that he has great magical powers, and leaves to be tutored in a foreign city, falls in love with a beautiful woman, makes friends and allies, and learns 'surprising' facts about the history of his people. Will he and his band of friends be able to unlock the necessary secrets in time to save his homeland from destruction? I won't give away the ending. Angus Wells, on the other hand, isn't so conscientious. He drops blatantly obvious clues almost from the start of the book, so any discerning reader will find it easy to predict not only how the book will end, but also exactly where the heroes will go and what they will do at almost every step along the way.The writing is generally weak, with too much repetition and emphasis on mannerisms rather than character development. The main character often feels his throat being clogged several times on the same page, and people's faces turn red more times than I can count. There are many occasions where characters spout dialogue for several pages on end without any attempt to make it sound like real human interaction. Description is nothing special, and the concluding sequences don't come close to having the narrative power that they should have. Wells makes the distracting choice of telling some of the story in the first person, but unnecessarily shifting to other viewpoints whenever he grows tired of his main character.It is to the author's misfortune that I picked up this work shortly after finishing Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy, a series of books with a similar plot but vastly superior implementation. Hobb masterfully blended elements of courtly intrigue into her story, but the few mentions of political manipulations in \\"Lords of the Sky\\" feel tacked-on. Hobb gave her cast of characters a variety of original and frightening magical talents, but Wells' wizards are limited to old standbys like enhanced memory and shooting bolts of fire. Most importantly, Hobb actually went into the minds of her characters while Wells is content to stick with stock characters and clich&eacute;s. I wouldn't deem \\"Lords of the Sky\\" to be the worst book I've ever read, but we're undergoing a golden age of high fantasy right now, and there's no reason for fans of the genre to content themselves with mediocre work like this."},{"Title":"LORDS OF THE SKY","review":"Great read. In my opinion one can see the improvements in style and character development simply by reading his other series. Lords of the Sky clearly stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of his previous work, but hopefully is only a taste of what will be offered in the future"},{"Title":"Life on the Run","review":"Bradley's memoir of the waning games in the New York Knicks' 1973-74 season (the season after they won their second NBA championship) contains many observations about professional sports that, unfortunately, continue to ring true today: the shameless exploitation of undereducated athletes by agents and comparable parasites; the intrinsic harshness of an itinerant existence during a roadtrip on the West Coast; the grueling physical and mental demands of the NBA regular season; the evanescent nature of fan support. Given all of the above, why then would anyone want to play NBA basketball? Well, Bradley also does a fine job of describing the many thrills an athlete can derive from, among other things, being exhalted by home fans; winning a championship; and being part of a selflless team unit that manages to sublimate individualistic tendancies in its pursuit of greater goals. Bradley's book, from what I can gather, was revolutionary for its time in that it eschewed the type of hagiographic approach that many writers took toward the world of professional sports and ablely demonstrated the myriad difficulties associated with being a player in the nation's largest media spotlight. It should be a must- read for all aspiring NBA players -- especially those players who are considering foregoing several (or all) years of their collegiate eligibilities to make a fast buck. They should be forewarned: &quot;All that glitters isn't gold.&quot;"},{"Title":"Life on the Run","review":"Bill Bradley's account of three weeks in the life of an NBA team in the '70's is as much a stunningly insightful social commentary as it is a nice, easily-rambling, &quot;On the Road&quot;-style ride.

It chronicles the last few weeks of a Knick's season, and all the emotion that comes with it.

Whatever, he's human."},{"Title":"Life on the Run","review":"Bill Bradley's Life on the Run is an insightful and thoughtful account of what it was like to be a professional basketball player in the mid-1970s. Bradley writes about a bygone era--one where all the players weren't multimillionaires, teams traveled commercial, there was no ESPN and media oversaturation and players roomed together. While some things have changed since the book was published nearly 35 years ago, many of the things are the same.Bradley, a star at Princeton, chose to attend Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar for two years before joining the New York Knicks in the NBA. He thought he wouldn't play professionally, but he realized he missed the game while at Oxford.Bradley was the symbol of the Christian, scholar/athlete, but he says much of that image was overblown. \\"I studied, practiced and went to church, but the media exaggerated each facet of my life until expectations were such that I could never fulfill. The greater the acclaim, the more certain it was that the public appetite could never be satisfied. The only way out, I thought, was to reject basketball and become a lawyer or businessman.\\"Bradley says being a professional athlete is a mixed blessing. He shows both sides of the coin in his book. He tells how players spend their days (and yes it's boring much of the time), how they cope with physical exertion, travel and constant aches and pains. He provides interesting profiles of his teammates and says that on many teams friendship is overblown and even hypocritical.Unlike most players today, Bradley was obsessed with team basketball and not individual statistics. \\"I do not depend on the outside for recognition,\\" writes Bradley. \\"The press and public approval mean little to me. What is important is my own judgment as to whether the team plays according to my estimate of how an ideal team should.\\"The 1970 championship Knicks vindicated Bradley's concept and approach to the game.\\"Success of the group assures the success of the individual,\\" he writes, \\"but not the other way around.\\"It's truly a pleasure to rub shoulders with Bradley and his Knick teammates for 230 pages."},{"Title":"Life on the Run","review":"This book was both enjoying and informative. If your a basketball fan of the late sixties and seventies you will enjoy this book. I'm sure todays players would have a completely different lifestyle than their predecessors, but Bill gives you a picture of his day and insight into his cast of characters/teammates. I enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Run","review":"He writes about being in the NBA but it's during the 70's when it was so different from now. Players didn't make mega millions then. I can't believe they would still have to do their own laundry and share a hotel room with someone on the team. But it's a nice glimpse into the 70's and professional basketball, I guess.

In 1970, departments of computer science were still new in universities, if they existed at all. The work was intended primarily as an inexpensive text on the psychology of perception (confirmed by the imprint price -- 50p -- and the awful paper on which Penguin printed it). However, it does contain a chapter on pattern recognition by computer, including a review of the early work by Bledsoe, Grimsdale, Rosenblatt, and Selfridge on visual patterns and a short section on early computer speech recognition work by Hughes and Hemdal at Purdue."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Cornerstones of Freedom)","review":"I read this book in school as a child (well, I'm only 17 now, not exactly old) and I was permanantly at least 10 pages ahead of the teacher so impatient was I to continue with the story. The novel follows a group of families as they make their way to the promised land, fighting attacks from animals, illness, obstacles in their path, but like all good stories the ending is a happy one.

Each lesson consists of a conversation followed by exercises. The conversation is written in German, with a pronunciation guide and English translation. The written exercises which follow the conversation emphasize key aspects of the lesson. My only complaints are these: (1) some words are very hard to pronounce, and so the product would be better if it had a tape or CD accompaniment; (2) there are usually only 10 exercises at the end of each chapter, and I would prefer more."},{"Title":"German Step-By-Step","review":"I bought the 3rd printing of this book in Half Price Books in Houston years ago for around $4. If you know German, but need to review your conversational skills, this is a good buy - if you can also get it for around $4.While this books covers a large amount of vocabulary and grammar at a fast yet coherent pace over 24 relatively short chapters, and gives plenty of text for the reader to practice reading and speaking, it's laden with numerous annoying and potentially confusing typographical errors. The fact that it reads \\"Third Printing, Septemeber 1997\\" on the *title page* even before you get to the lessons should be fair warning. If you know German to a fair extent, these typos likely won't trip you up. But for beginners, I think there's reason for concern, especially when German words are misspelt, the wrong German sentence is given for the English translation (or vice versa), or when they botch the phonetic spellings. There's just too many good beginner's books and CD-Roms now for a beginner to have to suffer through that - plus, if you are a beginner, it's better to get something with an audio component. I know German pronounciation well enough to only look at the phonetics in this book when I can't quite remember where the stressed syllable in a word falls. Beyond that, I avoid the phonetic guide - too confusing for this experienced yet still non-native German speaker!Another thing about this book that one needs to be aware of is its very casual approach to grammar. You'll get no spifty grammar paradigms in the back if you forget which definite article goes with which case - and German definite articles are one very good argument for such paradigms! The goal of this book is just to get you speaking, apparently, and not to make sure you have a firm grasp of basic German grammar. That's fine if you know some German, are using other materials that cover grammar in more detail, or just need a handful of German phrases to get by on a couple weeks' vacation in a German speaking country. But I can't recommend this as a sole or primary resource for anyone wanting to learn German properly or seriously.The real value in this book is that it gives you 24 chapters of accessible dialogues and text for reading and speaking aloud best suited for intermediate-beginner to advanced-intermediate German learners who need either review material or additional practice. If used as a supplementary resource in this way, you'll likely get your $4 worth out of it."},{"Title":"German Step-By-Step","review":"Easy to understand writing.

However, this is no ordinary reading as the deceased, being of sound mind, left very lucid and specific instructions. Her will is to be read over four days at Aurore's summer cottage on a remote bayou island to nine people. Anyone who leaves before the full reading forfeits their portion of the inheritance which could be sizable since Aurore owned Gulf Coast Shipping....... Over the next few days, Aurore's secrets become known in small bites. The family begins to take sides against each other and then there is the outsiders, a black family whose son is the only person who knows the entire story since he heard it from Aurore (in the prequel). As a hurricane approaches the island, everyone knows a segment of the full tale. To survive the hurricane and to share the inheritance, Aurore's potential heirs need to start working together rather than continue to tear one another to pieces. If they fail to stop their bickering and reduce the tension, they may find they have more than a nasty storm to survive....... RISING TIDES is an exciting, extremely explosive period piece that makes the turbulent sixties seem dramatically potent and alive. The realistic but different personas of the characters and the brutal issues they confront make Emilie Richards' novel a great southern heater that will remind fans of Faulkner. This book and her previous tale that included Aurore (IRON LACE) are great and are highly recommended reads.......Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Rising Tides","review":"Emilie Richards is a very talented writer; her books, including this one, are worth the money. I was addicted to reading this book and stayed up late every night for a week to find out what happened next.

I did not like this book. I felt that too many characters were introduced too fast. I found myself getting lost many times trying to remember who was who and having to page back over and over again. I never had to do that with her other books.I've read about 8 of her books and loved every one of them so I was looking forward to this one but I cannot recommend it to anyone unless you have a memory that is much better than average to keep track of everything.Jackie from Calif."},{"Title":"Rising Tides","review":"Rising Tides, the sequel to Iron Lace,wasn't as interesting as I thought it was going to be. I read Iron Lace first and couldn't wait to read Rising Tides to find out what happened. It seemed like the author got writer's block a couple of times. This book seemed to me like it was the story of Hugh, Aurore's oldest son. The parts where Hugh was overseas during the war were boring and very drawn out. The characters didn't seem to be as well developed for this second novel. Iron Lace seemed very interesting with all of the flashbacks but to me the author found a good thing (the flashbacks) and ran it into the ground. The book did seem to get good towards the end. I would recommend this book if you've read Iron Lace only so you can find out the rest of the story. Borrow it from the library though, it's not worth buying."},{"Title":"Rising Tides","review":"I love Emilie Richards and have read many of her books.If I had not known better, I would felt that this must have been a very early book, written by an inexperienced writer. It was not as tightly plotted as her others, and certain sections, Hugh in Europe, for example, seemed loose and wandering.Unfortunately, I read it before Iron Lace (which I am waiting for), and had a hard time dealing with the number of characters. Too many secrets made for too many seemingly unconnected people. I would have appreciated a family tree to guide me. I strongly suggest that you read these two books in order!All of that said, I did finish the book (I do not always finish books) and did generally enjoy it.

Included are her son bent on a political career and his wife, their daughter, a photographer, as well as her secret daughter and her son. As each part of the will is read, we learn more about the convoluted and sometimes tragic history of the family and find out if the truth will bring them together or drive them apart.

It does solve some of the questions that remained with me after her first book, but was just not as moving!"},{"Title":"Rising Tides","review":"This book is the sequel to \\"Iron Lace\\" so of course I wanted to read it. It didn't flow as well as the first book and the middle of the book could have been shortened a bit. Overall, it was a good read."},{"Title":"Rising Tides","review":"Emilie Richards is a wonderful writer. The other books in this series were eonderful, too, especially Iron Lace."},{"Title":"Rising Tides","review":"I thought this was a very good sequel to the first book and adequately filled in the gaps, answering many questions. It is a sad commentary on our history but pretty honest."},{"Title":"Rising Tides","review":"I am unabashedly an Emilie Richards fan. This book is one of my favorite sequels to one of my favorite books, Iron Lace. I am a fan of sequels ~~ I am always curious to what happens in the next generation or two. How do the choices a character in a previous book affect the other characters that were barely named in the first book? It's a great concept and I think Richards did a great job exploring that in this book.There are nine characters in this book and how their lives entwined make for a great reading. There is Hugh, Aurora's son, who died but his presence is still felt among the rest of the characters. There is Dawn, Hugh's niece, Aurora's granddaughter, there is Ferris, Aurora's son and his wife, Cappy. There is Philip, Nicky, his mother and Ben, Hugh's friend and the poor agiated lawyer who is executor of the will. Forced to spend four days at Aurora's favorite summer place ~~ they all discover how they are all related.It makes for great entertaining reading and I loved every page of it. It is not that often when you find a author who writes well and manages to entertain you at the same time ~~ especially when you're stricken with the flu bug.11-9-03"},{"Title":"Rising Tides","review":"JERSEY XRAY was designated by AMAZON as the company who would ship my book to me.I was charged on my visa on Nov 4.

He traces the genealogy of Pinch Sulzberger and his disfunctional family.

Pawlick has gone where no one else has gone before showing how one sick and disfuntional, yet powerful family and its exquiste propaganda machine can dominate and control the political landscape. Pawlick deserves a pulitzer prize."},{"Title":"Libel by New York Times","review":"WOW: I had some understanding of what was going on with the whole gay marriage issue but Mr. Pawlick's book really clarified things for me. Just reading the same subject in 2 different papers and you can see how slanted the Globe is which I knew was owned by the New York Times. Thanks go out to Mr.Pawlick for enlightening us about the part the New York Times and the Globe played in the whole SJC (fiasco) ruling on gay marriage."},{"Title":"Libel by New York Times","review":"Mr. Pawlick puts the whole gay marriage conspiracy in perspective.

Well....this is a great book to start with. I am not a math person, but when reading the bible you just know there's more to the measurements and assignment of numbers.

Good price."},{"Title":"Number in Scripture: Its supernatural design and spiritual significance","review":"I got the Kindle Edition for 99 cents. It is almost worth it. It may be okay for reading straight through but not for study. For that you need a table of contents and a good index."},{"Title":"Number in Scripture: Its supernatural design and spiritual significance","review":"I have found that reference books on Kindle are almost impossible to manuver. You have to read the whole book to find what you are looking for. As example in Number in Scripture and others you have no way of looking up a specific number or topic. You have to go through the whole book to find what you are looking for and many times miss it. I wish there was a way that you could click on the table of contents and be able to go right where you want to go. I have been very disappointed with all the reference material offered on Kindle for that reason. If anyone has a better idea of how to manuver through it, please let me know."},{"Title":"Number in Scripture: Its supernatural design and spiritual significance","review":"This book was instrumental in understanding numbers as they apply to spiritual significance. God unfolded a story in my life and numbers were His way of communicating timing. This book helped me to understand God's numbers. A friend of mine ordered the book for me. I had shared with him numbers and timing that were being revealed. My friend stated the moment he took the book in his hands from the sales clerk who handed it to him, he heard the words \\"that's Lavon's book.\\" This book does not read as a novel. It took me a couple of readings of different passage to understand its depth. I think the book is wonderful in that it reveals God's order and preciseness. This book was instrumental in my writing my book, thus it was \\"Lavon's book.\\""},{"Title":"Number in Scripture: Its supernatural design and spiritual significance","review":"First of all this review is primarily about the Kindle edition of this book. I owned the hardcopy and enthusiastically recommend it. I would give it 5 stars.The Kindle edition, on the other hand, is terrible! I'm guessing that this eBook was simply run through a converter without even an attempt at formatting. The text is all jumbled, there are no links within the table of contents, and the Hebrew words are not rendered at all (Greek is rendered poorly). Tables and diagrams are destroyed beyond all recognition. Apparently, no human reviewed this before submitting it to Amazon. Subsequently, Amazon didn't bother to \\"look inside\\" either.If I read this in this format initially, I would not have fully appreciated the books content. Mr. Bullinger did considerable research into this book's content. I'm amazed that he was able to turn out a work of this quality years before the Strong's Exhaustive Concordance was published. It's a magnificent work that was sabotaged in this version!I was hoping to have a digital version as a reference work. However, the lack of links and cross-references eradicate any usefulness in this regard.Stay away from this Kindle version. Even at .99, it's overpriced! Buy the book instead. I wish I had my .99 back! :-("},{"Title":"Number in Scripture: Its supernatural design and spiritual significance","review":"It does not read well, as it is a list of items to be further researched and validated with study.And, while the content is intriguing and worth study, the kindle version is nearly worthless.* The kindle edition does not render Hebrew correctly (it's a jumble of characters & letters), though greek seems to come through, usually.* The 'tables' do not align when presented.* There are no breaks, chapters, etc to make navigation easy and this edition as a worthwhile reference."},{"Title":"Number in Scripture: Its supernatural design and spiritual significance","review":"Each number represent God something about His name or what it has to do with creation. It proves nothing done in creation was by evolution. God had a purpose for everything that was created. I would have preferred the hard back version better it was easier to read & understand."},{"Title":"Number in Scripture: Its supernatural design and spiritual significance","review":"Numbers in Scripture and in creation aren't haphazard. They were created by a God of grace as proof of His existence and omnipotence. If you are skeptical, read on.For me this book confirmed my faith as a Christian and in the infallible Word of God. Dr. Bullinger, whom I call God's genius, shows throughout the book the undeniable fact that the Bible is the true and inspired Word of God and that God's creation is also numerically perfect. Here is an example of the numerical imprint of the lowly bee taken from the book:\\"In the case of the BEE, it is the number three which pervades its phenomena--In three days the egg of the queen is hatched.It is fed for nine days (3x3).It reaches maturity in 15 days (5x3).The worker grub reaches maturity in 21 days (7x3).And is at work three days after leaving its cell.The drone matures in 24 days (8x3).The bee is composed of three sections,-- head and two stomachs.The two eyes are made up of about 3,000 small eyes, each (like the cells of the comb) having six sides (2x3).Underneath the body are six (2x3) wax scales with which the comb is made.It has six (2x3) legs. Each leg is composed of three sections.The foot is formed of three triangular sections.The antennae consist of nine (3x3) sections.The sting has nine (3x3) barbs on each side.Is this design? or is it chance? Why should it be the number three instead of any other number? No one can tell. We can only observe the wondrous working of supernatural laws, and admire the perfection of design.\\"How in the world can anyone think that a bee was created by a chaotic big bang with this type of information?For those interested in end time prophecy, Dr. Bullinger also explains the number of the beast,666. It was a real eye opener for me.Buy the book. It will increase your faith.P.S. My name is Deborah, the Hebrew Word for 'bee'. I was born on 9/3/19?). Is this by chance or design? :) I don't know but it certainly gives me a chuckle."},{"Title":"Number in Scripture: Its supernatural design and spiritual significance","review":"An ebook like this does need to have links from to content to reference the numbers in this case.
