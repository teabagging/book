The plot thus plays itself out neither as a whodunit or a whydunit, but as a tragedy and morality play that develops slowly and inevitably to a violent climax.\\"  Publishers Weekly From William X. Kienzle, author of the classic mystery, The Rosary Murders. Father Robert Koesler has retired from St. Joseph's parish \\"old St. Joe's downtown\\" as it was familiarly known where Father Zachary Tully has become his successor. Upon his return from vacation, Father Koesler finds a message from an old friend, Patrick McNiff, now a bishop and rector of St. Joseph's Seminary. McNiff asks Koesler to reside in the seminary, concelebrate the liturgies, possibly teach a class, and most important help McNiff smooth out the factionalism of the faculty and its possible effects on the seminarians. In his new residence, Father Koesler learns much about the problems dividing the contemporary seminary as well as dividing his old home parish under the leadership of Father Tully. Although he realizes that many inner lives are in turmoil, he is ill-prepared for the fact that such turmoil may lead to murder. As Father Koesler prepares for the Mass following a tragic murder, he wonders if he should have anticipated it through the clues laid out along the way. This is the twenty-first in the series of William X. Kienzle mysteries, which star Father Robert Koesler as the priest-sleuth solving murders in real locations in Detroit.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jcrxLavoJcIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marine Life Patterns for the Scroll Saw: 57 Original Designs for Dolphins, Seahorses, Whales, Sportfish, and More","description":"Scroll all varieties of underwater creatures: dolphins, seahorses, whales, trout, sailfish, salmon and more.

The book examines how individuals survive when faced with extremes of immersion, heat, cold or altitude, emphasizing the body's recognition of stress and the brain's role in optimizing physiological function in order to provide time to escape or to adapt. In illustrating how human biology adapts to extremes, the book also explains how we learn to cope by blending behavior and biology, first by trial and error, then by rigorous scientific observation, and finally by technological innovation. The book describes life-support technology and how it enables humans to enter once unendurable realm, from the depths of the ocean to the upper reaches of the atmosphere and beyond.

It offers a scintillating view of those dramatic and fateful days when much of the modern world was sketched out, when countries were created Iraq, Yugoslavia, Israel whose troubles haunt us still. Winner of the Samuel Johnson Prize ? Winner of the PEN Hessell Tiltman Prize ? Winner of the Duff Cooper Prize Between January and July 1919, after  the war to end all wars,  men and women from around the world converged on Paris to shape the peace. Center stage, for the first time in history, was an American president, Woodrow Wilson, who with his Fourteen Points seemed to promise to so many people the fulfillment of their dreams. Stern, intransigent, impatient when it came to security concerns and wildly idealistic in his dream of a League of Nations that would resolve all future conflict peacefully, Wilson is only one of the larger-than-life characters who fill the pages of this extraordinary book. David Lloyd George, the gregarious and wily British prime minister, brought Winston Churchill and John Maynard Keynes. Lawrence of Arabia joined the Arab delegation. Ho Chi Minh, a kitchen assistant at the Ritz, submitted a petition for an independent Vietnam. For six months, Paris was effectively the center of the world as the peacemakers carved up bankrupt empires and created new countries. This book brings to life the personalities, ideals, and prejudices of the men who shaped the settlement. They pushed Russia to the sidelines, alienated China, and dismissed the Arabs. They struggled with the problems of Kosovo, of the Kurds, and of a homeland for the Jews. The peacemakers, so it has been said, failed dismally; above all they failed to prevent another war. Margaret MacMillan argues that they have unfairly been made the scapegoats for the mistakes of those who came later. She refutes received ideas about the path from Versailles to World War II and debunks the widely accepted notion that reparations imposed on the Germans were in large part responsible for the Second World War. Praise for Paris 1919  It s easy to get into a war, but ending it is a more arduous matter. It was never more so than in 1919, at the Paris Conference. . . . This is an enthralling book: detailed, fair, unfailingly lively. Professor MacMillan has that essential quality of the historian, a narrative gift.

Ballad of a Ghetto Poet tells the savage and lyrical story of a teenager caught in the brutal cross-fire of poverty and violence that could send him on the collision course to the cellblock -- or the grave. Chicko Grayson is a teenager growing up on the tough streets of Richmond, Virginia, where powerty is a life sentence, and the only way out is behind the barrel of a gun. Raised on the harsh, brutal language of the streets, Chicko hears the music of God in the poetry he writes. But God is noticeably absent when he fals in with a sly and dangerous criminal who draws Chicko and his best friends Malcolm and Junnie into the city's violent underworld of crime.

Because","description":"A New York Times bestseller and enduring classic, All About Love is the acclaimed first volume in feminist icon bell hooks' \\"Love Song to the Nation\\" trilogy. All About Love reveals what causes a polarized society, and how to heal the divisions that cause suffering. Here is the truth about love, and inspiration to help us instill caring, compassion, and strength in our homes, schools, and workplaces.  The word  love  is most often defined as a noun, yet we would all love better if we used it as a verb,  writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in All About Love. Here, at her most provocative and intensely personal, renowned scholar, cultural critic and feminist bell hooks offers a proactive new ethic for a society bereft with lovelessness--not the lack of romance, but the lack of care, compassion, and unity. People are divided, she declares, by society s failure to provide a model for learning to love. As bell hooks uses her incisive mind to explore the question  What is love?  her answers strike at both the mind and heart. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the  100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.  All About Love is a powerful, timely affirmation of just how profoundly her revelations can change hearts and minds for the better.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A5ZDDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rational hydrotherapy,: A manual of the physiological and therapeutic effects of hydriatic procedures, and the technique of their application in the treatment of disease","description":"The physiological and therapeutic effects of hydrotherapy procedures, and the technique of their application in the treatment of disease.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4rWYxwEACAAJ&dq=Rational+hydrotherapy,:+A+manual+of+the+physiological+and+therapeutic+effects+of+hydriatic+procedures,+and+the+technique+of+their+application+in+the+treatment+of+disease&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bless Me, Father","description":"The inspiration for the hit London Weekend Television series of the same name, this is one confessional you ll want to make a point of visiting Young Neil Boyd has just finished divinity school and has been newly ordained as a priest.

There is a need, however, to review pe riodically what we know and what we think we know about the art, and to add new insights that become available. This book is a response to that need; it has been written for science practitioners and grandstanders of the 1980s, drawing on in Sights and perceptions gained from victories and defeats of the 1970s. It seems especially important that the strategies and rules of scientific game playing be reviewed critically as we move into the decade of the 1980s, since many of those rules have changed during the 1970s--in fact each recent decade has seen significant changes. The 1950s were expansionist, when sci entific jobs were relatively easy to find, when faculties were expanding, when students were plentiful, and when federal grants were readily available. The 1960s began as a period of stabilization, and then became one of unrest and reexami nation of purpose. The climate was still good; students were v vi PREFACE still abundant, but there was less growth in faculty size, and federal grants reached a plateau. In the 1970s the student population started to decline, and federal funding for research began to dry up.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SzULBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secrets of the Heart.","description":"An early collection of Kahlil Gibran s writings, showcasing the many styles of this prolific thinker, all profoundly beautiful Kahlil Gibran reveals his vision of the soul and understanding of the world past, present, and future in this rich sampling of more than twenty works.

She explains the ways in which the students' own conversational structures impact and shape their written products.

Romance. [no. 698])","description":"In this study Professor Dorfman applies the methods of modern linguistics to literary analysis. Literature may be described as the structured use of language: the modern linguistic analyzes language in a search for the minimal units of sound and form, phoneme and morpheme, and determines the combinations by which they can communicate meaning. The author here searches for a minimal structural unit in the literary narrative analogous to the phoneme and the morpheme in language structure. Based on a detailed analysis of the Roland and the Cid and twelve additional Romance narratives, Professor Dorfman's argument is that the structure of the medieval Romance epics may be analyzed into functional units which he calls \\"narremes.\\" He divides a narrative into two types of structure: the superstructure and the substructure. A narrative, by definition, is a series of incidents. All the incidents in the narrative, taken as written, form the superstructure. Analysis, however, shows that many of the incidents may be abstracted from the narrative without deflecting the story-line. On the other hand, other incidents reveal themselves as organically linked with each other, so they cannot be omitted, without destroying the story-line. These selected incidents are the narremes, which make up the substructure of the narrative. This method of analysis produces so interesting and surprising results, results which make an important advance in research in linguistics and Romance literature. Eugene Dorfman, as an orthodox structuralist, has focused strictly on the formal descriptions of the narratives; but his analysis leads into the great traditional problems of literary history, and in particular poses anew the problem of the origins of the epic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=efDlDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leadership . . .

The title refers to a well-known Chinese saying, meaning that one should be grateful to the origin of his well-being by serving his homeland that nourished him. This was central to the value system of Chinese intellectuals of older generations. Jingshan's (the author) grandfather Ye used this saying in his poem to Jingshan's father Pa at Cornell to express Ye's expectations for Pa's return after his study. This is a story of life and death, perseverance, hardship, responsibility, struggle for survival, as well as love, help, and mutual support. In its broad outlines the story goes as follows: Ye was a supporter of Sun Yat-sen and a member of the first Parliament in China in the beginning of the twentieth century. After his retirement, he returned to his hometown and lived on the land he owned. Jingshan's maternal grandfather was a General under the Guomindang (KMT) government led by Chiang Kai-shek and was killed by the Communists in the beginning of the 1930s. Upon his graduation from Cornell University, Pa returned to China in 1947 and taught as a professor at the Law School of Peking University. He was among the last group of the Chinese scholars who ever came to America to study and who then returned to China before the Communist takeover (and would be among the last until China reopened its doors in the early 1980s). Pa returned to China amid the country's instability and uncertainty caused by the political situation there. The Communists claimed victory in 1949 and Pa soon became the target of political campaigns launched by the Communists. He was forbidden to teach for political reasons in 1950, and it was not until 1979 that he was able to teach again. Jingshan's sister, a college student and a lively and gifted person, died far away from home during a political campaign in 1966. Jingshan's aunt, who lived with the family and took care of the children, was beaten and humiliated on the streets at the start of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). She was forced to return to her original village and died soon after in 1966. The remaining five members of the family were dispersed throughout China to do hard labor. Jingshan was sent to the countryside as hundreds of thousands of high school students were during that time but was unable to leave and stayed in the countryside for seven and half years; later, when she was finally hired by an oil field company after the Cultural Revolution, her family background once again prevented her from being able to attend college. Jingshan's younger brother was sent to a border region between China and Burma when he was only fifteen and did hard labor there for several years. Jingshan's family, however, endured all the sufferings and hardships. Unlike most of the books on a similar topic, this book is not restricted to detailing political movements, or to recording a family's (or an author's) life chronologically. Rather, it is primarily about the daily life of an ordinary Chinese scholar's family in the context of the political environment during that period the ways of living in the passage of time that are increasingly becoming remote even to people living in China today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2iDvwAEACAAJ&dq=Drinking+The+Water+While+Thinking+Of+Its+Source&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jet Smoke and Dragon Fire (The Dragon Fire Trilogy)","description":"The village in which Sparrow lives is as well-equipped, technologically, as any other in the modern world ...

A partner in John Jacob Astor s Pacific Fur Company, the Scotsman shipped for Oregon aboard the Tonquin in 1810 and helped found the ill-fated settlement of Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia River. In 1812, facing disaster, Stuart and six others slipped away from Astoria and headed east. His journal, edited and annotated by Philip Ashton Rollins, describes their hazardous 3,700-mile journey to St. Louis. Crossing the Rockies in winter, they faced death by cold, starvation, and hostile Indians. But they made history by discovering what came to be called the Oregon Trail, including South Pass, over which thousands of emigrants would travel west in mid-century. Besides Stuart s narrative, this volume contains important material about Astoria and the fate of the Tonquin, as well as the harrowing account of Wilson Price Hunt, who headed a party of overlanders traveling east to join the Astorians.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iefDlnjDeQgC&dq=The+Discovery+of+the+Oregon+Trail:+Robert+Stuart%27s+Narratives+of+his+Overland+Trip+Eastward+from+Astoria+in+1812-13&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Case for the Resurrection of Jesus","description":"\\"A phenomenal resource that is both user-friendly and up-to-date, [and will] equip believers to defend this crucial issue.\\" - Josh McDowell.

Acknowledging the independent sector as a vital and growing part of the global education system, this book explores how schools are to respond to financial, moral, pastoral and academic challenges, and so ensure their own survival, and the futures of the children they educate. Breaking a complex and varied field down into ten clear areas of analysis, essays written by leading education experts tackle the key challenges faced by independent schools around the world. Commentators consider the issues created by the upward trend of educating international students, question the extent to which independent schools have echoed societal movements towards greater access, diversity and gender fluidity, and provide first-hand insight into the experiences of staff, pupils and parents involved in the everyday functioning and longer-term development of the independent sector. A health check on this most controversial of sectors, this book will enlighten and inform not only those working in independent schools today, but anyone interested in education, and will make an important contribution to a bigger debate about the place of independent schools at a time of political, economic and societal uncertainty.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hwuWDwAAQBAJ&dq=State+of+Independence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ephesians","description":"\\"Stephen Fowl's rich volume on this rich letter displays his careful reading of the text that yields a truly theological commentary.\\"--Michael J. Gorman, Raymond E. Brown Chair in Biblical Studies and Theology, St. Mary's Seminary and University \\"Stephen Fowl brings his considerable gifts in theological interpretation to the profound theological message of the Letter to the Ephesians. The result is a refreshingly irenic commentary that reflects a thorough knowledge of the critical discussions while eschewing lengthy debate.\\" --Andrew T. Lincoln, Portland Professor of New Testament, University of Gloucestershire \\"Reading Stephen Fowl's work is always a wonderful experience. His prose is tight and clear, his thinking fresh, and his commentary on Scripture always targets the sacred text and what it may teach the church about its relationship with God and one another.\\" --Robert W. Wall, Paul T. Walls Professor of Scripture and Wesleyan Studies, Seattle Pacific University Even though it was written some two millennia ago, Ephesians still speaks to Christians today in themes quite familiar to the modern reader. In a context where the church had become overwhelmingly, if not exclusively, Gentile, the Christian community needed to be reminded of the priority of Israel and the astonishing work of reconciliation that God willed to accomplish in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Now available as a casebound, this volume in the highly acclaimed New Testament Library series reveals the great theological promises of Ephesians while discussing issues of context, authorship, and style.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cQdydKpNJwgC&dq=Ephesians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cladistic Biogeography: Interpreting Patterns of Plant and Animal Distributions (Oxford Biogeography Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_JV2cgAACAAJ&dq=Cladistic+Biogeography:+Interpreting+Patterns+of+Plant+and+Animal+Distributions+(Oxford+Biogeography+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ireland's Eye: Travels","description":"On August 28, 1922, the martyred Irish patriot Michael Collins was buried. Businesses across Dublin closed as thousands came out to pay their respects. On the same day, Michael Lyons, a cooper from the Guinness factory, drowned in Dublin's Royal Canal. This peculiar confluence is Mark Anthony Jarman's starting point for a meditation on the intertwined history of a nation and his family. Jarman's pursuit of the circumstances of his grandfather's drowning leads him through a modern Ireland that teems with ghosts from the past. Thwarted by family gossip, aunts who can't drive a stick shift, cousins more interested in pubs than lore, and his own fascination with the many Irelands that have been, Jarman finds what he's seeking despite, or perhaps because of, the antics and the unreliable histories. What he reconfigures is a revelation, and an enchanting and engrossing read.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m3zgzBVY5uQC&dq=Ireland%27s+Eye:+Travels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The D.A.

Paul Escott portrays North Carolina's major social groups, focusing on the elite, the ordinary white farmers or workers, and the blacks, and analyzes their attitudes, social structure, and power relationships. Quoting frequently from a remarkable array of letters, journals, diaries, and other primary sources, he shows vividly the impact of the Civil War, Emancipation, Reconstruction, Populism, and the rise of the New South industrialism on southern society. Working within the new social history and using detailed analyses of five representative counties, wartime violence, Ku Klux Klan membership, stock-law legislation, and textile mill records, Escott reaches telling conclusions on the interplay of race, class, and politics. Despite fundamental political and economic reforms, Escott argues, North Carolina's social system remained as hierarchical and undemocratic in 1900 as it had been in 1850.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6pWBCzj3vQ4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biology: The Living Science","description":"Living Science for Classes 9 and 10 have been prepared on the basis of the syllabus developed by the NCERT and adopted by the CBSE and many other State Education Boards.

In the horological trade, it is technical practice that the 'prentice hand' is first tried out on clocks, before attempting repair work on watches. Clocks have the advantage of possessing sizeable and robust parts and of being easier to handle. But there the advantage for the repairer ends. The sizes, shapes, complications and even the nationalities of clocks appear to be without end. Every movement has detail difference and, naturally, the defects when due for repair, are as varied. In this book, the author has dealt with the usual faults likely to develop in each type of movement in general use; from the lordly grandfather to the humble alarm. All the tools and equipment are described and illustrated, together with the ways of using them. The craftsman's most important and valuable tools of all - his skilful fingers - are shown in use in the clearest manner. As is usual in N.A.G. Press textbooks, the drawings have been specially made from parts under working conditions. A glance through the book will show their usefulness and clarity. Over 400 line drawings are used throughout and the reader is left in no doubt of what he is asked to do in following the author's clearly written technical and practical instructions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p2_KDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The historic Thames (The wayfarer's library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mPwqvQEACAAJ&dq=The+historic+Thames+(The+wayfarer%27s+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essay on criticism,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-sFLAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Red-Blooded Yankee!

You ll see in clear, intoxicating detail how hippie culture, women s lib, and an absolutely ingenious Swedish company all played their part, transforming the booze into a status symbol.

With searing clarity and unabashed wit, Edmund White s unnamed protagonist yearns for what he knows to be shameful. He navigates an uneasy relationship with his father, confounds first loves, and faces disdain from his peers at school. In the embrace of another, he discovers the sincere and clumsy pleasures of adolescent sexuality. But for boys in the 1950s, these desires were unthinkable. Looking back on his experiences, the narrator notes,  I see now that what I wanted was to be loved by men and to love them back but not to be a homosexual.

A high school student when interned in 1942, Minoru Kiyota was so infuriated by his treatment during an FBI interrogation and by the denial of his request to leave the camp to pursue his education that he refused to affirm his loyalty as required of all internees. For this he was sent to Tule Lake Segregation Center in northern California - a holding pen for \\"dangerous\\" and \\"disloyal\\" individuals. While imprisoned there under deplorable conditions, Kiyota learned of a new law offering Japanese Americans the \\"opportunity\\" to renounce their U.S. citizenship. Although barely old enough to do so, Kiyota took this drastic step. Throughout his four long years of incarceration, he refused to resign himself to the injustices he witnessed and experienced. His story shares the fury and frustration aroused by gross violations of his rights as a U.S. citizen and shows how the painful years of internment determined the course of his life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I8wfFPtRskgC&dq=Beyond+Loyalty+-+The+Story+of+a+Kibei&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ZEEE","description":"A reissue of the 1965 classic children's tale tells the story of Zeee, a fairy who hates people and is constantly in search of a place to live.

They put concern for the lives of others over concern for their own lives, and work tirelessly to recover the bodies of the missing. Their heroic actions save lives, provide comfort to and care for the wounded and inspire onlookers, but at what cost to themselves? We now know that rescue workers who are exposed to mutilated bodies, mass destruction, multiple casualties, and life-threatening situations may become the hidden victims of disaster. The traumatic consequences of exposure can profoundly impact emergency responders, radiate to their families, and permeate the emergency organization. This much-needed new book, based on the authors' original research and clinical experience, describes the consequences of trauma exposure on police officers, fire fighters, and paramedics. Weaving data collected in large-scale quantitative studies with the personal stories of responders shared in qualitative interviews, this much-needed account explores the personal, organizational, and societal factors that can ameliorate or exacerbate traumatic response. Stress theory, organizational theory, crisis theory, and trauma theory provide a framework for understanding trauma responses and guiding intervention strategies. Using an ecological perspective, the authors explore interventions spanning prevention, disaster response, and follow-up, on individual, family, group, organizational, and community levels. They provide specific suggestions for planning intervention programs, developing trauma response teams, training emergency service responders and mental health professionals, and evaluating the effectiveness of services provided. Disaster, whether large-scale or small, underscores our ongoing vulnerability and the crucial need for response plans that address the health and well being of those who confront disaster on a daily basis. In the Line of Fire speaks directly to these emergency response workers as well as to the mental health professionals who provide them with services, the administrators who support their efforts, and the family members who wonder if their loved one will return home safely from work tonight.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fMJL5z46DtsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oh My Goddess!

Drawing on memories of his childhood on a dairy farm in Illinois, Austin Smith explores the beauty and cruelty of rural life, challenging the idea that the American Midwest is mere  flyover country,  a place that deserves passing over. At the same time, the collection suggests that America itself has become a flyover country, carrying out drone strikes and surveillance abroad, locked in a state of perpetual war that Americans seem helpless to stop. In these poems, midwestern barns and farmhouses are linked to other lands and times as if by psychic tunnels. A poem about a barn cat moving her kittens in the night because they have been discovered by a group of boys resonates with a poem about the house in Amsterdam where Anne Frank and her family hid from the Nazis. A poem beginning with a boy on a farmhouse porch idly swatting flies ends with the image of people fleeing before a drone strike.

Our world teeters on a knife-edge between a peaceful and prosperous future for all, and a dark winter of death and destruction that threatens to smother the light of civilization. Within 30 years, in the 2030 decade, six powerful 'drivers' will converge with unprecedented force in a statistical spike that could tear humanity apart and plunge the world into a new Dark Age. Depleted fuel supplies, massive population growth, poverty, global climate change, famine, growing water shortages and international lawlessness are on a crash course with potentially catastrophic consequences. In the face of both doomsaying and denial over the state of our world, Colin Mason cuts through the rhetoric and reams of conflicting data to muster the evidence to illustrate a broad picture of the world as it is, and our possible futures. Ultimately his message is clear; we must act decisively, collectively and immediately to alter the trajectory of humanity away from catastrophe. Offering over 100 priorities for immediate action, The 2030 Spike serves as a guidebook for humanity through the treacherous minefields and wastelands ahead to a bright, peaceful and prosperous future in which all humans have the opportunity to thrive and build a better civilization.

The New York Times The classic, bestselling biographical novel of Vincent Van Gogh Since its initial publication in 1934, Irving Stone s Lust for Life has been a critical success, a multimillion-copy bestseller, and the basis for an Academy Award-winning movie. The most famous of all of Stone s novels, it is the story of Vincent Van Gogh brilliant painter, passionate lover, and alleged madman. Here is his tempestuous story: his dramatic life, his fevered loves for both the highest-born women and the lowest prostitutes, and his paintings for which he was damned before being proclaimed a genius. The novel takes us from his desperate days in a coal mine in southern Belgium to his dazzling years in the south of France, where he knew the most brilliant artists (and the most depraved whores). Finally, it shows us Van Gogh driven mad, tragic, and triumphant at once. No other novel of a great man s life has so fascinated the American public for generations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xuPgxnKCakUC&dq=Lust+for+life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Information and Legislative Organization (Michigan Studies in Political Analysis)","description":"In this controversial book, Keith Krehbiel investigates and casts doubt upon a view of Congress held by many academics, journalists, and members of the lay public: that Congress is organized primarily to facilitate logrolling or \\"gains from trade\\" between legislators. The author puts forward an alternative \\"informational\\" theory that, unlike previous formal theories, highlights institutional needs and individual incentives for acquiring policy expertise. Using games with incomplete information, Krehbiel derives a set of unique and testable predictions about the organization of legislatures -- including the composition of committees and the procedures under which legislation is considered. Krehbiel's creative illustrations and nonmathematical presentation of formal theories make this book accessible to a diverse set of readers. The political relevance and testability of games with incomplete information will be appreciated by game theorists and economists, while the book's findings make it essential reading for political scientists who study American politics, political institutions, or democratic legislatures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nJRFDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The city of anger,: A novel","description":"Furiously paced novel about the struggle for power in a great American city.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FZtLAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+city+of+anger,:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theogony and Works and Days (The World's Classics)","description":"Hesiod, who lived in Boetia in the late eighth century BC, is one of the oldest known, and possibly the oldest of Greek poets.

As well as offering the earliest known sources for the myths of Pandora, Prometheus and the Golden Age, Hesiod's poetry provides a valuable account of the ethics and superstitions of the society in which he lived. Unlike Homer, Hesiod writes about himself and his family, and he stands out as the first personality in European literature.

Culture has become a new concept of race, sustaining ethnic identity politics that subvert human rights especially for women and children. Fearful of being considered racist, state agencies have sacrificed freedom and equality in the name of culture. Comparing her native Norway to Western Europe and the United States, Wikan focuses on people caught in turmoil, how institutions function, and the ways in which public opinion is shaped and state policies determined. Contradictions arise between policies of respect for minority cultures, welfare, and freedom, but the goal is the same: to create a society committed to both social justice and respect for human rights. Writing with power and grace, Wikan makes a plea for a renewed moral vitality and human empathy that can pave the way for more effective social policies and create change.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hChewKl3WskC&dq=Generous+Betrayal:+Politics+of+Culture+in+the+New+Europe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Touch Me I'm Sick","description":"Love once inspired sonnets, plays, novels, and countless romantic songs.

This is the first book to apply this verification technique to the rapidly growing field of embedded systems-on-a-chip(SoC). As traditional embedded system design evolves into single-chip design, embedded engineers must be armed with the necessary information to make educated decisions about which tools and methodology to deploy. SoC verification requires a mix of expertise from the disciplines of microprocessor and computer architecture, logic design and simulation, and C and Assembly language embedded software. Until now, the relevant information on how it all fits together has not been available. Andrews, a recognized expert, provides in-depth information about how co-verification really works, how to be successful using it, and pitfalls to avoid. He illustrates these concepts using concrete examples with the ARM core - a technology that has the dominant market share in embedded system product design.

This vast geographical and political diversity ensures that Spanish is a good deal less unified than French, German or even English, the latter more or less internationally standardized according to either American or British norms. Until the 1960s, the criteria of internationally correct Spanish were dictated by the Real Academia Espanola, but the prestige of this institution has now sunk so low that its most solemn decrees are hardly taken seriously - witness the fate of the spelling reforms listed in the Nuevas normas de prosodia y ortograjia, which were supposed to come into force in all Spanish-speaking countries in 1959 and, nearly forty years later, are still selectively ignored by publishers and literate persons everywhere. The fact is that in Spanish 'correctness' is nowadays decided, as it is in all living languages, by the consensus of native speakers; but consensus about linguistic usage is obviously difficult to achieve between more than twenty independent, widely scattered and sometimes mutually hostile countries.

Yet it provides a framework for understanding the speech process which is not only comprehensive and coherent, but of great relevance to current debates on issues of language performance and applied linguistics. Current theoretical difficulties stem largely from initial errors of Descartes; whereas earlier theoretical formulations, while outlining a bio-mechanics of speech, retain the central role of the human agent. The discussions explicated in this book come mainly from the natural-philosophic and medical literature of Greco-Roman Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance and early 17th century. This uncharted territory is mapped by tracing its textual history and diffusion as well as explaining the theory on its own terms but in clear and comprehensible language. Interdisciplinary in perspective, the book encompasses topics of interest not only to the language sciences, but also to the biosciences, medicine, philosophy of human movement, psychology and behavioral sciences, neurosciences, speech pathology, experimental phonetics, speech and rhetoric, and the history of science in general.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZblBAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catholic Questions Catholic Answers","description":"This book is a fascinating treasury of facts and truths about the Catholic faith.

Their solution is just to look to the great cooks--from Julia Child to James Beard to Diana Kennedy--for the simple dishes that are hidden away in even the most complicated cookbooks. They've assembled a treasury of superb recipes that depend on perfectly balanced flavors. The range is broad, from favorite American classics like spoon bread, corn fritters, and the only really delicious oven-fried chicken to exotic new tastes like Moghul Lamb, Bangkok Chicken, and Pasta with Vodka. For each recipe the editors offer tips, variations, suggests, and down-to-earth commentaries about how to work with exciting new ingredients as well as giving their own tried-and-true favorite recipes, simple winners they've cooked for years to great applause. Altogether there are 119 master recipes with 81 variations and 34 Editors' Kitchen recipes, a true culinary gold mine. In their pursuit of the secrets of true flavor, Frances McCullough and Barbara Witt come up with some unusual approaches, rethinking some of our basic ideas about how to prepare roasted chicken and turkey (in a very hot oven), pasta (one method lets it sit in hot water off the flame), and baking potatoes (they're particularly wonderful baked to death). Here you'll find a lot of nitty-gritty information about entertaining, a refresher course on how to make a really good green salad, lists of canapes and tidbit desserts, a collection of quick breads, and microwave notes. In a warm, intimate, encouragingly frank style, McCullough and Witt constantly encourage cooks to improvise by offering a range of variations, to start them experimenting with foods and flavors to develop their own recipes. This is a unique, user-friendly book that works for beginners who are reasonably sophisticated eaters as well as for experienced cooks. It will become the contemporary cook's favorite sourcebook for distinctive food.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aPtMBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kant: Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics","description":"Kant is the central figure of modern philosophy. He sought to rebuild philosophy from the ground up, and he succeeded in permanently changing its problems and methods. This new, revised edition of the Prolegomena, which is the best introduction to the theoretical side of his philosophy, presents his thought clearly by paying careful attention to his original language. Also included are selections from the Critique of Pure Reason, which fill out and explicate some of Kant's central arguments (including famous sections of the Schematism and Analogies), and in which Kant himself explains his special terminology. The first reviews of the Critique, to which Kant responded in the Prolegomena, are included in this revised edition.

This exodus was greater than the total number of those who had left in the previous 250 years.

When he falls hard for Jim Glaser, an alluring older man who is astonished to find in Seth the second love of his life, it seems simpler to gloss over his old life in Drinkwater and the history he used to have. Jim, who expected to remain alone forever, is happy to start over, too, and theirs becomes a tender, sexy romance. Although Seth seems to have successfully put his past behind him to become the man he wants to be---the kind of man Jim can cherish---his childhood rushes back unexpectedly and with a vengeance. When Seth's sister, Cassie, arrives in the city with significant secrets and plans of her own, Drinkwater's intractable demands force Seth to revisit his hidden past. What Jim learns about Seth's concealments threatens to destroy their new life together.

This important work introduces Tiantai Buddhism to the reader and demonstrates its relevance to profound philosophical issues. Ziporyn argues that we can make both of the claims below simultaneously: This book is about everything. It contains the answers to all philosophical problems which ever shall exist. This book is all claptrap. It is completely devoid of objective validity of any kind. These claims are not contradictory. Rather, they state the same thing in two different ways. To be objective truth is to be subjective claptrap, and vise versa. All interchanges of any kind - conversations, daydreams, sensations - are not only about something but also about everything. Thus, this book concerns itself with no less than the nature of what is and what it means for something to be what it is.

Did you know that stressing key points in color can boost memory retention by 25 percent? Author Laura Erlauer has studied brain research and applied it to classroom teaching in a way that is both intuitive and scientific. Synthesizing recent research exploring how the brain works, she explains how students' emotions and stress affect their ability to learn, how the physical classroom environment influences learning, and what forms of assessment work best. Drawing on her experience as a teacher and principal, Erlauer summarizes current brain research and shows how teachers can use this knowledge in the classroom every day. The book covers a wide variety of topics, including * The most effective use of collaborative learning; * Simple ways to keep the attention of your students for the whole class period; * Keys to involving students in decision making to increase their engagement and achievement; * Ways to make lesson content relevant to motivate students; and * Things every teacher can to do limit stress in the classroom and school environment. Each chapter provides examples from real classrooms, showing how the research can be used to improve student learning. The ideas and strategies presented are from a variety of grade levels and subject areas and can be used immediately to create a classroom where students can reach their full potential.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ypVuBwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Brain-Compatible+Classroom:+Using+What+We+Know+about+Learning+to+Improve+Teaching&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Journey to a War","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uxemQgAACAAJ&dq=Journey+to+a+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Small, Elderly Dragon","description":"When the kingdom is overtaken by a sorcerer, young Princess Dorma, nearsighted and awkward, helps a small, elderly dragon find the power needed to save the villagers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e-uOX2V6QnsC&dq=A+Small,+Elderly+Dragon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yesterday's Spy","description":"From the ITV News at Ten Anchor 'Atmospheric, informative and flawlessly plotted' The Sunday Times 'Riveting...with style and energy, evocative scene-setting and strong characterisation' Financial Times What readers are saying: 'His telling of fiction is as good as his telling of the news on TV!' ***** 'A very enjoyable book and a real page turner' ***** 'Writing that seems not just plausible but frighteningly real' ***** _____________________________ A man in search of his son.

Foreign powers are jockeying for influence, money and, most importantly, oil.

Origins, from village breweries to entire wine-producing regions, are located by nation, province and district. In many cases, there is a mention of when a producer or product was established, perhaps a word about the founder or a brief explanation of a curious-sounding brand name.

So she quit her job and set out to prove that adventure is not just a vacation style but a philosophy of living and to find like-minded, risk-taking women around the globe. With modest backing, a small television crew, her spirited producer-mother, Jeannie, and a whole lot of chutzpah, Morris tracked down artists, activists, and politicoswomen of action who are changing the rules and sometimes the world around them. In these pages, Morris brings to life the remarkable people and places she s encountered on the road while filming her PBS series Adventure Divas and other programs. We meet Assata Shakur, a former Black Panther and social activist and now a fugitive living in exile in Cuba; Kiran Bedi, New Delhi s chief of police, who revolutionized India s infamously brutal Tijar Jail with her humanitarian ethic; New Zealand pop star Hinewehi Mohi, a Maori who reinvigorates her native culture for a new generation; and Mokarrameh Ghanbari, a septuagenarian painter and rice farmer who lives in the tiny village of Darikandeh on the Caspian plains of Iran, where her creative talents run counter to the government s strict stance on art. Along the way, Morris herself becomes a certified Adventure Diva, as she hunts for wild boar with Penan tribesmen in the jungles of Borneo, climbs the Matterhorn short-roped to a salty fourth-generation Swiss guide, and memorably becomes the first woman ever to enter the traditional camel race of the Saharan oasis town of Timia. Intelligent, phenomenally funny, and chock-full of rich and telling details of place, Adventure Divas is a pro-woman chronicle for the twenty-first century. In a pilgrimage fueled by curiosity, ideology, and full-on estrogen power, Holly Morris has paved the way for all of us to discover our own diva within and set out on our own adventures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aB-0Ll-FPtkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PRAXIS/CST English As a Second Language (National Teacher Examination Series)","description":"***Includes Practice Test Questions*** Praxis II Health Education (5551) Exam Secrets helps you ace the Praxis II: Subject Assessments, without weeks and months of endless studying.

In Shadow of a Man, Steve Dawson examines the homelessness in Denver from the perspectives of the streetwalkers themselves. He records the experiences, thoughts and pain word for word as he wanders the streets, a drifter amongst drifters. Dawson's account offers a graphic, unedited description of life on the streets, illustrating the tactics that these wayward wanderers utilize to endure the challenges that we take for granted everyday. Depicting these people's own perceptions of reality reveals how one's mind can be shattered, and existence can be forgotten in our ever benevolent society. The results are powerful passages that will leave you pondering in astonishment. Steve Dawson is a freelance writer and documentarian. He spent many months on the wintry streets of Denver, Colorado interacting with the dispossessed. On the verge of being homeless himself, he set out to learn the ways of his inevitable demise. His B.A. in Communications made it possible to delve into the minds and thoughts of the downtrodden. As a published poet, his words flow across the page which enabled him to reveal truths about these vagabonds that were once hidden in the depths of shadows.

Victor Davis Hanson, known for his military histories and his social commentary, is a fifth-generation Californian who lives on a family farm in the Central Valley and has written eloquent elegies on the decline of agrarianism, Fields Without Dreams and The Land Was Everything. Here too, he ponders what has changed in California over the past quarter century, examining how the state and the Southwest more broadly indeed, the entire nation have been altered by hemorrhaging borders. Hanson admires the ambition and vigor of immigrants who have helped make California strong, but he indicts the disordered immigration policies that led to the present mess. He also illuminates the ways those policies are harmful to people who have come from Mexico and Central America seeking a better life in the United States. Nearly twenty years after the first publication of Mexifornia, Hanson offers an update on the continuing tragedy of illegal immigration. At the same time, he remains hopeful that our traditions of integration, assimilation, and intermarriage may yet remedy a predicament created by politicians and ideologues.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g7nrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thomas Aquinas as Reader of Psalms (Studies in Spirituality and Theology)","description":"Often overlooked but rich in inspiration, Aquinas' Commentary on the Psalms is part of his lectures on the Bible delivered to students. Composed near the end of his life, this work reflects his mature thought on such central issues as Christ, prayer, preaching, grace, and good works. In his study of this important text, Thomas Ryan shows how the Postilla super Psalmos offers new insight into Aquinas' spirituality. Combining literary, thematic, and comparative questions, Ryan reveals how this work differs from those more familiar to modern students of Aquinas, and he articulates its significance for the study of spirituality. Aquinas believed the Psalms to be a book that contained all of theology, revealing so much about Christ that it resembles New Testament gospels more than Old Testament prophetic books. Ryan identifies patterns in Aquinas' confirmatory use of scripture and his use of christological quotations. He shows how Super Psalmos reflects the evocative way in which Aquinas draws out meaning for his students' lives and pastoral practices, and reveals how as a teacher and theologian Aquinas was intent on moving his students -- often through dramatic language -- both to imitation of Christ and to action inspired by prayer. The first treatment of Super Psalmos in English, Ryan's work recovers Aquinas as an accomplished biblical and pastoral theologian and not simply a dispassionate expositor of theology, reestablishing him as an important resource for spirituality. It offers a better understanding of Aquinas' life and work as it suggests new potential for assessing other Thomistic writings -- and also invites us to reconsider the deeper meaning of the Psalms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bFHZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Thomas+Aquinas+as+Reader+of+Psalms+(Studies+in+Spirituality+and+Theology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Warning!: May Contain Nuts! absolutely the first definitive review of the incompetent, inadvertent and occasionally illegal world of business in the new Millenium.","description":"In Warning: May Contain Nuts we are once again pleasantly immersed in the world which is Barry Gibbons. Following on from his best selling Dream Merchants and Howboys, Barry Gibbons, former CEO of Burger King and iconoclast, gives a hilarious and insightful account of how and why businesses get it wrong! Through a series of droll vignettes, Gibbons takes us on a romp-roaring ride through the next 999 years of corporate mayhem and madness - bad behaviours which affect everyone - from the street sweeper to the CEO in his private jet. Because we're not talking about little blips on a profit and loss statement in a poxy sector of some niche industry. Business has far more an impact on our daily lives than government or politics. About half of the world's biggest economies are now corporations. From Enron's attempt to bring back the eighties with their excessive greed to Vodafone's loosing millions (that didn't actually exist in the first place) - Gibbons rips into the antics of these once trusted companies. So is it all doom and gloom? Are we destined for failure because of the frolicking these companies get up to - at our expense!? Are there any lessons or optimistic quick turn-around plans of action that Gibbons can share with us? Not really. But Warning: May Contain Nuts makes for some highly entertaining reading. And for the clever among us the lessons are implied. Just don't be daft.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jCl-k0YQEQ0C&dq=Warning!:+May+Contain+Nuts!+absolutely+the+first+definitive+review+of+the+incompetent,+inadvertent+and+occasionally+illegal+world+of+business+in+the+new+Millenium.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marx Versus Markets","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZuqAyK7XZEIC&dq=Marx+Versus+Markets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gladky's Art Deco Patterns and Designs in Full Color (Dover Pictorial Archives)","description":"Architect, designer and world traveler, Serge Gladky was a major figure in the rise of the modernist aesthetic and the decorative style known as Art Deco. In that style, he created a series of compositions widely regarded as among the most inspired and innovative in modem design. Among them are intricate lattice works of geometric inspired motifs, bizarre compositions containing surreal animals and images, bold abstracts, mysterious collages of symbolic forms and shapes, whimsical Cubist-flavored constructions resembling heads, and much more. This beautiful volume, faithfully reprinted in glowing full color from rare original French portfolios, contains over 60 of Gladky's finest designs. A landmark achievement in the evolution of a great international design style, the patterns are now available for the first time to artists and craftspeople for copyright-free use in design and craft projects. Because of Gladky's far-ranging travels and studies throughout Asia and Eastern Europe, his designs and use of color brought a new and potent exoticism to the essentially Western European, Paris-centered Art Deco aesthetic. His striking originality and innovative conceptions are on display here, ready to delight and inspire artists, illustrators and craftspeople, who will find Gladky's work one of the most imaginative and beautifully wrought achievements in 20th-century design.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jyd0QgAACAAJ&dq=Gladky%27s+Art+Deco+Patterns+and+Designs+in+Full+Color+(Dover+Pictorial+Archives)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Probate: Protecting the Public, Improving the Process","description":"An eye-opening account of the prevalence of fraud and abuse inherent in American probate law.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X_cJePKTzZcC&dq=American+Probate:+Protecting+the+Public,+Improving+the+Process&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The golden rooms (Armed Services edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kPYZzwEACAAJ&dq=The+golden+rooms+(Armed+Services+edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Art Of The Novel: Critical Prefaces (Notable American Authors)","description":"This collection of prefaces, originally written for the 1909 multi-volume New York Edition of Henry James s fiction, first appeared in book form in 1934 with an introduction by poet and critic R.

However, they are often constrained by lack of adequate resources, sound policies, and national support. It is clear that change and advancements, both systematic and scientific, are needed in a number of forensic science disciplines to ensure the reliability of work, establish enforceable standards, and promote best practices with consistent application. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward provides a detailed plan for addressing these needs and suggests the creation of a new government entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science, to establish and enforce standards within the forensic science community. The benefits of improving and regulating the forensic science disciplines are clear: assisting law enforcement officials, enhancing homeland security, and reducing the risk of wrongful conviction and exoneration. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs. While this book provides an essential call-to-action for congress and policy makers, it also serves as a vital tool for law enforcement agencies, criminal prosecutors and attorneys, and forensic science educators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4VH5FhgTXxoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death Dines at 8:30","description":"Sixteen acclaimed mystery writers--including Diane Mott Davidson, Tamar Myers, Edward Hoch, Mike Resnick, Valerie Wolzien, Claudia Bishop, and Bill and Judy Crider--serve up a taste-tempting array of suspenseful whodunits, in an anthology that comes complete with a variety of original recipes.

Not only were schools for rich and poor blatantly unequal, the gulf between the two extremes was widening and it has widened since. The urban schools he visited were overcrowded and understaffed, and lacked the basic elements of learning including books and, all too often, classrooms for the students.

This literary memoir takes readers from her childhood in India where depression is thought to be a curse to life in America where she eventually finds the light within by drawing on both her rich Hindu heritage and Western medicine to spare. As a young girl in Bangalore, Gayathri was surrounded by the fragrance of jasmine and flickering oil lamps, her family protected by Hindu gods and goddesses. But as she grew older, demons came forth from the dark corners of her idyllic kingdom--with the scariest creatures lurking within her.The daughter of a respected Brahmin family, Gayathri began to feel different. \\"I can hardly eat, sleep, or think straight. The only thing I can do is cry unending tears.\\" Her parents insisted it was all in her head. Because traditional Indian culture had no concept of depression as an illness, no doctor could diagnose and no medicine could heal her mysterious malady.This memoir traces Gayathri's courageous battle with the depression that consumed her from adolescence through marriage and a move to the United States. It was only after the birth of her first child, when her husband discovered her in the backyard \\"clawing the earth furiously with my bare hands, intent on digging a grave so that I could bury myself alive,\\" that she finally found help. After a stay in a psych ward she eventually found \\"the light within,\\" an emotional and spiritual awakening from the darkness of her tortured mind.Gayathri's inspiring story provides a first-of-its-kind cross-cultural view of mental illness--how it is regarded in India and in America, and how she drew on both her rich Hindu heritage and Western medicine to find healing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qlvXDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"eyes of a boy, lips of a man","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VcPQAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Virtuous Liaisons: Care, Love, Sex, and Virtue Ethics","description":"Author Raja Halwani discusses how virtue ethics illuminates the three central areas of our lives -- care, love, and sex -- which are often considered to be crucial to a well-lived life. Halwani concludes that virtue ethics allows for those sexual lifestyles that are deemed by traditional morality to be wrong -- promiscuity, open relationships, and sex work -- which boldly counters the conservative viewpoint of many virtue ethicists. This argument about the relationship between romantic love and virtue also examines the works of other philosophers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LBow-ov9P8wC&dq=Virtuous+Liaisons:+Care,+Love,+Sex,+and+Virtue+Ethics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"By a Fraction of a Second","description":"The top swimmers at the U.S. Olympic Trials all have talent, desire, determination, and years of hard work behind them.

Frank Dobie \\"In 1827 I started out from Hopkinsville, Kentucky, with all my worldly possessions, consisting of a few dollars in money, a change of clothes, and a gun, of course, to seek my fortune in this lazy man's paradise.\\" Noah Smithwick would remain in Texas for the next thirty-four years of his life. His memoir of that time, The Evolution of a State, or, Recollections of Old Texas Days, is a fascinating account of the early history of the Lone Star State when life was extremely tough for these early pioneers. He records in brilliant detail his trials and tribulations, his conflicts with fellow pioneers, Mexicans and Native Americans, and how he carved out a life for himself in this frontier territory. From the Fall of the Alamo to the Battle of Brushy Creek, Smithwick chronicles some of the most iconic moments in early Texan history. This book, however, is not just a first-person account of life in the first-half of the nineteenth century, as Smithwick provides thorough details of the changes that he saw going on around him and how Texas was developing to become the state we know today. Noah Smithwick was born in Martin Co., N. C., on the 1st day of January 1808. He drifted with the tide of emigration to Texas in 1827, remaining with the state till 1861, when he moved on to California, settling first in Tulare Co., and later at Santa Anna, Orange Co., at which place he died Oct. 21, 1899, aged 91 years, 9 months and 21 days.

In the 1970s and the 1980s, developments in the valuation of capital-investment opportunities based on options pricing revolutionized capital budgeting. Managerial flexibility to adapt and revise future decisions in order to capitalize on favorable future opportunities or to limit losses has proven vital to long-term corporate success in an uncertain and changing marketplace. In this book Lenos Trigeorgis, who has helped shape the field of real options, brings together a wealth of previously scattered knowledge and research on the new flexibility in corporate resource allocation and in the evaluation of investment alternatives brought about by the shift from static cash-flow approaches to the more dynamic paradigm of real options an approach that incorporates decisions on whether to defer, expand, contract, abandon, switch use, or otherwise alter a capital investment. Comprehensive in scope, Real Options reviews current techniques of capital budgeting and details an approach (based on the pricing of options) that provides a means of quantifying the elusive elements of managerial flexibility in the face of unexpected changes in the market. Also discussed are the strategic value of new technology, project interdependence, and competitive interaction. The ability to value real options has so dramatically altered the way in which corporate resources are allocated that future textbooks on capital budgeting will bear little resemblance to those of even the recent past. Real Options is a pioneer in this area, coupling a coherent picture of how option theory is used with practical insights in into real-world applications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z8o20TmBiLcC&dq=Real+options:+Managerial+flexibility+and+strategy+in+resource+allocation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of Mathematics Education in the United States and Canada","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dZNPzQEACAAJ&dq=A+History+of+Mathematics+Education+in+the+United+States+and+Canada&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, by Harriet A. Jacobs: A True Tale of Slavery, by John S. Jacobs","description":"'The degradations, the wrongs, the vices, that grow out of slavery, are more than I can describe.' Harriet Jacobs was born a slave in the American South and went on to write one of the most extraordinary slave narratives. First published pseudonymously in 1861, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl describes Jacobs's treatment at the hands of her owners, her eventual escape to the North, and her perilous existence evading recapture as a fugitive slave. To save herself from sexual assault and protect her children she is forced to hide for seven years in a tiny attic space, suffering terrible psychological and physical pain. Written to expose the appalling treatment of slaves in the South and the racism of the free North, and to advance the abolitionist cause, Incidents is notable for its careful construction and literary effects. Jacobs's story of self-emancipation and a growing feminist consciousness is the tale of an individual and a searing indictment of slavery's inhumanity. This edition includes the short memoir by Jacobs's brother, John S. Jacobs, 'A True Tale of Slavery'. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3qvnCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death of a salesman;: Certain private conversations in two acts and a requiem","description":"Arthur Miller's extraordinary masterpiece, Death of a Salesman changed the course of modern theatre, and has lost none of its power as an examination of American life and consumerism, published in Penguin Modern Classics. 'A man is not an orange. You can't eat the fruit and throw the peel away' Willy Loman is on his last legs. Failing at his job, dismayed at his the failure of his sons, Biff and Happy, to live up to his expectations, and tortured by his jealousy at the success and happiness of his neighbour Charley and his son Bernard, Willy spirals into a well of regret, reminiscence, and A scathing indictment of the ultimate failure of the American dream, and the empty pursuit of wealth and success, is a harrowing journey. In creating Willy Loman, his destructively insecure anti-hero, Miller defined his aim as being 'to set forth what happens when a man does not have a grip on the forces of life'. Arthur Miller (1915-2005), American dramatist, was born in New York City. In 1938 Miller won awards for his comedy The Grass Still Grows. His major achievement was Death of a Salesman, which won the 1949 Pulitzer Prize for drama and the 1949 New York Drama Critics' Circle Award.

Broken down into sections on the Practical and Theory of painting Collier is particularly useful for those looking to paint (or study) in his own Pre-Raphaelite style, although any student of oil painting would do well to study his techniques. The section on Theory discusses colour in a way very different to modern teachers, so while it may be difficult to understand for some others may find that it suits their mind and opens up new concepts. Collier was particularly well known for his use of colour, portraits and history painting, and his skills in these areas shine through in the advice he gives in A Manual of Oil Painting. This makes this little book a must read for those interested in the art of his period from both practical and academic perspectives.

Becker has shown that an economic approach can provide a unified framework for understanding all human behavior. In a highly readable selection of essays Becker applies this approach to various aspects of human activity, including social interactions; crime and punishment; marriage, fertility, and the family; and \\"irrational\\" behavior. \\"Becker's highly regarded work in economics is most notable in the imaginative application of 'the economic approach' to a surprising breadth of human activity. Becker's essays over the years have inevitably inspired a surge of research activity in testimony to the richness of his insights into human activities lying 'outside' the traditionally conceived economic markets. Perhaps no economist in our time has contributed more to expanding the area of interest to economists than Becker, and a number of these thought-provoking essays are collected in this book.\\" Choice Gary Becker was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Science in 1992.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ci5OCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chinese snuff bottles;: The adventures & studies of a collector","description":"Chinese Snuff Bottles is invaluable document for all interested in the history of Chinese art.

This is particularly noticeable in such areas as the role of women, the human relationship with God, and life after death, as new ideas clash with religious dogmas that, based upon a literal acceptance of the Creation Story in Genesis, suggest the inferiority of women, the inherent sinfulness of humanity, an active Devil, and an everlasting Hell. When this ancient Hebrew Paradisial tale is considered as a myth, however, rather than historical fact, and interpreted from the perspective of what the Jewish mystics (kabbalists) say was the original intent, then all the weak and demeaning ideas are removed. When Adam, Eve, the serpent, tree, etc., are read as archetypal figures an entirely different meaning is revealed that removes the confusion which is contributing to the existing tensions in society. This understanding presents a new, constructive look at Scripture for a wide audience of both Christian and Jewish women and men as well as those who are outside those two faiths with the exception of the most orthodox Jews, and those fundamentalist Christians who insist on a literal reading of the Bible. The Female, the Tree, and Creation, 1) explains the original meaning of the Adam and Eve tale as interpreted by Jewish kabbalists, 2) traces the themes of the Creation Story (e.g. the role of women, human relationship with God, sin, evil, etc.), through Judaism and early Christianity, and their evolvement in public consciousness, orthodox religion, and other spiritual teachings, up to the present time, 3) shows the practical value of Kabbalah in helping to resolve the controversies of today, irrespective of one's cultural or religious background, and 4) interprets historical trends to logically suggest the likely direction of man's consciousness and institutionalized religion in the 21st century. 5) This manuscript is enhanced by separate Introductions from Rabbi Gelberman (New York), and Dr. Carol Parrish-Harra, President, Sancta Sophia Seminary (Oklahoma). 6) The length of the manuscript is approximately 66,000 words, and consists of six chapters and an Appendix. A condensed outline follows. Chapter One: The Significance of Myth: Uses illustrative stories to explain the value of myth, and how the Creation Story fits a mythical pattern. Chapter Two: Symbols in the Adam and Eve Story An in-depth explanation and historical background of the various symbols (Tree, Serpent, etc.) that appear in this story. Chapter Three: The Source: The source of the Creation Story symbols, particularly the female and the serpent. I.. Moses and Egypt II. Mythic Formation. How and why the Creation Story was constructed along the lines of kabbalstic mysticism to covertly deliver a message of the sacredness of the female, the divinity of humanity, and the nature of sin and evil. Chapter Four: Jewish Mysticism and the Creation Story: I. Jewish Mysticism. Explains Jewish mysticism, traces the early evolvement of Kabbalah, and explains the kabbalists concept of the Sefirot. II. The Sefirot and Creation: An in-depth explanation of Kabbalah as it relates to the Creation Story to show the original, intended meaning of this tale. Chapter Five: Sin, Guilt and Evil. I. Jewish Thought. II. Christian Thought. The why' and how' the sense of sin, guilt and evil that pervades the theological presentation of the Creation Story became a part of Jewish and Christian thought.

This plane cremated so many crewmen that newscasters were afraid to write or talk about it for fear this might cause a morale problem with our men who were told to fly them. The author recites his cadet life at Randolph Field, San Antonio, Texas, THE WEST POINT OF THE AIR, where he became the top-ranking cadet officer. He then earned his wings at Ellington Field, Texas and, along with others of his class, was assigned to be an Instructor Pilot of this aircraft for seventeen months. So many men were being killed in horrible crashes that each wore their Air Force Wings as bracelets on their wrists so their bodies could be identified,  just in case.  Combat in the skies over Europe followed, and so did the crashes. Pilots did not know the mammoth tail could, and had separated from this airplane while in flight. Pilots knew the propellers could runaway and cremate their entire crew in disastrous, fiery crashes. Pilots did not know the manufacturers of parts of this airplane were falsifying reports and Congress knew it. They did know that they could be killed every time they took one up. This dramatic, true story is shocking in its detail and documentation.

Showdown on the Hogback was first published in Giant Western magazine August 1950 under the pseudonym Jim Mayo. Years later, as was Louis L'Amour's habit, it was rewritten as Showdown at Yellow Butte. Was any gunfighter ever in a worse predicament? Tom Kedrick found himself caught between two sides - and he was both those sides! Hired by a big land syndicate to drive out what he is told are dangerous squatters and outlaw gangs from a useless swamp, Kedrick soon finds he has been lied to and betrayed. What he finds is fertile is ranch land already claimed by the farmers and ranchers who have been living there peacefully, but are prepared to fight to the death to keep their homes. When Kedrick confronts the syndicate, he finds himself marked for death both by the syndicate's killers and the suspicious farmers. The cover for this ebook edition is reworked from the original magazine cover by George Rozen for Showdown on the Hogback (Rosen also provided covers for The Shadow and Doc Savage magazines during his long career) and was scanned from the publisher's copy of that issue of Giant Western.

He loved Roman republicanism, but saw himself as too principled for the mere politics that might have saved it. His life and lessons are urgently relevant in the harshly divided America and world of today. With erudition and verve, Rob Goodman and Jimmy Soni turn their life of Cato into the most modern of biographies, a blend of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and Game Change.\\" Howard Fineman, Editorial Director of The Huffington Post Media Group, NBC and MSNBC News Analyst, and New York Times bestselling author of The Thirteen American Arguments \\"A truly outstanding piece of work. What most impresses me is the book's ability to reach through the confusing dynastic politics of the late Roman Republic to present social realities in a way intelligible to the modern reader. Rome's Last Citizen entertainingly restores to life the stoic Roman who inspired George Washington, Patrick Henry and Nathan Hale. This is more than a biography: it is a study of how a reputation lasted through the centuries from the end of one republic to the start of another.\\" David Frum, DailyBeast columnist, former White House speech writer, and New York Times bestselling author of The Right Man Marcus Porcius Cato: aristocrat who walked barefoot and slept on the ground with his troops, political heavyweight who cultivated the image of a Stoic philosopher, a hardnosed defender of tradition who presented himself as a man out of the sacred Roman past and the last man standing when Rome's Republic fell to tyranny. His blood feud with Caesar began in the chamber of the Senate, played out on the battlefields of a world war, and ended when he took his own life rather than live under a dictator. Centuries of thinkers, writers, and artists have drawn inspiration from Cato's Stoic courage. Saint Augustine and the early Christians were moved and challenged by his example. Dante, in his Divine Comedy, chose Cato to preside over the souls who arrive in Purgatory. George Washington so revered him that he staged a play on Cato's life to revive the spirit of his troops at Valley Forge. Now, in Rome's Last Citizen, Rob Goodman and Jimmy Soni deliver the first modern biography of this stirring figure. Cato's life is a gripping tale that resonates deeply with our own turbulent times. He grappled with terrorists, a debt crisis, endemic political corruption, and a huge gulf between the elites and those they governed. In many ways, Cato was the ultimate man of principle he even chose suicide rather than be used by Caesar as a political pawn. But Cato was also a political failure: his stubbornness sealed his and Rome's defeat, and his lonely end casts a shadow on the recurring hope that a singular leader can transcend the dirty business of politics. Rome's Last Citizen is a timeless story of an uncompromising man in a time of crisis and his lifelong battle to save the Republic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EDz4NXXlhQUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PartitionMagic: The Essential Hard-Disk Manager; Version2.0 For Windows 95, Windows & DOS; 3.5\\" Disk","description":"PCMag.com is a leading authority on technology, delivering Labs-based, independent reviews of the latest products and services.

One of the best-known artists of her time, and a true American legend, Anna Mary Robertson \\"Grandma\\" Moses (18601961) was often marginalized as a latter-day \\"folk\\" painter or a phenomenon of popular media. Accompanying a traveling exhibition, this new book looks closely at the paintings themselves and the artist s compelling biography to reassert her role in the development of a culture of modernist art at mid-century. Presenting fresh research, several scholars examine Moses s name, public persona, painted world, and wildly popular place in American pop culture; address the myth of the self-taught artist; and contextualize her work alongside such contemporaries as Horace Pippin, Elie Nadelman, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and Morris Hirshfield.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5lJOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Grandma+Moses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hogfather (Discworld)","description":"It's the night before Hogswatch.

He introduces the reader to a vast cast of eccentric characters-bums, criminals, prostitutes, politicians, and poets, not to mention the police. He conducts you to the scenes of the crimes. He invites you to the courtroom and the murderer s solitary cell and to the gallows. He lets you sit around with him in the city room of a great Chicago newspaper, where he collected considerable material for that newspaper classic, The Front Page, which he wrote in collaboration with Charles MacArthur. Some of these stories are bizarre. Most of them are bawdy. But they are all imbued with lusty vitality and with a kind of innocent wonder that life is really so much stranger than fiction. The author looks back on the whole era with the consistently-unchanged fresh eye of youth. He is less concerned with nostalgia than reporting the way it was.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7vSuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Raven's Pride (Harlequin Intrigue, No. 572)","description":"He Had Given Her the One Thing She Treasured Most and He Didn't Even Know It Eden Maes came back to the Native American pueblo to clear her family's name for the sake of her baby boy.

Hitherto the possibility of solving a problem so far-reaching has evidently never been envisaged, and even if it had been so, the means of dealing with it were either altogether unsuspected or, at best, inadequately used. Is there a logic of history? Is there, beyond all the casual and incalculable elements of the separate events, something that we may call a metaphysical structure of historic humanity, something that is essentially independent of the outward forms--social, spiritual and political--which we see so clearly? Are not these actualities indeed secondary or derived from that something? Does world-history present to the seeing eye certain grand traits, again and again, with sufficient constancy to justify certain conclusions? And if so, what are the limits to which reasoning from such premisses may be pushed? Is it possible to find in life itself--for human history is the sum of mighty life-courses which already have had to be endowed with ego and personality, in customary thought and expression, by predicating entities of a higher order like \\"the Classical\\" or \\"the Chinese Culture,\\" \\"Modern Civilization\\"--a series of stages which must be traversed, and traversed moreover in an ordered and obligatory sequence? For everything organic the notions of birth, death, youth, age, lifetime are fundamentals--may not these notions, in this sphere also, possess a rigorous meaning which no one has as yet extracted? In short, is all history founded upon general biographic archetypes? The decline of the West, which at first sight may appear, like the corresponding decline of the Classical Culture, a phenomenon limited in time and space, we now perceive to be a philosophical problem that, when comprehended... ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Windham Press is committed to bringing the lost cultural heritage of ages past into the 21st century through high-quality reproductions of original, classic printed works at affordable prices. This book has been carefully crafted to utilize the original images of antique books rather than error-prone OCR text. This also preserves the work of the original typesetters of these classics, unknown craftsmen who laid out the text, often by hand, of each and every page you will read. Their subtle art involving judgment and interaction with the text is in many ways superior and more human than the mechanical methods utilized today, and gave each book a unique, hand-crafted feel in its text that connected the reader organically to the art of bindery and book-making. We think these benefits are worth the occasional imperfection resulting from the age of these books at the time of scanning, and their vintage feel provides a connection to the past that goes beyond the mere words of the text.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xmh7oAEACAAJ&dq=Oswald+Spengler+The+Decline+of+the+West,+Volume+One:+Form+and+Actuality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Another Lousy Day In Paradise","description":"Brilliant, witty, perceptive essays about fly-fishing, the natural world, and life in general by the acknowledged master of fishing writers. For the first time, two of John Gierach s most popular fishing books are collected in one volume a double dose of delight for longtime fans or first-time visitors to Gierach country. As Gierach astutely observes in Dances with Trout,  Fly-fishing is solitary, contemplative, misanthropic, scientific in some hands, poetic in others, and laced with conflicting aesthetic considerations. It s not even clear if catching fish is actually the point.  This observation might also describe Gierach s writing catching fish might be the subject, but most of the fun and (mis)adventure comes well before that point. Whether it s fishing close to home waters (Colorado) or farther afield (Alaska, Scotland, Texas); ice-fishing, tournament fishing, or night fishing; fishing for trout, salmon, carp, splake, or grayling; fishing with familiar companions like A.K. Best or the enigmatic  Zen master among fishing guides ; no detail of the fishing life is too insignificant or too absurd for Gierach. As he writes in Another Lousy Day in Paradise,  The real truth about fly-fishing is, it is beautiful beyond description in almost every way, and when a certain kind of person is confronted with a certain kind of beauty, they are either saved or ruined for life, or a little bit of both.  So start reading and be saved or ruined by Gierach s wonderful insights into the world around us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cuvIDwAAQBAJ&dq=Another+Lousy+Day+In+Paradise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"It's Great to Have a Sister Like You: A Blue Mountain Arts Collection (Language Of-- Series)","description":"Created by the bestselling poet and artist team of Susan Polis Schutz and Stephen Schutz, this distinctive series of hardcover books has a perfect title for every customer.

Goldstein's life-affirming program is inspired by his own heartbreak: the February morning when he was faced with the sudden news that his twelve-year marriage was ending, leaving Goldstein with primary custody of their three small children. Though paralyzed at first by feelings of loss and depression, Goldstein eventually discovered that the pain allowed him and his children a deeper appreciation for the simple moments of joy -- that his once \\"broken\\" family was succeeding not despite its wounds, but because of them. In Sacred Wounds, Goldstein reveals the secret to finding strength in challenging and often traumatic events, outlining a life-changing nine-step process to help readers move through heartache and toward healing. In clear, compassionate language, he refutes the notion of pain as a destroyer, drawing on the compelling stories of many of the people he has counseled along the way: Rick and Sara, who are plagued by infertility; Yvette, an aspiring man who battles her secular desires; Steve, for whom a frightening diagnosis portends the end...and then the beginning of hope. Remarkably affecting and inspiring, Goldstein's stories confirm that we are all well equipped to deal with the inevitable hurts and heartbreaks in life -- if only we release our preconceptions, acknowledge the strengthening power of our wounds, and follow the nine steps to a spiritual rebirth. Indispensable for anyone suffering through spiritual and emotional difficulties, Sacred Wounds is the key to shifting our perceptions and finding new strength and success in the painful experiences we all endure.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NPy7QtkpI4QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stats Pro Football Handbook 2000","description":"STATS Pro Football Handbook tackles the NFL.

The age was rich in military material, some of it the most human and the most picturesque that I have ever read. Setting aside historical works or the biographies of the leaders there is a mass of evidence written by the actual fighting men themselves, which describes their feelings and their experiences, stated always from the point of view of the particular branch of the service to which they belonged. The Cavalry were particularly happy in their writers of memoirs. Thus De Rocca in his \\"Memoires sur la guerre des Francais en Espagne\\" has given the narrative of a Hussar, while De Naylies in his \\"Memoires sur la guerre d'Espagne\\" gives the same campaigns from the point of view of the Dragoon. Then we have the \\"Souvenirs Militaires du Colonel de Gonneville,\\" which treats a series of wars, including that of Spain, as seen from under the steel-brimmed hair-crested helmet of a Cuirassier. Pre-eminent among all these works, and among all military memoirs, are the famous reminiscences of Marbot, which can be obtained in an English form. Marbot was a Chasseur, so again we obtain the Cavalry point of view. Among other books which help one to an understanding of the Napoleonic soldier I would specially recommend \\"Les Cahiers du Capitaine Coignet,\\" which treat the wars from the point of view of the private of the Guards, and \\"Les Memoires du Sergeant Bourgoyne,\\" who was a non-commissioned officer in the same corps. The Journal of Sergeant Fricasse and the Recollections of de Fezenac and of de Segur complete the materials from which I have worked in my endeavour to give a true historical and military atmosphere to an imaginary figure.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2k1Glvm95kMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cocina Deliciosa (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rXYdzgEACAAJ&dq=Cocina+Deliciosa+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sandy: The Autobiography of a Star","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b57QbqgSCY8C&dq=Sandy:+The+Autobiography+of+a+Star&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chas Addam's Monster Rally","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oa7CzgEACAAJ&dq=Chas+Addam%27s+Monster+Rally&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Federal benefits for veterans and dependents (SuDoc VA 1.34:IS 1/)","description":"Between 1992 and 1996, the American aerospace community vigorously explored the development of a post-Space Shuttle reusable space transportation system for the United States. This activity included studies by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), scientific foundations, and the aerospace industry. Likewise, both the executive branch of the government, through the issuance of a White House Policy Space Transportation Directive, and the legislative branch, though the holding of congressional hearings and budget allocations to NASA and the Department of Defense, were deeply involved in the decision-making process. The new policy direction was aimed toward reestablishing the Unites States' competitiveness in the space launch vehicle development and launch area and in transferring much of this activity to the U.S. aerospace industry. These developments served as the prelude to NASA's single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO), reusable launch vehicle (RLV) program that included the development of three technology test bed vehicles. The first of these vehicles was the DC-XA Clipper Graham, which actually was an upgrade to the original DC-X (Delta-Clipper Experimental) developed by McDonnell Douglas for the Department of Defense and subsequently transferred to NASA at the start of the Agency's single-stage-to-orbit program. The DC-XA Clipper Graham was followed by the X-33, which was intended to serve as a test bed vehicle for the subsequent development of a full-size reusable single-stage-to-orbit vehicle, and the X-34, which was intended as a technology test bed vehicle to demonstrate low-cost reusability and to conduct flight experiments. These were all promising concepts, and prospects for developing a cheap, robust, reusable space lift system to supplant the already aging Space Shuttle seemed assured. But within a decade, such hopes had been dashed-all the more frustrating to program proponents and participants, who had contributed some remarkably creative engineering to support the bold conceptual visions underpinning each of these programs. This book examines arguably the most elegant and promising of all of these, the NASA-Orbital Sciences X-34 Technology Testbed Demonstrator program, one ranking high on any list of the best research aircraft never flown","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z52dzgEACAAJ&dq=Federal+benefits+for+veterans+and+dependents+(SuDoc+VA+1.34:IS+1/)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Professional JavaScript with DHTML, ASP, CGI, FESI, Netscape Enterprise Server, Windows Script Host, LiveConnect and Java","description":"Unleash the true power of JavaScript by mastering Object-Oriented programming principles and patterns About This Book Covering all the new Object-Oriented features introduced in ES6, this book shows you how to build large-scale web apps Build apps that promote scalability, maintainability, and reusability Learn popular Object-Oriented programming (OOP) principles and design patterns to build robust apps Implement Object-Oriented concepts in a wide range of front-end architectures Who This Book Is For This book is ideal for you if you are a JavaScript developers who wants to gain expertise in OOP with JavaScript to improve your web development skills and build professional quality web applications.

Richard Roeper, like the rest of us, adores the movies.

With his characteristic acerbic wit, he weaves short essays with lists that work together to explain where Hollywood succeeds--and where it so often frustrates, disappoints, and fails us. But while Roeper devotes most of the book to mockery and ridicule, this book is, in the end, a love letter to film. Some of the essays and lists included in Schlock Value: Comical statistical breakdowns, including career batting averages of actors Reviews of Hollywood finances, including budgets, salaries, and ticket prices A proposed moratorium on pet projects, e.g., Kevin Costner's The Postman or John Travolta's Battlefield Earth The age differences between Woody Allen and his various leading ladies Actors appearing around the world in television commercials, including a list of the biggest stars that do overseas commercials--and the products they push Schlock Value is the perfect book for anyone who loves grumbling and complaining about the movies--but still can't help spending their weekends and evenings in front of the screen.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eSWZAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tomorrow's Organization: Crafting Winning Capabilities in a Dynamic World","description":"From issues of strategy and structure to leadership and capability development, the authors combine their research and consulting experience to offer the latest thinking and emerging practices today's most successful companies have incorporated to achieve strategic market advantage.

Author Lisa Jo Sagolla draws on extensive interviews with McCracken's friends, family, and colleagues to paint a complex portrait of the petite, blue-eyed, and sprightly entertainer as a woman exploiting her mesmerizing beauty and magnetism to succeed in the man's world of entertainment, yet always retaining the persona of childlike pixie she portrayed on stage. McCracken's comic exuberance and athleticism also epitomized a new ballet form that married the European ideas of aristocratic grace and movement with a uniquely American spirit and style. From her beginnings in Philadelphia and New York, to her meteoric rise to fame, to her life long struggle with the little understood and devastating effects of diabetes, The Girl Who Fell Down chronicles McCracken's spirited yet poignant life, including her training at Balanchine's seminal School of American Ballet, her blossoming as a \\"ravishing talent\\" with a \\"crackerjack dance technique\\" under Agnes de Mille, her supremacy as a performer, her marriages to novelist Jack Dunphy (who left her for Truman Capote,) and Bob Fosse, and her ultimate diagnosis with heart disease. Touching and inspiring, Sagolla's account describes McCracken's lasting influence through her nurturing of husband Fosse's provocative career, her dramatic coaching of actress Shirley MacLaine, and her inspiration for the many dancer-comediennes that followed -- Gwen Verdon, Carol Haney, and Sandy Duncan, to name a few. Rich with the social and cultural history of a golden age in show business and teeming with colorful choreographers, dancers, and entertainers, this comprehensive and carefully researched biography will introduce Joan McCracken to a new audience of dance enthusiasts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DtFa_zgI384C&dq=The+Girl+Who+Fell+Down:+A+Biography+of+Joan+McCracken&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"But the morning will come,: Novel","description":"The reactions of a southern white girl who discovers her unborn child will inherit Negro blood.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FFBbAAAAMAAJ&dq=But+the+morning+will+come,:+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fun with Zoo Animals Stencils (Dover Stencils)","description":"This delightful stencil collection of six different animals offers youngsters unlimited trips to the zoo!

The product of a lifetime of struggle and reflection, Cruse's book is a singular amalgam of cultural history, passionate disputation, and deeply considered analysis of the relationship between American blacks and American society. Reviewing black intellectual life from the Harlem Renaissance through the 1960s, Cruse discusses the legacy (and offers memorably acid-edged portraits) of figures such as Paul Robeson, Lorraine Hansberry, and James Baldwin, arguing that their work was marked by a failure to understand the specifically American character of racism in the United States. This supplies the background to Cruse's controversial critique of both integrationism and black nationalism and to his claim that black Americans will only assume a just place within American life when they develop their own distinctive centers of cultural and economic influence. For Cruse's most important accomplishment may well be his rejection of the clich s of the melting pot in favor of a vision of Americanness as an arena of necessary and vital contention, an open and ongoing struggle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9FNdJ8wlss8C&dq=Crisis+of+the+Negro+Intellectual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oracle 9i Java Programming: Solutions for Developers Using PL/SQL and Java","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=okIzzwEACAAJ&dq=Oracle+9i+Java+Programming:+Solutions+for+Developers+Using+PL/SQL+and+Java&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"STORY OF THE GYPSIES","description":"With this book, first published in 1928, Romanian-born American author Konrad Bercovici has written a sympathetic, thorough, and fascinating account of an extra-ordinary people.

Those of us who work as Transplant Coordinators were frequently referred to by hospital staff as 'organ vultures' behind our backs, but also many times within earshot. I felt this reference to extremely ugly birds was unfair and short sighted. I did say once in a while to a difficult staff person, 'if your kid needed a transplant wouldn't you hope that someone was out there being as ethically aggressive about finding an organ as they can?' That usually shut them up quickly.\\" -- from the Foreword One of the miracles of modern medicine is the ability of surgeons to transplant organs. Often, it's the only way to save the life of a person whose own kidneys, lungs, liver or heart are failing. But with barely 2 percent of critically ill patients suitable for organ donation, the demand far exceeds the number of organs that become available. The Gift of Life is about the remarkable world of organ transplant coordinators, profiles of the men and women who locate and arrange for the donation of organs from those who are dying and wish to live on in others' bodies through this selfless gift. Traci Graf tells the riveting story of this unique and demanding branch of medicine. Transplant coordinators review the medical files and charts on all patients whose condition is so severe that they are not expected to live. Their task is to convince the patient (or the patient's family) to allow organs to be donated immediately upon death. The transplant coordinator works to saves lives by finding and obtaining consent for as many organ donations as possible. In The Gift of Life, transplant coordinator Traci Graf recounts the stress, drama and joy of working long hours dealing with emotionally distraught family members and overworked medical staff, and the emotional toll of a job that means the difference between life and death for the recipients. Packed with riveting first person narrative, The Gift of Life will appeal to anyone interested in modern medical practice and the lives and challenges faced by nurses and doctors who work to offer critically ill patients the gift of life thanks to donors' foresight and generosity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4utECQAAQBAJ&dq=Gift+of+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Skein: 30 Quick Projects to Knit or Crochet","description":"These knitted and crocheted fashion accessories and decorative accents for the home vary in their required levels of skill, but all can be completed quickly and require only one skein of yarn.

But when Margaret's estranged husband, a scapegrace jazz musician, comes home to die, she is in danger of losing both her standing in the church and the son she has tried to keep on the godly path.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XcpWAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Troubleshooting Remote Access Networks (CCIE Professional Development)","description":"Master advanced MPLS VPN deployment solutions to design, deploy, and troubleshoot advanced or large-scale networks.

For years the mainstream media has stared down its collective nose at publications like the National Enquirer, but as Walker shows in scorching detail and irreverent humor, it is the gatekeepers and news elitists who need a trip to the woodshed, starting with Dan Rather.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-CAkvti6dogC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brainwashing and the Cults","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2mAQAQAAIAAJ&dq=Brainwashing+and+the+Cults&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yankee Stranger.","description":"Williamsburg, Virginia, is once more the scene in this second book of Thane's series, but the time is now the 1860s. Some of the characters are the descendants of those in the first novel, Dawn's Early Light, and Grandmother Day, who was 16 when Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown, is now 95. Once, she can remember, it was Massachusetts that was threatening to secede instead of South Carolina. And when she was a girl they never seemed to think much about Yankees, one way or the other. But when a Yankee comes to Williamsburg in the tense autumn of 1860 and red-haired Eden Day falls heels over head in love with him, her great grandmother takes the long view besides, she likes him herself. The story moves from Williamsburg to Richmond to Washington and back again during the dreadful years between Fort Sumter and Appomattox. In addition to the fictitious characters, Jeb Stuart and General Lee, Pickett, Magruder, and Stonewall Jackson are all seen through the eyes of the men who followed them into battle. Like Dawn's Early Light, Yankee Stranger is full of action and romance, but most importantly, it presents a vivid re-creation of a vanished world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7fR_DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plunge into the depths of despair","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6JlCnwEACAAJ&dq=Plunge+into+the+depths+of+despair&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miss Macintosh, My Darling: a Novel","description":"Miss MacIntosh herself, who hails from What Cheer, Iowa, and seems downright and normal, with an incorruptible sense of humor and the desire to put an end to phantoms; Catherine Cartwheel, the opium lady, a recluse who is shut away in a great New England seaside house and entertains imaginary guests; Mr. Spitzer, the lawyer, musical composer and mystical space traveler, a gentle man, wholly unsure of himself and of reality; his twin brother Peron, the gay and raffish gambler and virtuoso in the world of sports; Cousin Hannah, the horsewoman, balloonist, mountain-climber and militant Boston feminist, known as Al Hamad through all the seraglios of the East; Titus Bonebreaker of Chicago, wild man of God dreaming of a heavenly crown; the very efficient Christian hangman, Mr. Weed of the Wabash River Valley; a featherweight champion who meets his equal in a graveyard--these are a few who live with phantasmagorical vividness in the pages of Miss MacIntosh, My Darling.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oDoZMbrQVT0C&dq=Miss+Macintosh,+My+Darling:+a+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In search of maturity: An inquiry into psychology, religion and self-education","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=364gCXVqYnkC&dq=In+search+of+maturity:+An+inquiry+into+psychology,+religion+and+self-education&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black like me","description":"This American classic has been corrected from the original manuscripts and indexed, featuring historic photographs and an extensive biographical afterword.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RFErAQAAIAAJ&dq=Black+like+me&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Non-Euclidean geometry (Mathematical expositions)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VjHzswEACAAJ&dq=Non-Euclidean+geometry+(Mathematical+expositions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"City at World's End (Crest Giant, s184)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0Fc8AQAAIAAJ&dq=City+at+World%27s+End+(Crest+Giant,+s184)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Day Follow Night: From Chaos to Redemption","description":"Young Everett Carson loses his mother in a flood, then his father to suicide.

In fact, 48 percent of UK exports of goods and services go to the EU. Moreover, nearly 80 percent of our economy is the result of domestic activity, involving buying from and selling to each other. The export of goods and services to the rest of the world account for another 11 percent, and only ten percent is the result of exporting to the EU. In any event, the jobs currently resulting from trade with the EU would not be lost if we left. A number of authoritative studies have found that leaving the EU would have little impact on employment. The balance of the costs and benefits of UK membership of the EU is unequivocally negative. The net costs are substantial. The current recurring annual direct net cost to the UK of EU membership is estimated to range between approximately three and five percent of the GDP, with a 'most likely' figure of four percent of the GDP, equivalent to 40 billion per year. Within the 'most likely' 40 billion, 20 billion is the direct net cost of EU regulation to the UK economy - annually. A further 15 billion is the direct net cost to the UK economy of the Common Agricultural Policy. Another 5 billion is the annual cash subsidy that the UK pays to 'Brussels' through the EU budget. The current heavy burden of direct net economic cost - four percent of GDP - will not get lighter in the future. At best it will get no worse. The gloomy prognosis for the future is due partly to measures already in the EU pipeline, starting with the EU Constitution and enlargement, and partly to the UK being locked into a regional bloc in marked long-term decline. On a global view, the EU model of conducting trade, via a tightly-regulated customs union, is outmoded. The world outside the EU, with a superior trading and economic performance, tends to choose interlocking networks of user-friendly free trade agreements. These deliver the same benefits that EU members derive from the single market, but with very few of the costs.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NN6zAAAAIAAJ&dq=Cost+Too+Far:+An+Analysis+Of+The+Net+Economic+Costs+And+Benefits+For+The+Uk+Of+Eu+Membership&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beginning Active Server Pages 2.0","description":"Active Server Pages is part of Microsoft's server-based technology.

She is Canada's most decorated warship, winning honours in the Arctic, English Channel, Normandy, Bay of Biscay, and Korea. Her first commander, the late Harry DeWolf, is Canada's most famous naval hero. Since her decommissioning in 1963, Haida, the last of the feisty Tribals, has been preserved as a national naval memorial.HMCS Haida's story is an account of sharp-end war; of Canada's naval experience in Murmansk convoys and British Home Fleet protection; in English Channel operations, when Canadian and British naval units swept the German naval ensign from the seas; in the destruction of a U-boat, and in the liberation of Trondheim, Normay. Haida was always in on the action. She sank more enemy military tonnage than any other Canadian vessel.Haida's finest days were during the intense naval operations leading up to D-Day. With her sisters Huron and Iroquois and the ill-fated Athabaskan, with British and Polish men of war, she engaged German destroyers, torpedo boats, minesweepers and others and never lost. She vigorously carried the war to the enemy at great risk. Her postwar career including two tours in the Korean theater displays the same brave purpose in her officers and men, trained professionals and dedicated sailors.Barry Gough has written a new chapter in Canadian naval annals, showing that the best equipment brings forth the best results when good fortune and superb seamanship and weapons handling are matched in equal measure Haida's illustrious story.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2D4KAAAACAAJ&dq=HMCS+Haida:+Battle+Ensign+Flying:+Canada%27s+Famous+Tribal+Class+Destroyer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Girl Seeks Bliss: Zen and the Art of Modern Life Maintenance","description":"Fundamental concepts of Buddhism for the modern-day woman.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q-dZAAAACAAJ&dq=Girl+Seeks+Bliss:+Zen+and+the+Art+of+Modern+Life+Maintenance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Warautumn","description":"In this thrilling conclusion to the epic series begun in Bloodwinter and continued in Springwar and Summerblood, Tom Deitz brings us the final chapter in the unforgettable saga of a fugitive king, a lost magic, and a revolution that will either liberate a world--or condemn it to eternal tyranny.

But Avall is no longer there. Aided by the blind harpist Kylin, he has escaped from the hold in a blaze of improbable magic that transported the king and his closest followers to a dangerous wilderness. As the royal armies prepare for siege and Eron s capital seethes with growing rebellion, Avall and his comrades must retrieve the magical Lightning Sword--now lost by Avall s sister, Merryn--and make their way back to the embattled citadel.

There are many stories we can spin about previous ages, but which accounts get told? And by whom? Is there even such a thing as  objective  history? In this  witty, wise, and elegant  (The Spectator), book, Richard Cohen reveals how professional historians and other equally significant witnesses, such as the writers of the Bible, novelists, and political propagandists, influence what becomes the accepted record. Cohen argues, for example, that some historians are practitioners of  Bad History  and twist reality to glorify themselves or their country.  Scholarly, lively, quotable, up-to-date, and fun  (Hilary Mantel, author of the bestselling Thomas Cromwell trilogy), Making History investigates the published works and private utterances of our greatest chroniclers to discover the agendas that informed their and our views of the world. From the origins of history writing, when such an activity itself seemed revolutionary, through to television and the digital age, Cohen brings captivating figures to vivid light, from Thucydides and Tacitus to Voltaire and Gibbon, Winston Churchill and Henry Louis Gates. Rich in complex truths and surprising anecdotes, the result is a revealing exploration of both the aims and art of history-making, one that will lead us to rethink how we learn about our past and about ourselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Cw02EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aliens Gold Tenth Planet","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Kl-xWZ2B2q0C&dq=Aliens+Gold+Tenth+Planet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Past Imperfect : Most Likely to...

Providing a revealing window onto the Renaissance, they chronicle how style-conscious accountant Matth?us Schwarz and his son Veit Konrad experienced life through clothes, and climbed the social ladder through fastidious management of self-image. These bourgeois dandies' agenda resonates as powerfully today as it did in the sixteenth century: one has to dress to impress, and dress to impress they did. The Schwarzes recorded their sartorial triumphs as well as failures in life in a series of portraits by illuminists over 60 years, which have been comprehensively reproduced in full color for the first time. These exquisite illustrations are accompanied by the Schwarzes' fashion-focussed yet at times deeply personal captions, which render the pair the world's first fashion bloggers and pioneers of everyday portraiture. The First Book of Fashion demonstrates how dress  seemingly both ephemeral and trivial  is a potent tool in the right hands. Beyond this, it colorfully recaptures the experience of Renaissance life and reveals the importance of clothing to the aesthetics and every day culture of the period. Historians Ulinka Rublack's and Maria Hayward's insightful commentaries create an unparalleled portrait of sixteenth-century dress that is both strikingly modern and thorough in its description of a true Renaissance fashionista's wardrobe. This first English translation also includes a bespoke pattern by TONY award-winning costume designer and dress historian Jenny Tiramani, from which readers can recreate one of Schwarz's most elaborate and politically significant outfits.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T6LTCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles of Information Security","description":"Specifically oriented to the needs of information systems students, PRINCIPLES OF INFORMATION SECURITY, 5e delivers the latest technology and developments from the field.

Ingrid D. Rowland's pathbreaking life of Bruno establishes him once and for all as a peer of Erasmus, Shakespeare, and Galileo, a thinker whose vision of the world prefigures ours. By the time Bruno was burned at the stake as a heretic in 1600 on Rome's Campo dei Fiori, he had taught in Naples, Rome, Venice, Geneva, France, England, Germany, and the \\"magic Prague\\" of Emperor Rudolph II. His powers of memory and his provocative ideas about the infinity of the universe had attracted the attention of the pope, Queen Elizabeth and the Inquisition, which condemned him to death in Rome as part of a yearlong jubilee. Writing with great verve and sympathy for her protagonist, Rowland traces Bruno's wanderings through a sixteenth-century Europe where every certainty of religion and philosophy had been called into question and shows him valiantly defending his ideas (and his right to maintain them) to the very end. An incisive, independent thinker just when natural philosophy was transformed into modern science, he was also a writer of sublime talent. His eloquence and his courage inspired thinkers across Europe, finding expression in the work of Shakespeare and Galileo. Giordano Bruno allows us to encounter a legendary European figure as if for the first time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C-q8CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Canal: The Story Continues...","description":"The young housewife who organized the residents of the Love Canal neighborhood to publicize their plight and protest to state and federal officials updates the struggle to persuade government officials to act.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fFMeAQAAIAAJ&dq=Love+Canal:+The+Story+Continues...&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Apple Pro Training Series: Final Cut Pro 5 (Apple Pro Training)","description":"The Apple-Certified Way to Learn This fully updated Apple-certified guide presents a real-world workflow from raw media to finished project to demonstrate the features of Final Cut Pro X 10.4 and the practical techniques you will use in editing projects.

Native culture has deep ties to storytelling, and yet no other North American culture has been the subject of more erroneous stories. The Indian of fact, as King says, bears little resemblance to the literary Indian, the dying Indian, the construct so powerfully and often destructively projected by White North America. With keen perception and wit, King illustrates that stories are the key to, and only hope for, human understanding.

Little House in the Big Woods Wolves and panthers and bears roam the deep Wisconsin woods in the late 1870's. In those same woods, Laura lives with Pa and Ma, and her sisters, Mary and Baby Carrie, in a snug little house built of logs. Pa hunts and traps. Ma makes her own cheese and butter. All night long, the wind howls lonesomely, but Pa plays the fiddle and sings, keeping the family safe and cozy. Little House on the Prairie Pa Ingalls decides to sell the little log house, and the family sets out for Indian country! They travel from Wisconsin to Kansas, and there, finally, Pa builds their little house on the prairie. Sometimes farm life is difficult, even dangerous, but Laura and her family are kept busy and are happy with the promise of their new life on the prairie. Farmer Boy While Laura Ingalls grows up in a little house on the western prairie, Almanzo Wilder is living on a big farm in New York State. Almanzo and his brother and sisters work at their chores from dawn to supper most days -- no matter what the weather. There is still time for fun, though, especially with the horses, which Almanzo loves more than anything. On the Banks of Plum Creek Laura's family's first home in Minnesota is made of sod, but Pa builds a clean new house made of sawed lumber beside Plum Creek. The money for materials will come from their first wheat crop. Then, just before the wheat is ready to harvest, a strange glittering cloud fills the sky, blocking out the sun. Soon millions of grasshoppers cover the field and everything on the farm. In a week's time, there is no wheat crop left at all. By the Shores of Silver Lake Pa Ingalls heads west to the unsettled wilderness of the Dakota Territory. When Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and baby Grace join him, they become the first settlers in the town of De Smet. And Pa begins work on the first building in what will soon be a brand-new town on the shores of Silver Lake. The Long Winter The first terrible storm comes to the barren prairie in October. Then it snows almost without stopping until April. Snow has reached the rooftops, and no trains can get through with food or coal. The people of De Smet are starving, including Laura's family, who wonder how they're going to make it through this terrible winter. It is young Almanzo Wilder who finally understands what needs to be done. He must save the town, even if it means risking his own life. Little Town on the Prairie The long winter is over. With spring come socials, parties, and \\"Literaries.\\" There is also work to be done. Laura spends many hours each day sewing shirts to help send Mary to a college for the blind. But in the evenings, Laura makes time for a new caller, Almanzo Wilder. These Happy Golden Years Laura is teaching school, and it's terrifying! Most of the students are taller than she is, and she must sleep away from home for the first time. Laura is miserable, but the money is needed to keep Mary in a college for the blind. And every Friday -- no matter what the weather -- Almanzo Wilder arrives to take Laura home to her family for the weekend. Laura and Almanzo are courting, and even though she's not yet sixteen, she knows that this is a time for new beginnings. The First Four Years Laura and Almanzo Wilder have just been married! Their life on a small prairie homestead begins with high hopes. But each year seems to bring unexpected disasters -- storms, sickness, fire, and unpaid debts. These first four years call for courage, strength, and a great deal of determination. Always, though, there is love, especially for the newest member of the family -- baby Rose.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OwhdvgAACAAJ&dq=LAURA+INGALLS+WILDER%27S+LITTLE+HOUSE+BOOKS+The+Complete+Set+9+Volumes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Divers Guide to Hawaii : A Shore Divers Guide to the 6 Major Islands in the Hawaiian Chain","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gVkQAQAAIAAJ&dq=Divers+Guide+to+Hawaii+:+A+Shore+Divers+Guide+to+the+6+Major+Islands+in+the+Hawaiian+Chain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Litterature Francaise: Textes et Contextes","description":"Tome I of this two-volume anthology covers 19th to 20th century French literature.

Although Hume is once more considered as one of the greatest British philosophers, scholars now tend to focus on his thought rather than his writing. To round out our understanding of Hume, M. A. Box in this book charts the interrelated development of Hume's literary ambitions, theories of style, and compositional practice from his Treatise in 1739 through the Enquiries. In so doing, Box makes the case for Hume's career-long concern with the presentational modes of reaching an audience for his philosophical writings. Hume reacted to the popular failure of his masterpiece, A Treatise of Human Nature, Box suggests, by self-consciously exploring strategies in his subsequent works for agreeably bringing his readership to participate in the act of philosophizing. Combining a sensitive grasp of the ways Restoration period and eighteenth-century writers conceived the relations between rhetoric and philosophy with sound readings of particular texts, Box shows how Hume's literary concerns went beyond matters of style to involve persona, structure, and doctrine. While this book helps explain long-standing ambiguities surrounding Hume, especially by pointing out the tension between his created persona and his own voice, it also serves as an excellent introduction to his philosophy.

It was a bleak and lonely countryside over which he had been wandering for ten years. A rare tree, bird or wild animal was the only life he encountered during his desolate trek through his young years of roaming. Infrequently, he was fortunate enough to find shelter and food in the shops of deserted villages; otherwise he foraged what he could from the nearly barren land. Contact with other humans was his innermost and greatest fear. But the day came when his curiosity overcame his sensibilities of self-preservation and he was drawn to the sound of a great wailing not far from a place where he had come to rest. Form that moment on his whole existence took on a radical change. His wanderings became a kaleidoscope of adventures, emotions, and responsibilities - never static, forever mobile, and potentially dangerous. There were moments when it would have been easier to turn his back, return to old ways, but somehow he knew this was an impossibility. He accepted his new fate, but still feared the greatest of all commitments until it was too late for him. This fantasy adventure will not fail to excite and stir in every reader memories and emotions of seemingly forgotten times and moments.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dQc1AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Pirates (Wordsworth Reference)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uM9uAAAACAAJ&dq=Dictionary+of+Pirates+(Wordsworth+Reference)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Penguin History of the World, Revised Edition","description":"The completely updated edition of J.

Born to Christian parents, prior to conversion he migrated into a Theosophical society and quickly rose in prominence. His conversion came from his father's patient admonitions from Scripture. It was Proverbs 14:12, 'there is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death, ' which particularly struck his heart and compelled him to renounce Theosophy and follow Jesus.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DgSQpwAACAAJ&dq=Divine+healing%3B:+Is+it+scriptural%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Build my gallows high","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ReFCAQAAIAAJ&dq=Build+my+gallows+high&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"General Relativity and Relativistic Astrophysics (Texts & Monographs in Physics)","description":"In 1979 I gave graduate courses at the University of Zurich and lectured in the 'Troisieme Cycle de la Suisse Romande' (a consortium offour uni versities in the french-speaking part of Switzerland), and these lectures were the basis of the 'Springer Lecture Notes in Physics', Volume 150, published in 1981.

Thirring asked me to prepare an English edition for the 'Texts and Mono graphs in Physics'. Fortunately E. Borie agreed to translate the original German text into English. An excellent collaboration allowed me to re vise and add to the contents of the book. I have updated and improved the original text and have added a number of new sections, mostly on astrophysical topics. In particular, in collaboration with M. Camenzind I have included a chapter on spherical and disk accretion onto compact objects. This book divides into three parts. Part I develops the mathematical tools used in the general theory of relativity. Since I wanted to keep this part short, but reasonably self-contained, I have adopted the dry style of most modern mathematical texts.

Today, the figure of Sherlock Holmes towers over detective fiction like a colossus but it was not always so. Edgar Allan Poe s Dupin, the hero of  The Murders in the Rue Morgue,  anticipated Holmes  deductive reasoning by more than forty years. In A Study in Scarlet, the first of Holmes  adventures, Doyle acknowledged his debt to Poe and to  mile Gaboriau, whose thief-turned-detective Monsieur Lecoq debuted in France twenty years earlier. If Rue Morgue was the first true detective story in English, the title of the first full-length detective novel is more hotly contested. Among the possibilities are two books by Wilkie Collins The Woman in White (1859) and The Moonstone (1868) Mary Elizabeth Braddon s The Trail of the Serpent (1861) or Aurora Floyd (1862), and The Notting Hill Mystery (1862-3) by the pseudonymous  Charles Felix.  As the early years of detective fiction gave way to two separate golden ages hard-boiled tales in America and intricately-plotted  cozy  murders in Britain and these new sub-genres went their own ways, their detectives still required the intelligence and clear-sightedness that characterized the earliest works of detective fiction: the trademarks of Sherlock Holmes, and of all the detectives featured in these pages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FGmZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prep (Junior Library Guild Selection)","description":"This riveting novel about the shocking world of urban prep-school gangs is a powerful, brutally realistic expos of America's most affluent youth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CxbhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Prep+(Junior+Library+Guild+Selection)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Jealous God: Science's Crusade Against Religion","description":"The age-old war between religion and science has taken a new twist. Once the dedicated scientist-martyr fought heroically against rigid religionists. But now the tables have turned, and it is established science crusading against religion, pushing atheistic agendas in the classroom, in textbooks, and in the media. This book shows how science has now become a religion of its own-an often fanatical one at that-furiously preaching atheism, punishing dissenters, dictating how and what we should think, and subtly inserting its worldviews in everything from education to entertainment. And, with stunning clarity, it proves that, with billions of dollars up for grabs in the race for stem cell research, intellectual integrity has been replaced with good old-fashioned greed. With sharp insight and completely original reporting, this book defiantly shows the extent to which science is beating down religion and how this systematic tyranny is unmistakably weakening culture and society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q9rMi51o1-gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rommel papers","description":"An essential collection of the wartime writings and diary of World War II German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, edited with commentary by one of the great military theorists of our time When Erwin Rommel died-by forced suicide at Hitler's command-he left behind in various ingenious hiding places the papers that recorded the story of his dramatic career and the exact details of his masterly campaigns. It was his custom to dictate each evening a running narrative of the day's events and, after each battle, to summarize its course and the lessons to be learned from it. He wrote, almost daily, intimate and outspoken letters to his wife in which his private feelings and-after the tide had turned-forebodings found expression. To this is added by Rommel's son Manfred the story of the field marshall's last weeks and the final day when he was given the choice of an honorable suicide or an ignominious trial for treason. An engrossing human document and a rare look at the mind of the \\"Desert Fox,\\" The Rommel Papers throws an interesting light on the Axis alliance and on the inner workings of Hitler's high command.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=byyzmkyCQ1gC&dq=The+Rommel+papers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playing Through","description":"In the tradition of Peter Mayle and James Dodson s Final Rounds, Curtis Gillespie gives us a delightful and heartwarming story of people, place, and golf.

He writes affectionately about place, family, life, the obsessive nature of golf, and the personalities who are drawn to the sport. Along the way Curtis Gillespie discovers how much he owes his father -- and finds a rich sense of belonging among the local courses and the people who play them.

The ubiquitous salaryman came to signify both Japanese masculinity, and Japanese corporate culture, and in this sense, the salaryman embodied 'the archetypal citizen'. This book uses the figure of the salaryman to explore masculinity in Japan by examining the salaryman as a gendered construct. Whilst there is a considerable body of literature on Japanese corporate culture and a growing acknowledgement of the role of gender, until now the focus has been almost exclusively on women in the workplace. In contrast, this book is one of the first to focus on the men within Japanese corporate culture through a gendered lens. Not only does this add to the emerging literature on masculinity in Japan, but given the important role Japanese corporate culture has played in Japan's emergence as an industrial power, Romit Dasgupta's research offers a new way of looking both at Japanese business culture, and more generally at important changes in Japanese society in recent years. Based on intensive interviews carried out with young male private sector employees in Japan, this book makes an important contribution to the study of masculinity and Japanese corporate culture, in addition to providing an insight into Japanese culture more generally. As such it will be of great interest to students and scholars of Japanese studies, Japanese society and gender studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gWE2PhdiJGoC&dq=Salaryman+in+Japan+(Japan+in+Your+Pocket+Series)+(No.+8)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plato's Phaedo","description":"\\"A first rate translation at a reasonable price.\\" -- Michael Rohr, Rutgers University","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=to4f1ALslIYC&dq=Plato%27s+Phaedo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Photographic Atlas of the Body","description":"This text, structured to supplement physiology and anatomy courses, covers standard body systems, as well as orientation, surface anatomy, and histology.

The varied contributions to this interdisciplinary Special Issue highlight assumptions about the human perception of, attitude toward, and responsibility for the animals that are read and written about, thus demonstrating that just as  the animal  does not exist, neither does  the human . In their zoopoetic focus, the analyses are aware that animal narratology ultimately always contains an approximation of an animal perspective in human terms and terminology, yet they make clear that what matters is how the animal is approximated and that there is an effort to approach and encounter the non-human in the first place. Many of the analyses come to the conclusion that literary animals give readers the opportunity to expand their own points of view both on themselves and others by adopting another s perspective to the degree that such an endeavor is possible. Ultimately, the contributions call for a recognition of the many spaces, moments, and modes in which human lives are entangled with those of animals one of which is located within the creative bounds of storytelling.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wPQOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Autobio+of+Malcolm+X+(Br)(Pbk)(Oop)+(Bloom%27s+Notes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Healing Path","description":"A compelling, inspirational guide to healing from old wounds shows readers how to channel the painful energy of past hurts into a meaningful, fruitful life.

Thanks largely to its perceived difficulty, data preparation has traditionally taken a backseat to the more alluring question of how best to extract meaningful knowledge. But without adequate preparation of your data, the return on the resources invested in mining is certain to be disappointing. Dorian Pyle corrects this imbalance. A twenty-five-year veteran of what has become the data mining industry, Pyle shares his own successful data preparation methodology, offering both a conceptual overview for managers and complete technical details for IT professionals. Apply his techniques and watch your mining efforts pay off-in the form of improved performance, reduced distortion, and more valuable results. On the enclosed CD-ROM, you'll find a suite of programs as C source code and compiled into a command-line-driven toolkit. This code illustrates how the author's techniques can be applied to arrive at an automated preparation solution that works for you. Also included are demonstration versions of three commercial products that help with data preparation, along with sample data with which you can practice and experiment. * Offers in-depth coverage of an essential but largely ignored subject. * Goes far beyond theory, leading you-step by step-through the author's own data preparation techniques. * Provides practical illustrations of the author's methodology using realistic sample data sets. * Includes algorithms you can apply directly to your own project, along with instructions for understanding when automation is possible and when greater intervention is required. * Explains how to identify and correct data problems that may be present in your application. * Prepares miners, helping them head into preparation with a better understanding of data sets and their limitations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hhdVr9F-JfAC&dq=Data+Preparation+for+Data+Mining+(The+Morgan+Kaufmann+Series+in+Data+Management+Systems)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Standard Jewish Encyclopedia (Revised)","description":"Winner, The New York Public Library, Best of Reference Award, 2002 New York University Press is proud to announce the return of a valuable resource for both Jewish families and those interested in learning more about the Jewish faith.

Magnificently illustrated, it also contains a new introduction, a guide for usage, new illustrations, as well as a new annotated bibliography.

There are biographical entries on biblical figures, rabbis, and others whose thoughts and actions have influenced the development of Judaism. Also included are dozens of insightful commentaries on specific prayers. Issues of particular contemporary interest are given special attention, as are women's roles, with a separate entry on the feminist movement and new biographical entries on figures ranging from Miriam and Deborah to Blu Greenberg and Suzannah Heschel.

In this updated edition of The Global Brain, Russell details an extraordinary new vision of humanity's potential as a fully conscious superorganism in an awakening universe. Presenting evidence that the earth itself is a living being and every person upon it a cell in the planetary nervous system, Russell describes how breakthroughs in telecommunications and computer networks are rapidly linking the human species into an embryonic global brain. At the same time, the human potential movement is growing faster than any other segment of society and influencing every aspect of the culture -- including business, politics, and medicine. Russell shows how the convergence of these powerful trends is creating the required conditions for an evolutionary shift in consciousness from egocentrism to geo-centrism. First published in 1983 as The Global Brain and translated into ten languages, Russell's seminal work won acclaim from forward thinkers all over the world. Regarded by many as years ahead of its time, its original predictions about the impact of computer networks and changing social values were quickly fulfilled.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DBiSQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Global+Brain+Awakens:+Our+Next+Evolutionary+Leap&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chobits, tome 2 (French Edition)","description":"Having left the country for a cram school in the city, Hideki Motosuwa has humorous and unusual experiences with Chi, a \\"persocom,\\" or miniature android and personal computer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j3JWAAAAYAAJ&dq=Chobits,+tome+2+(French+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Female, The Tree, and Creation","description":"At the beginning of this new millennium there is an increasing tension between the doctrines of both orthodox Christianity and Judaism, and the changing beliefs of modern society. This is particularly noticeable in such areas as the role of women, the human relationship with God, and life after death, as new ideas clash with religious dogmas that, based upon a literal acceptance of the Creation Story in Genesis, suggest the inferiority of women, the inherent sinfulness of humanity, an active Devil, and an everlasting Hell. When this ancient Hebrew Paradisial tale is considered as a myth, however, rather than historical fact, and interpreted from the perspective of what the Jewish mystics (kabbalists) say was the original intent, then all the weak and demeaning ideas are removed. When Adam, Eve, the serpent, tree, etc., are read as archetypal figures an entirely different meaning is revealed that removes the confusion which is contributing to the existing tensions in society. This understanding presents a new, constructive look at Scripture for a wide audience of both Christian and Jewish women and men as well as those who are outside those two faiths with the exception of the most orthodox Jews, and those fundamentalist Christians who insist on a literal reading of the Bible. The Female, the Tree, and Creation, 1) explains the original meaning of the Adam and Eve tale as interpreted by Jewish kabbalists, 2) traces the themes of the Creation Story (e.g. the role of women, human relationship with God, sin, evil, etc.), through Judaism and early Christianity, and their evolvement in public consciousness, orthodox religion, and other spiritual teachings, up to the present time, 3) shows the practical value of Kabbalah in helping to resolve the controversies of today, irrespective of one's cultural or religious background, and 4) interprets historical trends to logically suggest the likely direction of man's consciousness and institutionalized religion in the 21st century. 5) This manuscript is enhanced by separate Introductions from Rabbi Gelberman (New York), and Dr. Carol Parrish-Harra, President, Sancta Sophia Seminary (Oklahoma). 6) The length of the manuscript is approximately 66,000 words, and consists of six chapters and an Appendix. A condensed outline follows. Chapter One: The Significance of Myth: Uses illustrative stories to explain the value of myth, and how the Creation Story fits a mythical pattern. Chapter Two: Symbols in the Adam and Eve Story An in-depth explanation and historical background of the various symbols (Tree, Serpent, etc.) that appear in this story. Chapter Three: The Source: The source of the Creation Story symbols, particularly the female and the serpent. I.. Moses and Egypt II. Mythic Formation. How and why the Creation Story was constructed along the lines of kabbalstic mysticism to covertly deliver a message of the sacredness of the female, the divinity of humanity, and the nature of sin and evil. Chapter Four: Jewish Mysticism and the Creation Story: I. Jewish Mysticism. Explains Jewish mysticism, traces the early evolvement of Kabbalah, and explains the kabbalists concept of the Sefirot. II. The Sefirot and Creation: An in-depth explanation of Kabbalah as it relates to the Creation Story to show the original, intended meaning of this tale. Chapter Five: Sin, Guilt and Evil. I.

Analysis of the popular appeal of The Lord of the Rings (on websites and elsewhere) shows that Tolkien fans are hungry for discussion of the urgent moral and cosmological issues arising out of this fantastic epic story. Can political power be wielded for good, or must it always corrupt? Does technology destroy the truly human? Is it morally wrong to give up hope? Can we find meaning in chance events? In The Lord of the Rings and Philosophy, seventeen young philosophy professors, all of them ardent Tolkien fans and most of them contributors to the four earlier volumes in the Popular Culture and Philosophy series, address some of these important issues and show how clues to their solutions may be found in the imaginary world of Middle-earth.

Kids are not Dallas s strong suit. But Nixie needs a safe place to stay, and Dallas needs to solve this case. Not only because of the promise she made to Nixie. Not only for the cause of justice. But also to put to rest some of her own darkest memories and deepest fears.

The title of this book, The Body Of Light, refers to two stages in this process of internal evolution. The first applies to the subtle body, which is typically described in terms of the radiance of its colors. The second concerns the final stage of development, when the physical level is totally transfigured and only a rainbow body a distinct but nonmaterial entity that is free of all physical limitations remains. That is the eventual goal. But to get there, the subtle body must be activated; a process which is the theme of this book. By examining Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist and other traditions for information on the subtle body, the authors lead us to a better understanding of the inner workings of all spiritual traditions. Liberally illustrated with line drawings and comparative tables the second half of The Body Light is devoted to a sequence of practical exercises, drawn from a wide variety of traditions, that you can immediately use to begin or to broaden your own spiritual practice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b4nQAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Irreducible Minimum: An Examination of Basic Christian Doctrine","description":"'The Irreducible Minimum' is a careful examination of the eleven essential doctrines, including the doctrine of the Bible, Dispensationalism, Theology Proper and Trinitarianism, Christology, Holy Spirit, Angels, Sin, Salvation, the Church, and the doctrine of last things, from a pre-tribulational, pre-millennial viewpoint.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LHtKAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Professional .NET Framework","description":"Market_Desc:   Experienced Microsoft platform developers, either from .NET 1.x or earlier Win 9X/NT development platforms Special Features:   Wrox!

Some poems address common themes such as having a hard day at school, feeling shy or being a newcomer, while others explore subjects of fascination   bats, spiders, skeletons, octopuses, polka dots, racing cars and birthday parties.

Nation after nation fell to Japanese soldiers. How were the Japanese able to justify their occupation of so many Asian nations? And how did they find supporters in countries they subdued and exploited? Race War! delves into submerged and forgotten history to reveal how European racism and colonialism were deftly exploited by the Japanese to create allies among formerly colonized people of color. Through interviews and original archival research on five continents, Gerald Horne shows how race played a key and hitherto ignored ;role in each phase of the war. During the conflict, the Japanese turned white racism on its head portraying the war as a defense against white domination in the Pacific. We learn about the reverse racial hierarchy practiced by the Japanese internment camps, in which whites were placed at the bottom of the totem pole, under the supervision of Chinese, Korean, and Indian guards an embarrassing example of racial payback that was downplayed by the defeated Japanese and the humiliated Europeans and Euro-Americans. Focusing on the microcosmic example of Hong Kong but ranging from colonial India to New Zealand and the shores of the U.S., Gerald Horne radically retells the story of the war. From racist U.S. propaganda to Black Nationalist open support of Imperial Japan, information about the effect of race on U.S. and British policy is revealed for the first time. This revisionist account of the war draws connections between General Tojo, Malaysian freedom fighters, and Elijah Muhammed of the Nation of Islam and shows how white racism encouraged and enabled Japanese imperialism. In sum, Horne demonstrates that the retreat of white supremacy was not only driven by the impact of the Cold War and the energized militancy of Africans and African-Americans but by the impact of the Pacific War as well, as a chastened U.S. and U.K. moved vigorously after this conflict to remove the conditions that made Japan's success possible.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q_DVIILAiIoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Revolutionary Guide to Assembly Language","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AhsHAAAACAAJ&dq=Revolutionary+Guide+to+Assembly+Language&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Classic Book of Science Fiction","description":"Brian Aldiss William Gibson R.A.

Drawing from thousands of hours of previously unavailable (and still classified) tape-recorded meetings between the highest levels of the American military command in Vietnam, A Better War is an insightful, factual, and superbly documented history of these final years. Through his exclusive access to authoritative materials, award-winning historian Lewis Sorley highlights the dramatic differences in conception, conduct, and at least for a time results between the early and later years of the war. Among his most important findings is that while the war was being lost at the peace table and in the U.S. Congress, the soldiers were winning on the ground.

These often rancorous arguments have gone on, however, with little awareness of their historical antecedents. Experimentation on animals and particularly humans is often assumed to be a uniquely modern phenomenon, but the ideas and attitudes that encourage the biological and medical sciences to experiment on living creatures date from the earliest expression of Western thought. Here, Anita Guerrini looks at the history of these practices from vivisection in ancient Alexandria to present-day battles over animal rights and medical research employing human subjects. Guerrini discusses key historical episodes, including the discovery of blood circulation, the development of smallpox and polio vaccines, and recent AIDS research. She also explores the rise of the antivivisection movement in Victorian England, the modern animal rights movement, and current debates over gene therapy.--From publisher description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8as-dLk-6N0C&dq=Experimenting+with+Humans+and+Animals:+From+Galen+to+Animal+Rights+(Johns+Hopkins+Introductory+Studies+in+the+History+of+Science)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The upper hand: God's sovereignty in Afghan captivity","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=156RGAAACAAJ&dq=The+upper+hand:+God%27s+sovereignty+in+Afghan+captivity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alicia's Tutu","description":"Alicia is convinced that a tutu will make her a better dancer, but her mother says she doesn't need one.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=thEwIAAACAAJ&dq=Alicia%27s+Tutu&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Visual Basic Oracle 8 Programmer's Reference","description":"Oracle is the relational database of preference in the corporate world, and when combined with the rapid application development capabilities of Visual Basic, provides a powerful base for developers.

A working theory is presented based on what we know of the neurological and cognitive development in the context of evolution of the human species and its brain. In outlining our theory of developmental disabilities in evolutionary terms, the authors offer evidence to support the following notions: Bipedalism was the major reason for human neocortical evolution; Cognition evolved secondary and parallel to evolution of motricity; There exists an overlap of cognitive and motor symptoms; Lack of thalamo-cortical stimulation, not overstimulation, is a fundamental problem of developmental disabilities; A primary problem is dysfunctions of hemisphericity; Most conditions in this spectrum of disorders are the result of a right hemisphericity; Environment is a fundamental problem; All of these conditions are variations of the same problem; These problems are correctable; Hemisphere specific treatment is the key to success.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KG-BxG-Y5D0C&dq=Neurobehavioral+Disorders+of+Childhood:+An+Evolutionary+Perspective&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Successful Aging: Strategies for Healthy Living (Prevention in Practice Library)","description":"There is a near-universal folk saying that everyone wishes to live a good long life, but no one wishes for old age.

It is a book about primary prevention strategies in the aging process; it is not about preventing that process. It is not about being old. Instead, it is about the things that individuals - and the helping professionals who provide them with counsel and assistance - can do to prevent the preventable problems of advancing age, and to better manage those changes in functioning that cannot be prevented. In short, it is about extending all our capacities to the fullest so that we can better keep all those promises that we make to ourselves and others. Aging is a life-long process. We focus here on the changes that are taking place in our selves and in our society as we age. In particular, we focus on what we can do to affect these changes by the choices we make and how we live. This book offers primary prevention strategies for mature and older adults, with the recognition that mature adulthood starts as soon as we are old enough to truly appreciate our active role in our own aging processes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yf3jBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Battle Fatigue","description":"Racial Battle Fatigue is described as the physical and psychological toll taken due to constant and unceasing discrimination, microagressions, and stereotype threat.

Falk suggests that a way to understand and explain such irrational matters is to examine the unconscious aspects of the conflict. He examines large-group psychology, nationalism, group narcissism, psychogeography, the Arab and Israeli minds, and suicidal terrorism, and he offers psychobiographical studies of Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat, two key players in this tragic conflict today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4CNVmZIen3AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Timekeepers: The Great Jazz Drummers (Art of Jazz)","description":"Discusses the role of drumming in jazz and surveys some of the greatest jazz drummers in history, from Warren Baby Dodds and Arthur Zutty Singleton to Tony Williams and Elvin Jones.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k9zrGwAACAAJ&dq=Timekeepers:+The+Great+Jazz+Drummers+(Art+of+Jazz)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"By Persons Unknown: The Strange Death of Christine Demeter","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lGVGgMcB8nEC&dq=By+Persons+Unknown:+The+Strange+Death+of+Christine+Demeter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moll Flanders (Bantam Classic)","description":"Considered one of the great English novels, Defoe's book follows Moll Flanders as she struggles to avoid the deadly poverty of 17th-century England.

Traveling, like Tocqueville and John Gunther before him, through a political and cultural landscape in transition, Kaplan reveals a nation shedding a familiar identity as it assumes a radically new one. An Empire Wilderness opens in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where the first white settlers moved into Indian country and where Manifest Destiny was born. In a world whose future conflicts can barely be imagined, it is also the place where the army trains its men to fight the next war. \\"A nostalgic view of the United States is deliberately cultivated here,\\" Kaplan writes, \\"as if to bind the uncertain future to a reliable past.\\" From Fort Leavenworth, Kaplan travels west to the great cities of the heartland--to St. Louis, once a glorious shipping center expected to outshine imperial Rome and now touted, with its desolate inner city and miles of suburban gated communities, as \\"the most average American city.\\" Kaplan continues west to Omaha; down through California; north from Mexico, across Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas; up to Montana and Canada, and back through Oregon. He visits Mexican border settlements and dust-blown county sheriffs' offices, Indian reservations and nuclear bomb plants, cattle ranches in the Oklahoma Panhandle, glacier-mantled forests in the Pacific Northwest, swanky postsuburban sprawls and grim bus terminals, and comes, at last, to the great battlefield at Vicksburg, Mississippi, where an earlier generation of Americans gave their lives for their vision of an American future. But what, if anything, he asks, will today's Americans fight and die for? At Vicksburg Kaplan contemplates the new America through which he has just traveled--an America of sharply polarized communities that draws its population from pools of talent far beyond its borders; an America where the distance between winners and losers grows exponentially as corporations assume gov-ernment functions and the wealthy find themselves more closely linked to their business associates in India and China than to their poorer neighbors a few miles away; an America where old loyalties and allegiances are vanishing and new ones are only beginning to emerge. The new America he found is in the pages of this book. Kaplan gives a precise and chilling vision of how the most successful nation the world has ever known is entering the final, and highly uncertain, phase of its history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ANcVBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Processes of constitutional decisionmaking: Cases and materials (Law school casebook series)","description":"In Processes of Constitutional Decisionmaking, an extraordinary team of authors traces the historical, political, and social development of constitutional law.

Like ingredients in a long-simmering soup, they flavor who we are and what we do. In this beautiful, haunting, and larger-than-life memoir, one woman shares with us the humor, heartbreak, and triumph of her Jewish ancestry, to comfort and strengthen us all, whatever our faith. At home in her Pennsylvania kitchen, Joann Leonard makes soup. In her grandfather's pot, she improvises, using her great-grandmother's unwritten recipe. As she does, amid the fragrant steam rising from the pot comes a stream of memories, half-told tales, and departed ancestors asking that their stories be told. And what stories they are: of the six strong Axelrood brothers and their families terrorized by Cossacks in their Eastern European village; of a man hiding twenty-eight days under a barn floor to avoid being murdered; of a tiny girl left with others for safety in the flight from savagery and lost for twelve long years; and of new lives made from old in America, \\"the Golden Land.\\" As Joann Leonard adds each story to her pot, she creates a rich and universal soup to nourish us all: the story of a woman putting together the fragmented pieces of her own life and recognizing the power of her own Jewish heritage. What she discovers within her cookpot are the extraordinary endurance, remarkable bravery, and lusty humor of her forebears and the joy of an undying legacy of faith that is the greatest gift she has been given--a gift she has been entrusted to pass along to her two adult sons. These pages invite us all to share in this life-giving food. In a nation where most people's roots lie in faraway lands, The Soup Has Many Eyes is a rich, poetic, deeply satisfying testament to the importance of family bonds, spiritual insight, and--most of all--the miracle that happens when we invite the past into our lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dCSegTP-9XgC&dq=The+Soup+Has+Many+Eyes:+From+Shtetl+to+Chicago+-+One+Family%27s+Journey+Through+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Drood case","description":"Five studies on Dicken's \\"Edwin Drood.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CM4EAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Drood+case&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Powdered Peas and Other Blessings","description":"Casa Materna was founded in Naples, Italy, in 1905 by Pastor Riccardo Santi.

This view was fostered by a wide range of literary, political, and business leaders, including Pearl S. Buck, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wendell Willkie, Joseph Stillwell, Claire Chennault, and most notably, the powerful publisher of Life and Time, Henry R. Luce. This book shows how the notion of the Chinese as aspiring Americans helped shape American opinions and policies toward Asia for almost twenty years. This notion derived less from the reality of Chinese historical or cultural similarities than from a projection of American values and culture; in the American view, fueled by various political, economic, and religious interests, China was less a geographical entity than a symbol of American hopes and fears. One of the more important consequences was the idealization of China and the demonization of Japan.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zZyXI2npmbQC&dq=American+Images+of+China,+1931-1949&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real Presence","description":"Most Catholics don't believe that Jesus is really present in the Eucharist. Rather, they see the bread and wine of Holy Communion as mere symbols of Christ's body and blood. Is that disbelief just a misunderstanding or is it a blatant rejection of one of the central beliefs of the faith? In Real Presence, University of Notre Dame theologian Timothy P. O'Malley clears up the confusion and shows you how to learn to love God and neighbor through a deeper understanding of the doctrine of real presence. A 2019 study by the Pew Research Center found that almost seventy percent of Catholics don't believe that Jesus is really present in the Eucharist. O'Malley offers a concise introduction to Catholic teaching on real presence and transubstantiation through a biblical, theological, and spiritual account of these doctrines from the early Church to today. He also explores how real presence enables us to see the vulnerability of human life and the dignity of all flesh and blood. O'Malley leads you to a deeper understanding and renewed faith in Catholic teaching about transubstantiation and real presence by helping you learn how the doctrine of real presence is rooted in divine revelation and how the Church's teaching regarding transubstantiation is spiritually fruitful for the believer today; how to make your own the doctrine of real presence by worshipping Christ in the Eucharist and therefore making a real assent to real presence; how the Eucharist, although not the exclusive presence of Christ in the Church's liturgy and mission, is crucial in growing our capacity for recognizing those other presences; and the important relationship between Eucharistic communion and adoration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6a0bzgEACAAJ&dq=Real+Presence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crooked Hinge","description":"Banished from the idyllic English countryside he once called home and en route to live with his cousin in America, Sir John Farnleigh, black sheep of the wealthy Farnleigh clan, nearly perished in the sinking of the Titanic.

But another  Sir John  soon follows, an unexpected man who insists he has absolute proof of his identity and of his claim to the estate.

In this book, Deborah Gorham focuses on Vera Brittain's struggles and achievements as a feminist.

But it also includes our positive, untapped potential qualities we may admire in others but disavow in ourselves. Befriending the shadow makes fear an ally and enables us to live more authentically. It also automatically improves our interpersonal relationships, because we are freed from the need to project our own negativity onto others, and we become more acutely aware when theirs is projected onto us. David Richo looks for where the shadow manifests in personal life, family interaction, religion, relationship, and the world around is. He shows how to use the gentle practice of mindfulness to work with our shadow side, and he provides numerous exercises for going deeper. He is remarkably skillful at making the shadow concept not only easy to understand, but supremely practical for enhancing the quality of our lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gy_5m7lSMk8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lucifer's Hammer","description":"The gigantic comet had slammed into Earth, forging earthquakes a thousand times too powerful to measure on the Richter scale, tidal waves thousands of feet high.

Beyond traditional threats from states such as China and Russia and non-state actors employing violent extremism, can America s politics and political system withstand the assaults of the Fifth Horseman and the new MAD, Massive Attacks of Disruption? The Covid-19 pandemic, the January 6 insurrection and takeover of the US Capitol, SolarWinds cyber attacks, the Texas storms that cut power, and the blocking of the Suez Canal are harbingers of the new MAD. And the nation is unaware and unprepared to deal with them. What must be done? First, we must recognize the potentially existential dangers posed by MAD. Second, we must reorganize government to meet these dangers. Third, we need new national security strategies to protect, defend, and mitigate these new threats. Fourth, we must create a private-public partnership in a national re-investment fund that can redress many of the risks of MAD.

Twenty years later, no one has emerged to contradict that judgment, and the book has gained recognition as a classic. As the San Francisco Examiner noted,  It is not often that a work of history can be said to supplant every book on the same subject that has gone before it.  Through the diary and letters of William Swain--augmented by interpolations from more than five hundred other gold seekers and by letters sent to Swain from his wife and brother back home--the complete cycle of the gold rush is recreated: the overland migration of over thirty thousand men, the struggle to  strike it rich  in the mining camps of the Sierra Nevadas, and the return home through the jungles of the Isthmus of Panama. In a new preface, the author reappraises our continuing fascination with the  gold rush experience  as a defining epoch in western--indeed, American--history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1cVgBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Social Movements: Identity, Culture, and the State","description":"\\"Why do social movements take the forms they do?

Unlike his contemporaries, he is remembered for his negotiating and peacekeeping skills rather than for any historic deed on the battlefield. Most who knew Ouray considered him to be a very extraordinary Indian--a man of keen perceptions and a talented diplomat. But probably no other Indian chief was as enigmatic. Although most of his tribe were prepared to die for him, his own brother-in-law tried to kill him. He was chief of the Ute Nation, but he was neither a full-blooded Ute nor a chief elected by his own people--he was half Apache and was appointed chief by the U.S. government. In spite of high praises given him by various luminaries of his day, many insisted that Ouray was ordinary, at best. He was a tough and tenacious negotiator for his people, but he was also a friend of the whites and realized that if the Utes did not submit they would be destroyed. This book explores Ouray's life and his people but makes no judgments. It lets the reader decide what historic status to accord this famous chief.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JBZnzgEACAAJ&dq=Ouray:+Chief+of+the+Utes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tiger!

She is seven; he is fifty-one. When Peter invites her and her mother to his house, the little girl finds a child's paradise of exotic pets and an elaborate backyard garden. Her mother, beset by mental illness and overwhelmed by caring for Margaux, is grateful for the attention Peter lavishes on her, and he creates an imaginative universe for her, much as Lewis Carroll did for his real-life Alice. In time, he insidiously takes on the role of Margaux's playmate, father, and lover. Charming and manipulative, Peter burrows into every aspect of Margaux's life and transforms her from a child fizzing with imagination and affection into a brainwashed young woman on the verge of suicide. But when she is twenty-two, it is Peter ill, and wracked with guilt who kills himself, at the age of sixty-six. Told with lyricism, depth, and mesmerizing clarity, Tiger, Tiger vividly illustrates the healing power of memory and disclosure.

Many diverse factors have combined to weaken its structure in American society: the conflicting needs and schedules of dual working parents; the ongoing fragmentation of our civic, cultural, and religious communities; the prevalence of divorce and remarriage; the advent of technological distractions like video games and computers. What was once a strong, cohesive unit has become, in many cases, no more than a loose grouping of individuals with individual timetables and agendas. However, now more that ever before, we have the freedom to shape the kind of family we want, rather that an obligation to conform to inflexible concepts of what a family should be. Nationally respected family therapist William J. Doherty believes that we can strengthen the ties that bind us together-and create new, more permanent ones in the process-through the use of family-specific everyday rituals. The Intentional Family -- a practical guide to avoiding conflicts and promoting understanding -- offers a myriad of simple yet effective methods for opening regular channels of communication between parents and their children, husbands and wives: from shared family meals and vacations, to regular \\"storytime,\\" weekly drives, religious services, and monthly \\"spouse only\\" romantic dinners. Clearly presented and engagingly written, here are proven and indispensable strategies for reviving a lost sense of family -- useful guidelines that will help us make the most of our most important relationships.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tXPtHAAACAAJ&dq=The+Intentional+Family:+How+to+Build+Family+Ties+in+Our+Modern+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saturn S-Series: 1991 Thru 2002- All Models (Haynes Repair Manual)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J7LfAAAAMAAJ&dq=Saturn+S-Series:+1991+Thru+2002-+All+Models+(Haynes+Repair+Manual)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hunger of Memory","description":"Hunger of Memory is the story of Mexican-American Richard Rodriguez, who begins his schooling in Sacramento, California, knowing just 50 words of English, and concludes his university studies in the stately quiet of the reading room of the British Museum.

By 1920 such health seekers represented an estimated 10 percent of New Mexico s population. The influx of  lungers  as they were called many of whom remained in New Mexico would play a critical role in New Mexico s struggle for statehood and in its growth. Nearly sixty sanatoriums were established around the state, laying the groundwork for the state s current health-care system. Among New Mexico s prominent lungers were artists Will Shuster and Carlos Vierra, who  came to heal and stayed to paint.  Bronson Cutting, brought to Santa Fe on a stretcher in 1910, became the influential publisher of the Santa Fe New Mexican and a powerful U.S Senator. Others included William R. Lovelace and Edgar T. Lassetter, founders of the Lovelace Clinic, as well as Senator Clinton P. Anderson, poet Alice Corbin Henderson, architect John Gaw Meem, aviator Katherine Stinson, and Dorothy McKibben, gatekeeper for the Manhattan Project.

This monumental work uses demographic, voting, and other statistical analysis as well as the more traditional methods and sources of political history to trace the realignment of American politics in the 1850s and the birth of the Republican party. Gienapp powerfully demonstrates that the organization of the Republican party was a difficult, complex, and lengthy process and explains why, even after an inauspicious beginning, it ultimately became a potent political force. The study also reveals the crucial role of ethnocultural factors in the collapse of the second party system and thoroughly analyzes the struggle between nativism and antislavery for political dominance in the North.

For most of us, cars rank second only to houses in terms of major life expenses. A car is a statement of independence, a symbol of social status or financial success, a way to get from point A to B. First and foremost though, a car is a significant investment. So it only makes sense that car owners should want to protect their investments and make sure that they get the most mileage a  figuratively and literallya out of their cars. In Clueless About Cars Lisa Christensen, licensed mechanic and diagnostic specialist, helps those new to the car game and seasoned pros alike become familiar with their vehicles and learn how to care for them. In simple, informative and often hilarious language, Christensen acquaints readers with the fundamental systems of the car. She covers the basics of preventative maintenance and offers advice on how to make a preliminary diagnosis when something goes wrong (and it always does!). She also provides tips to help car owners talk to their mechanic, how to diagnose a car\`s tics, tocs, and knocks and how to perform basic do-it-yourself repairs.

It asks a simple question: how do Asian societies maintain their cultural uniqueness in the face of Western cultural, economic and military power, in the face of globalisation? In the wake of the regional economic crisis, Sheridan examines lives and societies in stress and transition. He draws on hundreds of interviews across Asia and the United States, from Presidents and Prime Ministers to beggars and housewives, from civil servants and traders to politicians and prostitutes. He challenges popular interpretations from Western gurus such as Sam Huntington, Francis Fukuyama and former Hong Kong governor, Chris Patten. Instead Sheridan chases Asian Values down the houtungs (lane ways) of Beijing and across the kampungs of Malaysia, into the old colonial cities of India and out to the smallest village in the Philippines countryside. He draws on a wide range of scholarship and twenty years experience working in the region to offer an ambitious, region-wide interpretation of the Asian Values debate. A mixture of travel writing and cultural and political analysis, Asian Values, Western Dreams offers insights into relations between Asian nations, as well as between Asia and the West. Whether for the executive or student, the Western traveller or the Asian reader interested in learning about their neighbours, Asian Values, Western Dreams is an indispensable guide to the new Asia.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PqYyfxnuy3oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World of Thrush Green","description":"Reveals the real Thrush Green behind the author's fictional English village, the setting for her popular novels, in a combination of memoirs, sketches of characters real and imaged, and scenes from her books.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fY0OAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+World+of+Thrush+Green&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lethal Wind","description":"Harry Boggs is the man to see about cocaine.

In particular the author is dissatisfied with the interpretation of the miracles that such theology can give. In his submission, a theology which acknowledges, and then fails to take account of, or strips away altogether, the demonological thought-world into which the miracle stories are woven, results in only a partial estimate of their significance. Here the miracles are restored to their context, seen in perspective as historical happenings, and considered in relation to Jesus central theme of the Kingdom. In this book, written a half century ago, Kallas flew full force into the face of the prevailing way of interpreting the New Testament. While scholarship as a whole was convinced that the New Testament had to be modernized, stripped of its archaic and medieval language or the church would lose it audience, Kallas argued in the opposite direction, insisting that while a rewrite of the New Testament would salvage our audience, we would have nothing to tell them for the gospel would have been emasculated. Fifty years of flaccid flawed pap has proven him right and has demanded a reprint of this his first book. James Kallas has had an extraordinary life. A veteran of the U.S. Navy at age 14, later one of St. Olaf College s greatest athletes, A Phi Beta Kappa key winner, a Fulbright and Rockefeller Scholar, a private pilot; and a former pro football player with the Chicago Bears. He was on the founding faculty of California Lutheran College (now University), and went on to be President of Dana College in Blair NE.

Based on a diary kept throughout his tour of duty, the author's personal account of the conflict illustrates what it was like for a 'part-timer' to fight alongside the regular army. Weekend Warrior chronicles the difficulties and traumas Mervin and his colleagues endured while carrying out their work, including situations in which they literally had to fight for their lives. The author also describes how he and his companions dealt with the horrific sights, sounds and realities of war. Thrust unexpectedly into the middle of a dangerous conflict, Mervin's memoirs relate not only the fear and excitement he experienced but also his sadness at the scenes of poverty he witnessed and his anger towards the media, which, he feels, reported the conflict to the world with an anti-war bias. On his return home, Mervin faced further challenges when he lost his job because of his call-up and he also received criticism from an often hostile public. Weekend Warrior paints a startlingly vivid picture of fear and confusion on the front line and highlights the problems faced by those lucky enough to return home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TzdNxx08kAgC&dq=Weekend+Warrior:+A+Territorial+Soldier%27s+War+in+Iraq&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In memoriam [A.H.H.] (Golden treasury series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IYPsSAAACAAJ&dq=In+memoriam+%5BA.H.H.%5D+(Golden+treasury+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to conquer suffering without doctors","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gIuLW4qVeR0C&dq=How+to+conquer+suffering+without+doctors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roger Zelazny's To Rule in Amber (New Amber Trilogy)","description":"As Oberon takes up the reins of leadership to build a new empire on the foundations of that laid by his father, he confronts a host of challenges as he deals with old and new enemies, political intrigue, power-mad siblings, assassins, a mad father, and the King of Chaos.

The resulting instability of the government alarmed the Soviet Union which began to apply pressure on the government to replace all westerners with Soviet workers. Consequently, many foreign aid projects fell by the wayside. This is an insider view of Afghanistan at a formative period of its history and gives background to understand today's rule by the fundamentalist sect, the Taliban. Stratton mixes humor with frustration as she meets inflexible male Afghan attitudes toward women, particularly the male servants in their home, as well as how foreigners seek to create a slice of home in alien circumstances. Gathering around the pool to trade rumors following the coup, learning one's telephone is tapped, mixed signals between cultures, having a servant threaten to kill for one for his having been fired. All these and more give the reader insight into living abroad in a third world country. Stratton and a female friend risked the hostile elements to travel around the country on their own, in an unreliable car that put them in peril more than once. They lived through their experiences...perhaps by Grace extended to na?ve fools.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w-HnwAEACAAJ&dq=Guests+in+the+Land+of+Buzkashi:+Afghanistan+Revisited&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sukhoi Su-27 (Famous Russian Aircraft)","description":"The Sukhoi Design Bureau was tasked in 1969 with developing a fourth-generation heavy fighter and thus began the story of the Su-27, known to the western world as the Flanker--an aircraft which turned out to be one of the most successful Soviet fighter designs. This book tells the story of how the original project developed, how the final configuration of what was known as the T-10 was selected and why the brave decision to scrap the original project and rework it as the T-10S was taken, a decision that proved to be justified. The book covers the design and testing of the prototypes in both configurations, the production entry of the basic Su-27 single-seat fighter and the Su-27UB two-seat combat trainer together with the efforts of Sukhoi to keep them up to date with mid-life upgrades to Generation 4++' (Su-35S) level. The operational histories of Su-27 versions including the Su-30/Su-34/Su-35 are also described. When the Soviet Navy decided to bolster its fleet with carriers optimized for conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) aircraft, Sukhoi responded by developing the Su-27K, which later entered service as the Su-33, Russia's first operational CTOL shipboard fighter. These naval variants are included in the book as is a chapter describing the story of how China purchased license manufacturing rights for the Su-27 and went on to develop its own versions with indigenous avionics and weapons, including the basic J-11 fighter and the J-15 Flying Shark--a clone of the Su-33. The post-Soviet republics included, the Su-27/Su-30/Su-34/Su-35 family has seen service with nearly 20 nations, including places as far apart as Vietnam, Malaysia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Angola, India and Venezuela. The book describes in depth the development and operational career of the Su-27 family, including mid-life upgrades and the latest variants, and features detailed fleet lists. Richly illustrated with color photographs, line drawings and color profiles of the various color schemes carried by the type, this is the definitive work on a truly outstanding aircraft.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VRGCtAEACAAJ&dq=Sukhoi+Su-27+(Famous+Russian+Aircraft)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sometimes Form Sometimes Vessel: A Collection Of Poetry","description":"Four separate generations of nameless characters struggle for redemption, love, and peace in a lyrically weaved collection of stories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Zxw2LwEACAAJ&dq=Sometimes+Form+Sometimes+Vessel:+A+Collection+Of+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marvel Masterworks: Fantastic Four Vol. 4","description":"Hulk, Dr. Strange, Sub-Mariner, Valkyrie and Nighthawk join up with Luke Cage, Daredevil and Son of Satan to take on the likes of the Wrecking Crew, Satannish and Asmodeus.

To what extent, I wondered, could a person's memory be shaped by suggestion? When people witness a serious automobile accident, how accurate is their recollection of the facts? If a witness is questioned by a police officer, will the manner of questioning alter the representation of the memory? Can memories be supplemented with additional, false information?\\" The \\"passion\\" Loftus describes in the lines above led her to a teaching career at the University of Washington and, perhaps more importantly, into hundreds of courtrooms as an expert witness on the fallibility of eyewitness accounts.

So, with her sister and her sister's rapidly growing unborn child in mind, Currin set out to translate the complex stages of growth she learned about during medical school courses into a compilation of fun, interesting, and scientifically sound information that expectant parents can understand. Now she's making Before Birth available to everyone. Organized according to the forty-week model of pregnancy, Currin uses clear language and colorful illustrations to convey the complex mystery of fetal development to audiences unfamiliar with or daunted by medical terminology.

A country beset by conflict in its region and faced with the need to integrate immigrants of disparate backgrounds into a modern and advanced state, Israel has preoccupied observers, scholars, and journalists since its independence in 1948. Israel and its politics have been the subject of substantial and often highly partisan literature, being hotly and vigorously debated both at home and abroad. The second edition of the Historical Dictionary of Israel addresses the need in the literature on Israel for a comprehensive impartial information source about the various diplomatic and political personalities, institutions, organizations, events, concepts, and documents that together define the political life of the Jewish state. This is done through a chronology, an introductory essay, a bibliography, and hundreds of cross-referenced dictionary entries on significant persons, places, events, government institutions, political parties, and battles, as well as entries on Israel's economy, society, and culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mf-xAAAAQBAJ&dq=Political+Dictionary+of+Israel+(Historical+Dictionaries+of+Asia,+Oceania,+and+the+Middle+East)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mastering German Vocabulary: A Practical Guide to Troublesome Words","description":"How often have you looked up an English word in a German dictionary only to be confronted by a bewildering array of German equivalents?

(Rev. 1:3). Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book. (Rev. 22:7). The author of the book of the revelation is Jesus Christ (Rev. 22:16). The Lord intended that this book should be read and studied especially by His people (Rev. 1:3). It is not a sealed book, as many suppose, but one which is open and easy to understand (Rev. 22:10). Bearing these facts in mind, we find the study of Revelation to be fascinating, illuminating and deeply profitable, instead of difficult and confusing. The messages in this volume constitute thirty-five radio sermons which were preached first over the Mutual Network and by foreign and short-wave stations around the world, from August, 1945, to April, 1946. The response to these radio messages was so enthusiastic and the evident desire for light on the book of the Revelation so general that we soon decided to print these studies on one volume. Hence this book. No attempt has been made to present an exhaustive verse-by-verse exposition of the book, but, rather, we have tried to present the general outline, the basic structure and the framework. We have dwelt at length on certain passages because they constitute the pillars of the book. Our purpose is to present clearly the general outline and structure, and then the details will fall naturally into their proper places. If certain simple rules are followed in reading and studying it, the book of the Revelation becomes clear, logical and easily understood. We present here a few rules which should be observed before studying the book: 1. Revelation is not a dark book. It is a revelation. 2. It is not necessary for one to understand all the symbols and details if he is to gain a deeper knowledge of the book as a whole. One need not be able to identify every tree in the forest to appreciate the beauty of the forest as a whole. 3. Observe the rule of literal interpretation. The greatest curse of the Christian Church is the evil of spiritualizing the Bible. Although there are many symbols and signs in the book, as in every other book and in our daily conversation, the context indicates whether a passage is to be interpreted literally or symbolically. Interpret literally, except where the context or grammatical structure clearly indicates that the reference is a symbol or a sign. 4. Approach the Book with a  fresh  mind. Try to forget the views you have held concerning the Book because others have declared it to be mysterious and beyond our understanding. Thousands of believers never read Revelation, but carefully avoid it simply because someone told them it is a dark book and impossible to understand. Study the book for yourself. 5. Read the book prayerfully, realizing that the Holy Spirit who infallibly inspired the book is also the person Who must illuminate the book. Never read a portion of scripture without first asking Him for light and guidance. We submit for your help the following simple outline of Revelation. Remember these five rules as you study it. If you will memorize the outline thoroughly, and keep it clearly before your mind, you will have no trouble filling in the details. Grand Rapids, Michigan M. R.

Two women kidnapped by infamous Cleveland school-bus driver Ariel Castro share the stories of their abductions, captivity, and dramatic escape On May 6, 2013, Amanda Berry made headlines around the world when she fled a Cleveland home and called 911, saying:  Help me, I m Amanda Berry. . . . I ve been kidnapped, and I ve been missing for ten years.  A horrifying story rapidly unfolded. Ariel Castro, a local school bus driver, had separately lured Berry, Gina DeJesus, and Michelle Knight to his home, where he kept them chained. In the decade that followed, the three were raped, psychologically abused, and threatened with death. Berry had a daughter Jocelyn by their captor. Drawing upon their recollections and the diary kept by Amanda Berry, Berry and Gina DeJesus describe a tale of unimaginable torment, and Pulitzer Prizewinning Washington Post reporters Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan interweave the events within Castro s house with original reporting on efforts to find the missing girls.

This book is based on an honors course in advanced calculus that the authors gave in the 1960's. The foundational material, presented in the unstarred sections of Chapters 1 through 11, was normally covered, but different applications of this basic material were stressed from year to year, and the book therefore contains more material than was covered in any one year. It can accordingly be used (with omissions) as a text for a year's course in advanced calculus, or as a text for a three-semester introduction to analysis. The prerequisites are a good grounding in the calculus of one variable from a mathematically rigorous point of view, together with some acquaintance with linear algebra. The reader should be familiar with limit and continuity type arguments and have a certain amount of mathematical sophistication. As possible introductory texts, we mention Differential and Integral Calculus by R Courant, Calculus by T Apostol, Calculus by M Spivak, and Pure Mathematics by G Hardy. The reader should also have some experience with partial derivatives. In overall plan the book divides roughly into a first half which develops the calculus (principally the differential calculus) in the setting of normed vector spaces, and a second half which deals with the calculus of differentiable manifolds.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDA8DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robert et Collins Senior: Dictionnaire Francais - Anglais et Anglais - Francais (CD-ROM inclus) / Collins Robert French to English and English to French Dictionary with CD-ROM","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6ltxzgEACAAJ&dq=Robert+et+Collins+Senior:+Dictionnaire+Francais+-+Anglais+et+Anglais+-+Francais+(CD-ROM+inclus)+/+Collins+Robert+French+to+English+and+English+to+French+Dictionary+with+CD-ROM&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The book of Job: The oldest lesson in the world : a new translation","description":"One of the most respected Bible scholars of the 19th century, British clergyman ETHELBERT WILLIAM BULLINGER (1837-1913) here offers his perspective on the Book of Job, with an interpretation focused on appreciating the mysteries of God's ways and a translation that pays close attention to rendering the meaning of the original Hebrew as fully as possible.

Like many other peoples throughout history who have bristled under the controlling hand of a remote government, westerners have long nursed a deep resentment toward our nation's capital. Rumblings of revolution have stirred for decades, bolstered in recent years by increasing evidence of the impossibility of a distant, centralized government successfully managing the West's widespread and far-flung lands.In This Sovereign Land, Daniel Kemmis offers a radical new proposal for giving the West control over its land. Unlike those who wish to privatize the public lands and let market forces decide their fate, Kemmis, a leading western Democrat and committed environmentalist, argues for keeping the public lands public, but for shifting jurisdiction over them from nation to region. In place of the current centralized management, he offers a regional approach that takes into account natural topographical and ecological features, and brings together local residents with a vested interest in ensuring the sustainability of their communities. In effect, Kemmis carries to their logical conclusion the recommendations about how the West should be governed made by John Wesley Powell more than a century ago.Throughout, Kemmis argues that the West no longer needs to be protected against itself by a paternalistic system and makes a compelling case that the time has come for the region to claim sovereignty over its own landscape. This Sovereign Land provides a provocative opening to a much-needed discussion about how democracy and ecological sustainability can go hand in hand, and will be essential reading for anyone interested in the West and western issues, as well as for all those concerned with place-based conservation, public lands management, bioregionalism, or related topics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9qvQjhquKOcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Songs for Pickin' and Singin'","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zlbluQAACAAJ&dq=Songs+for+Pickin%27+and+Singin%27&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Serbocroatian-Eng Dict CB","description":"Horace G. Danner s A Thesaurus of English Word Roots is a compendium of the most-used word roots of the English language. As Timothy B. Noone notes in his foreword:  Dr. Danner s book allows you not only to build up your passive English vocabulary, resulting in word recognition knowledge, but also gives you the rudiments for developing your active English vocabulary, making it possible to infer the meaning of words with which you are not yet acquainted. Your knowledge can now expand and will do so exponentially as your awareness of the roots in English words and your corresponding ability to decode unfamiliar words grows apace. This is the beginning of a fine mental linguistic library: so enjoy!  In A Thesaurus of English Word Roots, all word roots are listed alphabetically, along with the Greek or Latin words from which they derive, together with the roots  original meanings. If the current meaning of an individual root differs from the original meaning, that is listed in a separate column. In the examples column, the words which contain the root are then listed, starting with their prefixes, for example, dysacousia, hyperacousia. These root-starting terms then are followed by terms where the root falls behind the word, e.g., acouesthesia and acoumeter. These words are followed by words where the root falls in the middle or the end, as in such terms as bradyacusia and odynacusis.. In this manner, A Thesaurus of English Word Roots places the word in as many word families as there are elements in the word. This work will interest linguists and philologists and anyone interested in the etymological aspects of English language.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CSxEAwAAQBAJ&dq=Serbocroatian-Eng+Dict+CB&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reflections on the Jesus Prayer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LdUzAAAACAAJ&dq=Reflections+on+the+Jesus+Prayer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Budo SECRETS: Teachings of the Martial Arts Masters","description":"In budo which can be translated as \\"the way of brave and enlightened activity\\" martial arts and spirituality merge at the highest level of skill.

Their advanced knowledge of science, mathematics, and astronomy was passed on to descendants who escaped to Egypt and South America. From Atlantis to the Sphinx bases this assertion on a true fact: that archaeologists and geologists are at odds over the age of the Sphinx. Archaeologists claim that the Sphinx dates to classical dynastic Egypt, around 2,400 b.c. But some geologists claim that it could have been built as early as 7,000 to 10,500 b.c. The geologists' claim is based on the curious fact that the erosion of the Sphinx is more characteristic of water erosion than that of wind and sand. Starting from the assumption that there was an advanced civilization in existence much earlier than previously thought, Wilson goes on to claim that it could very well be Atlantis--not a literal island that sank, but more of a great civilization that either declined naturally or experienced a great catastrophe, passing on only a fraction of its knowledge to other peoples. From Atlantis to the Sphinx delves into what might have been a completely different knowledge system from that of modern man--one as alien to us as that of the Martians. The book sets out to reconstruct that ancient knowledge in a fascinating exploration of the remote depths of history, a ground-breaking attempt to understand how these long-forgotten peoples thought, felt, and communicated with the universe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nHSJhcOmeSQC&dq=From+Atlantis+to+the+Sphinx&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wildflowers of Vermont","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cbHzZwEACAAJ&dq=Wildflowers+of+Vermont&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angels' Visits: An Inquiry into the Mystery of Zinfandel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rtI8kgEACAAJ&dq=Angels%27+Visits:+An+Inquiry+into+the+Mystery+of+Zinfandel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sewers of Warsaw","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TDYzGQAACAAJ&dq=Sewers+of+Warsaw&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hannah's Garden","description":"Step into the Victorian Era, Turn -of- the- Century time period with every turn of the page in this inspirational, Christian, love story!

The Last Green Valley is a compelling and inspiring story of heroism and courage in the dark days at the end of World War II.\\" --Kristin Hannah, #1 New York Times bestselling author From the author of the #1 bestseller Beneath a Scarlet Sky comes a new historical novel inspired by one family's incredible story of daring, survival, and triumph. In late March 1944, as Stalin's forces push into Ukraine, young Emil and Adeline Martel must make a terrible decision: Do they wait for the Soviet bear's intrusion and risk being sent to Siberia? Or do they reluctantly follow the wolves--murderous Nazi officers who have pledged to protect \\"pure-blood\\" Germans? The Martels are one of many families of German heritage whose ancestors have farmed in Ukraine for more than a century. But after already living under Stalin's horrifying regime, Emil and Adeline decide they must run in retreat from their land with the wolves they despise to escape the Soviets and go in search of freedom. Caught between two warring forces and overcoming horrific trials to pursue their hope of immigrating to the West, the Martels' story is a brutal, complex, and ultimately triumphant tale that illuminates the extraordinary power of love, faith, and one family's incredible will to survive and see their dreams realized.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DzCbzQEACAAJ&dq=green+valley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saviors of the Bugle","description":"Led by a classmate, middle school students try to save their town's newspaper.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h5WWzZvfwQwC&dq=Saviors+of+the+Bugle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead Stick (New Alaskan Murder Mystery)","description":"Taylor Morgan of Alaska's LifeLine Air Ambulance force faces down threats and danger as she turns sleuth to investigate the fatal crash of Erica Wolverton, a fellow female pilot.

It is an intense and compelling drama based on the true story of the Carmelite nuns at Compeigne beheaded during the last few days of the Revolution, but also encompassing the Paris mob, the Reign of Terror, women revolutionists, etc., climaxing in the heroic martyrdom of sixteen Carmelites. This story unfolds around Blanche de la Force, who enters the Carmelite convent amid the horror of the French Revolution. Blanche is so timorous that she seems unsuited to the rigors of religious life even at the best of times - and badly misplaced as the Reign of Terror begins to stain France with the blood of martyrs. Sister Marie, one of the leading nuns in the convent, receives with joy the death threats of the revolutionaries: the sisters are going to be awarded the crown of Christian martyrdom! Sister Marie prepares the other nuns for this fearsome sacrifice, all the while harboring doubts about Blanches ability and willingness to join them in dying for Christ. Blanches life thereafter and the story of the nuns take several unexpected twists, leaving you not only with the inspiring, true witness of their martyrdom, but also with a penetrating insight into the nature of holiness. As our world is engulfed anew in terror and hatred for the Christian faith, The Song at the Scaffold will inspire us with a renewed and fervent love for God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0WnmuYk4pAoC&dq=The+song+at+the+scaffold,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"There Came a Stranger","description":"Chad Walker doesn't give a hoot about anyone in Pinto, Texas.

In The Little Book of Big Change, psychologist Amy Johnson shows you how to rewire your brain and overcome your bad habits once and for all. No matter what your bad habit is, you have the power to change it. Drawing on a powerful combination of neuroscience and spirituality, this book will show you that you are not your habits. Rather, your habits and addictions are the result of simple brain wiring that is easily reversed. By learning to stop bad habits at the source, you will take charge of your habits and addictions for good. Anything done repeatedly has the potential to form neural circuitry in the brain. In this light, habits and addictions are impersonal brain wiring problems that result from taking your habitual thinking as truth, and acting on that thinking in the form of doing your habit over and over. This book offers a number of small changes you can make in your everyday life that will help you stop your bad habit in its tracks. If you want to understand the science behind your habit, make the decision to end it, and commit to real, lasting change, this book will help you to finally take charge of your life once and for all.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KWFBCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The children of Odin: The book of northern myths","description":"From master storyteller Padriac Colum, winner of a Newbery Honor for The Golden Fleece, comes a collection of fifteen timeless tales inspired by Norse mythology.

McLean had only served seven years of his twenty-eight-year sentence he received following a 1996 sting operation off the Caithness coast in which a Customs officer lost his life. Despite being described as one of the most ruthless and important figures on the country's drug scene, McLean had found his security status downgraded from Category A to D and had been transferred to HMP Leyhill, an open prison which had seen 82 prisoners escape in 2002 alone. Shortly after the media had accused the security services of helping him to escape, McLean was found  dead. But not only did it take the Metropolitan Police 29 days to make the news public, it also took them that long to inform Avon and Somerset - the very police force who were still trying to recapture him. Why? Who was McLean and what made him so important? So important, in fact, that the Home Secretary, David Blunkett, had been compelled to order a report into his disappearance, much of which remains secret to this day. Cut-Throat is a truly unique account of Rod McLean's life and death, told in the first person using material from McLean's own hand. Whether as a mercenary in the Congo, an armed robber in Newcastle or as an international drug-smuggler and gun-runner who operated where few others have dared, McLean will take you through his life as he struggles against the darkest realms of humanity and himself until the very end, an end which overshadows the greatest secret of all  not of how he died, but of how he lived.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-mPbM_YdpaYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oxford Picture Dictionary: English-Vietnamese Editon (The Oxford Picture Dictionary Program)","description":"Vibrant, realistic illustrations and unparalleled teaching support make the Oxford Picture Dictionary Program what every classroom needs to build students' vocabulary, reading, and critical thinking skills.Help your students picture their journey to success with the Oxford Picture Dictionary Third Edition - now enhanced with new topics to prepare learners for work, academic study, and citizenship.* Increase vocabulary retention with over 4,000 words, 421 verbs and practice activities - available as an American English dictionary or in 5 bilingual editions (Arabic, Chinese, French, Spanish and Vietnamese).* Prepare students to meet the requirements of their daily lives with updated content including Job Search, Career Planning and Digital Literacy.* Access everything you need for a successful classroom from the online Teacher Resource Center - giving you more time to focus on teaching!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6fPmjwEACAAJ&dq=The+Oxford+Picture+Dictionary:+English-Vietnamese+Editon+(The+Oxford+Picture+Dictionary+Program)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The child's world first reader","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vPUAAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Around Auburn, NY","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K2rPswEACAAJ&dq=Around+Auburn,+NY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Kentucky Rifle Hunting Pouch","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JseaNAAACAAJ&dq=The+Kentucky+Rifle+Hunting+Pouch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bastiat's \\"The Law\\" (Occasional Paper, 123)","description":"In this new condensed version of his masterpiece, Capitalism, Arthur Seldon explains why, despite its apparent imperfections, the market system is infinitely preferable to the alternatives. The market system has, since the eighteenth century, brought enormous gains in living standards, in contradiction to the Marxist theories that predicted capitalism's collapse. The institution of property rights has facilitated trade and investment, whilst the price mechanism has enabled people to benefit from dispersed knowledge about individual preferences. Yet politicians, needing to win votes in the short-term, have largely failed to recognise the benefits of a market system with the minimum of government intervention. The development of the welfare state has been disastrous, almost destroying the voluntary provision of health and education, whilst creating institutions that serve producer interests at the expense of consumers. Seldon's message is clear; if capitalism is to yield its best results the political process must be confined to the minimal duties of the state. This condensed version of Capitalism includes a foreword by the late Milton Friedman, an introduction by John Blundell and Philip Booth, and commentaries by James Bartholomew and D.R. Myddelton.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yrgJd9gAiZMC&dq=Bastiat%27s+%22The+Law%22+(Occasional+Paper,+123)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black is the Fashion for Dying","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q13vPQAACAAJ&dq=Black+is+the+Fashion+for+Dying&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Undeserving","description":"The Undeserving Poor is a history of the ideas that underlie America's enduring confrontation with poverty.

Now Brooks turns to the building blocks of human flourishing in a multilayered, profoundly illuminating work grounded in everyday life. This is the story of how success happens, told through the lives of one composite American couple, Harold and Erica. Drawing on a wealth of current research from numerous disciplines, Brooks takes Harold and Erica from infancy to old age, illustrating a fundamental new understanding of human nature along the way: The unconscious mind, it turns out, is not a dark, vestigial place, but a creative one, where most of the brain s work gets done. This is the realm where character is formed and where our most important life decisions are made the natural habitat of The Social Animal. Brooks reveals the deeply social aspect of our minds and exposes the bias in modern culture that overemphasizes rationalism, individualism, and IQ. He demolishes conventional definitions of success and looks toward a culture based on trust and humility. The Social Animal is a moving intellectual adventure, a story of achievement and a defense of progress. It is an essential book for our time one that will have broad social impact and will change the way we see ourselves and the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lFJd2ZFp5LcC&dq=The+Social+Animal+(A+Series+of+books+in+psychology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Patriots: A Young People's Edition: The Story of Blacks in the Military from the Revolution to Desert Storm","description":"They fought on Lexington Green the first morning of the Revolution and survived the bitter cold winter at Valley Forge.

Comics have conquered America. From our multiplexes, where Marvel and DC movies reign supreme, to our television screens, where comics-based shows like The Walking Dead have become among the most popular in cable history, to convention halls, best-seller lists, Pulitzer Prizewinning titles, and MacArthur Fellowship recipients, comics shape American culture, in ways high and low, superficial, and deeply profound. In American Comics, Columbia professor Jeremy Dauber takes readers through their incredible but little-known history, starting with the Civil War and cartoonist Thomas Nast, creator of the lasting and iconic images of Uncle Sam and Santa Claus; the golden age of newspaper comic strips and the first great superhero boom; the moral panic of the Eisenhower era, the Marvel Comics revolution, and the underground comix movement of the 1960s and  70s; and finally into the twenty-first century, taking in the grim and gritty Dark Knights and Watchmen alongside the brilliant rise of the graphic novel by acclaimed practitioners like Art Spiegelman and Alison Bechdel. Dauber s story shows not only how comics have changed over the decades but how American politics and culture have changed them. Throughout, he describes the origins of beloved comics, champions neglected masterpieces, and argues that we can understand how America sees itself through whose stories comics tell. Striking and revelatory, American Comics is a rich chronicle of the last 150 years of American history through the lens of its comic strips, political cartoons, superheroes, graphic novels, and more.

She arrived in Kyoto, a city she had dreamed about but never seen, with two bags, an open-ended plane ticket, and the ability to speak only sushi-bar Japanese. She left a year later, having learned the language, the art of kaiseki, and what was truly important to her. Through special introductions and personal favors, Victoria was able to attend one of Kyoto s most prestigious tea schools, where this ago-old Japanese art has been preserved for generations and where she was taken under the wing of an American expatriate who became her mentor in the highly choreographed rituals of this extraordinary culinary discipline. During her year in Kyoto, Victoria explored the mysterious and rarefied world of tea kaiseki, living a life inaccessible to most foreigners. She also discovered the beguiling realm of modern-day Japanese food the restaurants, specialty shops, and supermarkets. She participated in many fast-disappearing culinary customs, including making mochi (chewy rice cakes) by hand, a beloved family ritual barely surviving in a mechanized age. She celebrated the annual cleansing rites of New Year s, donning an elaborate kimono and obi for a thirty-four-course extravaganza. She includes twenty-five recipes for favorite dishes she encountered, such as Chicken and Egg Rice Bowl, Japanese Beef and Vegetable Hotpot, and Green-Tea Cooked Salmon Over Rice. Untangling My Chopsticks is a sumptuous journey into the tastes, traditions, and exotic undercurrents of Japan. It is also a coming-of-age tale steeped in history and ancient customs, a thoughtful meditation on life, love, and learning in another land.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iEkTIdCgcCkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Planning and Managing Web Sites on the Macintosh: The Complete Guide to Webstar and Machttp","description":"Providing everything needed to set up and run a Web site on a Macintosh, a helpful resource covers site design, server configuration, and writing custom software, and the CD-ROM enables users to install and customize a fully functional site.

Harp on the Shore examines Thoreau's use of maritime metaphor. It shows how he, a writer ordinarily perceived as quintessentially landlocked, came to view the terrestrial world in terms of the oceanic. The book explores both the poetic and the philosophical implications of Thoreau's passion for the sea. Beginning with Thoreau's deep attachment to the sea and maritime life in New England and the ways in which that attachment stimulated his imaginative identification of Concord as a center of maritime activity, it examines the sea voyage as a symbol of man's intellectual processes. The book shows how maritime allusions enlarge the significance of Thoreau's ideas about man's struggle to attain individuality and identity, his notion of Homeric or Edenic man, and his belief in a middle ground where many could and should stand--between the natural and the civilized, the individual and the group.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oc0O9A2y15QC&dq=Harp+on+the+Shore:+Thoreau+and+the+Sea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Serbs: The Guardians of the Gate (History)","description":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Few people in the history of college sports have been more influential or had a bigger impact than Lou Holtz. Winner of the three national Coach of the Year honors, the only coach ever to lead six different schools to season-ending bowl games, and the ninth-winningest coach in college football history, Holtz is still teaching and coaching, although he is no longer on the gridiron. In his most telling work to date, the man still known as \\"Coach\\" by all who cross his path reveals what motivated a rail-thin 135-pound kid with marginal academic credentials and a pronounced speech impediment to play and coach college football, and to become one of the most sought-after motivational speakers in history.

In this engaging memoir, Fay Ajzenberg-Selove writes candidly about her difficult journey to international recognition in physics. She is frank about the ways being a woman has made a difference in her opportunities and choices as a scientist--and how, by being a woman, she has made a difference in the world of physics. Ajzenberg-Selove came to America at the age of 15 after narrowly escaping the Nazi takeover of France. She had planned to become an engineer like her father, but switched to physics after she was told the only engineering jobs open to women were in drafting: Marie Curie's example proved to her that women could do physics. Her first attempt at graduate work at Columbia University was a disaster, but she was sturck with the intellectual beauty of the field. After taking a Ph.D. in physics at University of Wisconsin, she did post-doctoral work with Thomas Lauritsen at the California Institute of Technology, where she began writing the first of a series of major review papers on the nuclear spectroscopy of the light nuclei, a subject of fundamental importance to nuclear physics, astrophysics, and applied physics. She continued this work and experimental research for thirty-eight years while teaching at Boston University, Haverford College, and the University of Pennsylvania. During her early career, Ajzenberg-Selove was shielded by her male mentors from experiencing much of the discrimination directed against women in science. Her simultaneous battles to become a tenured professor and to overcome breast cancer opened her eyes and confirmed her as a feminist. The lay reader and the scientist alike will be fascinated by Ajzenberg-Selove's clear portrayal of her interlinked lives as physicist, teacher, wife of particle physicist, Walter Selove, and a woman who relishes both competition and friendship in a male-dominated field. An invaluable book for anyone contemplating a career in science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4QLmvV92qz8C&dq=A+Matter+of+Choices:+Memoirs+of+a+Female+Physicist+(Lives+of+Women+in+Science)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Bible Chronicles: From Genesis to the Promised Land","description":"Introducing a new form of the Bible to African-American readers, a boxed edition presents a retelling of scriptural stories in the everyday language of the streets.

In Hidden in Plain View, historian Jacqueline Tobin and scholar Raymond Dobard offer the first proof that certain quilt patterns, including a prominent one called the Charleston Code, were, in fact, essential tools for escape along the Underground Railroad. In 1993, historian Jacqueline Tobin met African American quilter Ozella Williams amid piles of beautiful handmade quilts in the Old Market Building of Charleston, South Carolina. With the admonition to \\"write this down,\\" Williams began to describe how slaves made coded quilts and used them to navigate their escape on the Underground Railroad. But just as quickly as she started, Williams stopped, informing Tobin that she would learn the rest when she was \\"ready.\\" During the three years it took for Williams's narrative to unfold and as the friendship and trust between the two women grew Tobin enlisted Raymond Dobard, Ph.D., an art history professor and well-known African American quilter, to help unravel the mystery. Part adventure and part history, Hidden in Plain View traces the origin of the Charleston Code from Africa to the Carolinas, from the low-country island Gullah peoples to free blacks living in the cities of the North, and shows how three people from completely different backgrounds pieced together one amazing American story.

In appearance Hercule Poirot hardly resembled an ancient Greek hero. Yet - reasoned the detective - like Hercules he had been responsible for ridding society of some of its most unpleasant monsters. So, in the period leading up to his retirement, Poirot made up his mind to accept just twelve more cases: his self-imposed 'Labours'. Each would go down in the annals of crime as a heroic feat of deduction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9n84swEACAAJ&dq=The+Labours+of+Hercules&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Enigmas of Easter Island","description":"Easter Island, an isolated speck in the Pacific Ocean, produced one of the most fascinating and yet least understood of ancient cultures. Who were the inhabitants of this unimaginably remote volcanic island? Where did they come from? What, and equally intriguing, how did they erect the giant stone statues found all over the island? And what became of their civilization? - ;Easter Island, an unimaginably remote volcanic island in the Pacific Ocean, produced one of the most fascinating and yet least understood prehistoric cultures. Who were its inhabitants, and where did they come from? Why, and equally intriguingly, how did they erect the giant stone statues found all over the island? Paul Bahn and John Flenley tackle these and a host of other questions, introducing us, along the way, to the bizarre birdman cult found in the island's art, and the only recently deciphered Rongorongo script engraved on wooden panels. The Enigmas of Easter Island combines a wealth of new archaeological evidence, intriguing folk memories and the records of Captain Cook and other early explorers, to reveal how the island's decline may stem from ecological catastrophe. The result is a fascinating portrait of a civilization which still retains many of its mysteries. This book, originally published in 1992, was hailed as the best account of Easter Island ever written. Now it has been brought substantially up to date with a wealth of new material. -","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PtKSlp4X3oMC&dq=The+Enigmas+of+Easter+Island&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FORECAST OF EVIL","description":"Frozen in Fear...It was supposed to be the perfect winter getaway: snow, sleighs, and a warm friendly tourist town on a remote Michigan island - what could be more romantic for New Jersey reporter Elise Jenkins and her new love interest, Detective Mitch Burns?

It is also an enduring lesson that a military unit, formed under an evil ideology, led by a social outcast and composed of vicious criminals, will sink to its lowest common denominator - hate. The Dirlewanger Battalion, also known as \\"Sonderkommando (special commando) Dirlewanger\\" was perhaps the least understood, but at the same time the most notorious German SS anti-partisan unit in World War II. German propaganda correspondents and wartime photographers did not follow them in action. And for good reason. Wherever the Dirlewanger unit - named for and led by Oskar Dirlewanger - operated, corruption and rape formed an every-day part of life and indiscriminate slaughter, beatings and looting were rife. Formed as a battalion of convicted poachers in 1940, the unit operated in Poland until 1942, guarding Jews in forced labor camps and making life miserable for Poles in Lublin and Cracow. From there Dirlewanger spent two years combating partisans in central Russia, giving no quarter and expecting none in return, during vicious fighting against an elusive foe in the midst of inhospitable swamps and dismal forests. In 1944 Dirlewanger savaged Warsaw during the Polish Uprising, before moving to Slovakia to crush another rebellion there. The end of the war saw the unit, which was now a division in size, fighting for its life south of Berlin against the Soviet Army. Medieval in their outlook on war and certainly not indicative of many German military formations, this unit none-the-less remains a reflection of a segment of mankind gone mad in the inferno of World War II on the eastern front.

On her way to the Mediterranean, Luce Adams doesn t expect her life to be much affected by her travels, let alone drastically altered. She s heading to a memorial service for her mother, Kitty, who died two years earlier in a car accident on Crete, while she was researching Minoan culture. Shy and awkward, Luce has never been able to handle her mother s adoring circle of academics and goddess-worshippers or her mother s lover, Lee Pronski, who talked Luce into going on the trip. Following Lee s itinerary through Italy and Greece on the way to Crete, hitting all of Kitty Adams s favourite places, only serves to remind Luce of how far she was from the centre of her mother s life. Despite the efforts of Kitty s old friends, it s an emotional distance that no number of healing rites or goddess figurines can help Luce overcome. The only part of the journey that holds Luce s interest is her role as a courier, delivering a package of old family papers to a museum in Venice. The eighteenth-century documents   a travel journal kept by Luce s ancestor Asked For Adams, a manuscript written in what appears to be Arabic, and some precious letters written by Casanova   had been discovered in the family s cottage on the St. Lawrence, and were recently authenticated by a Harvard expert. Luce, an archivist, was the natural person to entrust with their safe delivery. And as she discovers upon cracking open Asked For s journal, Luce is also the one person who truly needs to read the young Puritan s story   not only to get to the bottom of what happened to her ancestor, who disappeared one night in Venice, but also so she can begin to understand what it means to lead a passionate life. Luce s reading mirrors our own, as the journal and letters are woven into the novel and give life to the second narrative of What Casanova Told Me. In 1797, Asked For Adams travels to Venice with her father and her intended husband, the stiff and unimaginative Francis Gooch, on a trade mission. Arriving at night by public barge, Asked For is intrigued by the eccentrics they encounter on board   especially a ridiculously wigged old woman named Countess Flora Waldstein. But the charming countess is in fact Giacomo Casanova, disguised to avoid the authorities, and when the two meet up again at Venice s historic belltower, their destinies begin to intertwine. Upon the unexpected death of her father, Asked For abandons Francis and accepts Casanova s invitation to join him on a romantic quest to Constantinople. Her travel journal, kept in the style of the French novels that she so admires, tells the rich and exotic tale of their search for great love. Using Asked For s journal as a guide, Luce travels through Venice, Greece and Turkey, and begins to see how she can seize experience and come to terms with her mother s love for her and for Lee. And as the journeys of the two women converge, Luce finds her own way of moving through the world, Asked For learns what it means to live an ideal life, and both discover the brilliance, passion and generous spirit of the great Casanova. What Casanova Told Me has received rave reviews. The novel was a finalist for the 2004 Commonwealth Writers  Prize, Canada and Caribbean Region, and was picked as one of The Globe and Mail s top books of 2004. It was also selected as one of the top ten books of the year by the Calgary Herald, the Sun-Times, and Toronto s NOW magazine. Maclean s named Asked For Adams one of the five best fictional characters of 2004 and called her  the utterly charming core of Susan Swan s parallel-track historical novel.

But who or what controls what we watch and how we watch it? In Theatre of the Mind Jay Ingram, whose past scientific investigations include the properties of honey on toast and the complexities of the barmaid's brain, tackles one of the most controversial of subjects: consciousness. Scientists have long tried to map our brains and understand how it is that we think and are self-aware, but what do we really know? Any discussion of the brain raises more questions than answers, and Ingram illuminates some of the most perplexing ones: What happens in our minds when we're driving and we suddenly realize that we don't remember the last few miles of highway? How do we remember images, sounds, and aromas from our past so vividly, and why do we often recreate them so differently in our dreams? Ingram's latest book is a mind-bending experience, a cerebral, stylish ride through the history, philosophy, and science of the brain and the search for the discovery of the self.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=haynaQy9sTgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Edward the second (English literature for schools)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=huUNAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kennedy","description":"Based on interviews with some of his closest associates, a portrait of the thirty-fifth president discusses his privileged childhood, military service, struggles with a life-threatening disease, and career in politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kdgJnwEACAAJ&dq=Kennedy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brave New World (Br) (Pbk)(Oop) (Bloom's Reviews)","description":"The Second Edition of Johnny Salda?a's international bestseller provides an in-depth guide to the multiple approaches available for coding qualitative data.

Modern sailplanes make soaring and gliding flight possible, and with them, humans can fly higher, faster, and farther than the greatest of birds, using only an invisible force of nature to stay aloft. The terms soaring and gliding are used interchangeably, and the sport is appealing to pilot and spectator alike. Sailplane enthusiasts have always been explorers, always looking for a more ideal site that will provide the intellectual challenges of soaring as well as the sheer beauty and relaxation the sport can offer. Michigan-based glider pilots and designers found their soaring paradise in the early 1930s when they ventured north to the Sleeping Bear Dunes area. The explorers began to promote the sport to national and international prominence, and many came to make up a veritable who's who of American aeronautics. Over a century after Octave Chanute discovered motorless flight on the Lake Michigan dunes, sailplanes, hang gliders, and paragliders still fill the skies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K42QfQi6roUC&dq=Soaring+and+Gliding:+The+Sleeping+Bear+Dunes+National+Lakeshore+Area+(MI)+(Images+of+Aviation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"IONPAIR: A chemical speciation program for calcareous and gypsiferous soil solutions (Special report)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qWlPAAAAYAAJ&dq=IONPAIR:+A+chemical+speciation+program+for+calcareous+and+gypsiferous+soil+solutions+(Special+report)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Analysing Discourse","description":"\\"The book is an essential resource seeking to analyze real texts and discourse.\\"--BOOK JACKET.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5-gXEMPlNsEC&dq=Analysing+Discourse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mind Magic Techniques for Transforming Your Life","description":"Part I of this book explains the nature of consciousness and how the mind works.

Our visions of the future and our expectations of emancipation, have been deeply affected by the changes of recent history: the end of the Cold War, the explosion of new ethnic and national identities, the social fragmentation under late capitalism, and the collapse of universal certainties in philosophy and social and historical thought. Laclau here begins to explore precisely how our visions of emancipation have been recast under these new conditions. Laclau examines the internal contradictions of the notion of \\"emancipation\\" as it emerged from the mainstream of modernity, as well as the relation between universalism and particularism which is inherent in it. He explores the making of political identities and the status of central notions in political theory such as \\"representation\\" and \\"power,\\" focusing particularly on the work of Derrida and Rorty.

(They provide the music for his last tango.) Mix in the beautiful Arabella, a Duchess by marriage and Queen of all London bunco by her other talents and Bentwhistle's long time unrequited love. With her arrival the \\"Great Game\\" can continue. The rules being that he would marry her if he could not solve every larceny that is committed by her friends.

In fact, pathological altruism, in the form of an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one's own needs, may underpin some personality disorders. Hyperempathy - an excess of concern for what others think and how they feel - helps explain popular but poorly defined concepts such as codependency. The contributing authors of this book provide a scientific, social, and cultural foundation for the subject of pathological altruism, creating a new field of inquiry. Each author's approach points to one disturbing truth: what we value so much, the altruistic \\"good\\" side of human nature, can also have a dark side that we ignore at our peril.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5rmMnvgD40UC&dq=Altruism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Birds (Penguin Longman Reader Level 2)","description":"Hans Andersen wrote many stories, and these are some of the best.

How can we accumulate the essential blessings of a happy life? What emotions must we abandon-and which should we embrace-to find joy? Such conundrums were ever on the mind of James Allen, one of the most popular writers in the fields of inspiration and spirituality at the turn of the 20th century.

A classic of spiritual succor, first published in 1908, this is as vital and as necessary a work as it was a century ago. British author and pop philosopher JAMES ALLEN (1864-1912) retired from the business world to pursue a life of writing and contemplation.

Wright Mills Award for the best book in the field of social problems. The work is in effect three books in one: a forthright account of how to analyze survey data, a penetrating critique of delinquency research, and a set of original essays on methodology. It is a landmark work that continues to serve as an essential tool for those who both study and want to learn about deviance. In the new introduction, Travis Hirschi describes the setting in which 'Delinquency Research' was written, noting that it exudes a confident optimism that well-conducted research and analysis will quickly lead to important advances in the field. Hirschi maintains that twenty-eight years after 'Delinquency Research' was first published the validity of its optimistic view has been confirmed by the fact that the field of criminology is among the leading producers of high quality research. As a result, we know more about crime and delinquency than ever before. 'Delinquency Research' forms the basis for present and future studies of criminology and is a necessary addition to the libraries of sociologists, criminologists, scholars in the area of delinquency, and students interested in research methods.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wE8PEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grammar of the Shot (Media Manuals)","description":"For beginners","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1z66wAEACAAJ&dq=Grammar+of+the+Shot+(Media+Manuals)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Arte de La Estratagema (Spanish Edition)","description":"Las comunidades cristianas que tienen como gu a espiritual a un hombre espiritual, podr n llegar a ser iglesias espirituales.

And, amazingly, not so coincidentally, the head of the giant spider woman thing bears a striking resemblance to his long lost cousin, Sara, who vanished in her thirteenth summer, some fifteen years prior, off the face of the planet. Jake Trapper must deal with his own recurring nightmares regarding his missing cousin; conquer his fear of spiders; while all the while attempting to save his relationship with the fiery woman he loves, Ellie.

Rana Mitter goes back to this pivotal moment in Chinese history to uncover the origins of the painful transition from a premodern past into a modern world. By the 1920s the seemingly civilized world shaped over the last two thousand years by the legacy of the great philosopher Confucius was falling apart in the face of western imperialism and internal warfare. Chinese cities still bore the imprints of its ancient past with narrow, lanes and temples to long-worshipped gods, but these were starting to change with the influx of foreign traders, teachers, and missionaries, all eager to shape China's ancient past into a modern present. Mitter takes us through the resulting social turmoil and political promise, the devastating war against Japan in the 1940s, Communism and the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, and the new era of hope in the 1980s ended by the Tian'anmen uprising. He reveals the impetus behind the dramatic changes in Chinese culture and politics as being China's \\"New Culture\\" - a strain of thought which celebrated youth, individualism, and the heady mixture of strange and seductive new cultures from places as far apart as America, India, and Japan.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0VGQlHQKm10C&dq=A+Bitter+Revolution:+China%27s+Struggle+with+the+Modern+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Perfume: Historia de un Asesino (Spanish Edition)","description":"Quiz  los olores evoquen el privilegio de la invisibilidad.

Occasionally that question has broken out in quite extreme forms, suggesting the answer that Jesus may never have existed at all as an historical person. But now, apart from such absurd freaks of scholarship, we are confronted in a new way with the question whether we can know enough about Jesus to enable us to build a Christology upon Him. It is by challenging us with that question--not by giving us an assured result--that Form Criticism has become a momentous factor in creating the situation which exists for Christological thought to-day. It will make a great difference to the problem of Christology whether we accept or reject the claims of this new historical radicalism.\\"--Chapter 1, page 27","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wFMcAAAAMAAJ&dq=God+was+in+Christ+:+An+essay+on+incarnation+and+atonement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A handbook for reading: Phonics textbook (A Beka Book reading program)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r-aQMwEACAAJ&dq=A+handbook+for+reading:+Phonics+textbook+(A+Beka+Book+reading+program)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to study your Bible","description":"Beloved Bible teacher Kay Arthur s inductive study method has helped millions of people discover the truth of God s Word for themselves.

Textbook of Men's Mental Health provides clinicians with the information they need for understanding how certain disorders manifest differently in men -- and for recognizing how treatment responses in men differ from those in women. Multidisciplinary coverage in this groundbreaking guide draws from fields such as public health and substance abuse to create a well-rounded approach to addressing men's specific mental health problems. With contributions by today's experts in men's mental health, this work gathers the latest research about men's psychiatric issues, from the difficulties in diagnosing male depression to strategies for engaging men in marital therapy. First addressing developmental issues specific to childhood, adolescence, and old age, the text then presents treatment options for an array of problems, from anxiety to sexual disorders to posttraumatic stress disorder. This volume then addresses psychosocial issues as they apply uniquely to men, such as fathering, marriage, aggression, and overcoming the stigma of mental health treatment -- as well as a chapter on how men's ethnicity influences the effectiveness of therapy. Among the topics discussed are how men behave in intimate relationships with women -- and the mental health considerations unique to gay men psychiatric disorders more prevalent in men than women, such as substance abuse, antisocial personality, and conduct disorder up-to-date facts on male sexual functioning, covering erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, and male orgasmic disorder why disorders less common in men -- anxiety, depression, PTSD -- require different treatment than for women coverage of compulsive disorders seen in men both more frequently, such as pathological gambling and compulsive sexual behavior -- and less frequently, such as kleptomania and compulsive buying insight into how body image, a problem usually associated with women, has become a serious health issue for men, as evidenced by eating disorders, muscle dysmorphia, and steroid abuse No previous text has addressed such a wide range of issues concerning men's mental health, presented here in evidence-based coverage featuring case vignettes, key points, practice guidelines, and an extensive reference list in each chapter. Clinicians who wish to make more prudent decisions regarding the care of men with mental health issues will find this text indispensable to their practice -- and to the well-being of their male patients.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JPcjcqDGUqgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bourgeois Experience: Victoria to Freud Volume 1: Education of the Senses (Vol 1)","description":"A study of middle-class culture from the 1820s to World War I","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_rsLRAAACAAJ&dq=The+Bourgeois+Experience:+Victoria+to+Freud+Volume+1:+Education+of+the+Senses+(Vol+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American guide to U.S. coins","description":"The Large Print Edition of the Guide Book of United States Coins gives you all the content from the regular edition, shown 45% bigger!

Storytelling is an even rarer skill. A genuinely comic vision is beyond price. The Ordways has all three.

The Ordways are one such clan, and in this eloquent and original novel, our narrator recounts the story of how he and his kin arrived in this magical land where the South meets the West. The tale begins with his great-grandfather, Thomas Ordway, who lost his sight at the Battle of Shiloh and vowed to quit Tennessee forever. He crossed the Red River into Texas and stopped on the edge of the featureless prairie, a landscape too mystifying even for a sightless man. Years later, the narrator s grandfather, Sam Ordway, was forced to leave the forest behind when his three-year-old son, Ned, was kidnapped by a neighbor. Sam scoured the vast state of Texas in search of Ned but never found the boy.

The author presents a concise overview of the strategic planning process, defines the terms involved, and provides a step-by-step methodology for organizations ready to move into the actual implementation of strategic planning. In addition to differentiating between community-based, corporate, functional, and defined-purpose strategic planning processes, Mercer explains the delineation between strategic and tactical planning and offers practical approaches to overcoming barriers to the use of strategic planning in the public sector arena. Throughout, the author makes extensive use of case studies of strategic planning programs implemented by a variety of local government and public sector organizations. Mercer begins by describing how strategic planning can be both an effective tool for dealing with change and a technique of organizational development. He goes on to provide detailed instructions on how to prepare to conduct strategic planning, how to determine strategic issues, the importance of a values audit, and how to develop an environmental scan or assessment. Subsequent chapters address determining organizational threats and opportunities, composing the mission statement, defining critical success factors and indicators, planning strategies, and assessing strategic risks and benefits. Finally, the author shows how to perform an internal assessment of ability to actually adopt and carry out strategies, the importance of contingency planning, and how to tie strategic planning to the budget and evaluate the process. The public sector manager experienced with strategic planning techniques can use the guide as a handy reference to particular aspects of the process, while those new to strategic planning will find this an indispensable aid in developing and implementing their own internal strategic planning processes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_FImFM1D4uQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Assassination: The Politics of Murder","description":"Documents the political assassinations that have changed the course of history, looking at the victims, their assassins and their motives, the political climate, conspiracy theories, and the aftermath","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MYbaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Assassination:+The+Politics+of+Murder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Wilderness to Witness","description":"The journey through the last forty-four years of my life has yielded many joyous occasions, some sorrows, achievements and yes...some failures.

A leading authority on Renaissance art, Francis Ames-Lewis traces the ways in which the social and intellectual concerns of painters and sculptors brought about the acceptance of their work as a liberal art, alongside other arts like poetry. He charts the development of the idea of the artist as a creative genius with a distinct identity and individuality. Ames-Lewis examines the various ways that Renaissance artists like Mantegna, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and D rer, as well as many other less well known painters and sculptors, pressed for intellectual independence. By writing treatises, biographies, poetry, and other literary works, by seeking contacts with humanists and literary men, and by investigating the arts of the classical past, Renaissance artists honed their social graces and broadened their intellectual horizons. They also experienced a growing creative confidence and self-awareness that was expressed in novel self-portraits, works created solely to demonstrate pictorial skills, and monuments to commemorate themselves after death.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FrcsXlpD6NIC&dq=The+Intellectual+Life+of+the+Early+Renaissance+Artist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goodnight Seattle: The Unauthorized Guide to the World of \\"Frasier\\"","description":"The Encyclopedia of Television, second edtion is the first major reference work to provide description, history, analysis, and information on more than 1100 subjects related to television in its international context.

In August 1922 during the Irish Civil War, that prophecy came true  Collins was shot and killed by a fellow Irishman in a shocking political assassination. So ended the life of the greatest of all Irish nationalists, but his visions and legacy lived on.

My grandparents lived just across the state line in Alabama. Until I was eight years old, I had no idea that our black neighbors (the Collins family) were constantly reminded that they were second-class citizens. My parents accepted the Collins family as true friends who could be relied on to help and love their neighbors. My daddy was strong-willed and independent in his constant support of all our black friends. Shut Godwin helped many whites and blacks, and his reputation as a force to be reckoned with actually made the Ku Klux Klan back away from any sort of witch hunts. And many times over the years, he redirected the evildoers that he called the KKK cowards dressed up in white ghost costumes. When I was ten years old, my mother drove her children across the country so that we could spend the summer in Magdalena, New Mexico. That was the closest we could get to my daddys sawmill.

Linked by focused readings of Hamlet and the Henriad, the essays follow Shakespeare s two most famous royal sons, the Princes Hamlet and Hal, as they haunt contemporary political psychology in the early years of a new millennium, and especially in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. Between devolution in Britain and the new  doctrine  of pre-emptive strike in the United States, our contemporary Hamlets and Hals epitomize a debate  as fraught now as in Shakespeare  day  about the cost of spin-doctoring legacies. In exploring how current political culture inherits Shakespeare, Hamlet s Heirs challenges scholarly assumptions about historical periodicity, modernity and the uses of Shakespeare in present day contexts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qnWBAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Transformation of War: The Most Radical Reinterpretation of Armed Conflict Since Clausewitz","description":"At a time when unprecedented change in international affairs is forcing governments, citizens, and armed forces everywhere to re-assess the question of whether military solutions to political problems are possible any longer, Martin van Creveld has written an audacious searching examination of the nature of war and of its radical transformation in our own time. For 200 years, military theory and strategy have been guided by the Clausewitzian assumption that war is rational a reflection of national interest and an extension of politics by other means. However, van Creveld argues, the overwhelming pattern of conflict in the post-1945 world no longer yields fully to rational analysis. In fact, strategic planning based on such calculations is, and will continue to be, unrelated to current realities. Small-scale military eruptions around the globe have demonstrated new forms of warfare with a different cast of characters - guerilla armies, terrorists, and bandits pursuing diverse goals by violent means with the most primitive to the most sophisticated weapons. Although these warriors and their tactics testify to the end of conventional war as we've known it, the public and the military in the developed world continue to contemplate organized violence as conflict between the super powers. At this moment, armed conflicts of the type van Creveld describes are occurring throughout the world. From Lebanon to Cambodia, from Sri Lanka and the Philippines to El Salvador, the Persian Gulf, and the strife-torn nations of Eastern Europe, violent confrontations confirm a new model of warfare in which tribal, ethnic, and religious factions do battle without high-tech weapons or state-supported armies and resources. This low-intensity conflict challenges existing distinctions between civilian and solder, individual crime and organized violence, terrorism and war. In the present global atmosphere, practices that for three centuries have been considered uncivilized, such as capturing civilians or even entire communities for ransom, have begun to reappear. Pursuing bold and provocative paths of inquiry, van Creveld posits the inadequacies of our most basic ideas as to who fights wars and why and broaches the inevitability of man's need to  play  at war. In turn brilliant and infuriating, this challenge to our thinking and planning current and future military encounters is one of the most important books on war we are likely to read in our lifetime.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WZoAlQEACAAJ&dq=The+Transformation+of+War:+The+Most+Radical+Reinterpretation+of+Armed+Conflict+Since+Clausewitz&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Phenomenological Movement (Phaenomenologica) 2-Volume","description":"The present attempt to introduce the general philosophical reader to the Phenomenological Movement by way of its history has itself a history which is pertinent to its objective. It may suitably be opened by the following excerpts from a review which Herbert W. Schneider of Columbia University, the Head of the Division for International Cultural Cooperation, Department of Cultural Activities of Unesco from 1953 to 56, wrote in 1950 from France: The influence of Husserl has revolutionized continental philosophies, not because his philosophy has become dominant, but because any philosophy now seeks to accommodate itself to, and express itself in, phenomenological method. It is the sine qua non of critical respectability. In America, on the contrary, phenomenology is in its infancy. The aver age American student of philosophy, when he picks up a recent volume of philosophy published on the continent of Europe, must first learn the \\"tricks\\" of the phenomenological trade and then translate as best he can the real import of what is said into the kind of analysis with which he is familiar. . . . . . . No doubt, American education will gradually take account of the spread of phenomenological method and terminology, but until it does, American readers of European philosophy have a severe handicap; and this applies not only to existentialism but to almost all current philosophicalliterature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n_8QswEACAAJ&dq=The+Phenomenological+Movement+(Phaenomenologica)+2-Volume&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Afternoon Tea Book","description":"A guide to the traditions and etiquette of afternoon tea provides recipes for a variety of savory treats, pastries, cakes, and cookies along with information on the technique of making a perfect pot of tea.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lO5PYgEACAAJ&dq=The+Afternoon+Tea+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Mehndi","description":"A beautifully illustrated exploration of the history and symbolism of the ancient Indian art of henna design discusses how this form of body painting has recently become fashionable, giving step-by-step instructions on making and using henna paste. 20,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XY4XAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+Mehndi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Putting the Pieces Together: A Practical Guide to Recovery From Borderline Personality Disorder","description":"Dr. Joe Santore, Ph.D.\\"Joy Jensen has written a straight talking to the point \\"beginners\\" guide to recovering from BPD.

In Sorokin's scabrous dystopian satire, Day of the Oprichnik, American readers were introduced to his distinctive style, which combines an edgy avant-garde sensibility with a fondness for the absurd and even grotesque all in the service of bringing out stinging truths about life in modern-day Russia. In The Blizzard, we are immediately immersed in the atmosphere of a 19th century Russia familiar to us from the works of Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Dostoyevsky. District doctor Garin is desperately trying to reach the village of Dolgoye, where a mysterious epidemic called the  Chernukha  is raging and threatens to spread throughout the country, turning people into zombies. The doctor carries with him a vaccine that will prevent the spread of this terrible disease, but is stymied in his travels by an all-consuming snow storm, an impenetrable blizzard that turns a drive that should last only a few hours into a voyage of days, and finally, a journey into eternity. The Blizzard dramatizes a timeless metaphysical predicament. The characters in this nearly post-apocalyptic world are constantly in motion, and yet somehow trapped and frozen spending day and night fighting their way through the storm on an expedition filled with extraordinary encounters, dangerous escapades, torturous imaginings, and amorous adventures. In the fantastical realm Sorokin has invented, the reader also loses her bearings, subject to the vicissitudes of time and change, to both the movement of life and its stagnancy. Hypnotic, fascinating, and richly descriptive, The Blizzard is a seminal work from one of the most inventive writers working today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CafMCgAAQBAJ&dq=Blizzard:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silent Snow, Secret Snow (Creative Classic Series)","description":"A Study Guide for Conrad Aiken's \\"Silent Snow, Secret Snow,\\" excerpted from Gale's acclaimed Short Stories for Students.

The submarine service was in its infancy, and interest in the self-propelled torpedo as an undersea weapon flourished. Herreshoff's fast, steam-powered boats were the first of the delivery platforms accepted by the U.S. Navy Department for experiments at the Newport Naval Torpedo Station and service during the Spanish-American War. Dating from the Civil War, the torpedo station on Goat Island in Newport Harbor was the first torpedo armory in the United States, specializing in research, development, and manufacture. Building the Mosquito Fleet: The U.S. Navy's First Torpedo Boats traces the important and often dramatic history of the involvement between the U.S. Navy and the Herreshoff brothers' marine yards over a period of more than thirty years. It is a story of enterprise, naval development, and marine manufacturing during a time of experimentation and evolution. Included are dramatic stories of the men who built and tested these dangerous new vessels. This fascinating volume preserves under one cover a concise history of the torpedo boats built by the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company. It describes design and construction innovations introduced by the Herreshoffs and traces the events that led the major navies of the world to take notice of the Herreshoffs' work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p1k6ejrEZlkC&dq=The+Mosquito+Fleet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whiz Mob: a Correlation of the Technical Argot of Pickpockets with Their Behavior Pattern","description":"Whiz Mob is David W.

He argues that middle life and late adulthood present opportunities for turning inward for a deeper contemplative life within the context of active, worldly endeavors. This can also augur a reform of social relationships--beyond individual development alone--toward the creation of a more cooperative, just society. In this way, physical decline is countered by a spiritual ascent. He summons aging persons, fortified with universal values and concerns gained from age and experience, to return to the centers of decision making. Throughout, the author ponders such questions as personal power, identity, fear, freedom, contemplation, sexuality, the church, faith, suffering, and hope. In candid interviews, older religious leaders reflect on their early value formation, personal traumas, choice of careers, midlife transitions, experiences of old age, and the prospect of death. In dwelling mainly on human spiritual dilemmas of the aging cycle, Bianchi offers a strong, clear message of hope--one that stands against the tide of our culture which tends to shunt older people to the outer eddies of life's stream. Aging as a Spiritual Journey is immensely valuable to all laypersons and those in the helping professions who are concerned about the quality of the aging process.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8yZNAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jane Fairfax: A Novel to Complement \\"Emma\\" by Jane Austen (Portway Large Print Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iHUZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Jane+Fairfax:+A+Novel+to+Complement+%22Emma%22+by+Jane+Austen+(Portway+Large+Print+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dynasty's End: Bill Russell and the1968-69 World Champion Boston Celtics (Sportstown Series)","description":"The following summer, Russell stunned the sports world by announcing his retirement, ending his and the Celtics' celebrated reign.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b7bB1FXutcMC&dq=Dynasty%27s+End:+Bill+Russell+and+the1968-69+World+Champion+Boston+Celtics+(Sportstown+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catastrophe and Crisis","description":"This book explores how and why an event is a precursor to the emergence of a crisis and how a given crisis affects an organization and its stakeholders.

From birth, children are learning and rely on parents and the other caregivers in their lives to protect and care for them. The impact of parents may never be greater than during the earliest years of life, when a child's brain is rapidly developing and when nearly all of her or his experiences are created and shaped by parents and the family environment. Parents help children build and refine their knowledge and skills, charting a trajectory for their health and well-being during childhood and beyond. The experience of parenting also impacts parents themselves. For instance, parenting can enrich and give focus to parents' lives; generate stress or calm; and create any number of emotions, including feelings of happiness, sadness, fulfillment, and anger. Parenting of young children today takes place in the context of significant ongoing developments. These include: a rapidly growing body of science on early childhood, increases in funding for programs and services for families, changing demographics of the U.S. population, and greater diversity of family structure. Additionally, parenting is increasingly being shaped by technology and increased access to information about parenting. Parenting Matters identifies parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices associated with positive developmental outcomes in children ages 0-8; universal/preventive and targeted strategies used in a variety of settings that have been effective with parents of young children and that support the identified knowledge, attitudes, and practices; and barriers to and facilitators for parents' use of practices that lead to healthy child outcomes as well as their participation in effective programs and services. This report makes recommendations directed at an array of stakeholders, for promoting the wide-scale adoption of effective programs and services for parents and on areas that warrant further research to inform policy and practice. It is meant to serve as a roadmap for the future of parenting policy, research, and practice in the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FA8MDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What's Holding You Back?: 30 Days to Having the Courage and Confidence to Do What You Want, Meet Whom You Want, and Go Where You Want","description":"You never again need feel powerless in the face of uncertainty, awkward with strangers, or helpless in new situations.With What's Holding You Back?, Sam Horn shows you the way to a solid sense of self-assurance that doesn't depend on where you are or who you're with.
