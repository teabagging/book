Explore ways to minimize that trauma! This book illustrates the ways that children growing up to be gay are harmed by homophobia before anyone, including themselves, even knows they are gay. This compelling and sympathetic volume describes many simple ways that these children can be helped to understand that they can grow up to lead normal lives, with hopes and dreams for their futures. How Homophobia Hurts Children: Nurturing Diversity at Home, at School, and in the Community brings home the voices of these children. They describe their experiences to show how they came to the frightening recognition that they are part of a group held in disregard by the rest of society, even sometimes by their own families. Dr. Jean M. Baker, the author of How Homophobia Hurts Children: Nurturing Diversity at Home, at School, and in the Community is a clinical psychologist and the mother of two gay sons. In this book she shares her experience as both psychologist and mother to show how the myths and fallacies about homosexuality have influenced parents, schools, churches, and lawmakers to send children the cruel message that if they are gay, they are not normal and will not be able to lead normal lives. In this unique volume you'll find: a chapter on identity development, following the Eriksonian model interviews with high school students who are self-identified as gay firsthand descriptions of the harassment and victimization of those perceived as gay in schools research on how victimization at school affects gay youths a discussion of the relatively new phenomenon of gay/straight alliances (gay support groups or clubs) a chapter on transgender identity with interviews with four transsexual persons who describe their personal childhood experiences and their transition process The focus of How Homophobia Hurts Children: Nurturing Diversity at Home, at School, and in the Community, centering on the social and familial experiences of children who will grow up to be gay but have not yet come to that realization, is unique. But beyond that, this book also explains how homophobia affects the attitudes of non-gay children by leading them to believe that it is acceptable to mistreat homosexuals. Finally, specific suggestions are made for changes in parenting and changes in school/classroom practices that could help prevent the harm that is inflicted upon so many of our gay children.

We all want more money, but as societies become richer, they do not become happier. This is not speculation: It's the story told by countless pieces of scientific research. We now have sophisticated ways of measuring how happy people are, and all the evidence shows that on average people have grown no happier in the last fifty years, even as average incomes have more than doubled. The central question the great economist Richard Layard asks in Happiness is this: If we really wanted to be happier, what would we do differently? First we'd have to see clearly what conditions generate happiness and then bend all our efforts toward producing them. That is what this book is about-the causes of happiness and the means we have to effect it. Until recently there was too little evidence to give a good answer to this essential question, but, Layard shows us, thanks to the integrated insights of psychology, sociology, applied economics, and other fields, we can now reach some firm conclusions, conclusions that will surprise you. Happiness is an illuminating road map, grounded in hard research, to a better, happier life for us all.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CQQN8mQt0AgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Educational Renewal: Better Teachers, Better Schools","description":"\\"Once again Goodlad has his finger on the pulse of education. . . .Excellent reading for the professional educator.\\" --Choice Goodlad picks up where he left off in Teachers for Our Nation'sSchools --providing the vision and rationale behind centers ofpedagogy that can bring schools and universities together in aclose, renewing relationship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bzFzWsJEHLUC&dq=Educational+Renewal:+Better+Teachers,+Better+Schools&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Savage Business: The Comeback and Comedown of Mike Tyson","description":"Examines the life and career of Mike Tyson inside the arena of professional boxing, looking closely at the personalities, deals, and profits that make up this world of sport and violence","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QwSEUvYSq-gC&dq=A+Savage+Business:+The+Comeback+and+Comedown+of+Mike+Tyson&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Russian gentleman, (The world's classics.

An understanding of seed dormancy is of considerable significance to world agriculture and the global economy, since grasses are a principal source of food for humankind and play an essential role in stabilizing the land surface of much of the globe. Experimental evidence is considered in depth for a single species, the wild oat (Avena fatua), probably the most widely studied species for understanding seed dormancy in the plant kingdom. The evidence for this species is compared with other examples among the Gramineae to reach some general conclusions about the nature of seed dormancy in grasses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GOgyZrXfEuwC&dq=Seed+Dormancy+in+Grasses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cowboy Charlie: The Story of Charles M.

We call it the Heart because these deeper realities are experienced most strongly in the region of the physical heart. However, the spiritual Heart is not limited to a location in your body. The Heart is the totality of your connection with the essential qualities and greater dimensions of your true nature as limitless Being. Any full exploration of the larger truth of your Being must include a discovery of the capacities and qualities of this tender, loving, and wise aspect of your true nature.Living from the Heart consists of three related pieces that explore living from the spiritual Heart. Part One, From the Heart, offers simple ways to drop your awareness into the Heart and thereby shift into a more open, allowing perspective and to more fully experience the world and your true nature as aware space. It goes on to explore dropping awareness into the belly and ultimately into the larger spiritual Heart, which includes the mind, heart and belly. These simple shifts in perspective can profoundly alter your experience of life and its challenges. It turns out it doesn \\"t matter what you experience; what matters is where you experience it from.Part Two, The Heart \\"s Wisdom, explains how the Heart is a wise and accurate guide to the truth. The truth is whatever opens your Heart and quiets your mind. This simple definition cuts through any confusing ideas and beliefs to the direct source of wisdom and guidance available in your own Heart.Part Three, Love Is for Giving, points to the true source of love in your own Heart. The essence of love is the spacious, open attention of our awareness. Awareness is the gentlest, kindest, and most intimate force in the world. It touches everything but doesn \\"t impose or make demands. Surprisingly, this awareness, or love, is experienced most fully when you give it to others, not when you get it from others. The more love you give, the more love you experience. It is by freely giving love that we are filled with love.Throughout, there is a pointing beyond the experience of the Heart and its wisdom, peace, and love to the possibility of recognizing these essential qualities as who and what you are. The Heart with all its joy, satisfaction, peace, love, and wisdom is not just something you can experience more fully; it is what you have always been and always will be. In recognizing your true nature as this fullness of Being, you can ultimately rest from all seeking and effort, and just be who you are.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8GSx9GTT2eUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Soldiers Three","description":"Wikepedia: Three Soldiers is a 1921 novel by the American writer and critic John Dos Passos. It is one of the key American war novels of the First World War, and remains a classic of the realist war novel genre. The disillusionment John Dos Passos felt for the Great War forms the core of THREE SOLDIERS, which stands as a denunciation of the military and its exploitation of young men. The novel chronicles the wartime experiences of a trio of American privates from different backgrounds: Andrews, a gifted musician and Harvard graduate from New York; Fuselli, a store clerk who hopes to impress a girl back home in San Francisco; and Chrisfield, an easygoing farm boy from Indiana. Recognized as a masterpiece when first published more than seventy-five years ago, THREE SOLDIERS still stands as a testament to the dehumanizing effects of war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vpkxMtUMADAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New York Times Campaigns: A Century of Presidential Races","description":"Based on massive new research, a compelling and surprising account of the twentieth century's closest election The 1960 presidential election between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon is one of the most frequently described political events of the twentieth century, yet the accounts to date have been remarkably unbalanced. Far more attention is given to Kennedy's side than to Nixon's. The imbalance began with the first book on that election, Theodore White's The Making of the President 1960--in which (as he later admitted) White deliberately cast Kennedy as the hero and Nixon as the villain--and it has been perpetuated in almost every book since then. Few historians have attempted an unbiased account of the election, and none have done the archival research that Irwin F. Gellman has done. Based on previously unused sources such as the FBI's surveillance of JFK and the papers of Leon Jaworski, vice-presidential candidate Henry Cabot Lodge, and many others, this book presents the first even-handed history of both the primary campaigns and the general election. The result is a fresh, engaging chronicle that shatters long-held myths and reveals the strengths and weaknesses of both candidates.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eMhQEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+New+York+Times+Campaigns:+A+Century+of+Presidential+Races&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classic Rock Stories: The Stories Behind the Greatest Songs of All Time","description":"The first time on the open road with Dad's beat-up clunker and a brand-new driver's lecense.

The essays range from detailed examinations of specific codices to broader theoretical discussions on past and present editorial practices, from the benefits and disadvantages of digital editions versus print editions to the importance of including 'extratextual' material such as variant texts, illustrations, intertexts, and other information about a work's cultural contexts, history, and use. The Book Unbound presents important contributions to the discussions surrounding the editing of medieval texts, including the use of digital technology with historical and literary documents, while offering practical ideas on editing print and hypertext.

Beston argued that, \\"The world today is sick to its thin blood for the lack of elemental things, for fire before the hands, for water, for air, for the dear earth itself underfoot.\\" Seventy-five years after they were first published, Beston's words are more true than ever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5JKNN1ReCsUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No neutral ground","description":"Cape Town is one of the most beautiful cities in the world - often described as a kind of heaven on earth. Yet for the majority of its inhabitants it is hell. Apartheid-spawned ghettoes are everywhere, and for those living in Manenberg - a coloured township on the Cape Flats, purpose-built by the apartheid government as part of its forced removal plan - life is just as marginal today as it was during apartheid. The main differences now are the rampant drug use and widespread gang presence. No Neutral Ground is a gripping account of Pete Portal's move from London to Manenberg, of addicts and gangsters meeting Jesus and being transformed, and how he went from living with a heroin addict to establishing a church community - and all the heartbreak and failure along the way. This is a story of mighty works of God, as well as relapse, hopelessness and despair; the miraculous and the mundane, heaven and hell, all balanced on a knife edge. Offering searing insight and an inspiring vision of faith, Pete asks why anyone would choose this way of life, if giving up our lives for others is worth it - and what the church could become if we were willing to risk it all to reach the forgotten and the lost.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yONqzQEACAAJ&dq=No+neutral+ground&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vampirism: Literary Tropes of Decadence and Entropy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Swallows & Amazons","description":"A new teacher at a New England prep school ignites a gender war--with deadly consequences--in a provocative novel from the bestselling author of The Passenger and the Spellman Files series. What do you love? What do you hate? What do you want? It starts with this simple writing prompt from Alex Witt, Stonebridge Academy's new creative writing teacher. When the students' answers raise disturbing questions of their own, Ms. Witt knows there's more going on the school than the faculty wants to see. She soon learns about The Ten--the students at the top of the school's social hierarchy--as well as their connection to something called The Darkroom. Ms. Witt can't remain a passive observer. She finds the few girls who've started to question the school's \\"boys will be boys\\" attitude and incites a resistance that quickly becomes a movement. But just as it gains momentum, she also attracts the attention of an unknown enemy who knows a little too much about her--including what brought her to Stonebridge in the first place. Meanwhile, Gemma, a defiant senior, has been plotting her attack for years, waiting for the right moment. Shy loner Norman hates his role in the Darkroom, but can't find the courage to fight back until he makes an unlikely alliance. And then there's Finn Ford, an English teacher with a shady reputation who keeps one eye on his literary ambitions and one on Ms. Witt. As the school's secrets begin to trickle out, a boys-versus-girls skirmish turns into an all-out war, with deeply personal--and potentially fatal--consequences for everyone involved. Lisa Lutz's blistering, timely tale shows us what can happen when silence wins out over decency for too long--and why the scariest threat of all might be the idea that sooner or later, girls will be girls.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i7qkDwAAQBAJ&dq=Swallows&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Haindl Tarot: A Reader's Handbook","description":"Rachel Pollack explores the Haindl tarot in this, her third study of Hermann Haindl's deck.

In The Hounds of Heaven, author Stephen Bodio embarks on a quest to discover the ancient breed of Central Asian sighthounds known as tazis. From his home in new Mexico, he chased leads all the way to Kazakhstan, where these beautiful dogs may have existed 6000 years ago. Evidence in ancient rock paintings suggests that these hounds, ancestors of modern breeds like salukis and Afghans, were used for hunting in the Bronze Age along with horses and birds of prey all along the old Silk Road. Centuries later, the Soviets tried to wipe out the breed, valued by tribal people as a symbol of their independence. But today, the greatest threat to tazis might be the show-dog breeder s closed stud books. In an effort to preserve them, Bodio brought several pups back to his home in New Mexico, bred them, and placed them with friends, some of whom wanted to use them to increase the genetic diversity of the saluki. The Hounds of Heaven is a celebration of the Asian sighthound in all its names and glorious variety, a lament for disappearing ways, and a truly unique adventure.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zGKCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wicked City: Chicago From Kenna To Capone (Illinois)","description":"An account of Chicago's vice, crime, capitalism, and corruption; also the story of Chicago's drive for wealth and power: its raucousness, meanness, lawlessness, ebullience, greed --and poetry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hBEUAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Wicked+City:+Chicago+From+Kenna+To+Capone+(Illinois)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Circle of Dreams","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9fJwVZZiSVAC&dq=A+Circle+of+Dreams&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cold One","description":"Every fall in northern Michigan brings a spate of dogman sightings.

Anita Avramides maintains that Grice's paradigm can be used to defend very different conceptions of mind and of meaning. In this clearly argued book she describes Grice's analysis of meaning and proposes two interpretations of it, one reductive and one nonreductive. Much current work in cognitive science assumes that the content of words and thoughts can be explained in naturalistic terms. A leading idea (advanced mainly by Stephen Schiffer and Brian Loar) is that the naturalistic account of content will proceed in two stages: a reduction of the semantic features of word; to the contents of propositional attitudes and then a reduction of the latter to physical or functional notions. The appeal of Grice's work on meaning to this two stage reductionist strategy is that Gricean definitions seem to provide the only way of reducing the semantic to the psychological, a reduction that is required for a naturalistic account of intentionality. While Avramides defends the method of analysis as one suited to the concept of meaning, she rejects a reductive interpretation of the analysis. She argues that any attempt to reduce the semantic to the psychological leads to a mistaken conception of mind. She exposes the assumptions behind the reductive interpretation and offers fresh and original arguments for the antireductionist position. Against the reductive Gricean she defends the idea that there is a deep epistemological symmetry between semantic and propositional attitude notions, a result of which is that semantically characterized linguistic behavior is central to our concept of belief.

A. MacDevitt. Caesar's Commentaries are an outstanding account of extraordinary events by one of the most exceptional men in the history of the world. Julius Caesar himself was one of the most eminent writers of the age in which he lived. His commentaries on the Gallic and Civil Wars are written with a purity, precision, and perspicuity, which command approbation. They are elegant without affectation, and beautiful without ornament. Of the two books which he composed on Analogy, and those under the title of Anti-Cato, scarcely any fragment is preserved; but we may be assured of the justness of the observations on language, which were made by an author so much distinguished by the excellence of his own compositions. His poem entitled The Journey, which was probably an entertaining narrative, is likewise totally lost. All of Caesar's works that remain intact are contained in this edition of his commentaries. It is to the honor of Caesar, that when he had obtained the supreme power, he exercised it with a degree of moderation beyond what was generally expected by those who had fought on the side of the Republic. His time was almost entirely occupied with public affairs, in the management of which, though he employed many agents, he appears to have had none in the character of actual minister. Caesar deprecated a lingering death, and wished that his own might be sudden and speedy. And the day before he died, the conversation at supper, in the house of Marcus Lepidus, turning upon what wasthe most eligible way of dying, he gave his opinion in favor of a death that is sudden and unexpected. He died in the fifty-sixth year of his age, and was ranked amongst the Gods.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kr87vgAACAAJ&dq=Caesar%27s+War+Commentaries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pathways in Scripture: A Book-By-Book Guide to the Spiritual Riches of the Bible (St. Paul Center Studies in Biblical Theology and Spiritualit)","description":"An introduction to the books of the Bible that lead beyond the literal meaning of Scripture to its spiritual sense.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EvoFAAAACAAJ&dq=Pathways+in+Scripture:+A+Book-By-Book+Guide+to+the+Spiritual+Riches+of+the+Bible+(St.+Paul+Center+Studies+in+Biblical+Theology+and+Spiritualit)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Running Mate","description":"Hailed as \\"astonishingly powerful\\" by The New York Times, and \\"written perfectly\\" by The Washington Post, Joe Klein's #1 bestseller, Primary Colors, was the most-talked-about political novel of the past century. Now acclaimed journalist and author Joe Klein returns with another brilliant and slyly subversive novel set in the gladiatorial arena he knows so well: politics in modern-day America. U.S. senator Charlie Martin is a hot political property, dashing, honorable, irreverent -- and a decorated Vietnam veteran. The Running Mate follows this brash hero on a wild, exhilarating ride through the minefields of politics as usual. But as Charlie quickly learns, combat is a cakewalk compared with the battles waged by free men in pursuit of glory and power. For Charlie's political star is beginning to wane ... a bid for the presidency ends in failure ... a young campaign volunteer's father decks him -- in front of the cameras ... a well-kept secret from Charlie's Vietnam days is revealed ... and a woman has entered his life -- one who loves him but is appalled by his life's work. Suddenly Charlie must confront the two greatest challenges of his life -- a political opponent who has no scruples and a dazzling, unconventional woman who may force him to choose between love and politics. Charlie's dilemma is one that has come to haunt contemporary American politics: Is it possible to be a good politician and a good man?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e6Hgn1oovXYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tibetan Buddhist Companion","description":"This selection of precious and practical quotes from great masters of Tibetan Buddhism reflects the immense variety of approaches and the profundity that have made the tapestry of Tibetan Buddhist teachings of deep interest to an ever- increasing number of readers.

Conroy vividly and hilariously recounts his adventures in a very different Belize. Conroy admits in Our Man in Belize that his tales \\"have taken on a life of their own\\"--tales of disasters, for example, like the dinner party at which an Obeah witch doctor blew up the consulate oven, causing the suddenly bald cook to quit in mid-meal , and the equally unsettling occasion when huge tropical roaches, attracted by the gracious candlelight, plunged helplessly from the ceiling into the guests' bowls of gazpacho. He describes the unorthodox social mores of the town, whose bordello was a barely hidden enterprise of the town's most respectable citizen, and he brings to vivid life the charming Belize people and their ways. Conroy also recounts the tragedy of Hurricane Hattie, which killed four hundred people on Halloween Eve in 1961 and changed the Belize way of life forever. None of the cheerful chaos and disorganization was what Conroy expected when he arrived in this small Central American country with his wife and two daughters, to face some of the most bizarre experiences of day-to-day diplomatic life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gVEnBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John McIntosh Kell of The Raider Alabama","description":"A vivid portrait of the man credited as a driving force behind the most successful of the Confederate raiders, the legendary C.S.S. Alabama. John McIntosh Kell was an experienced, proven military man, a graduate of Annapolis, a veteran of the Mexican War and of Admiral Perry s voyage to Japan. As a Confederate officer, Kell served first on the raider Sumter and then on the Alabama. At sea for only 22 months, the Alabama engaged nearly 300 northern merchant vessels, burning 55 of these transport ships along with their million-dollar cargoes. Though First Lieutenant (\\"Luff\\") Kell was apparently content to let his captain, Raphael Semmes, take credit for their accomplishments, Semmes acknowledged that his successes were due largely to the energy and resourcefulness of his second in command. Life on the commerce cruisers was hard and tedious, and much of the responsibility for running the day-to-day operations, including the disciplining of a largely mercenary crew, rested on Kell, whose sense of duty and loyalty did not waver. Norman C. Delaney bases his account of this remarkable naval officer s experiences on the interviews Kell granted to news reporters during the 1880s and 1890s (previously neglected by historians) and his memoirs, published in 1900 as Recollections of a Naval Life. He supplements these materials with records from Kell s earlier years, including letters, journals, diaries, and contemporary observations. First published in 1973 by The University of Alabama Press, this new edition of an award-winning biography will be welcomed by Civil War historians and enthusiasts around the world, naval institutions and museums, and general readers alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Kf10DwAAQBAJ&dq=John+McIntosh+Kell+of+The+Raider+Alabama&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All This Hell: U.

Madeline Ullom More than one hundred U.S. Army and Navy nurses were stationed in Guam and the Philippines at the beginning of World War II. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, five navy nurses on Guam became the first American military women of World War II to be taken prisoner by the Japanese. More than seventy army nurses survived five months of combat conditions in the jungles of Bataan and Corregidor before being captured, only to endure more than three years in prison camps. When freedom came, the U.S. military ordered the nurses to sign agreements with the government not to discuss their horrific experiences. Evelyn Monahan and Rosemary Neidel-Greenlee have conducted numerous interviews with survivors and scoured archives for letters, diaries, and journals to uncover the heroism and sacrifices of these brave women.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0iUrtAXOI_0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Cook's Book Of Tomatoes","description":"?This is an indispensable book for anyone who cares about good food, how to get it, and how to put it on the table.  ?Nancy Harmon Jenkins, The Mediterranean Diet CookbookIn The Good Cook s Book of Tomatoes, an installment in the expertly researched and newly updated culinary series of the Good Cook s Books, award-winning author Michele Anna Jordan brings her creative zeal to one of the most popular fruits on the market.

If you're old enough, you remember the darkened room, the hum of the projector, and the beeep that signaled the teacher to turn to the next frame. If you weren't busy shooting spitballs, filmstrips might even have taught you something about science, hygiene, the great bounty of American farms and factories. With simple illustrations and quaint photographs that evoke a more innocent era, Change Your Underwear Twice a Week is the first book to collect dozens of these filmstrip treasures together, creating a panorama of four decades of overlooked graphic design, popular culture, and inadvertent humor. Readers from the Internet generation will get a good chuckle over what appears to be electronic cave art. But you'll also discover one of the great subtexts of postwar American life. From the mid-1940s until the late 1960s, filmstrips were the coming attractions of capitalism and the American way, teaching youngsters how society wanted them to view the world. Filmstrips celebrated our foundering railroads (\\"Tommy Takes a Train Trip\\"), the space program (\\"The Moon, Our Nearest Neighbor\\"), and our trusted friend the butcher, the milkman, the mailman, and the cop. They taught us not to sit too close to our new TV sets and why we should change our underwear twice a week (presumably, Commies did this only once a week). A chronicle of America's filmstrip experience, Change Your Underwear Twice a Week is also a glimpse into the companies and eccentric pioneers who created these graphic gems and how they influenced several generations of American youth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zkGTABHxg4AC&dq=Change+Your+Underwear+Twice+a+Week:+Lessons+from+the+Golden+Age+of+Classroom+Filmstrips&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raw Data","description":"Episodes in the history of data, from early modern math problems to today's inescapable \\"dataveillance,\\" that demonstrate the dependence of data on culture. We live in the era of Big Data, with storage and transmission capacity measured not just in terabytes but in petabytes (where peta- denotes a quadrillion, or a thousand trillion). Data collection is constant and even insidious, with every click and every \\"like\\" stored somewhere for something. This book reminds us that data is anything but \\"raw,\\" that we shouldn't think of data as a natural resource but as a cultural one that needs to be generated, protected, and interpreted. The book's essays describe eight episodes in the history of data from the predigital to the digital. Together they address such issues as the ways that different kinds of data and different domains of inquiry are mutually defining; how data are variously \\"cooked\\" in the processes of their collection and use; and conflicts over what can--or can't--be \\"reduced\\" to data. Contributors discuss the intellectual history of data as a concept; describe early financial modeling and some unusual sources for astronomical data; discover the prehistory of the database in newspaper clippings and index cards; and consider contemporary \\"dataveillance\\" of our online habits as well as the complexity of scientific data curation.

In the sixtieth anniversary year of the Catholic Worker, Rosalie Riegle Troester reconfirms the diversity and commitment of a movement that applies basic Christianity to social problems. Founded in 1933 by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin, the Catholic Worker has continued to apply the principles of voluntary poverty and nonviolence to changing social and political realities. Over 200 interviews with Workers from all over the United States reveal how people came to this movement, how they were changed by it, and how they faced contradictions between the Catholic Worker philosophy and the call of contemporary life. Vivid memoirs of Dorothy Day, Peter Maurin, and Ammon Hennacy are interwoven with accounts of involvement with labor unions, war resistance, and life on Catholic Worker farms. The author also addresses the Worker's relationship with the Catholic Church and with the movement's wrenching debates over abortion, homosexuality, and the role of women.

Second, these results introduce the analysis of the phylogenies of TEs and their interpretations, according to different models i.e. horizontal versus vertical transmission.

But there is another way of looking at film, and that is through its relationship with the visual arts  mainly painting, the oldest of the art forms. Art History for Filmmakers is an inspiring guide to how images from art can be used by filmmakers to establish period detail, and to teach composition, color theory and lighting. The book looks at the key moments in the development of the Western painting, and how these became part of the Western visual culture from which cinema emerges, before exploring how paintings can be representative of different genres, such as horror, sex, violence, realism and fantasy, and how the images in these paintings connect with cinema. Insightful case studies explore the links between art and cinema through the work of seven high-profile filmmakers, including Peter Greenaway, Peter Webber, Jack Cardiff, Martin Scorsese, Guillermo del Toro, Quentin Tarantino and Stan Douglas. A range of practical exercises are included in the text, which can be carried out singly or in small teams. Featuring stunning full-color images, Art History for Filmmakers provides budding filmmakers with a practical guide to how images from art can help to develop their understanding of the visual language of film.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AmFCDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Day of Reckoning: The Massacre at Columbine High School","description":"Who was the evilest of the evil, the baddest of,the bad?

Having secured for himself an unassailable position by manipulating Hitler into wiping out the SS's left-wing rivals, the SA, in The Night of the Long Knives, he continued to nurture political supremacy for himself while Hitler fought his military war. At the heart of Himmler's Secret War is the turning point of the war when, following the German defeat at Stalingrad, Himmler recognized that Germany would lose. Through his trusted envoy, Walter Schellenberg, he devoted much energy to negotiating his intended post-war role as the man who would lead Germany. He believed his intermediary, the British Ambassador in Sweden, Victor Mallet, was in direct contact with Winston Churchill. In fact, he was the victim of a highly effective sting by the Political Warfare Executive (PWE).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HJDMtAEACAAJ&dq=Himmler%27s+Secret+War:+The+Covert+Peace+Negotiations+of+Heinrich+Himmler&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gatecrashers: The Nicholas Everard World War II Saga Book 6","description":"A final volume in the Everard saga finds Paul, the son of Nick Everard, commanding a state-of-the-art miniature submarine on a mission to sabotage a formidable German battleship, an endeavor that is critical to the survival of an Arctic envoy being escorted by his father.

They were in for a surprise. For behind the walls of Wall Street's firms lies a stratum of stunted, overworked, abused, and in the end, very well-compensated, but very frustrated men and women. Monkey Business takes readers behind the scenes at Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette (DLJ), one of Wall Street's hottest firms of the 90s, from the interview process to the courting of clients to bonus time. It's a glimpse of a side of the business the financial periodicals don't talk about -- 20-hour work days, trips across the country where associates do nothing except carry the pitch book, strip clubs at night, inflated salaries, and high-powered, unforgettable personalities. Monkey Business provides readers with a first-class education in the real life of an investment banker. But best of all, it is an extremely funny read about two young men who, on their way towards achieving the American dream, quickly realized they were selling their souls to get there.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BGFZWAhDCgkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Artrex: Dark Hero","description":"\\"Only the shadow of death can grant you the spirit and the will to fight for your life...and the lives of others.\\" And such is the life of a Shadaal.

However, by great good fortune, he found himself in a position where his experience of things past could be adapted to the needs of a virtually untried aspect of warfare- that of Army/Air Force Co-operation. As an Army Officer in a world of high-ranking Airmen, it was his task to walk the tightrope between the two Services in an effort to persuade both parties that neither could win the war without the other and that co-operation was preferable to self-interest. The words 'prima donna' crop up frequently in the story and one is not surprised when the author remarks 'while we were organising signal exercises..and such necessary menial chores, at which the Services worked together without a hitch, our problem was to get the Great Chiefs to stop quaralling?. Although he describes his experiences with cheerful modisty, it is clear that this unsung 'armchair soldier' played a vital role in the back room battle that had to be resolved before the war proper could be waged with efficiency Apart from his being privy to much information that remained 'Top Secret' for many years after the war. Readers will soon see that his views on some of the Top Brass might have had unpleasant repercussions had they been aired too soon!

Jesse Pettey is one of these people who as a young man joined the military after the attack on Pearl Harbor because he felt it was his duty. He learned to fly a PT-19 and moved on to a BT-13. During World War Two, Pettey piloted a B-24 'Liberator' and flew his first combat mission in August of 1944, to be followed by 34 more. One More Mission is not only an account of World War Two aerial combat missions with the 15th Air Force in Italy, but of a young man's journey through a gauntlet of emotion, growth and trying experiences. Mr. Pettey's glimpses into his past are a heartwarming journey to a different era, a different pace and a different lifestyle. His talent carries the reader along through his upbringing in East Texas through the precarious days of flight training and then on to the dangerous excitement of deadly combat over the skies of Europe. And all the while, you feel as if he's sitting across a table from you with a cup of coffee in hand, sharing the times of his life with a close friend. His story is well written yet personal, inspiring and yet humble. It is a story that demands sharing. One More Mission is a journey not to be missed. Reviewed by Denise M.

Scant attention, however, has been paid the Niagara Campaign of 1814-the American army's ambitious but failed attempt to wrest Canada from British control. While a few writers have dealt with aspects of this effort, Richard Barbuto is the first to offer a comprehensive study of the entire campaign. Barbuto covers every aspect of a campaign that saw the American army come of age, even as its military leaders blundered away potential victory and the acquisition of a coveted expanse of North American territory. Vividly recreating the major battles on the Niagara peninsula at Chippawa, Lundy's Lane, Fort Erie, and Cook's Mill Barbuto also clarifies the role of these engagements within the overall framework of American strategy. Despite early success at Chippawa, four long months of fighting finally ended in something like a draw, with the British still in control of Canada. Barbuto argues convincingly that the American government was never really able to harness, coordinate, and focus its tremendous resources in ways that would have allowed the campaign to succeed. Much of the blame, he shows, can be attributed to the poor leadership and confused strategic thinking of President James Madison and his secretary of war, John Armstrong. The American effort was further undermined by manpower shortages, a few ineffective field commanders, and the army and navy's inability to coordinate their objectives and operations. Even so, Barbuto contends that the American soldier, led by the likes of Jacob Brown and the legendary Winfield Scott, performed surprisingly well against one of the great armies of the nineteenth century. Barbuto's analysis, unmarred by national bias, presents a balanced picture of these events from the perspective of all participants American, British, Canadian, and Native American. He also fills an important gap by providing the first ever capsule histories of all regimental-sized units involved in the campaign. Breathing new life into these events, his far-ranging study should become the definitive work on this long-neglected campaign.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XeR2AAAAMAAJ&dq=Niagara+1814:+America+Invades+Canada&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Be Young, Gifted and Black","description":"Fast paced, powerful, touching and hilarious, this kaleidoscope of constantly shifting scenes, mood and images recreates the world of a great American woman and artist, Lorraine Hansberry.

It's all here: how Joan, a humble maiden in an insignificant town, was told by St. Michael the Archangel, St. Catherine, and St. Margaret to lead the French in battle against the English; how she finally succeeded in convincing the French of the truth of her mission; how she met with fantastic success but was betrayed, captured, and imprisoned; and finally, how she suffered through a politically motivated trial for heresy and was burned at the stake.Best of all, de Wohl is not interested solely in the external details of Joan's life, but in Joan's all-encompassing love for God, which informed all her courageous actions from beginning to end. You'll not only thrill to Joan's heroism; your heart will delight in her example of loving surrender to God's will.

Hansen distinguishes between the city's seven political institutions: the Assembly, the nomothetai, the People's Court, the boards of magistrates, the Council of Five Hundred, the Areopagos, and ho boulomenos. He discusses how Athenians conceived liberty both as the ability to participate in the decision-making process and as the right to live without oppression from the state or other citizens.

Resources for Teaching Middle School Science, developed by the National Science Resources Center (NSRC), is a valuable tool for identifying and selecting effective science curriculum materials that will engage students in grades 6 through 8. The volume describes more than 400 curriculum titles that are aligned with the National Science Education Standards. This completely new guide follows on the success of Resources for Teaching Elementary School Science, the first in the NSRC series of annotated guides to hands-on, inquiry-centered curriculum materials and other resources for science teachers. The curriculum materials in the new guide are grouped in five chapters by scientific area-Physical Science, Life Science, Environmental Science, Earth and Space Science, and Multidisciplinary and Applied Science. They are also grouped by type-core materials, supplementary units, and science activity books. Each annotation of curriculum material includes a recommended grade level, a description of the activities involved and of what students can be expected to learn, a list of accompanying materials, a reading level, and ordering information. The curriculum materials included in this book were selected by panels of teachers and scientists using evaluation criteria developed for the guide. The criteria reflect and incorporate goals and principles of the National Science Education Standards. The annotations designate the specific content standards on which these curriculum pieces focus. In addition to the curriculum chapters, the guide contains six chapters of diverse resources that are directly relevant to middle school science. Among these is a chapter on educational software and multimedia programs, chapters on books about science and teaching, directories and guides to science trade books, and periodicals for teachers and students. Another section features institutional resources. One chapter lists about 600 science centers, museums, and zoos where teachers can take middle school students for interactive science experiences. Another chapter describes nearly 140 professional associations and U.S. government agencies that offer resources and assistance. Authoritative, extensive, and thoroughly indexed-and the only guide of its kind-Resources for Teaching Middle School Science will be the most used book on the shelf for science teachers, school administrators, teacher trainers, science curriculum specialists, advocates of hands-on science teaching, and concerned parents.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XgOdAgAAQBAJ&dq=Science+Plus,+1997:+Technology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blue Spots!

Informed by the conviction that humanistic thinking has relevance for everyday life, the magazine has long maintained a rare space for thoughtful dialogue between a wide range of political views, philosophical perspectives, and personal experiences: its contributors include liberals and conservatives, philosophers and activists, Marxists and Catholics, New Yorkers and Midwesterners. A little more than a decade since its founding on the campus of the University of Chicago, it offers a unique and revelatory look at the changing face of America, one that speaks not only to way American minds have been forced to  open  by a decade of trauma and transformation, but also to the challenge of remaining open to our fellow citizens during our deeply divided present. Featuring award-winning and highly acclaimed essays from The Point s first ten years, The Opening of the American Mind traces the path of American intellect from the magazine s inception in 2009, when Barack Obama was ascending the steps of the White House, to the brink of the 2020 election. The essays, chosen both for the way they capture their time and transcend it, are assembled into five sections that address cycles of cultural frustrations, social movements, and the aftermath of the 2016 election, and provide lively, forward-looking considerations of how we might expand our imaginations into the future. Spanning the era of Obama and Trump, Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter, #MeToo and renewed attention to reparations, this anthology offers critical reflections on some of the decade s most influential events and stands as a testament to the significance of open exchange. The intellectual dialogue provided by The Point has never been more urgently needed, and this collection will bring the magazine s vital work to an even broader readership.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CyL_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Survey of Palestine : Prepared in December, 1945 and January, 1946 for the Information of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry (Volume 1 of 3)","description":"This is a history of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a violent Marxist faction within the Palestinian national movement.

Do you think that perhaps a key to conflict resolution must come from within? How can teachers and pre-service teachers help their students learn and use strategies for conflict resolution? Tools for Conflict Resolution is a practical method for teaching conflict resolution skills to students in grades K-12. Conflict is a part of everyone's life. It is the authors' belief that if each student is given tools for handling conflict, and these tools are used each time conflict arises that soon students become proficient conflict managers. This book begins with a chapter, which introduces Peter Senge's five disciplines: Personal Mastery, Mental Models, Shared Vision, Team Building, and Systems Thinking. After reading this chapter, the reader is able to embrace the five disciplines and begin practicing the adult level. As teachers, we teach from who we are. The rest of the book is filled with actual lesson plans, which are directly tied to the Multiple Intelligences Theory and are developmentally appropriate for students. Case studies, role- plays, skits, literature, songs, and co-operative learning activities are the primary instructional methods used to teach students conflict resolution skills. An annotated bibliography is included to assist teachers in extending lessons. These lessons may be taught during Social Studies as a unit on character education or could be used during a guidance class.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6jrm2vsCFSAC&dq=Tools+for+Conflict+Resolution:+A+Practical+K-12+Program+Based+on+Peter+Senge%27s+5th+Discipline&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manual of Steel Construction: Volume ll connections.","description":"Includes bibliographical references and index.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0_QeAQAAIAAJ&dq=Manual+of+Steel+Construction:+Volume+ll+connections.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Where's the Toast?

Hobsbawm's column led to his writing a critical history, The Jazz Scene (1959). This enhanced edition from 1993 adds later writings by Hobsbawm in which he meditates further 'on why jazz is not only a marvellous noise but a central concern for anyone concerned with twentieth-century society and the twentieth-century arts.' 'All the greats are covered in passing (Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday), while further space is given to Duke Ellington, Ray Charles, Thelonious Monk, Mahalia Jackson, and Sidney Bechet ... Perhaps Hobsbawm's tastiest comments are about the business side and work ethics, where his historian's eye strips the jazz scene down to its commercial spine.'

Based on the author s own teaching experience, it covers the analysis of simple electrical circuits consisting of a few essential components using fundamental and well-known methods and techniques. Although the above content has been included in other circuit analysis books, this one aims at teaching young engineers not only from electrical and electronics engineering, but also from other areas, such as mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, mining engineering, and chemical engineering, with unique pedagogical features such as a puzzle-like approach and negative-case examples (such as the unique  When Things Go Wrong...  section at the end of each chapter). Believing that the traditional texts in this area can be overwhelming for beginners, the author approaches his subject by providing numerous examples for the student to solve and practice before learning more complicated components and circuits. These exercises and problems will provide instructors with in-class activities and tutorials, thus establishing this book as the perfect complement to the more traditional texts. All examples and problems contain detailed analysis of various circuits, and are solved using a  recipe  approach, providing a code that motivates students to decode and apply to real-life engineering scenarios Covers the basic topics of resistors, voltage and current sources, capacitors and inductors, Ohm s and Kirchhoff s Laws, nodal and mesh analysis, black-box approach, and Thevenin/Norton equivalent circuits for both DC and AC cases in transient and steady states Aims to stimulate interest and discussion in the basics, before moving on to more modern circuits with higher-level components Includes more than 130 solved examples and 120 detailed exercises with supplementary solutions Accompanying website to provide supplementary materials www.wiley.com/go/ergul4412","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lFvMDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theme of the Pentateuch (Journal for the Study of the Old Testament)","description":"This popular textbook regards the Pentateuch as a literary whole, with a single theme that binds it together.

Entries are arranged in dictionary style, but a knowledge of Greek is not necessary to use the book, since an English-Greek index provides the reader with Greek equivalents of English terms, with cross-reference to the main text. Its great value is that it isolates terms and allows the reader to follow their individual careers, while at the same time it offers an evolutionary history of the concept instead of a mere definition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JPQ8DAAAQBAJ&dq=Greek+Philosophical+Terms:+A+historical+Lexicon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stray Birds","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A history of pantomime","description":"\\"A History of Pantomime\\" by R.

Author John Thackara has spent a lifetime roving the globe in search of design that serves human needs. In this clear-eyed but ultimately optimistic book, he argues that, in our eagerness to find big technological solutions, we have all too often ignored the astonishing creativity generated when people work together and in harmony with the world around them. Drawing on an inspiring range of examples, from a temple-led water management system in Bali that dates back hundreds of years to an innovative e-bike collective in Vienna, Thackara shows that below the radar of the mainstream media there are global communities creating a replacement economy--one that nurtures the earth and its inhabitants rather than jeopardizing its future--from the ground up. Each chapter is devoted to a concern all humans share--land and water management, housing, what we eat, what we wear, our health, how and why we travel--and demonstrates that it is possible to live a rich and fulfilling life based on stewardship rather than exploitation of the natural environment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zo0HvgAACAAJ&dq=NEXT+ECONOMY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best American Short Stories 2005 (Best American (TM))","description":"Collects nature- and science-based essays by such authors as Anne Fadiman, Brian Hayes, Cullen Murphy, and Gary Taubes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-PZdHQuUzN8C&dq=The+Best+American+Short+Stories+2005+(Best+American+(TM))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Illustrated History of South Africa: The Real Story (Expanded Third Edition)","description":"Focus: Music of South Africa provides an in-depth look at the full spectrum of South African music, a musical culture that epitomizes the enormous ethnic, religious, linguistic, class, and gender diversity of the nation itself.

However, instead of serving just as an account of Adams  deeds, The Education of Henry Adams is a series of observations and introspections Adams makes on social changes, scientific advancements, personal relationships, professional success, travel, religion, war, and education. Born into the privilege of wealth and the renowned success of his ancestors, President John Adams and President John Quincy Adams, Adams received an education from notable schools, such as Harvard. He continued his prestigious education in Berlin, studying law and the German language. Despite his formal education, Adams felt unprepared to face the changing dynamics of his country, including shifts in social, religious, political, and scientific beliefs. For this reason, Adams advocates for  self-education  through experience, friendships, and reading. In his autobiography, Adams endorses studying American history and science in school, and encourages the process of self-educating after one s formal education. With a set of strong political and religious beliefs, Adams invokes a substantial impression with his perspectives on the on-going transformation of the United States of America. Henry Adams  autobiography, The Education of Henry Adams, has earned remarkable acclaim, including receiving a Pulitzer Prize. As a man who had direct access to many American political offices, including the presidential cabinet, the senate, and the congress, Adams had an intimate view of the innerworkings of American politics, and lived through social changes such as the Civil War, the abolition of slavery, scientific advancements, shifts in religious views, and the first World War. Though he felt his formal education left him unprepared for such happenings, Adams encourages readers to learn from their experiences and relationships. The Education of Henry Adams offers invaluable insight on the rapid changes in society, and reminds readers that one s education is never finished. Now with a new, eye-catching cover design and reprinted in a modern font, The Education of Henry Adams by Henry Adams is more accessible than ever and able to offer modern-day readers insight on historical events and philosophy of learning that will always be relevant.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nPIIEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ben and Shadoe (The Hunters, Book 5)","description":"AN ADRENALINE-FUELLED THRILLER FROM THE #1 BESTSELLING AUTHOR  Deadly conspiracies, bone-crunching action and a tormented hero with a heart . . . packs a real punch  Andy McDermott","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HHE5w-5KXsgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The logic of scientific discovery","description":"Described by the philosopher A.J.

We need to think of ourselves as good people and are troubled when we compromise our integrity to be successful and important. In Living a Life That Matters, Rabbi Kushner suggests that the path to a truly successful and significant life lies in friendship, family, acts of generosity and self-sacrifice, as well as in God's forgiving nature. He describes how, in changing the life of even one person in a positive way, we make a difference in the world, give our lives meaning, and prove that we do, in fact, matter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8XuwSNgiC9AC&dq=Living+a+Life+That+Matters:+Resolving+the+Conflict+Between+Conscience+and+Success&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"\\"Hey, Whipple, Squeeze This\\": A Guide to Creating Great Ads (Adweek Magazine Series)","description":"The classic guide to creating great advertising now covers all media: Digital, Social, and Traditional Hey Whipple, Squeeze This has helped generations of young creatives make their mark in the field.

In Refrigeration Nation, Jonathan Rees explores the innovative methods and gadgets that Americans have invented to keep perishable food cold from cutting river and lake ice and shipping it to consumers for use in their iceboxes to the development of electrically powered equipment that ushered in a new age of convenience and health. As much a history of successful business practices as a history of technology, this book illustrates how refrigeration has changed the everyday lives of Americans and why it remains so important today. Beginning with the natural ice industry in 1806, Rees considers a variety of factors that drove the industry, including the point and product of consumption, issues of transportation, and technological advances. Rees also shows that how we obtain and preserve perishable food is related to our changing relationship with the natural world. \\"A smart and illuminating book that will be of great interest to anyone engaged with either the history of technology or the history of food.\\" American Historical Review \\"Rees has written an entertaining, well-narrated, and well-researched book about building one root infrastructure of modern food systems.\\" Business History \\"Refrigeration Nation is a well-written and useful book for both scholars and students . . .

A tale of redemption, in which storytelling itself is the source of salvation, it won the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize. Rarely has a book so swiftly found its place on the literary landscape. And now we have  Tis, the story of Frank s American journey from impoverished immigrant to brilliant teacher and raconteur. Frank lands in New York at age nineteen, in the company of a priest he meets on the boat. He gets a job at the Biltmore Hotel, where he immediately encounters the vivid hierarchies of this  classless country,  and then is drafted into the army and is sent to Germany to train dogs and type reports. It is Frank s incomparable voice his uncanny humor and his astonishing ear for dialogue that renders these experiences spellbinding. When Frank returns to America in 1953, he works on the docks, always resisting what everyone tells him, that men and women who have dreamed and toiled for years to get to America should  stick to their own kind  once they arrive. Somehow, Frank knows that he should be getting an education, and though he left school at fourteen, he talks his way into New York University. There, he falls in love with the quintessential Yankee, long-legged and blonde, and tries to live his dream. But it is not until he starts to teach and to write that Frank finds his place in the world. The same vulnerable but invincible spirit that captured the hearts of readers in Angela s Ashes comes of age. As Malcolm Jones said in his Newsweek review of Angela s Ashes,  It is only the best storyteller who can so beguile his readers that he leaves them wanting more when he is done...and McCourt proves himself one of the very best.  Frank McCourt's  Tis is one of the most eagerly awaited books of our time, and it is a masterpiece.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kI2EQAAACAAJ&dq=Tis:+A+Memoir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"She's a Bad Motorcycle: Writers on Riding","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k8FuzgEACAAJ&dq=She%27s+a+Bad+Motorcycle:+Writers+on+Riding&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Active Assessment for Active Science: A Guide for Elementary School Teachers","description":"Active Assessment for Active Science meets the needs of teachers faced with the task of assessing hands-on science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=txYXAQAAMAAJ&dq=Active+Assessment+for+Active+Science:+A+Guide+for+Elementary+School+Teachers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christmas at Cliffhanger Inn","description":"Mystery always follows the women of the Writer's Club but this time with holiday flair!

Reluctantly, Josef Stalin agreed to provide the requisite air cover, introducing the superior swept-wing MiG-15 to counter the American's straight-wing F-80 jets. This in turn prompted the USAF to deploy its very best  the F-86A Sabre  to counter this threat. Thus began a two-and-a-half-year struggle in the skies known as  MiG Alley.  In this period, the unrelenting campaign for aerial superiority witnessed the introduction of successive models of these two revolutionary jets into combat. This meticulously researched study not only provides technical descriptions of the two types and their improved variants, complete with a  fighter pilot's assessment  of these aircraft, but also chronicles the entire scope of their aerial duel in  MiG Alley  by employing the recollections of the surviving combatants  including Russian, Chinese, and North Korean pilots  who participated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7a-HCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Upon the Shoulders of Vengeance: The Journey to Armageddon","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mystery play;: A farce","description":"THE STORY: The action is set in the chic living room of a U.S. Senator, during a cocktail party.

The international information they gathered and the capital they generated enabled them to play central roles in state building and economic development. During the Revolution, they helped the U.S. negotiate foreign loans, sell state debts, and establish a single national bank. Afterward, they increased their influence by lending money to the federal government and to its citizens. Even as federal and state governments began to encroach on their domain, maritime insurers adapted, preserving their autonomy and authority through extensive involvement in the formation of commercial law. Leveraging their claims to unmatched expertise, they operated free from government interference while simultaneously embedding themselves into the nation's institutional fabric. By the early nineteenth century, insurers were no longer just risk assessors. They were nation builders and market makers. Deeply and imaginatively researched, Underwriters of the United States uses marine insurers to reveal a startlingly original story of risk, money, and power in the founding era.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=84opEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Trespass of the Sign: Deconstruction, Theology, and Philosophy (Perspectives in Continental Philosophy)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7JkZygEACAAJ&dq=The+Trespass+of+the+Sign:+Deconstruction,+Theology,+and+Philosophy+(Perspectives+in+Continental+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sounding","description":"(Book).

In this book David Anrias shows what each sign looks like when rising. He goes further and, dividing each sign into 10 degree sections (known as \\"decanates\\"), shows how appearance changes, from early degrees, to middle degrees, to late degrees of the same sign. All 36 drawings are by the author himself, who was an accomplished artist and a keen observer. Twelve of these you will find in the frontispiece, the remaining 24 are in Book 1, chapter 7. While other artists have sketched the twelve basic types, and one or two have given variations on some of them, Anrias is the only astrological artist/writer to make systematic sketches of all 36 variations.Anrias follows this with deft character sketches. If a given decanate (the third decanate of Libra, for example) produces a distinct face, it also produces a distinct personality. Of this book, Dr. H., of Regulus Astrology LLC (author of A Rectification Manual; America is Born) writes, \\"I find Anrias' use of the decans based on triplicities more accurate than Chaldean decans for application in physiognomy judgments.\\"DAVID ANRIAS, the pen-name of Brian Ross, served with the British forces in World War I. A natural sensitive, after the war he joined the Theosophical Society, studied in India, and wasassociated with Jiddu Krishnamurti's ill-fated Order of the Star in the East. He strenuously disagreed with Krishnamurti's decision to dissolve it. Anrias's intense study of theosophy and metaphysics enlivens his astrology, making his book most fascinatingreading.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2XKJ-9jTz3wC&dq=Man+and+the+zodiac&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reckless Abandon","description":"Find out what God is doing in your generation and fling yourself into it!Throughout history ther are always those who understand the times and possess the knowledge of what to do.

At present, he is the head of the alternating-current machine laboratory at the Moscow Institute of Power Engineering. He is also a world-renowned chess player. He was born in 1911, and by 1935 had become a Grandmaster of Soviet chess. In 1948 he won the world chess championship and held the title until 1963 (except for a two-year break). His chess style has been characterized as deep, objective, serious, and courageous. In this book, the quality of his thinking is revealed in his study of the basic thought processes of master chess players, and his reduction of these processes to mathematical form. This formalization of thought processes is a contribution to science at three levels: at the immediate level, it provides a basis for a computer program that seems likely to succeed in playing chess; at the middle level, game-playing programs help us to study and rationalize the processes of planning and decision-making; and, at the highest level, the study of the mind in action, as in the game of chess, leads to an understanding of human thought and of the human psyche.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OKTqBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dickens: His Work and His World","description":"Presents the life and accomplishments of the English author, with discussions on some of his most popular works, including \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and \\"David Copperfield.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sl7hAAAAMAAJ&dq=Dickens:+His+Work+and+His+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bienvenidos: Glencoe Spanish 1","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Bc9frzdAHZ4C&dq=Bienvenidos:+Glencoe+Spanish+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moongirl: A full-length play","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6A95Zw7wo1YC&dq=Moongirl:+A+full-length+play&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Damien the leper","description":"Father Damien, famous for his missionary work with exiled lepers on the Hawaiian island of Molokai, is finally Saint Damien. His sanctity took 120 years to become officially recognized, but between his death in 1889 and his canonization in 2009--amid creeping secularization and suspicion of the missionary spirit he so much embodied--Fr. Damien De Veuster never faded from the world's memory. What kept him there? What keeps him there now? To find an answer, Belgian historian and journalist Jan De Volder sifted through Father Damien's personal correspondence as well as the Vatican archives. With careful and even-handed expertise, De Volder follows Father Damien's transformation from the stout, somewhat haughty missionary of his youth, bounding from Europe to Hawaii and straight into seemingly tireless priestly work, to the humble and loving shepherd of souls who eventually succumbed to the same disease that ravaged his flock. De Volder finds that--as spiritual father, caretaker, teacher, and advocate--Father Damien accomplished many heroic feats for these poor outcasts. Yet the greatest gift he gave them was their transformation from a disordered, lawless throng exiled in desperate anarchy into a living community built on Jesus Christ, a community in which they learned to care for one another. Every generation seems to have its own image of this world-famous priest. Already during his life on Molokai and at his death in 1889, many considered him a holy man. Even today, in the highly secularized Western world, he is widely admired. In 2005 his native Belgium honored him with the title \\"the greatest Belgian\\" in polling conducted by their public broadcasting service. Statues honor his memory in the National Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., and at the entrance to the Hawaiian State Capitol in Honolulu. In 1995, in the presence of Mother Teresa of Calcutta, Pope John Paul II beatified him in Brussels, Belgium; and in 2009 Pope Benedict XVI canonized him in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Today Father Damien is the unofficial patron of outcasts and those afflicted with HIV/AIDS. Illustrated with many photos. De Volder contends that the common thread running through the saint's life, the spirit of Father Damien that so speaks to the world, is at once uniquely Christian, fully human, and as important today as ever before.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1YxHDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lennon - The Solo Years (Easy Guitar Series)","description":"An anthology of his music during the years after the break-up of the Beatles.

Might invisibility be regarded not simply as refuge, but as a condition with its own meaning and power? The impulse to escape notice is not about complacent isolation or senseless conformity, but about maintaining identity, autonomy, and voice. In our networked and image-saturated lives, the notion of disappearing has never been more alluring. Today, we are relentlessly encouraged, even conditioned, to reveal, share, and promote ourselves. The pressure to be public comes not just from our peers, but from vast and pervasive technology companies that want to profit from patterns in our behavior. A lifelong student and observer of the natural world, Busch sets out to explore her own uneasiness with this arrangement, and what she senses is a widespread desire for a less scrutinized way of life for invisibility. Writing in rich painterly detail about her own life, her family, and some of the world s most exotic and remote places, she savors the pleasures of being unseen. Discovering and dramatizing a wonderful range of ways of disappearing, from virtual reality goggles that trick the wearer into believing her body has disappeared to the way Virginia Woolf s Mrs. Dalloway finds a sense of affiliation with the world around her as she ages, Busch deliberates on subjects new and old with equal sensitivity and incisiveness. How to Disappear is a unique and exhilarating accomplishment, overturning the dangerous modern assumption that somehow fame and visibility equate to success and happiness. Busch presents a field guide to invisibility, reacquainting us with the merits of remaining inconspicuous, and finding genuine alternatives to a life of perpetual exposure. Accessing timeless truths in order to speak to our most urgent contemporary problems, she inspires us to develop a deeper appreciation for personal privacy in a vast and intrusive world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cKhbDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Procopius: History of the Wars, Vol. 4, Books 6.16-7.35: Gothic War (Loeb Classical Library, No. 173) (English and Greek Edition)","description":"Procopius, born at Caesarea in Palestine late in the 5th century, became a lawyer. In 527 CE he was made legal adviser and secretary of Belisarius, commander against the Persians, and went with Belisarius again in 533 against the Vandals and in 535 against the Ostrogoths. Sometime after 540 he returned to Constantinople. He may have been that Procopius who was prefect of Constantinople in 562, but the date of his death (after 558) is unknown. Procopius's History of the Wars in 8 books recounts the Persian Wars of emperors Justinus and Justinian down to 550 (2 books); the Vandalic War and after-events in Africa 532-546 (2 books); the Gothic War against the Ostrogoths in Sicily and Italy 536-552 (3 books); and a sketch of events to 554 (1 book). The whole consists largely of military history, with much information about peoples and places as well, and about special events. He was a diligent, careful, judicious narrator of facts and developments and shows good powers of description. He is just to the empire's enemies and boldly criticises emperor Justinian. Other works by Procopius are the Anecdota or Secret History--vehement attacks on Justinian, Theodora, and others; and The Buildings of Justinian (down to 558 CE) including roads and bridges as well as churches, forts, hospitals, and so on in various parts of the empire. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Procopius is in seven volumes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a12ujgEACAAJ&dq=Procopius:+History+of+the+Wars,+Vol.+4,+Books+6.16-7.35:+Gothic+War+(Loeb+Classical+Library,+No.+173)+(English+and+Greek+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Constructing the Political Spectacle","description":"Thanks to the ready availability of political news today, informed citizens can protect and promote their own interests and the public interest more effectively.

At the same time the endeavour has been made to illustrate the part which Buddhist thought has played in the whole development of Asiatic culture, and to suggest a part of the significance it may still possess for modern thinkers.  The way of the Buddha is not, indeed, concerned directly with the order of the world, for it calls on higher men to leave the marketplace. But the order of the world can only be established on a foundation of knowledge: every evil is ultimately traceable to ignorance. It is necessary, then, to recognize the world for what it truly is. Gautama teaches us that the marks of this life are imperfection, transcience, and the absence of any changeless individuality. He sets before us a summum bonum closely akin to the Christian mystic conception of  self-naughting.  Here are definite statements which must be either true or false, and a clearly defined goal which we must either accept or refuse. If the statements be false, and if the goal be worthless, it is of the highest importance that the former should be refuted and the latter discredited. But if the diagnosis be correct and the aim worthy, it is at least of equal importance that this should be generally recognized: for we cannot wish to perpetuate as the basis of our sociology a view of life that is demonstrably false or a purpose demonstrably contrary to our conception of the good.  This book is designed, therefore, not as an addition to our already overburdened libraries of information, but as a definite contribution to the philosophy of life.  Ananada K.

In Author Unknown, Don Foster reveals a starling fact: since no two people use language in precisely the same way, our identities are encoded in our own language, a kind of literary DNA. Combining traditional scholarship with modern technology, Foster has discovered how to unlock that code and, in the process, has invented an entire field of investigation--literary forensics--by which it becomes possible to catch anonymous authors as they ultimately betray their identities with their own words. Foster's unique skills first came to light when a front-page New York Times article announced his discovery that a previously unattributed poem was written by Shakespeare. A few weeks later, Foster solved the mystery that had obsessed America for months when he identified Joe Klein as the author of Primary Colors. Foster also took on the case of an oddball California bag lady who many believed to be the elusive Thomas Pynchon. His contributions to the Unabomber case takes us inside the tangled mind of Ted Kaczynski. And, in the final chapter, Foster makes a surprising-and heartening-discovery about a beloved holiday icon. As entertaining as it is eye opening, Author Unknown shows us how Don Foster uses his unusual methods to search out the hidden identities behind anonymous documents of all kinds. Anyone who reads this remarkable book will find it impossible to read-or write-in the same way as before.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GIW-PAAACAAJ&dq=Author+Unknown:+Tales+of+a+Literary+Detective&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FEG: Ridiculous Stupid Poems for Intelligent Children","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Test Book - DO NOT BUY","description":"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American women. Although cardiovascular-related deaths significantly outnumber breast cancer deaths, breast cancer is arguably the most feared diagnosis among American women. Great strides have been made to heighten public awareness of breast cancer, with particular emphasis on early detection with mammography. Breast radiologists regularly witness the extreme anxiety that just the thought of being diagnosed with breast cancer can cause a patient. This anxious anticipation is often heightened by a lack of knowledge about what to expect from the process of breast imaging evaluation, which is frustrating for both patient and practitioner and can negatively affect the experience. Physicians often encounter patients who have little or no understanding of the reasoning behind the examination or procedure about to be performed-sometimes even up to the day of their breast cancer surgery. Furthermore, most women who undergo breast evaluations will not be diagnosed with cancer. The incidence of breast cancer is only 125.3 per 100,000 women (or 3-6 in every 1,000 screenings), however, symptoms of benign breast abnormalities are quite common and impact many more lives. Accurately diagnosing these non-cancerous conditions can alleviate much anxiety, in addition to helping patients towards a correct treatment plan. The Breast Test Book is a straightforward guide to the process of radiologic breast evaluations. Based on the most current scientific research and best standards of clinical practice, it will help debunk myths, shed light on misinformation, and provide clear facts about what women should expect from these screenings. This improved understanding will ultimately allow patients to play more active roles in their own care and, in the event that a diagnosis is made, give them confidence in their treatment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3WEwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Test+Book+-+DO+NOT+BUY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Piercing the Shields of Justice: Inside the Atf","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xi5TAAAACAAJ&dq=Piercing+the+Shields+of+Justice:+Inside+the+Atf&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Civil Engineering: Problems and Solutions (Pe Exam Preparation)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JiJWAAAAMAAJ&dq=Civil+Engineering:+Problems+and+Solutions+(Pe+Exam+Preparation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best American Mystery Stories 2006","description":"Presents a collection of mystery stories selected from magazines in the United States and Canada","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qn5AAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Best+American+Mystery+Stories+2006&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spirits, Fairies, Gnomes, and Goblins Pb","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2m4OAQAAMAAJ&dq=Spirits,+Fairies,+Gnomes,+and+Goblins+Pb&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blame It on Eve","description":"Advises Christian women on the importance of abandoning the pursuit of personal perfection and control in favor of embracing the purpose that God has set out for them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vUUq6n3pEmEC&dq=Blame+It+on+Eve&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the Mexique Bay (A Vintage book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KsldtQEACAAJ&dq=Beyond+the+Mexique+Bay+(A+Vintage+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Covert Action","description":"The dramatic, untold story of one of the CIA s most successful Cold War intelligence operations. December, 1981 the CIA receives word that the Polish government has cut telephone communications with the West and closed the Polish border. The agency s leaders quickly inform President Ronald Reagan, who is enjoying a serene weekend at Camp David. Within hours, Prime Minister Wojciech Jaruzelski has appeared on Polish national television to announce the establishment of martial law. A new era in Cold War politics has begun: Washington and Moscow are on a collision course. In this gripping narrative history, Seth G. Jones reveals the little-known story of the CIA s subsequent operations in Poland, which produced a landmark victory for democracy during the Cold War. While the Soviet-backed Polish government worked to crush a budding liberal opposition movement, the CIA began a sophisticated intelligence campaign, code-named QRHELPFUL, that supported dissident groups. The most powerful of these groups was Solidarity, a trade union that swelled to a membership of ten million and became one of the first legitimate anti-Communist opposition movements in Eastern Europe. With President Reagan s support, the CIA provided money that helped Solidarity print newspapers, broadcast radio programs, and conduct a wide-ranging information warfare campaign against the Soviet-backed government. QRHELPFUL proved vital in establishing a free and democratic Poland. Long overlooked by CIA historians and Reagan biographers, the story of QRHELPFUL features an extraordinary cast of characters including spymaster Bill Casey, CIA officer Richard Malzahn, Polish-speaking CIA case officer Celia Larkin, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, and Pope John Paul II. Based on in-depth interviews and recently declassified evidence, A Covert Action celebrates a decisive victory over tyranny for U.S. intelligence behind the Iron Curtain, one that prefigured the Soviet collapse.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=esI6DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Happy Birthday, Josefina!: A Springtime Story: Book 4 (The American Girls Collection)","description":"Josefina hopes to become a \\"curandera\\" or healer like Ti+a7a Magdalena, and she is tested just before her tenth birthday when her Pueblo Indian friend Mariana receives a potentially fatal snakebite.

British Catholic writer and artist Caryll Houselander lovingly explores Mary s intimately human side, depicting Our Lady as a musical instrument who makes divine love known to the world. This refreshed edition is rich and rewarding reading for all Christians who wonder what Mary was really like. While the Second Vatican Council led to a renewed interest in the theology and person of Mary, Caryll Houselander offered a simple yet profound reflection on the Mother of God almost fifteen years before the council began. Confronting the static, surreal  Madonna of the Christmas card,  Houselander provides instead an intuitive, warmly human, and approachable image of the Mother of God. Through the central image of a reed that is played for music, Houselander demonstrates how Mary chose to make herself an instrument for the divine plan, giving her inmost being to the proclamation of God s greatness. In sharing her distinctive vision of Mary, Houselander offers the Mother of God as a model for all people seeking to be instruments of the Divine. The essays and poems in The Reed of God also reflect on the mysteries of Mary s life and her impact on salvation history. In the book s four parts, Houselander explores key events of Mary s life, including her fiat, finding Jesus in the Temple, and the Assumption, as well as the themes of fruitful emptiness and the eternal search for union with God.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tXZNCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Even a Geek Can Speak: Low-Tech Presentation Skills for High-Tech People","description":"Whether you're seeking investors for the latest start-up or simply looking for that competitive edge, this book will help you articulate and sell the complex ideas that dominate our technology-driven business environment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uaYHDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rees Howells, Intercessor","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Bj3UDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Decolonial Voices: Chicana and Chicano Cultural Studies in the 21st Century","description":"The interdisciplinary essays in Decolonial Voices discuss racialized, subaltern, feminist, and diasporic identities and the aesthetic politics of hybrid and mestiza/o cultural productions.

He laid the fundamentals for the theory of solids and has been called the ?father of solid-state physics.? His numerous, valuable contributions include the theory of magnetism, measurement of the magnetic moment of the neutron, nuclear magnetic resonance, and the infrared problem in quantum electrodynamics.Statistical mechanics is a crucial subject which explores the understanding of the physical behaviour of many-body systems that create the world around us. Bloch's first-year graduate course at Stanford University was the highlight for several generations of students. Upon his retirement, he worked on a book based on the course. Unfortunately, at the time of his death, the writing was incomplete.This book has been prepared by Professor John Dirk Walecka from Bloch's unfinished masterpiece. It also includes three sets of Bloch's handwritten lecture notes (dating from 1949, 1969 and 1976), and details of lecture notes taken in 1976 by Brian Serot, who gave an invaluable opinion of the course from a student's perspective.

Drawing on exclusive access to J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and a tightly bonded team of bankers known on Wall Street as the  Morgan Mafia,  as well as in-depth interviews with dozens of other key players, including Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, Tett brings to life in gripping detail how the Morgan team s bold ideas for a whole new kind of financial alchemy helped to ignite a revolution in banking, and how that revolution escalated wildly out of control. The deeply reported and lively narrative takes readers behind the scenes, to the inner sanctums of elite finance and to the secretive reaches of what came to be known as the  shadow banking  world. The story begins with the intense Morgan brainstorming session in 1994 beside a pool in Boca Raton, where the team cooked up a dazzling new idea for the exotic financial product known as credit derivatives. That idea would rip around the banking world, catapult Morgan to the top of the turbocharged derivatives trade, and fuel an extraordinary banking boom that seemed to have unleashed banks from ages-old constraints of risk. But when the Morgan team s derivatives dream collided with the housing boom, and was perverted through hubris, delusion, and sheer greed by titans of banking that included Citigroup, UBS, Deutsche Bank, and the thundering herd at Merrill Lynch even as J.P. Morgan itself stayed well away from the risky concoctions others were peddling catastrophe followed. Tett s access to Dimon and the J.P. Morgan leaders who so skillfully steered their bank away from the wild excesses of others sheds invaluable light not only on the untold story of how they engineered their bank s escape from carnage but also on how possible it was for the larger banking world, regulators, and rating agencies to have spotted, and heeded, the terrible risks of a meltdown. A tale of blistering brilliance and willfully blind ambition, Fool s Gold is both a rare journey deep inside the arcane and wildly competitive world of high finance and a vital contribution to understanding how the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression was perpetrated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9aQOCMEI7m8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emerald Sea (The Council Wars)","description":"Now with all new content by John Ringo!

Those who persisted in escaping from other camps were sent to the impregnable fortress of Colditz Castle, situated on a rocky outcrop high above the River Mulde. Once within the walls of the castle, the Germans reasoned, escape was impossible. And yet many prisoners attempted escape and many succeeded Pat Reid was one of those men. Appointed 'Escape Officer' by his fellow inmates, he masterminded many of the attempts. From tunnelling, to hiding in rubbish sacks, disguising themselves as German officers and even leaping from the castle walls, nothing was too dangerous or foolhardy compared to imprisonment by the enemy. Reid's own escape, in 1942, was both one of the most simple and the most daring. First published in 1952, The Colditz Story is a classic escape story in the tradition of The Great Escape and The Wooden Horse.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=72x0oAEACAAJ&dq=The+Colditz+story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"UNIX Internals: The New Frontiers","description":"This book offers an up-to-date, in-depth, and broad-based exploration of the latest advances in UNIX-based operating systems.

The Santa Catalina Mountains first captivated Tony Zimmerman on a 1937 hunting trip. Regard for the alpine beauty must have been in his genes he was the son of Swiss German immigrants and by 1940 the Tucson schoolteacher had begun taking his family to Mount Lemmon to spend the summer. Back then, the road up the mountain was a rough two-track dirt road from Oracle, and Summerhaven was nothing but a sleepy cluster of summer cabins. But Tony Zimmerman was to help change all of that. The Road to Mount Lemmon is a beguiling memoir of the Catalina Mountains told by the daughter of one of the pioneers in the life and development of Mount Lemmon s communities. Mary Ellen Barnes tells how her father Tony resigned from teaching in 1943 to devote his career to the development of this mountain oasis. He not only sold real estate for long time landowner Randolph Jenks, he even bought the village s tiny two-room store, installing a sawmill to build a larger store, and built the Mount Lemmon Inn. And as she spins Tony s personal saga, she also gives readers a glimpse of the Catalinas before Tucson became a boom town, recalling idyllic adventures in wild country and the cowboys, rangers, ranchers, and loggers who worked there. Barnes tells Tony s story as if sharing it with family, evoking her father s personality on every page. The Road to Mount Lemmon is an intimate view of a mountain community over the course of nearly sixty years a view that few people have shared but one all can appreciate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l0UhDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The storybook cookbook","description":"Twenty-two recipes that have their origins in favorite children's books, with the passages from the books which describe the foods.

Dr. Maslow, the pioneer behind elemental concepts including the hierarchy of needs and the human search for self-actualization, innately understood that the goals and passions that so impact humans in their everyday life could be just as applicable-and his own findings just as valuable-in the work environment. The Maslow Business Reader collects Maslow's essays and letters for his many devoted adherents, and introduces his published and unpublished works to readers unfamiliar with Maslow's management breakthroughs. From recognizing and warning against management's natural progression to mechanize the human organization to brilliant discussions of human motivation, Dr. Maslow never fails to instantly recognize the heart and soul of each matter and provide direct, across-the-board solutions. Abraham Maslow's contributions to behavioral science shine on every page. In notes and articles, as well as personal letters to icons B. F. Skinner, John D. Rockefeller II, and others, The Maslow Business Reader provides his outlook on: * Management and leadership issues such as customer loyalty, entrepreneurship, and the importance of communication * Ways to build a work environment conducive to creativity, innovation, and maximized individual contributions * Techniques for finding comfort in change and ambiguity, and using them to spur creativity and innovation Amid today's impressive technological innovations, business leaders sometimes forget that work is-at its core-a fundamental human endeavor. The Maslow Business Reader reminds us of Dr. Abraham Maslow's towering contribution to the understanding of human behavior and motivation, and how his efforts can lead to a greater understanding of the twenty-first-century workplace-and the workers who call it home. An important analysis of workplace motivation-from the twentieth century's most influential behavioral expert Abraham Maslow is renowned-and rightfully so-for his pioneering work on the hierarchy of needs and the human drive for self-actualization. As today's worker increasingly equates professional success with personal satisfaction and fulfillment, Dr. Maslow's words and ideas have become recognized for their wisdom and prescience on performance improvement and management/employee relationships. The Maslow Business Reader collects Abraham Maslow's most instructive, intuitive thoughts and essays into one important volume. Assembled from the wealth of behavioral research and analysis Dr. Maslow left upon his death in 1970, the enclosed selections reveal a man comfortable with his position in history, tireless in his efforts to better understand what truly makes humans strive to reach their potential, and gifted in his ability to translate the most profound concepts and realities into entertaining, thought-provoking prose. Abraham Maslow is still regarded as the modern world's most articulate, insightful authority on human behavior and motivation. Discover his beliefs and conclusions on worker drives and motivations-as applicable today as when they were first written-in The Maslow Business Reader.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8PvwwrWnX5IC&dq=The+Maslow+Business+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greatest Is Charity: The Life of Andrew Reed, Preacher and Philanthropist","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sfPfAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Greatest+Is+Charity:+The+Life+of+Andrew+Reed,+Preacher+and+Philanthropist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living the Dream My Life and Basketball","description":"The star of the Houston Rockets chronicles the cross-cultural journey from his Nigerian childhood to the heights of fame with the NBA, discussing his life on and off the court, rivalry with other players, confrontations with owners and referees, and religious faith. 100,000 first printing. $150,000 ad/promo.

The New York Times Vincent van Gogh, the great but tormented artist, bared his tortured yet ecstatic soul in his letters to his confidant and companion, his beloved brother Theo. These letters reveal the man behind such masterpieces as The Starry Night and The Bedroom a desperate man whose quest for love became a flight into madness and for whom every day was a  fight for life.  Irving Stone, acclaimed author of Lust for Life and other remarkable biographic novels, has collected Vincent van Gogh s fascinating letters to Theo. Here we see the great artist as a human being as well as a man with an appointment with destiny. Van Gogh is a man struggling with doubts and fears, beset by poverty and mental illness, but also a painter who dares to break all the rules of academic art to create priceless masterpieces never honored during his lifetime. He was part of the coterie of great artists of his day while as the same time an intimate of aging streetwalkers. These letters are outpourings of his soul that paint a vibrant self-portrait in words equal to the intensity and emotion his painting created. This is the personal story of a legend.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Oi4cU55r2GYC&dq=Dear+Theo:+The+Autobiography+of+Vincent+Van+Gogh&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Travel Notes from the New Literacy Studies: Instances of Practice (New Perspectives on Language and Education)","description":"This book joins two important fields, that of literacy and multimodality, with a focus on local and global literacies.

Over the past few decades Buddhism has deepened its presence in the West and as a result teachings and practices are becoming integrated with those of Western psychology in a more productive way. The decline of mechanism and positivism offers new opportunities to bring together Western Buddhist views of the mind and its relationship to its surroundings. Written by psychologists and scholars, the essays discuss many of the difficult questions raised by Buddhism s increased presence. In particular the issue of the balance between authenticity and accessibility is examined. Buddhist traditions are often perceived as inaccessible and too firmly fixed to a cultural framework with some people, especially women, left feeling alienated and undervalued. However, by responding to this by attempting to synthesise Buddhism with the values of contemporary culture can lead to doubts about authenticity and dilution. Examining these issues and many more, the contributors seek to bring Buddhism into a realistic and informed relationship with contemporary Western thought.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=swtEAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Never Cry \\"Arp!\\" and Other Great Adventures","description":"A zany collection of misadventures follows young Pat and his experiences with Crazy Eddie, the friend kids love and mothers dread; Rancid Crabtree, a malodorous woodsman; Pat's skunk dog, Strange; and his buddy, Retch Sweeney.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Vd3luXtw8BEC&dq=Never+Cry+%22Arp!%22+and+Other+Great+Adventures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Cat in the Manger (An Alice Nestleton Mystery)","description":"This Christmas, in the newest Alice Nestleton Mystery, Alice will discover that cat-sitting can be murder  Off-Off Broadway actress-turned-sleuth Alice Nestleton is just crazy about cats, particularly her Maine coon cat Bushy and zany alleycat Pancho.

He is a cult leader of a movement that has taken over a political party  and he specifically campaigned on a platform of one-man rule. This fact permeates  Can It Happen Here? . . . which concludes, if you read between the lines, that  it  already has.   New York Times Book Review \\"Several of the contributors...agree that American politics is susceptible to creeping authoritarianism and provide the intellectual underpinning.\\"  Washington Post With the election of Donald J. Trump, many people on both the left and right feared that America s 240-year-old grand experiment in democracy was coming to an end, and that Sinclair Lewis  satirical novel, It Can t Happen Here, written during the dark days of the 1930s, could finally be coming true. Is the democratic freedom that the United States symbolizes really secure? Can authoritarianism happen in America? Acclaimed legal scholar, Harvard Professor, and New York Times bestselling author Cass R. Sunstein queried a number of the nation s leading thinkers. In this thought-provoking collection of essays, these distinguished thinkers and theorists explore the lessons of history, how democracies crumble, how propaganda works, and the role of the media, courts, elections, and \\"fake news\\" in the modern political landscape and what the future of the United States may hold.

Its inception is attributed to Vairocana, one of the first seven Tibetan Buddhist monks ordained at Samye in the eight century A.D. The doctrine is regarded among Buddhists as the core of the teachings adhered to by the Nyingmapa school whilst similarly it is held to be the fundamental teaching among the Bonpos, the non-Buddhist school in Tibet. After a historical introduction to Tibetan Buddhism and the Bon, the author deals with the legends of Vairocana (Part I), analysing early documents containing essential elements of the doctrine and comparing them with the Ch'an tradition. He goes on to explore in detail the development of the doctrine in the tenth and eleventh centuries A.D. (Part II). The Tantric doctrines that play an important role are dealt with, as are the rDzogs chen theories in relation to the other major Buddhist doctrines. Different trends in the rDzogs chen tradition are described in Part III. The author has drawn his sources mainly from early unpublished documents which throw light on the origins and development, at the same time also using a variety of sources which enabled him to explicate the crucial position which the doctrine occupies in Tibetan religions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vyS71NvZPXsC&dq=The+Great+Perfection+(Rdzogs+Chen):+A+Philosophical+and+Meditative+Teaching+of+Tibetan+Buddhism+(Asian+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Without Justice For All: The New Liberalism And Our Retreat From Racial Equality","description":"Without Justice for All: The New Liberalism and Our Retreat from Racial Equality questions, examines, and explains the way a new orthodoxy of American leaders has contributed to the social stratification and inequality which plagues America today. By looking at the history of our social policies since the New Deal, as well as the status of specific policy arenas, essayists show how political shifts over the past fifty years have moved us away from a more egalitarian politics. Throughout, the book responds critically to the now conventional argument that liberalism must be reconfigured in ways that retreat from immediate identification with the interests of labor, minorities, and the poor. From a look at federal housing policy and the failure of New Deal social programs to an examination of long established public assistance programs and Affirmative Action, Without Justice for All is a timely and important contribution to the dialogue on race in modern America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BwLFDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meditation, Mind & Patanjali's Yoga: A Practical Guide to Spiritual Growth for Everyone","description":"A Tibetan lama and leader of a global meditation network explains how the sport of running can be turned into a spiritual practice.

She ruled the Habsburg Empire from 1740-1780, an era when empires dominated Europe. She was the sovereign of a vast empire, ruling Austria, Hungary, Croatia, Bohemia, Transylvania, Flanders, and other Habsburg territories, and by marriage she was, among other titles, the Holy Roman Empress. Maria Theresa began her reign at the age of 23 after her father, Emperor Charles VI, died. Immediately after his death, her right to inherit the throne was challenged by most of the sovereign rulers of Europe. Despite setbacks such as the loss of Silesia, her richest province, to her life-long enemy Frederick II of Prussia, Maria Theresa proved to be a highly effective ruler. She initiated financial and educational reforms, promoted commerce, and reorganized the army, all of which strengthened Austria's resources. She was a key figure in the power politics of eighteenth-century Europe and she brought unity to the Habsburg Monarchy and was considered one of its most capable leaders. Maria Theresa and her husband Francis I also had sixteen children, most famously Marie Antoinette. Stollberg-Rilinger's biography challenges many of the myths that surround Maria Theresa's reign, such as that she came to the throne completely na?ve and unprepared. Stollberg-Rilinger shows that from early childhood on, Maria Theresa carefully observed what went on in court and how her father acted as a monarch dealing with sovereigns across Europe. She clears away the gendered misconceptions surrounding Maria Theresa's life and, through fresh, critical readings of the source material, reveals the historical reality. She also refutes anachronistic narratives that assume a false continuity between Maria Theresa's time and later periods. Unlike previous biographers, Stollberg-Rilinger is able to paint a detailed portrait of Maria Theresa as Empress, \\"king,\\" and reformer, and as a mother and master manipulator, by reconstructing the world in which the Austrian Empress lived and reigned\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FQoUEAAAQBAJ&dq=Maria+Theresa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frommer's(r) Barcelona, Madrid and Seville, 4th Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5mxYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Frommer%27s(r)+Barcelona,+Madrid+and+Seville,+4th+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marine Carving Handbook - The Design And Making Of Billetheads, Trailboards, And Other Marine Carvings","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xHppPQAACAAJ&dq=Marine+Carving+Handbook+-+The+Design+And+Making+Of+Billetheads,+Trailboards,+And+Other+Marine+Carvings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Devil's Waltz (Mira Historical Romance)","description":"Determined to keep Christian Montcalm, a destitute but devilishly handsome rogue, away from her wealthy charge, Annelise Kempton desperately tries to resist his charms, but to no avail.

Yet public debate about the faith is polarized-one camp praises \\"the religion of peace\\" while the other claims all Muslims are terrorists. Canadian human rights activist Yasmine Mohammed believes both sides are dangerously wrong. In Unveiled: How Western Liberals Empower Radical Islam, Yasmine speaks her truth as a woman born in the Western world yet raised in a fundamentalist Islamic home. Despite being a first-generation Canadian, she never felt at home in the West. And even though she attended Islamic schools and wore the hijab since age nine, Yasmine never fit in with her Muslim family either. With one foot in each world, Yasmine is far enough removed from both to see them objectively, yet close enough to see them honestly. Part Ayaan Hirsi Ali's Infidel, part The Handmaid's Tale, Yasmine's memoir takes readers into a world few Westerners are privy to. As a college educator for over fifteen years, Yasmine's goal is to unveil the truth. Is FGM Islamic or cultural? Is the hijab forced or a choice? Is ISIS a representation of \\"true\\" Islam or a radical corruption? And why is there so much conflicting information? Like most insular communities, the Islamic world has both an \\"outside voice\\" and an \\"inside voice.\\" It's all but impossible for bystanders to get a straight answer.

Three years later and half a world away, a British force was wiped out by Zulu warriors at Isandhlwana in South Africa. In both cases the total defeat of regular army troops by forces regarded as undisciplined barbarian tribesmen stunned an imperial nation. Although the similarities between the two frontier encounters have long been noted, James O. Gump s book The Dust Rose Like Smoke is the first to scrutinize them in a comparative context.  This study issues a challenge to American exceptionalism,  he writes. Viewing both episodes as part of a global pattern of intensified conflict in the latter 1800s resulting from Western domination over a vast portion of the globe, Gump s comparative study persuasively traces the origins and aftermath of both episodes. He examines the complicated ways in which Lakota and Zulu leadership sought to protect indigenous interests while Western leadership calculated their subjugation to imperial authority.

The despondent and demoralized group of men had endured repeated defeats and now were on the edge of giving up hope. Washington feared \\"the game is pretty near up.\\"Rather than submit to defeat, Washington and his small band of soldiers crossed the ice-choked Delaware River and attacked the Hessian garrison at Trenton, New Jersey on the day after Christmas. He followed up the surprise attack with successful actions along the Assunpink Creek and at Princeton. In a stunning military campaign, Washington had turned the tables, and breathed life into the dying cause for liberty during the Revolutionary War.The campaign has led many historians to deem it as one of the most significant military campaigns in American history. One British historian even declared that \\"it may be doubted whether so small a number of men ever employed so short a space of time with greater or more lasting results upon the history of the world.\\"In Victory or Death, historian Mark Maloy not only recounts these epic events, he takes you along to the places where they occurred. He shows where Washington stood on the banks of the Delaware and contemplated defeat, the city streets that his exhausted men charged through, and the open fields where Washington himself rode into the thick of battle.

Though at first glance the natural world may appear overwhelming in its diversity and complexity, there are regularities running through it, from the hexagons of a honeycomb to the spirals of a seashell and the branching veins of a leaf. Revealing the order at the foundation of the seemingly chaotic natural world, Patterns in Nature explores not only the math and science but also the beauty and artistry behind nature s awe-inspiring designs. Unlike the patterns we create, natural patterns are formed spontaneously from the forces that act in the physical world. Very often the same types of pattern and form such as spirals, stripes, branches, and fractals recur in places that seem to have nothing in common, as when the markings of a zebra mimic the ripples in windblown sand. But many of these patterns can be described using the same mathematical and physical principles, giving a surprising unity to the kaleidoscope of the natural world. Richly illustrated with 250 color photographs and anchored by accessible and insightful chapters by esteemed science writer Philip Ball, Patterns in Nature reveals the organization at work in vast and ancient forests, powerful rivers, massing clouds, and coastlines carved out by the sea. By exploring similarities such as the branches of a tree and those of a river network, this spectacular visual tour conveys the wonder, beauty, and richness of natural pattern formation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hG30CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The autobiography of St. Gemma Galgani","description":"St. Gemma Galgani (1878-1903) was a mystic, stigmatist, visionary, ecstatic, victim soul, discerner of spirits, seer of hidden things, prophetess, spouse of Christ, zealot for souls and devotee of the Poor Souls in Purgatory.

Topics covered in the book include: * Second quantization with spin adaptation * Gaussian basis sets and molecular-integral evaluation * Hartree-Fock theory * Configuration-interaction and multi-configurational self-consistent theory * Coupled-cluster theory for ground and excited states * Perturbation theory for single- and multi-configurational states * Linear-scaling techniques and the fast multipole method * Explicity correlated wave functions * Basis-set convergence and extrapolation * Calibration and benchmarking of computational methods, with applications to moelcular equilibrium structure, atomization energies and reaction enthalpies. Molecular Electronic-Structure Theory makes extensive use of numerical examples, designed to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each method treated. In addition, statements about the usefulness and deficiencies of the various methods are supported by actual examples, not just model calculations. Problems and exercises are provided at the end of each chapter, complete with hints and solutions. This book is a must for researchers in the field of quantum chemistry as well as for nonspecialists who wish to acquire a thorough understanding of ab initio molecular electronic-structure theory and its applications to problems in chemistry and physics.

It is a focus never more needed than in this age of confusing economic headlines. In a bold new concluding chapter entitled  The End of the Worldly Philosophy?  Heilbroner reminds us that the word  end  refers to both the purpose and limits of economics. This chapter conveys a concern that today s increasingly  scientific  economics may overlook fundamental social and political issues that are central to economics. Thus, unlike its predecessors, this new edition provides not just an indispensable illumination of our past but a call to action for our future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vIxtW9cw-DQC&dq=The+Worldly+Philosophers:+The+Lives,+Times&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G_4zAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Grand Design","description":"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? What is the nature of reality? Is the apparent  grand design  of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion or does science offer another explanation? In this startling and lavishly illustrated book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about these and other abiding mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by brilliance and simplicity. According to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history. The authors explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the  multiverse  the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature. They conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a  theory of everything : the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, which, if confirmed, would represent the ultimate triumph of human reason.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vfFhxYwjgK8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crosby's Opera House: Symbol of Chicago's Cultural Awakening","description":"It is also the story of Albert and Uranus Crosby, who migrated from Cape Cod to Chicago where, as successful entrepreneurs, they made their fortunes and later sacrificed it all in their efforts to bring a new musical and artistic enlightenment to their adpoted city.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hvr6l9y4WYsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beam Me Up, Scotty","description":"The actor who brought to life Star Trek's engineering officer Montgomery Scott discusses his army service during World War II, his career, and relationships with his co-stars","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nX8AAAAACAAJ&dq=Beam+Me+Up,+Scotty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With Christ in the school of prayer","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gdMXAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The rising tide of color against white world-supremacy","description":"A far-seeing survey of race and history, T. Lothrop Stoddard's epic work did not refer to a belief that whites should rule over other races, but merely that, as he put it, a man who in 1914 looked at a world map \\"got one fundamental impression: the overwhelming preponderance of the white race in the ordering of the world's affairs\\". It was this dominance, Stoddard said, which was coming to an end because of the massive demographic swings which he foresaw over the coming decades--just one of the many accurate predictions made in this book which have allowed it to stand the test of time. Starting with an overview of the different races of the world and their traditional homelands, Stoddard pointed out how their technological backwardness allowed what he called the \\"white flood\\" to colonize all four corners of the earth. -- Amazon.com","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ntVAAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Unfinished Novel and Other Stories","description":"In this vital and heartbreaking collection of stories, Valerie Martin, the bestselling author of Mary Reilly and the internationally acclaimed Property, turns an unflinching eye upon artists driven and blocked, desired and detested, infamous and sublime, as they struggle beneath the tyranny of Art to reconcile their audience with their muse. A painter who owes his small success to a man he despises, discovers that his passivity has cost him the love that might have set him free. A writer of modest talents encounters the old love who once betrayed him; now she repels him, yet the unfinished novel she leaves in his hands may surpass anything he could ever produce himself.

Addressing primarily those who lead volunteer or non-governmental agencies and religious organizations, the author holds that they should provide a model of effective, humane leadership for the business world, public service, and politics. Dorr focuses on scriptural sources for a spirituality of leadership, and draws insights from various spiritual traditions in the history of the church. He emphasizes the surprisingly strong and consistent democratic tradition within Christianity. He also draws on key elements in the thinking of political philosophers and management theorists. In the heart of the book the author describes four different kinds of leaders and outlines five styles or manners in which good leadership is exercised. Dorr concludes with a discussion of techniques for individual and communal discernment and the use of intuition in decision making.

It is a waste product and a commodity pricier than oil. It can save lives and transmit deadly infections. Each one of us has roughly nine pints of it, yet many don t even know their own blood type. And for all its ubiquitousness, the few tablespoons of blood discharged by 800 million women are still regarded as taboo: menstruation is perhaps the single most demonized biological event. Rose George, author of The Big Necessity, is renowned for her intrepid work on topics that are invisible but vitally important. In Nine Pints, she takes us from ancient practices of bloodletting to the breakthough of the \\"liquid biopsy,\\" which promises to diagnose cancer and other diseases with a simple blood test. She introduces Janet Vaughan, who set up the world s first system of mass blood donation during the Blitz, and Arunachalam Muruganantham, known as  Menstrual Man  for his work on sanitary pads for developing countries. She probes the lucrative business of plasma transfusions, in which the US is known as the  OPEC of plasma.  And she looks to the future, as researchers seek to bring synthetic blood to a hospital near you. Spanning science and politics, stories and global epidemics, Nine Pints reveals our life's blood in an entirely new light.

Dismissed from his job as a bank teller, Murdo tries to write, but cannot get beyond the first sentence. Murdo has a wild and fertile imagination, and, much to the incomprehension of his long-suffering wife, Janet, sets out to convert all he meets to his bizarre philosophy and unique vision of the world. Murdo's surreal and often hilarious antics, however, mask much deeper questions about his inadequacy in the face of social convention and his own spiritual turmoil. It is this juxtaposition of tragicomic elements, together with the fact that Murdo is in so many ways the alter ego of his creator, that brings real poignancy to these stories and confirms Iain Crichton Smith as one of Scotland's most versatile literary talents of modern times. This volume contains the two publications, Murdo and Other Stories and Thoughts of Murdo. It also includes another substantial piece, the autobiographical Life of Murdo, which is published in book form here for the first time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=edUfAQAAIAAJ&dq=Murdo:+The+Life+and+Works&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alvin Ailey: A Life In Dance","description":"Alvin Ailey (19311989) was a choreographic giant in the modern dance world and a champion of African-American talent and culture.

Before the Muslim invasion of 827, the islanders spoke dialects of either Greek or Latin or both. On the arrival of the Normans around 1060 Arabic was the dominant language, but by 1250 Sicily was an almost exclusively Christian island, with Romance dialects in evidence everywhere. Of particular importance to the development of Sicily was the formative period of Norman rule (1061 1194), when most of the key transitions from an Arabic-speaking Muslim island to a 'Latin'-speaking Christian one were made.

The question about the evidence for Auschwitz as a death camp played a central role in these proceedings. Irving had based his alleged denial of the Holocaust in part on a 1988 report by an American execution specialist, Fred Leuchter, which claimed that there was no evidence for homicidal gas chambers in Auschwitz. In connection with their defense, Penguin and Lipstadt engaged architectural historian Robert Jan van Pelt to present evidence for our knowledge that Auschwitz had been an extermination camp where up to one million Jews were killed, mainly in gas chambers. Employing painstaking historical scholarship, van Pelt prepared and submitted an exhaustive forensic report that he successfully defended in cross-examination in court.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S1gWDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"7-Card Stud : 42 Lessons How to Win at Medium & Lower Limits","description":"This book is a common sense, step-by-step guide for low to medium limit players to win consistently at both casino and home games.

Don t miss it!  (John Prados, author of Storm Over Leyte). Originally published in 1991, this classic work has now been revised and updated with additional photos. It is the story of how, in Vietnam, an elite group of Air Force pilots fought a secret air war in Cessna 0-2 and OV-10 Bronco prop planes flying as low as they could get. The eyes and ears of the fast-moving jets who rained death and destruction down on enemy positions, the forward air controller made an art form out of an air strike knowing the targets, knowing where friendly troops were, and reacting with split-second, life-and-death decisions as a battle unfolded. The expertise of the low, slow FACs, as well as the hazard attendant to their role, made for a unique bird s-eye perspective on how the entire war in Vietnam unfolded. For Tom Yarborough, who logged 1,500 hours of combat flying time, the risk was constant, intense, and electrifying. A member of the super-secret  Prairie Fire  unit, Yarborough became one of the most frequently shot-up pilots flying out of Da Nang engaging in a series of dangerous secret missions in Laos. In this work, the reader flies in the cockpit alongside Yarborough in his adrenaline-pumping chronicle of heroism, danger, and wartime brotherhood. From the rescuing of downed pilots to taking out enemy positions, to the most harrowing extended missions directly overhead of the NVA, here is the dedication, courage and skill of the fliers who took the war into the enemy s backyard.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oTDJAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Art as the Cognition of Life, Aleksandr Konstantinovich Voronsky, Selected Writings 1911-1936, Translated and edited by Frederick S.

Hailed as a savior by his followers and feared as a second Hannibal by his enemies, he envisioned a grand Eastern empire to rival Rome. After massacring eighty thousand Roman citizens in 88 BC, he seized Greece and modern-day Turkey. Fighting some of the most spectacular battles in ancient history, he dragged Rome into a long round of wars and threatened to invade Italy itself.

As the Prince of Wales turned fifty at the end of 1998, the media focused on the publication of Charles: Victim or Villain?, Penny Junor's controversial biography of the heir to England's throne. Directing the spotlight onto 'the three people' in the Royal marriage, this book has turned popular understanding on its head. But although Junor's unique insight into these endlessly intriguing relationships caused fierce speculation, even outrage, nothing has been denied. Nobody has disputed that this is the true portrait of a marriage.

Tom Brokaw writes about growing up and coming of age in the heartland, and of the family, the people, the culture and the values that shaped him then and still do today. His father, Red Brokaw, a genius with machines, followed the instincts of Tom s mother Jean, and took the risk of moving his small family from an Army base to Pickstown, South Dakota, where Red got a job as a heavy equipment operator in the Army Corps of Engineers  project building the Ft. Randall dam along the Missouri River. Tom Brokaw describes how this move became the pivotal decision in their lives, as the Brokaw family, along with others after World War II, began to live out the American Dream: community, relative prosperity, middle class pleasures and good educations for their children.  Along the river and in the surrounding hills, I had a Tom Sawyer boyhood,  Brokaw writes; and as he describes his own pilgrimage as it unfolded from childhood to love, marriage, the early days in broadcast journalism, and beyond he also reflects on what brought him and so many Americans of his generation to lead lives a long way from home, yet forever affected by it.

It is illustrated throughout with photos from the famous and extensive Lips' Collection. It was written in 1957 by Vincent J.M. Eras, the director of one of the most respected and important lock manufacturing companies in the world at that time, the Lips' Safe and Lock Manufacturing Company (now part of the ASSA ABLOY Group, along with Yale, Chubb, and many other once independent manufacturers). The author was not only a master locksmith who held several important patents, but he was also an avid collector and was passionate about the history and development of locking mechanisms. His extensive knowledge of the field comes across on every page. In fact, Eras had been in the lock manufacturing business for 58 years before he wrote this book. In the preface he states: \\"I consider it a gratifying task to place on record my experiences and through this book save them from oblivion. At the same time an excellent opportunity is presented to show the reader my collection of antique and modern locks - the tangible result of more than 50 years travelling, searching and study in many countries\\". In over 280 black-and-white photos and drawings Vincent Eras brings us on a grand tour of the development of locks from prehistoric to modern times and also explains to us, in words and illustrations, how their mechanisms work. This is a high-quality hardcover reprint of the 1957 edition of the book done by special arrangement with ASSA ABLOY. The typeface has been completely re-done and the photographs have been corrected using the latest digital correction technology. The quality is equal to and, in many cases, better than the original 1957 edition. A reprint of this book was done in the UK in the 1970s but the quality was poor. Artisan Ideas is very glad to be able to make this fascinating book available to the public again.

Those were the days when 300 passengers were landed twice weekly at Grangemouth or Dundee from the London boat, and the coastal passenger and cargo liner was in its heyday, catering both for the first class tourist as well as offering keenly priced second class fares for the like of football fans following away matches. Sadly, these wonderful steamer services are now largely forgotten but this new book will stir fond memories of the ships and their coastal voyages. The Depression of the 1930s, coupled with competition from both railway and the motor coach, were to spell the end for many of the coastal liners, while heavy losses incurred in World War II left only a few ships each offering just a handful of passenger berths. ?The story of their one hundred years of service is accompanied by numerous fascinating anecdotes, and the book focuses as much on the social need for coastal passenger services, the men and women who provided the services and the passengers who used them, as it does on the nuts and bolts of the ships themselves. This beautifully presented book will delight both ship enthusiasts and all those who enjoy the maritime and social history of the British Isles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uEOuCAAAQBAJ&dq=Passenger+Liners&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret Life of Ceecee Wilkes","description":" Full of surprises and captivating plot twists all the way until the very last page.

Over a decade ago, Simon Sinek started a movement that inspired millions to demand purpose at work, to ask what was the WHY of their organization. Since then, millions have been touched by the power of his ideas, and these ideas remain as relevant and timely as ever. START WITH WHY asks (and answers) the questions: why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over? People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had little in common, but they all started with WHY. They realized that people won't truly buy into a product, service, movement, or idea until they understand the WHY behind it. START WITH WHY shows that the leaders who have had the greatest influence in the world all think, act and communicate the same way and it's the opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be led, and people can be inspired.

Such missions are based at best on educated guesses as to the enemy situation and probable reaction. Success, failure, confusion, outstanding behavior, as pictured here, illustrate battle as it did, and often can, take place. The viewpoint of the participants at the time is hard to re-create in spite of what is known of the circumstances that surrounded the engagement. What now seems to be obvious was then obscure. The participants were continually faced with questions which can be reduced in number only by thorough training: What do I do next? Where shall I fire? Who is now in charge? Shall I fire? Will firing expose my position? Shall I wait for orders? To us who comfortably read accounts of the engagement the answers may seem evident. We must remember that confusion, like fog, envelops the whole battlefield, including the enemy. Initiative, any clear-cut aggressive action, tends to dispel it. In battle the terrain is the board on which the game is played. The chessmen are the small units of infantry, of armor, and the various supporting weapons each with different capabilities, all designed for the coordinated action which makes for victory. No one piece is capable of carrying the entire burden. Each must help the other. Above all, the human mind must comprehend which, for the instant, has the leading role. There is no time out in battle. Teams must be prepared to function in spite of shortages in both personnel and equipment. They must be practiced and drilled in getting and retaining the order necessary to overcome the confusion forever present on the battlefield. This is the outstanding lesson of these pages. If heeded they will have most beneficial effect on our Army. We, the victors in this war, can ill afford not to examine our training methods continually. Do we drill as we would fight? Do we instill in the soldier discipline and a knowledge of how to get order out of battle confusion? If not, victory will cost too much.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hNJFjgEACAAJ&dq=United+States+in+World+War+2:+Three+Battles,+Arnaville,+Altuzzo,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Juvenile Gangs","description":"In the quarter century since the first edition of this book, scholarship on gangs in general, and especially youth gangs, has grown exponentially. This massive expansion of the literature on youth gangs, especially in the past decade, warranted this expanded and updated fourth edition. The first chapter has an expanded discussion of definitional issues, plus recent data from the National Youth Gang Survey, material on the evolving economic nature of gangs, and gang use of internet and social media. The second chapter continues by examining gang violence and drug involvement, and the extent to which they are intercorrelated, with new material on victimization of gang members and gang involvement in drug use and sales. Chapter 3 focuses on racial and ethnic decadences in gangs and the important role of race and ethnicity on gang membership and gang behavior in the U.S. The fourth chapter examines female gangs and gang membership and the changes that have taken place in the nature and extent of female gang membership over time. The fifth and sixth chapters place contemporary American gangs in the historical and international perspective. Chapter 5 includes a new section on youth gangs in the new millennium, and Chapter 6 has been reorganized, particularly to reflect the burgeoning research on European and other international gangs since the turn of the millennium. Chapter 7 has been expanded to include recent developments in the actual and potential application of biosocial, psychological, and life course developmental theories to gangs. Chapter 8 provides a comprehensive, multilevel theory of gangs with updates including new propositions, and new evidence for both the new and old propositions, based on more recent work in theory development and theory testing for gangs. The ninth and tenth chapters  revisions focus on legislative and justice system efforts to deter gang crime and membership. Chapter 10 also focuses on intervention and assistance programs outside the justice system, including discussion of the Gang Resistance Education and Training program. The final chapter concludes by considering the future of youth gangs in the U.S. and elsewhere in light of historical and cross-national evidence, theory, and experience with gang interventions and programs, considering more recent developments in those areas, and whether they justify any change and for what would be expected of the future of youth gangs.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fEnxCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gold Cord","description":"Appalled by the hideous traffic in child prostitution at Hindu temples, Amy founded Dohnavur Fellowship to give them a safe home and introduce them to the love of Christ.

Robert Oppenheimer and the world's best scientists to produce the Atomic Bomb and win World War II. They were told as little as possible. Their orders were to go to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and report for work at a classified Manhattan Project site, a location so covert it was known to them only by the mysterious address: 109 East Palace. There, behind a wrought-iron gate and narrow passageway just off the touristy old plaza, they were greeted by Dorothy McKibbin, an attractive widow who was the least likely person imaginable to run a front for a clandestine defense laboratory. They stepped across her threshold into a parallel universe--the desert hideaway where Robert Oppenheimer and a team of world-famous scientists raced to build the first atomic bomb before Germany and bring World War II to an end. Brilliant, handsome, extraordinarily charismatic, Oppenheimer based his unprecedented scientific enterprise in the high reaches of the Sangre de Cristo mountains, hoping that the land of enchantment would conceal and inspire their bold mission. Oppenheimer was as arrogant as he was inexperienced, and few believed the thirty-eight-year-old theoretical physicist would succeed. Jennet Conant captures all the exhilaration and drama of those perilous twenty-seven months at Los Alamos, a secret city cut off from the rest of society, ringed by barbed wire, where Oppenheimer and his young recruits lived as virtual prisoners of the U.S. government. With her dry humor and eye for detail, Conant chronicles the chaotic beginnings of Oppenheimer's by-the-seat-of-his-pants operation, where freshly minted secretaries and worldly scientists had to contend with living conditions straight out of pioneer days. Despite all the obstacles, Oppie managed to forge a vibrant community at Los Alamos through the sheer force of his personality. Dorothy, who fell for him at first sight, devoted herself to taking care of him and his crew and supported him through the terrifying preparations for the test explosion at Trinity and the harrowing aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Less than a decade later, Oppenheimer became the focus of suspicion during the McCarthy witch hunts. When he and James B. Conant, one of the top administrators of the Manhattan Project (and the author's grandfather), led the campaign against the hydrogen bomb, Oppenheimer's past left-wing sympathies were used against him, and he was found to be a security risk and stripped of his clearance. Though Dorothy tried to help clear his name, she saw the man she loved disgraced. In this riveting and deeply moving account, drawing on a wealth of research and interviews with close family and colleagues, Jennet Conant reveals an exceptionally gifted and enigmatic man who served his country at tremendous personal cost and whose singular achievement, and subsequent undoing, is at the root of our present nuclear predicament.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0sJL-nN_DHQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Thoughts and Observations","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Portrait of America: Illinois (Video Tape)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Your Dog is Watching You: A writer finds out about dog psychology the hard way","description":"The author was walking his little dog on a leash when it was attacked by a loose German Shepherd.

He was also a scholar of history, folklore, languages, and the occult. In this groundbreaking study of Atlantis, he draws on all these disciplines, as well as ancient maps, Plato s dialogues, and folkloric narratives, to provide the most compelling case yet of the disappearance of an entire civilization. Professor Santos demonstrates that Plato s dating of Atlantis s disappearance in 11,600 BP (before present) precisely corresponds to the catastrophic end of the Pleistocene Ice Age, as well as a historic flood event of cataclysmic proportions.

Todd conveys Behn's vivacious character and the mores of the time' New York Times 'All women together ought to let flowers fall upon the tomb of Aphra Behn; for it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds,' said Virginia Woolf. Yet that tomb, in Westminster Abbey, records one of the few uncontested facts about this Restoration playwright, poet of the erotic and bisexual, political propagandist, novelist and spy: the date of her death, 16 April 1689. For the rest secrecy and duplicity are almost the key to her life. She loved codes, making and breaking them; writing her life becomes a decoding of a passionate but playful woman. In this revised biography, Janet Todd draws on documents she has rediscovered in the Dutch archives, and on Behn's own writings, to tell a story of court, diplomatic and sexual intrigue, and of the rise from humble origins of the first woman to earn her living as a professional writer. Aphra Behn's first notable employment was as a royal spy in Holland; she had probably also spied in Surinam. It was not until she was in her thirties that she published the first of the nineteen plays and other works which established her fame (though not riches) among her 'good, sweet, honey-candied readers'. Many of her works were openly erotic, indeed as frank as anything by her friends Wycherley and Rochester. Some also offered an inside view of court and political intrigues, and Todd reveals the historical scandals and legal cases behind some of Behn's most famous 'fictions'. Janet Todd, novelist and internationally renowned scholar, was president of Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge, and a Professor at Rutgers, NJ. An expert on women's writing and feminism, she has written about many writers, including Jane Austen, the Shelley Circle, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Aphra Behn.

The books are designed for students of linguistics and those who are studying language as part of a wider course. Cognitive Linguistics explores the idea that language reflects our experience of the world. It shows that our ability to use language is closely related to other cognitive abilities such as categorization, perception, memory and attention allocation. Concepts and mental images expressed and evoked by linguistic means are linked by conceptual metaphors and metonymies and merged into more comprehensive cognitive and cultural models, frames or scenarios. It is only against this background that human communication makes sense. After 25 years of intensive research, cognitive-linguistic thinking now holds a firm place both in the wider linguistic and the cognitive-science communities. An Introduction to Cognitive Linguistics carefully explains the central concepts of categoriza?-tion, of prototype and gestalt perception, of basic level and conceptual hierarchies, of figure and ground, and of metaphor and metonymy, for which an innovative description is provided. It also brings together issues such as iconicity, lexical change, grammaticalization and language teaching that have profited considerably from being put on a cognitive basis. The second edition of this popular introduction provides a comprehensive and accessible up-to-date overview of Cognitive Linguistics: Clarifies the basic notions supported by new evidence and examples for their application in language learning Discusses major recent developments in the field: the increasing attention paid to metonymies, Construction Grammar, Conceptual Blending and its role in online-processing. Explores links with neighbouring fields like Relevance Theory Uses many diagrams and illustrations to make the theoretical argument more tangible Includes extended exercises Provides substantial updated suggestions for further reading.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c1MVAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mode In Hats and Headdress","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Classic Cars (Source Book)","description":"The world's most popular book of the mighty American cars of the 1960s and 70s is back and better than ever.

Edwards on the Will offers a persuasive explanation. In 1753, after seven years of personal trials, which included dismissal from his Northampton church, Edwards submitted a treatise, Freedom of the Will, to Boston publishers. Its impact on Puritan society was profound. He had refused to be trapped either by a new Arminian scheme that seemed to make God impotent or by a Hobbesian natural determinism that made morality an illusion. He both reasserted the primacy of God's will and sought to reconcile freedom with necessity. In the process he shifted the focus from the community of duty to the freedom of the individual. Edwards died of smallpox in 1758 soon after becoming president of Princeton; as one obituary said, he was \\"a most rational . . . and exemplary Christian.\\" Thereafter, for a century or more, all discussion of free will and on the church as an enclave of the pure in an impure society had to begin with Edwards. His disciples, the \\"New Divinity\\" men--principally Samuel Hopkins of Great Barrington and Joseph Bellamy of Bethlehem, Connecticut--set out to defend his thought. Ezra Stiles, president of Yale, tried to keep his influence off the Yale Corporation, but Edwards's ideas spread beyond New Haven and sparked the religious revivals of the next decades. In the end, old Calvinism returned to Yale in the form of Nathaniel William Taylor, the Boston Unitarians captured Harvard, and Edwards's troublesome ghost was laid to rest. The debate on human freedom versus necessity continued, but theologians no longer controlled it. In Edwards on the Will, Guelzo presents with clarity and force the story of these fascinating maneuverings for the soul of New England and of the emerging nation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BzFKAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Giorgio De Chirico: Catalogo Dell' Opera Grafica 1969-1977 (Italian Edition)","description":"Edited by Marc Blondeau, Thierry Meaudre.

It is iconoclastic, crosses disciplinary boundaries, and finally it is calm and compellingly reasonable. The book was widely read on both sides of the Iron Curtain and the result was serious revision in both Western and Soviet strategy and doctrine. As a result, both sides were better able to avoid disaster during the Cold War. The strategic concepts still apply: defense, local animosities, and the usual balance-of-power issues are still very much with us. Kahn's stated purpose in writing this book was simply: \\"avoiding disaster and buying time, without specifying the use of this time.\\" By the late 1950s, with both sides H-bomb-armed, reason and time were in short supply. Kahn, a military analyst at Rand since 1948, understood that a defense based only on thermonuclear arnaments was inconceivable, morally questionable, and not credible. The book was the first to make sense of nuclear weapons. Originally created from a series of lectures, it provides insight into how policymakers consider such issues. One may agree with Kahn or disagree with him on specific issues, but he clearly defined the terrain of the argument. He also looks at other weapons of mass destruction such as biological and chemical, and the history of their use. The Cold War is over, but the nuclear genie is out of the bottle, and the lessons and principles developed in On Thermonuclear War apply as much to today's China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea as they did to the Soviets.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EN2gtPTjFd8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"JavaScript Demystified","description":"Even if you have no programming experience, you'll learn to create dynamic, interactive Web pages with help from this easy-to-use, self-teaching guide.

Claudia Clark's book tells the compelling story of these women, who at first had no idea that the tedious task of dialpainting was any different from the other factory jobs available to them. But after repeated exposure to the radium-laced paint, they began to develop mysterious, often fatal illnesses that they traced to conditions in the workplace. Their fight to have their symptoms recognized as an industrial disease represents an important chapter in the history of modern health and labor policy. Clark's account emphasizes the social and political factors that influenced the responses of the workers, managers, government officials, medical specialists, and legal authorities involved in the case. She enriches the story by exploring contemporary disputes over workplace control, government intervention, and industry-backed medical research. Finally, in appraising the dialpainters' campaign to secure compensation and prevention of further incidents--efforts launched with the help of the reform-minded, middle-class women of the Consumers' League--Clark is able to evaluate the achievements and shortcomings of the industrial health movement as a whole.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vEYMCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Instinctive Shooting II","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GG50MgKrYakC&dq=Instinctive+Shooting+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Officers And Gentlemen","description":"\\"Officers and Gentlemen\\" by Evelyn Waugh.

Accordingly, throughout this two-hundred-year period the author relates the political, economic and social events of Cuba; in particular he set Cuba's greatest crop, sugar, in the context of slavery and with the Atlantic slave trade and the development of Cuba's relations with the United States and the other states of Latin America. First published in 1971, Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom is still one of the most important and authoritative books on this complex country - marrying Hugh Thomas's unique skills as an historian with an intricate and absorbing subject.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jejCQgAACAAJ&dq=Cuba+Or+The+Pursuit+Of+Freedom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The principles of nuclear magnetism (The International series of monographs on physics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bloody Biscay","description":"\\"Bloody Biscay\\" is the story of the Luftwaffe's only long range maritime fighter unit -- V Gruppe/Kampfgeschwader 40 (V/KG 40) and its battles against the RAF, the US Army Air Force (USAAF) and the US Navy (USN) from July 1942 to August 1944 above the Bay of Biscay.

The hope is that you'll enjoy his past as much as he did, and arrive at some beautiful place inside of yourself by the end of your journey.

They act to empower you, revive you, and remind you that there is always another way to see your situation. Buddhist-inspired and psychologically grounded, these snippets of wisdom come through entertaining and universal stories of unpredictable life with children. Here are a few examples of how a mantra can help you control your reactions to those mothering circumstances largely out of your control: When it seems like everyone else's children are better behaved (and doesn t it always feel that way?), you can remind yourself to narrow your focus, or stop comparing your children to others, which is only bound to make you miserable. When the monotony of caring for a toddler gets to you, remembering to surrender to the goat, as one mother did when her son insisted on feeding the same goat at the petting zoo every day, for hours, will help you recognize the importance of being in the moment, and will help you endure and even enjoy the sometimes tedious routines. When you begin to resent that you do more housework than your spouse, despite your best intentions and all the nagging in the world, you can learn to ignore the score, or let go of keeping track, which can become an unhealthy (and unhelpful) obsession. When your mantras seem to fail you, you can always remind yourself that I am not Buddha. Motherhood is not something we can master. We can only try to be more mindful. Even so, some days are harder than others. Mantras are the deceptively simple words we can use to diffuse stress and choose appropriate, constructive behavior so we can recognize ourselves, find our center and be more mindful and compassionate mothers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BaADA17c6CoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Victory through faith,","description":"The Victory of Faith is one important bible study about the Christian faith.

Another critic described her as  rude, impertinent, blasphemous, a destroyer not only of beliefs but of esteemed values.  In this first full-length biography, Bryan F. Le Beau offers a penetrating assessment of O Hair s beliefs and actions and a probing discussion of how she came to represent both what Americans hated in their enemies and feared in themselves. Born in 1919, O Hair was a divorced mother of two children born out of wedlock. She launched a crusade against God, often using foul language as she became adept at shocking people and making effective use of the media in delivering her message. She first gained notoriety as one of the primary litigants in the 1963 case Murray v. Curlett which led the Supreme Court to ban school prayer. The decision stunned a nation engaged in fighting  godless Communism  and made O Hair America s most famous and most despised atheist. O Hair led a colorful life, facing assault charges and extradition from Mexico, as well as the defection of her son William, who as an adult denounced her. She later served as Hustler publisher Larry Flynt s chief speech writer in his bid for President of the United States. Drawing on original research, O Hair s diaries, and interviews, Le Beau traces her development from a child of the Depression to the dictatorial, abrasive woman who founded the American Atheists, wrote books denouncing religion, and challenged the words  Under God  in the Pledge of Allegiance,  In God We Trust  on American currency, the tax exempt status of religious organizations, and other activities she saw as violating the separation of church and state. O Hair remained a spokesperson for atheism until 1995, when she and her son and granddaughter vanished. It was later discovered that they were murdered by O Hair s former office manager and an accomplice. Fast-paced, engagingly written, and sharply relevant to ongoing debates about school prayer and other religious issues, The Atheist tells the colorful life-story of a woman who challenged America s most deeply held beliefs.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PitAMz7VfKAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knit It Your Way","description":"Designed to be used as a self-guided tutorial, this book develops and improves knitting skills through quick-to-knit projects for baby cardigans.

This ground-breaking book, now in affordable softcover, makes an unsettling proposal: most of what Christians do in present-day churches is rooted, not in the New Testament, but in pagan culture and rituals developed long after the death of the apostles. Coauthors Frank Viola and George Barna support their thesis with compelling historical evidence and extensive footnotes that document the origins of modern Christian church practices. In the process, the authors uncover the problems that emerge when the church functions more like a business organization than the living organism it was created to be. As you reconsider Christ's revolutionary plan for his church to be the head of a fully functioning body in which all believers play an active role you'll be challenged to decide whether you can ever do church the same way again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cPTBmcHa-i0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bengali Women","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Cry for Education","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Murder at Cambridge,","description":"The first in an exciting new historical mystery series set in the home of Agatha Christie! Colleen Cambridge's charming and inventive new historical series introduces an unforgettable heroine in Phyllida Bright, fictional housekeeper for none other than famed mystery novelist Agatha Christie. When a dead body is found during a house party at the home of Agatha Christie and her husband Max Mallowan, it's up to famous author's head of household, Phyllida Bright, to investigate... Tucked away among Devon s rolling green hills, Mallowan Hall combines the best of English tradition with the modern conveniences of 1930. Housekeeper Phyllida Bright, as efficient as she is personable, manages the large household with an iron fist in her very elegant glove. In one respect, however, Mallowan Hall stands far apart from other picturesque country houses . . . The manor is home to archaeologist Max Mallowan and his famous wife, Agatha Christie. Phyllida is both loyal to and protective of the crime writer, who is as much friend as employer. An aficionado of detective fiction, Phyllida has yet to find a gentleman in real life half as fascinating as Mrs. Agatha s Belgian hero, Hercule Poirot. But though accustomed to murder and its methods as frequent topics of conversation, Phyllida is unprepared for the sight of a very real, very dead body on the library floor . . . A former Army nurse, Phyllida reacts with practical common sense and a great deal of curiosity. It soon becomes clear that the victim arrived at Mallowan Hall under false pretenses during a weekend party. Now, Phyllida not only has a houseful of demanding guests on her hands along with a distracted, anxious staff but hordes of reporters camping outside. When another dead body is discovered this time, one of her housemaids Phyllida decides to follow in M. Poirot s footsteps to determine which of the Mallowans  guests is the killer.

In addition to providing accurate measures of loss probabilities and credit risk, our models can also be used to analyze and compare risk management practices and the drivers of delinquency across the banks. We find substantial heterogeneity in risk factors, sensitivities, and predictability of delinquency across banks, implying that no single model applies to all six institutions. We measure the efficacy of a bank's risk-management process by the percentage of delinquent accounts that a bank manages effectively, and find that efficacy also varies widely across institutions. These results suggest the need for a more customized approached to the supervision and regulation of financial institutions, in which capital ratios, loss reserves, and other parameters are specified individually for each institution according to its credit-risk model exposures and forecasts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_AoCswEACAAJ&dq=Credit+Card+Risk+Management&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DOGS DON'T TELL JOKES","description":"'Why did the guy eat two dead skunks for breakfast?'

An excellent book.   Choice Heralded for its readability and scholarship, The Fire in the Equations offers a fascinating discussion of scientific discoveries and their impact on our beliefs. The book s title is derived from Dr. Stephen Hawking s pondering,  What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?  Originally published in the U.S. in 1995, it provides an excursion through new theories of quantum physics and cosmology, ranging from the nature of time, the big bang, the  unreasonable effectiveness  of mathematics, laws of nature and their possible relation to God, chaos theory, black holes, Heisenberg s uncertainty principle, particle physics, Darwin's theory of evolution, and the role of God in all these equations. It even raises such questions as  how God might answer prayers  from the point of view of physics. While she gives no absolute answers, Kitty Ferguson takes the reader through a world of paradoxes and improbabilities, explaining how it is possible to believe both in a pre-determined universe and in free will as a theory of human behavior. She concludes that what we know about science doesn't necessarily make God inevitable, but does not rule God out either.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NNmB4RXbihcC&dq=The+Fire+in+the+Equations:+Science,+Religion,+and+the+Search+for+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Camelot 3000 (DC Comics Series)","description":"In the year 3000, an armada of destructive aliens has unleashed an all-out assault on Earth and is poised to conquer the planet.

Reverence gives meaning to much that we do, yet the word has almost passed out of our vocabulary. Reverence, says philosopher and classicist Paul Woodruff, begins in an understanding of human limitations. From this grows the capacity to be in awe of whatever we believe lies outside our control -- God, truth, justice, nature, even death. It is a quality of character that is especially important in leadership and in teaching, although it figures in virtually every human relationship. It transcends religious boundaries and can be found outside religion altogether. Woodruff draws on thinking about this lost virtue in ancient Greek and Chinese traditions and applies lessons from these highly reverent cultures to today's world. The book covers reverence in a variety of contexts -- the arts, leadership, teaching, warfare, and the home -- and shows how essential a quality it is to a well-functioning society. First published by Oxford University Press in 2001, this new edition of Reverence is revised and expanded. It contains a foreword by Betty Sue Flowers, Distinguished Teaching Professor Emeritus at the University of Texas at Austin, a new preface, two new chapters -- one on the sacred and one on compassion -- and an epilogue focused on renewing reverence in our own lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IIg3AwAAQBAJ&dq=Reverence:+Renewing+a+Forgotten+Virtue&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stamped with the Image of God: African Americans as God's Image in Black (American Catholic Identities)","description":"Documents included here demonstrate that African Americans have long been an integral part of Catholic history in America.

The poets of Resistencia explore feminist, queer, Indigenous, and ecological themes alongside historically prominent protests against imperialism, dictatorships, and economic inequality. Within this momentous collection, poets representing every Latin American country grapple with identity, place, and belonging, resisting easy definitions to render a nuanced and complex portrait of language in rebellion. Included in English translation alongside their original language, the fifty-four poems in Resistencia are a testament to the art of translation as much as the act of resistance. An all-star team of translators, including former US Poet Laureate Juan Felipe Herrera along with young, emerging talent, have made many of the poems available for the first time to an English-speaking audience.

These solutions were obtained as steady-state solutions to the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations using the finite-difference method of Brailovskaya, which has the second-order accuracy in the spatial coordinates. Good agreement was obtained between the computed results and the wall pressure distributions measured experimentally by Lewis, Kubota, and Lees for Mach numbers of 4 and 6.06, and respective Reynolds numbers, based on free-stream conditions and the distance from the leading edge to the corner, of 6.8 x 104 and 1.5 x 105. In those calculations, as well as in others, sufficient resolution was obtained to show the streamline pattern in the separation bubble. Upstream boundary conditions to the compression-corner flow were provided by numerically solving the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations for the flat-plate flow field, beginning at the leading edge. The compression-corner flow field was enclosed by a computational boundary with the unknown boundary conditions supplied by extrapolation from internally computed points. Numerical tests were performed to deduce that the magnitude of the errors introduced by the extrapolation was small. Calculations were made to show the effect of ramp angle and wall suction on the interaction flow field. The pressure distributions obtained in the present calculations, including a case of incipient separation, were plotted together by using the free-interaction scaling of Stewartson and Williams. A good correlation of the numerical results was found, but only fair agreement was found between this correlation and the universal pressure distribution found numerically by Stewartson and Williams.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rrwUTSDzxDUC&dq=Numerical+solutions+of+the+Navier-Stokes+equations+for+the+supersonic+laminar+flow+over+a+two-dimensional+compression+corner+(NASA+technical+report)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Types of New Theism: Knowledge of God in the Thought of Paul Tillich and Charles Hartshorne.: An article from: The Review of Metaphysics","description":"Charles Hartshorne has set himself the task of formulating the idea of deity \\"to preserve perhaps even increase, its religious value, while yet avoiding the contradictions which seem inseparable from the idea of customarily defined.\\" This is a brilliant attempt to redefine problems that have long challenged the Western world in its search for understanding both God and man.  The compact, closely reasoned book employs a skill in logic reminiscent of scholasticism at its best to refute traditional notions, scholastic and otherwise, of divine absoluteness, and to expound a conception of God which is both free of contradiction and religiously adequate. The position taken is described by Professor Hartshorne as surrelativism, or panentheism, and these terms indicate the two major emphases of the volume .He who follows its precise logic with the alertness it demands will have a clarifying and enriching experience.  S. Paul Schiling, Journal of Bible and Religion  In what respects is God absolute and in what respects relative? Or is it meaningless to say that he is both? In a rigorously analytical study Professor Hartshorne explains why he thinks both statements are necessary .One comes from this book with new confidence in the ability of philosophy to attack religious problems and, through careful analysis, to reveal what as alone conceivable must be true.  J.S. Bixler, Review of Religion  Hartshorne's work is a major achievement in religious thought because it strives to clear away errors that have been insuperable obstacles to religious search.

In early 1960 Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir accepted the invitation to visit Cuba and to report on the revolution. They arrived during the carnival in a land bursting with revolutionary activity. They visited Che Guevara, head of the National Bank. They toured the island with Fidel Castro. They met ministers, journalists, students, writers, artists, dockers and agricultural workers. Sartre spoke at the University of Havana. Sartre later published his Cuba reports in France-Soir. Sartre endorsed the Cuban Revolution. He made clear his political identification. He opposed colonialism. He saw the US as colonial in Cuban affairs from 1898. He supported Fidel Castro. He supported the agrarian reform. He supported the revolution. His Cuba accounts have been maligned, ignored and understudied. They have been denounced as blind praise of Castro,  unabashed propaganda.  They have been criticised for  clich s,   panegyric  and  analytical superficiality.  They have been called  crazy  and  incomprehensible.  Sartre was called na?ve. He was rebuked as a fellow traveller. He was, in the words of Cuban author Guillermo Cabrera Infante, duped by  Chic Guevara.  This book explores these accusations. Were Sartre s Cuba texts propaganda? Are they blind praise? Was he na?ve? Had he been deceived by Castro? Had he deceived his readers? Was he obligated to Castro or to the Revolution? He later buried the reports, and abandoned a separate Cuba book.

The freedom from the burden of our sin, the need to be \\"good enough,\\" anger, jealousy, and envy. Even though we are believers we would be ashamed to say that we don't always experience peace, contentment, and joy in our life. We are looking for the grace that God has so graciously given to us to be real in our life... Breaking Pride is an eBook based on one simple truth: In order to walk in God's grace we need to tear down the the walls of pride. A lot of believers, even though saved by God's grace, are still walking in pride rather than walking in His grace. Knowing what pride is and learning to identify pride in your life is the first step to overcoming a life filled with pride. Pride is rooted in fear and leads to anger, jealousy, and envy. Sin isn't keeping us from having a relationship with the Lord, it's our pride. So many of us long to have an authentic and REAL relationship with the Lord, and we long to have the fruit of the spirit filled in our heart. Our desire is to achieve these fruits through will power. But we do not even realize that the pride that lives within our heart is what is blocking the fruit of the spirit from living within us. In Breaking Pride you will learn to identify different areas of pride in your life. Filled with encouragement, Breaking Pride will take you through a practical reading of what pride may look like in your life... Let's stop building walls of pride and start building the foundation of grace within our lives...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1hrbMgEACAAJ&dq=Bondage+of+self:+Or+zombies+don%27t+play+soccer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ghost Riders","description":"It is April 1945 and the world's most prized horses are about to be slaughtered...

Simultaneously, however, other people discovered meanings in jazz more significant than those in any other music or art form. For them, jazz provided ecstatic experiences not found in any concert hall or church. These experiences--along with the charismatic personalities of such jazz heroes as Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, and John Coltrane--generated strong communal feelings and sect-like groupings which created rituals and myths to uphold the jazz mystique. In this study of the relationship between music and religion, Neil Leonard uses the work of Max Weber and his followers in order to explore how listeners have come to regard jazz as sacred or magical and have created myths and rituals to sustain this belief. Leonard argues that in a time when conventional religions have fallen into a state of flux, jazz has provided a focus for spiritual impulses tempered by the anxieties and alienations of the twentieth century. Leonard's Jazz tells us not only about music and society but also about religious behavior in a secular time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R5-Dqm31qWcC&dq=Jazz:+Myth+and+Religion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pocket Guide to Telecommunications, Electronic Communications and Information Technology","description":"The Pocket Guide to Telecommunications, Electronic Communications and Information Technology is designed to be a portable reference to the technical aspects of electronic communications.

Readers can imagine themselves in the field, watching the dogs on point near an overgrown fence row.

It expresses what God requires from man, and particularly from the Christian, that he serve Him in Spirit and in truth?intelligently, rationally, and in harmony with and response to God?s revelation of Himself, His Word. With a decidedly Puritan flavor and representing Reformed experiential religion at its best, Wilhelmus   Brakel systematically moves through the major doctrines of the Bible in hopes of seeing the minds of God?s people renewed for the purpose of promoting godliness. Throughout his work, but particularly in the practical application of each doctrine,   Brakel strives unceasingly to exalt the name of Jesus as the name that the Father has given above every other name?there being no other name given under heaven among men whereby we must be saved (Acts 4:12).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gHYxuQAACAAJ&dq=The+Christian%27s+Reasonable+Service+(4+Volume+Set)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whales and Dolphins of the World","description":"This is a new, redesigned and reformatted edition of a popular title.

Markar Melkonian spent seven years unraveling the mystery of his brother's road: a journey which began in his ancestors' town in Turkey and led to a blood-splattered square in Tehran, the Kurdish mountains, the bomb-pocked streets of Beirut, and finally, to the Cold War and the unraveling of the Soviet Union--an attempt to understand what happens when one man decides that terrible actions speak louder than words.--From publisher description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=84I6PgAACAAJ&dq=My+Brother%27s+Road&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Soft and Others: 16 Stories of Wonder and Dread","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pEA9nwEACAAJ&dq=Soft+and+Others:+16+Stories+of+Wonder+and+Dread&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blues Deluxe: A Tragicomic Love Story","description":"A novel set against the background of Hollywood deal-making follows hot comic Cool McCool as he pursues a wild, roller coaster relationship with rock superstar Honey","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NTOVAAAACAAJ&dq=Blues+Deluxe:+A+Tragicomic+Love+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Property, Women, and Politics: Subects or Objects?","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Rynosseros","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g_0gAQAAIAAJ&dq=Rynosseros&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Return of Count Electric","description":"Relates the tales and adventures of a wide assortment of characters, including a wedding photographer who takes matters into his own hands when the groom doesn't show up, and a middle-aged man's return to a haunting past","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2bkOAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Return+of+Count+Electric&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Sacrifice for Friendship","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=72riJJpJp1oC&dq=A+Sacrifice+for+Friendship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Drawing Handbook: Comprehensive, Easy-To-Master Lessons on Composition and Techniques Using Pencil and Pen & Ink","description":"This guide for beginners to the essentials of drawing techniques and composition features more than 500 step-by-step illustrations.

Heskett, W. Earl Sasser, Jr. and Leonard A. Schlesinger reveal that leading companies stay on top by managing the service profit chain. Why are a select few service firms better at what they do -- year in and year out -- than their competitors? For most senior managers, the profusion of anecdotal \\"service excellence\\" books fails to address this key question. Based on five years of painstaking research, the authors show how managers at American Express, Southwest Airlines, Banc One, Waste Management, USAA, MBNA, Intuit, British Airways, Taco Bell, Fairfield Inns, Ritz-Carlton Hotel, and the Merry Maids subsidiary of ServiceMaster employ a quantifiable set of relationships that directly links profit and growth to not only customer loyalty and satisfaction, but to employee loyalty, satisfaction, and productivity. The strongest relationships the authors discovered are those between (1) profit and customer loyalty; (2) employee loyalty and customer loyalty; and (3) employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction. Moreover, these relationships are mutually reinforcing; that is, satisfied customers contribute to employee satisfaction and vice versa. Here, finally, is the foundation for a powerful strategic service vision, a model on which any manager can build more focused operations and marketing capabilities. For example, the authors demonstrate how, in Banc One's operating divisions, a direct relationship between customer loyalty measured by the \\"depth\\" of a relationship, the number of banking services a customer utilizes, and profitability led the bank to encourage existing customers to further extend the bank services they use. Taco Bell has found that their stores in the top quadrant of customer satisfaction ratings outperform their other stores on all measures. At American Express Travel Services, offices that ticket quickly and accurately are more profitable than those which don't. With hundreds of examples like these, the authors show how to manage the customer-employee \\"satisfaction mirror\\" and the customer value equation to achieve a \\"customer's eye view\\" of goods and services. They describe how companies in any service industry can (1) measure service profit chain relationships across operating units; (2) communicate the resulting self-appraisal; (3) develop a \\"balanced scorecard\\" of performance; (4) develop a recognitions and rewards system tied to established measures; (5) communicate results company-wide; (6) develop an internal \\"best practice\\" information exchange; and (7) improve overall service profit chain performance. What difference can service profit chain management make? A lot. Between 1986 and 1995, the common stock prices of the companies studied by the authors increased 147%, nearly twice as fast as the price of the stocks of their closest competitors. The proven success and high-yielding results from these high-achieving companies will make The Service Profit Chain required reading for senior, division, and business unit managers in all service companies, as well as for students of service management.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f8PpwCgtp9MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Handbook for Pastors' and Ministers' Wives","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Nature's Super Seven Medicines: The Seven Essential Ingrediants for Optimal Health","description":"Reveals the seven common foods and herbs used to relieve such ailments as allergies and yeast infections","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p-qZ-hR7K8gC&dq=Nature%27s+Super+Seven+Medicines:+The+Seven+Essential+Ingrediants+for+Optimal+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Desafios para America Latina en el tercer milenio","description":"?Cu l es la situaci n del catolicismo, la religi n de mil millones de creyentes, en v speras del tercer milenio?

But she's crafty enough to have found a squatter's paradise in an empty TriBeCa loft, and a video store job that feeds her passion for old movies. It's a passion she shares with her favorite customer, Mr. Kelly, a lonely old man who rents the same video over and over. The flick is a noir classic based on a real-life unsolved bank heist and a million missing dollars. It's called Manhattan Is My Beat. That's the tape Rune is picking up from Mr. Kelly's shabby apartment when she finds him shot to death. The police suspect a robbery gone wrong, but Rune is certain the key to solving the murder is hidden somewhere in the hazy, black-and-white frames of Mr. Kelly's beloved movie. But as Rune hits the mean streets of New York to find answers, she gets caught up in a dangerous adventure more chilling than anything Hollywood could dream up.

Now, half a century later, this international best seller remains as relevant as when it first appeared. The book's arguments--that secularity has a positive effect on institutions, that the city can be a space where people of all faiths fulfill their potential, and that God is present in both the secular and formal religious realms--still resonate with readers of all backgrounds. For this brand-new edition, Harvey Cox provides a substantial and updated introduction.

From the bullied child to the new parent, from the pensioner who has outlived friends and family members to teenagers who manage their social lives through the glow of a mobile phone, it can - and does - affect anyone and everyone, irrespective of age, race or class. Many suffer in silence, convinced it's a confession too far, a sign of too much vulnerability, a shameful failing. But the human condition is not a failing. What's it like when loneliness descends? How does it announce itself, and how do you recognise it? Do you discuss it, or conceal it? From where can you seek help? A Life Less Lonely shares stories of loneliness and social isolation, and looks for ways in which we can help one another to future-proof ourselves against this most insidious affliction. By talking to those who suffer from it, and by highlighting the work of those who fight to combat it, the book offers guidance on how to spot the symptoms in yourself and in others, how to connect with those around you, and how, by understanding it all better, we might just set ourselves free from it.

Joanna Gaines, author of Magnolia Table  Generation after generation, Joy has been a warm, encouraging presence in American kitchens, teaching us to cook with grace and humor. This luminous new edition continues on that important tradition while seamlessly weaving in modern touches, making it all the more indispensable for generations to come.   Samin Nosrat, author of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat In the nearly ninety years since Irma S. Rombauer self-published the first three thousand copies of Joy of Cooking in 1931, it has become the kitchen bible, with more than 20 million copies in print. This new edition of Joy has been thoroughly revised and expanded by Irma s great-grandson John Becker and his wife, Megan Scott. John and Megan developed more than six hundred new recipes for this edition, tested and tweaked thousands of classic recipes, and updated every section of every chapter to reflect the latest ingredients and techniques available to today s home cooks. Their strategy for revising this edition was the same one Irma and Marion employed: Vet, research, and improve Joy s coverage of legacy recipes while introducing new dishes, modern cooking techniques, and comprehensive information on ingredients now available at farmers  markets and grocery stores. You will find tried-and-true favorites like Banana Bread Cockaigne, Chocolate Chip Cookies, and Southern Corn Bread all retested and faithfully improved as well as new favorites like Chana Masala, Beef Rendang, Megan s Seeded Olive Oil Granola, and Smoked Pork Shoulder.

They were held with passionate conviction, and incorporated, finally, into the constitutions of the new American states and of the United States.

You'll never know unless you teach them yourself. Catholic parents will find comfort in this parenting book when they discover how easy it is to converse and work with their children. For those under five, the conversations are about love and discipline; for older children, the discussions are on faith and respect; and for teens, the focus is on decision-making and defending faith and life, while rejecting peer pressure, drugs, alcohol, sexual abuse, depression, violence, and much more. In short (sometimes five-minute) sessions, families, even dysfunctional ones, come together to be strongly pro-life and pro-Catholic. These seeds of goodness are planted in one-on-one talks or in \\"Family Fun Time\\" activities. The Bible says, \\"I laid a foundation, and another man is building upon it. Let each man take care how he builds upon it.\\" (1 Corinthians 3:10).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5ncOAAAACAAJ&dq=Speak+to+Your+Children:+A+Handy+Catholic+Parenting+Guide+for+Concise,+Faith-filled+Conversations+with+Kids+about+Discipline,+Decision-making,+Truth,+and+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unger's Concise Bible Dictionary: With Complete Pronunciation Guide to Bible Names","description":"This dictionary provides the essential information for profitable Bible study.

Kauffman looks at a neglected genre the love letters written by literary heroines. Tracing the development of the genre from Ovid to the twentieth-century novel, Kauffman explores through provocative and incisive readings the important implications of these amatory discourses for an understanding of fictive representation in general. Among the texts Kauffman treats are Ovid's Heroides, Heloise's letters to Abelard, The Letters of a Portuguese Nun, Clarissa, Jane Eyre, The Turn of the Screw, Absalom, Absalom!, and The Three Marias: New Portuguese Letters. Drawing on the work of such theorists as Todorov, Genette, Barthes, Bakhtin, Lacan, and Derrida, Kauffman demonstrates how the codes of love shape intertextual dialogues among these works, in which each innovation in the genre is simultaneously a response to and a departure from the one preceding it. Throughout, she pays particular attention to the unsettling questions that the genre's shared thematic preoccupations and formal characteristics pose for concepts of gender, authorship, genre, and mimesis. Drawing on poststructuralism and psychoanalytic criticism to extend the boundaries of feminist theory, Kauffman makes a significant contribution to contemporary critical discussions of writing and gender, mimesis and narrative discourse, and poetics and politics. Her book, broad in its scope and far-reaching in its implications, will be valuable reading for anyone interested in feminist criticism, literary theory, and literary history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a_-tDwAAQBAJ&dq=Discourses+of+Desire:+Gender,+Genre,+and+Epistolary+Fictions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Pictures of Japan (My Travelship)","description":"From the Foreword: Friends of Moon and Winds-so were the Japanese poets called who wrote the tiny poems that comprise the greater part of this book.

The best lawyers are storytellers, he explains, who take the raw and disjointed observations of witnesses and transform them into coherent and persuasive narratives. Critics of the adversary system, of course, have little patience for storytelling, regarding trial lawyers as flimflam artists who use sly means and cunning rhetoric to befuddle witnesses and bamboozle juries. Why not simply allow the witnesses to speak their minds, without the distorting influence of lawyers' stratagems and feints? But Lubet demonstrates that the craft of lawyer storytelling is a legitimate technique for determining the truth andnot at all coincidentallyfor providing the best defense for the attorney's client. Storytelling accomplishes three important purposes at trial. It helps to establish a \\"theory of the case,\\" which is a plausible and reasonable explanation of the underlying events, presented in the light most favorable to the attorney's client. Storytelling also develops the \\"trial theme,\\" which is the lawyer's way of adding moral force to the desired outcome. Most importantly, storytelling provides a coherent \\"story frame,\\" which organizes all of the events, transactions, and other surrounding facts into an easily understandable narrative context. As with all powerful tools, storytelling may be misused to ill purposes. Therefore, as Lubet explains, lawyers do not have carte blanche to tell whatever stories they choose. It is a creative process to be sure, but every story must ultimately be based on \\"nothing but the truth.\\" There is no room for lying. On the other hand, it is obvious that trial lawyers never tell \\"the whole truth,\\" since life and experience are boundless and therefore not fully describable. No lawyer or court of law can ever get at the whole truth, but the attorney who effectively employs the techniques of storytelling will do the best job of sorting out competing claims and facts, thereby helping the court arrive at a decision that serves the goals of accuracy and justice. To illustrate the various challenges, benefits, and complexities of storytelling, Lubet elaborates the stories of six different trials. Some of the cases are real, including John Brown and Wyatt Earp, while some are fictional, including Atticus Finch and Liberty Valance. In each chapter, the emphasis is on the narrative itself, emphasizing the trial's rich context of facts and personalities. The overall conclusion, as Lubet puts it, is that \\"purposive storytelling provides a necessary dimension to our adversary system of justice.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RgUUCgAAQBAJ&dq=Nothing+But+the+Truth:+Why+Trial+Lawyers+Don%27t,+Can%27t,+and+Shouldn%27t+Have+to+Tell+the+Whole+Truth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Citizenship: Passing the Test","description":"Provides definitions of key concepts about American history and government used in the citizenship examination and interview.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mq7cngEACAAJ&dq=Citizenship:+Passing+the+Test&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Attack and Interceptor Jets","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xc3MMgEACAAJ&dq=Attack+and+Interceptor+Jets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mysterium Paschale: The Mystery of Easter","description":"This is an account, at once rigorously theological and warmly devotional, of the death and resurrection of Christ, and their significance for the Christian life.

And it offers an enlightening perspective on astronomy, Church history, and religious architecture, as well as an analysis of measurements testing the limits of attainable accuracy, undertaken with rudimentary means and extraordinary zeal.

At once brilliant and infuriating, self-important and courageous, Hastings s Churchill comes brashly to life as never before. Beginning in 1940, when popular demand elevated Churchill to the role of prime minister, and concluding with the end of the war, Hastings shows us Churchill at his most intrepid and essential, when, by sheer force of will, he kept Britain from collapsing in the face of what looked like certain defeat. Later, we see his significance ebb as the United States enters the war and the Soviets turn the tide on the Eastern Front. But Churchill, Hastings reminds us, knew as well as anyone that the war would be dominated by others, and he managed his relationships with the other Allied leaders strategically, so as to maintain Britain s influence and limit Stalin s gains. At the same time, Churchill faced political peril at home, a situation for which he himself was largely to blame. Hastings shows how Churchill nearly squandered the miraculous escape of the British troops at Dunkirk and failed to address fundamental flaws in the British Army. His tactical inaptitude and departmental meddling won him few friends in the military, and by 1942, many were calling for him to cede operational control. Nevertheless, Churchill managed to exude a public confidence that brought the nation through the bitter war. Hastings rejects the traditional Churchill hagiography while still managing to capture what he calls Churchill s  appetite for the fray.  Certain to be a classic, Winston s War is a riveting profile of one of the greatest leaders of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rJSXMIxpcngC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The art of building the Pennsylvania longrifle","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x1xUswEACAAJ&dq=The+art+of+building+the+Pennsylvania+longrifle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pennsylvania Dutch","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Holiness: Its nature, hindrances, difficulties, and roots : being a series of papers on the subject","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jylenQEACAAJ&dq=Holiness:+Its+nature,+hindrances,+difficulties,+and+roots+:+being+a+series+of+papers+on+the+subject&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Charismatic Renewal Among Lutherans","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QdCoHAAACAAJ&dq=The+Charismatic+Renewal+Among+Lutherans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ten Secrets for a Successful Family: A Perfect Ten for Homes That Win","description":"Adrian Rodgers shows parents how to creatively, consistently, and compellingly teach children the ten commandments and start raising their children God's way.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2XyEzQEACAAJ&dq=Ten+Secrets+for+a+Successful+Family:+A+Perfect+Ten+for+Homes+That+Win&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Birding from a tractor seat,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HmWkwgEACAAJ&dq=Birding+from+a+tractor+seat,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goddess","description":"Gestalt and Jungian psychologists Jennifer and Roger Woolger have written a fascinating guide to the goddess qualities that live within us all.

Chicago Tribune A classic look at those years of baseball futility and frustration that make the rare taste of success so much sweeter. Any team can have an off-decade. But three in a row? Only in Cleveland. No sports fans suffered more miserable teams for more seasons than Indians fans of the 1960s,  70s, and  80s. Terry Pluto takes a fond and often humorous look at  the bad old days  of the Tribe and finds plenty of great stories for fans to commiserate with. Other teams lose players to injuries; the Indians lost them to alcoholism (Sam McDowell), a nervous breakdown (Tony Horton), and the pro golf tour (Ken Harrelson). They even had to trade young Dennis Eckersley (a future Hall-of-Famer) because his wife fell in love with his best friend and teammate. Pluto profiles the men who made the Indians what they were, for better or worse, including Gabe Paul, the underfunded and overmatched general manager; Herb Score, the much-loved master of malaprops in the broadcast booth; Andre Thornton, who weathered personal tragedies and stood as one of the few hitting stalwarts on some terrible teams; and Super Joe Charboneau, who blazed across the American League as a rookie but flamed out the following season. Long-suffering Indians fans finally got an exciting, star-studded, winning team in the second half of the 1990s. But this book still stands as the definitive story of that generation of Tribe fans and a great piece of sports history writing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wQIWEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Klee (The Taste of our time)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZmwLjwEACAAJ&dq=Klee+(The+Taste+of+our+time)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manifesto for Americans","description":"Do you fear for our democracy? Are you ready to throw in the towel? Don't! This is your guidebook to reassembling our hyperpolarized American society in six (not-so-easy) steps, written by the cohost of WNYC's On the Media. As is often observed, Trump is a symptom of a virus that has been incubating for at least fifty years. But not often observed is where the virus is imbedded: in the psychic core of our identity. In American Manifesto: Saving Democracy from Villains, Vandals, and Ourselves, popular media personality Bob Garfield examines the tragic confluence of the American preoccupation with identity and the catastrophic disintegration of the mass media. Garfield investigates how we've gotten to this moment when our identity is threatened by both the left and the right, when e pluribus unum is no longer a source of national pride, and why, when looking through this lens of identity, the rise of Trumpism is no surprise. Overlaying this crisis is the rise of the Facebook-Google duopoly and the filter bubble of social media, where identity is insular and immutable. But fear not! WNYC's On the Media cohost Garfield has ideas about how we may counter the forces of fragmentation the manifesto itself: six steps to take to reassemble our fractured society. A quick, fascinating read, American Manifesto offers not only a vision of a country in extremis, but also a plan for how to address the ways in which our democracy is imperiled. Provocative, profound, and sometimes hilariously profane, American Manifesto is a call to action like no other.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6hO3zQEACAAJ&dq=Manifesto+for+Americans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Medicine in Quotations: Views of Health and Disease Through the Ages","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Thomas Edison: Inventing the Future (Great Lives Series)","description":"Traces the life of America's greatest inventor, recounts how he developed the first commercial laboratory, and looks at how his inventions changed the world","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Swb1_3gUqOcC&dq=Thomas+Edison:+Inventing+the+Future+(Great+Lives+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leo : The Sign of the Lion (The Little Birth Sign Library/Mini)","description":"Who are you going to fall in love with next?

Evidence from Scientists","description":"Drawing on startling new evidence from the mapping of the genome, an explosive new account of the genetic basis of race and its role in the human story Fewer ideas have been more toxic or harmful than the idea of the biological reality of race, and with it the idea that humans of different races are biologically different from one another. For this understandable reason, the idea has been banished from polite academic conversation. Arguing that race is more than just a social construct can get a scholar run out of town, or at least off campus, on a rail. Human evolution, the consensus view insists, ended in prehistory. Inconveniently, as Nicholas Wade argues in A Troublesome Inheritance, the consensus view cannot be right. And in fact, we know that populations have changed in the past few thousand years to be lactose tolerant, for example, and to survive at high altitudes. Race is not a bright-line distinction; by definition it means that the more human populations are kept apart, the more they evolve their own distinct traits under the selective pressure known as Darwinian evolution. For many thousands of years, most human populations stayed where they were and grew distinct, not just in outward appearance but in deeper senses as well. Wade, the longtime journalist covering genetic advances for The New York Times, draws widely on the work of scientists who have made crucial breakthroughs in establishing the reality of recent human evolution. The most provocative claims in this book involve the genetic basis of human social habits. What we might call middle-class social traits thrift, docility, nonviolence have been slowly but surely inculcated genetically within agrarian societies, Wade argues. These  values  obviously had a strong cultural component, but Wade points to evidence that agrarian societies evolved away from hunter-gatherer societies in some crucial respects. Also controversial are his findings regarding the genetic basis of traits we associate with intelligence, such as literacy and numeracy, in certain ethnic populations, including the Chinese and Ashkenazi Jews. Wade believes deeply in the fundamental equality of all human peoples. He also believes that science is best served by pursuing the truth without fear, and if his mission to arrive at a coherent summa of what the new genetic science does and does not tell us about race and human history leads straight into a minefield, then so be it. This will not be the last word on the subject, but it will begin a powerful and overdue conversation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WLcBDAAAQBAJ&dq=What+is+Race%3F+Evidence+from+Scientists&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gismo from Outer Space","description":"Two boys discover that the unusual device they have found is a communications system for a space ship enabling them to contact men from another planet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lk3MPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Gismo+from+Outer+Space&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Second International, 1889-1914","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7aDaAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Second+International,+1889-1914&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learn Design With Flash MX","description":"For design novices, this book answers all the essential Flash design questions that other titles ignore and readers are too timid to ask.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t6aJ-7mbujMC&dq=Learn+Design+With+Flash+MX&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learn to Earn : A Beginner's Guide to the Basics of Investing and Business","description":"Mutual-fund superstar Peter Lynch and author John Rothchild explain the basic principles of the stock market and business in an investing guide that will enlighten and entertain anyone who is high-school age or older. Many investors, including some with substantial portfolios, have only the sketchiest idea of how the stock market works. The reason, say Lynch and Rothchild, is that the basics of investing the fundamentals of our economic system and what they have to do with the stock market aren t taught in school. At a time when individuals have to make important decisions about saving for college and 401(k) retirement funds, this failure to provide a basic education in investing can have tragic consequences. For those who know what to look for, investment opportunities are everywhere. The average high-school student is familiar with Nike, Reebok, McDonald s, the Gap, and the Body Shop. Nearly every teenager in America drinks Coke or Pepsi, but only a very few own shares in either company or even understand how to buy them. Every student studies American history, but few realize that our country was settled by European colonists financed by public companies in England and Holland and the basic principles behind public companies haven t changed in more than three hundred years. In Learn to Earn, Lynch and Rothchild explain in a style accessible to anyone who is high-school age or older how to read a stock table in the daily newspaper, how to understand a company annual report, and why everyone should pay attention to the stock market.

That s why we created the Florida Real Estate License Exam Prep (FL-RELEP) the way we did. Since we have been managing real estate schools and developing curriculum for forty years, we know how all this works  or fails to work. First, FL-RELEP is comprehensive. It contains both extensive content review as well as testing practice. And the text review, unlike most competing books, is Florida-specific  not just simplistic national content, but terse, relevant and accurate state and national laws and regulations presented as a set of  key point reviews  ideal for pre-test memorization. FL-RELEP precisely follows the official 50+ page Florida syllabus topic by topic in the correct ordered sequence. Consequently, the material serves as a more user-friendly review for students who have taken pre-license courses throughout Florida containing this required content and organization. FL-RELEP s key point reviews are a succinct compression of tested national principles and practices drawn from our own Florida textbook, Principles of Real Estate Practice in Florida  one of the most widely used principles textbooks in Florida. Finally, our review content and question selection is tailored to follow the state testing outline promulgated by the state of Florida. A word about the tests. The FL-RELEP s test questions are designed to cover the content covered by the law reviews  which reinforces your learning of the total body of information tested by the state of Florida. The questions are direct, to the point, and designed to test your understanding. When you have completed a given test, you can check your answers against the answer key in the appendix. You may also note that each question s answer is accompanied by a brief explanation to further reinforce your understanding. In the end, as you know, it s all up to you. Unlike other publications, we are not going to tell you that using this book will guarantee that you pass the Florida state exam. It still takes hard work and study to pass. But we have done our best here to get you ready. Following that, the most we can do is wish you the best of success in taking and passing your Florida exam.

While goods services now tend to be shrouded in anonymity, in past times they were celebrated, prominently advertised, and in many cases were the raisons d' tre for a rail route. Throughout the nineteenth and much of the twentieth century, goods trains were the lifeblood of the nation, transporting precious raw materials, construction and industrial items, and fresh produce from coastal areas and farms into the centres of bustling cities. This informative illustrated history shows how rail freight has been carried since Victorian times, and how systems have been organized, from the train itself to the sidings, railway clearing houses, goods sheds and final destinations  whether villages, towns, cities, factories or docks. It also examines the basic rolling stock of these trains, from the humble coal wagon to today's hi-tech containers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lnLeDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unformed and Unfilled: The Gap Theory","description":"Everyone's heard of it. Many believe it. Is there a 'gap in time' between the first two verses in Genesis? Does this alleged gap really represent a vast amount of time? Weston Fields' classic treatment of this subject is now being published by Master Books, and promoted by such important organisations as Answers in Genesis. In this book, Fields makes a detailed study of the gap theory, paying particular attention to the Hebrew of Genesis. His conclusion -- that this theory is not a reasonable compromise with modern evolutionary theory, but a dangerous diversion from biblical truth -- helps readers who struggle with the question of the time taken during the creation week. Was it really six days? Can Christians find a workable solution to the debate about creation and time? An important book. Features: A presentation of a variety of views espoused by Christians of all denominations; A professional, scholarly look that can be easily understood by laymen; A fascinating study of the original Hebrew text.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=puCZKZEpwv4C&dq=Unformed+and+Unfilled:+The+Gap+Theory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Social, Emotional, and Personality Development, Volume 3, Handbook of Child Psychology, 5th Edition","description":"Part of the authoritative four-volume reference that spans the entire field of child development and has set the standard against which all other scholarly references are compared.

THE WHITE BOOK becomes a meditation on the color white, as well as a fictional journey inspired by an older sister who died in her mother's arms, a few hours old. The narrator grapples with the tragedy that has haunted her family, an event she colors in stark white--breast milk, swaddling bands, the baby's rice cake-colored skin--and, from here, visits all that glows in her memory: from a white dog to sugar cubes. As the writer reckons with the enormity of her sister's death, Han Kang's trademark frank and chilling prose is softened by retrospection, introspection, and a deep sense of resilience and love. THE WHITE BOOK--ultimately a letter from Kang to her sister--offers powerful philosophy and personal psychology on the tenacity and fragility of the human spirit, and our attempts to graft new life from the ashes of destruction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pFhbDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Tramp","description":"What do you get when you combine a dog from the wrong side of the tracks with a pampered pooch?

She had turned to the swamp for solace after a family tragedy and visited the swamp frequently. As her concern for the vanishing wetlands grew, she was inspired to document the swamp and share her love of nature with the world. Veiled behind dense drapes of Spanish moss and walls of wondrous cypress trees, Manchac Swamp is a wilderness jewel accessible only by boat. Drawn to the swamp's mystery and eventually captivated by its peace, Sims spent 15 years patiently penetrating its secrets. The result, trapped on film, is the many moods, flora, and fauna of this hidden world. Now, in this stunning album of her photographs, a glimpse of that quintessential Louisiana place in its seasonal variations is offered to all. In an evocative introduction to the book, John Kemp draws upon his interviews with several residents. They are a rare group who are known as \\"guardians of the swamp\\" and consider their existence a study in life as they learn to coexist with the majesty that surrounds them. An enigmatic group, they make their living off of the land.

All the while, dwindling patent protections impose an ever-contracting timeframe for success.Written to be accessible to a wide audience, NEW DRUGS provides a thorough, succinct, and practical understanding of these drug-development processes. If you're involved in the pharmaceutical industry, NEW DRUGS will provide scientific and management tools to increase the likelihood of regulatory approval at each phase of your compound's development. If you're a patient or consumer, NEW DRUGS will enable you to intelligently discuss medications with your health-care provider and empower you to make informed decisions at the pharmacy.

Moreover he argued for biographies of writers such as Dryden, Trollope, Wagner and Gerard Manley Hopkins as their lives would tell us something about their art. Humphrey Carpenter himself nicely summarizes Auden's ambiguity on this question. 'Here (referring to literary biography), as so often in his life, Auden adopted a dogmatic attitude which did not reflect the full range of his opinions, and which he sometimes flatly contradicted.' Although the biography was not authorized it did receive the co-operation of the Auden Estate which gave permission for letters and unpublished works to be quoted. The result is a biography that was widely praised on first publication in 1981 and which continues to hold its own. Now is the obvious time to reissue it with the character of Humphrey Carpenter playing an important role in Alan Bennett's The Habit of Art. In his introduction Alan Bennett writes 'When I started writing the play I made much use of the biographies of both Auden and Britten written by Humphrey Carpenter and both are models of their kind. Indeed I was consulting his books so much that eventually Carpenter found his way into the play.' 'Carpenter is a model biographer - diligent, unspeculative, sympathetic, and extremely good at finding out what happened when and with whom . . . admirably detailed and researched study.'

In this revelatory work, Barbara W. Tuchman examines not only the great rhythms of history but the grain and texture of domestic life: what childhood was like; what marriage meant; how money, taxes, and war dominated the lives of serf, noble, and clergy alike. Granting her subjects their loyalties, treacheries, and guilty passions, Tuchman re-creates the lives of proud cardinals, university scholars, grocers and clerks, saints and mystics, lawyers and mercenaries, and, dominating all, the knight in all his valor and  furious follies,  a  terrible worm in an iron cocoon.  Praise for A Distant Mirror  Beautifully written, careful and thorough in its scholarship . . . What Ms. Tuchman does superbly is to tell how it was. . . . No one has ever done this better.  The New York Review of Books  A beautiful, extraordinary book . . . Tuchman at the top of her powers . . . She has done nothing finer.  The Wall Street Journal  Wise, witty, and wonderful . . . a great book, in a great historical tradition.

In the 3rd edition of this popular volume, Keith Eubank seeks answers to the questions that have plagued us: Why, after the ghastly ordeal of World War I did Western powers undervalue the threat from Hitler? Why was there so much reluctance on the part of Britain and France to confront Germany? Why had Germany been permitted to rearm and to occupy independent nations without a struggle? What was the policy of appeasement? Why did the appeasers fail to perceive Hitler's intentions? In addition to a re-examination of these questions and an effort to dispel the enduring myths surrounding the history of this era, Keith Eubank has enhanced this new edition by including an analysis of the motivations and actions of central figures such as Neville Chamberlain and Joseph Stalin as well as a re-assessment of Soviet policies in the light of recent research that reveals their leaders as far less altruistic than some have imagined. With an expanded conclusion, a new photo section, and an updated bibliographic essay, this book remains an excellent brief overview of the period between 1918 and 1939.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=722JBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},I=["disabled"],P={key:0},E={key:1};function q(s,i,t,u,r,a){const g=f("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),n("div",M,[(e(!0),o(m,null,b(a.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",E,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",P,"See more"))],8,I)):c("",!0)])}const H=d(B,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-bd47438f"]]),J=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/17.md","filePath":"glossary/17.md"}'),x={name:"glossary/17.md"},D=Object.assign(x,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[w(H)]))}});export{J as __pageData,D as default};
