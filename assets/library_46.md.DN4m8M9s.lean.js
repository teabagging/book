I was not, though it does remind me of wading through dense fog, especially at the outset. I am a huge fan of Eco, and I discovered that, like rays of sunshine penetrating that fog, it illuminates those precious tiny gems that enable one to glimpse and understand rarely understood aspects of human existance. This apparently semiautographical novel allows the reader to gain insights into coming of age in Italy prior to, during and after WWII and it is so well written and illustrated that one can forgive Eco's manifest self indulgence."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Extraordinary Italian writer Umberto Eco is familiar for his phenomenal best-seller, THE NAME OF THE ROSE, among other works. THE MYSTERIOUS FLAME OF QUEEN LOANA takes the reader for a bizarre ride through the past to discover how memory operates. In Italy, 60-year-old Giambatistta \\"Yambo\\" Bodoni has suffered a stroke that has affected his memory. Flashes of sound and literary allusions fill the book's opening pages as Yambo's mind approaches consciousness in a hospital room. He knows only words and sounds, literary references in several languages, a poem here, Sherlock Holmes there, as his brain tries to re-focus. It's a brilliant, exciting and very dizzying sequence. Yambo can't remember who he is or who the people around him are, but he seems to remember all sorts of other things. When he goes off to his childhood home in the country to recuperate, he finds memories of his boyhood in the books and toys he grew up with.\\"Certain images spark something inside you,\\" he says and goes in search of more of that spark or \\"mysterious flame.\\" As he re-reads all his childhood books, he also rediscovers old Fascist material and horrible anti-Semitic propaganda from the early 1940s. He's not sure how it all fits together in his life. \\"It is awkward, revisiting a world you have seen before,\\" he says, \\"like coming home, after a long journey, to someone else's house.\\"Lots of remarkable col orful illustrations, reprinted from actual French, German and mostly Italian ads, posters, cartoons and book covers, also evoke strong memories. I couldn't relate to most of the European allusions, but I related to the process. If he had been talking about the books I grew up with, it would have stirred strong memories of my own. The segments during which he is in and out of consciousness are fascinating and poetic, demonstrating how he thinks and what he perceives. The book is a beautiful recreation of the memory-triggering process. As we follow how he regains his memory, the process seems to ring true. Eco is a gifted craftsman. This is truly a masterpiece, and some of the insights are breathtaking."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana is a side of Umberto Eco that you haven't seen before . . . and I think you will like it . . . especially if you found the references in The Name of the Rose and Foucault's Pendulum to be a little too much for you.The book's premise is much like that of The Arabian Nights, an excuse to introduce an interesting story teller who unravels a fascinating tale that could go on endlessly. In this case, the device is a stroke which causes Yambo to lose his memory of most everything (including his name) except what he has read. Recuperating from his stroke, Yambo receives hints from his wife and best friend about what he's like . . . and discovers that he has a weakness for the ladies. What does that mean about his relationship with his beautiful, young assistant?Soon frustrated by his memoryless life in Milan, Yambo goes back to his childhood home to see if anything there resurrects any memories. He discovers a house and attic full of the past through which he relives the history of Italians his age. Later, a second stroke restores his memory, and he relives his life as it happened . . . with a little fantasy attached.It's a witty commentary on the vacuity of the \\"official\\" record of our times to see how little of Yambo's life the effects of his life captured.For those who aren't Italian, the book offers deep and thoughtful look at what it meant to live in Italy under the Fascists. At times, it seemed like the musical comedy version of Gunter Grass's books about Nazi Germany.The book dazzles most, however, with its many full color illustrations from books, magazines, posters and other cultural icons. These images make the mental pictures conjured up by Eco's words stronger and more lasting. Be sure to check out the section on sources of citations and references that begin on 451. These details will add to your enjoyment of the illustrations.As I read the book, I wished that I knew a few more languages (especially German and Italian), but most of the references were either easy to appreciate or covered in context by another reference that I understood. Naturally, some Ph.D. student will write a dissertation that firmly fixes all of the references, but that will be too stuffy to read for this breezy, charming effort.What is life? What is memory? What is reality? These fundamental questions are all beautifully addressed in both sublime (images of perfect love) and the mundane (relieving oneself among the vineyard rows.It's great fun, and I highly recommend this book to you.

It is well written and has lots of information just like all other books that he wrote. But for some reason, I don't like this one as much as the other ones. There is just too much information from a culture and era that I can't related to. Perhaps, it is meant to be like this. Maybe he wanted to convey the idea of fragmented foreign ideas becoming the past memory."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Although it wasn't 100% uninteresting, I found it, on the whole, very boring. Picture this: a 60 year old intellectual wakes up from a coma with no memories of his past. In order to retrieve this memories, he goes into an excruciatingly detailed account of every book, magazine and comic strip he ever read in his life.Compensated by one moving episode from his childhood, I found the setting, the subject and the personality of the main character irrelevant and definetly lacking in the excitement and the depth of the other Umberto Eco's books I have read.--Written By Mary Camarena"},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"An older book dealer suddenly and unexpectedly holds in his hands Shakespeare's first folio from 1623 and the shock of the discovery triggers a coma from which the narrator is attempting to recover his memory and re-discover himself. It's an intriguing premise as the book dealer revisits an attic to dig through boxes of his old books to learn what light they can shed on his remembrance of lost time. The books, dating from his childhood, trigger memories of life in Fascist Italy, as he re-learns who he is by what he has already read, including children's tales, religious works, advertising, comic books, paperback novels and war propoganda. I admire the intelligence of Eco, a scholar whose style is fluid, clear, articulate, erudite and engaging. I also admire the translation of the novel, which reads beautifully and flows naturally. This novel seems self-indulgent in places and has a great many cultural and historical references, which will elude readers outside Italy. Of all the works referenced in this novel, there didn't seem to be enough of the real masterpieces here. Perhaps, that's the tragedy that any reader may risk by overcommitting to reading time squandered upon the works of lesser literary lights. By the way, this novel is masterfully illustrated by the publisher. I was intrigued by Eco and am well into Foucault's Pendulum, which is more impressive for the wit and sheer intellectual luminosity of the writing but that's another story for another day. I may well end up giving Eco's list a run for its money, if the rest of his work is as good as these two very fine but not quite great novels. Time spent reading Eco clearly is time well spent."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Fictional narrative is a strange thing. It can be changed and re-organized as the writer wants. The reader has the passive role of accepting the pre-arranged. Exceptions exist, such as Cortazar's \\"Hopscotch\\" and other books. Come to think of it, Umberto Eco's latest \\"The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana\\" is a book about the power of fiction and it handles an unorthodox form of narrative. It is a illustrated novel - for grown-ups.The pictures come as a bonus and as a curse. The colorful book is easy to the eyes, but at the same time, not always is the writer able to articulate image and text. There is a connection most of the time, but not most of the time the picture is so fundamental for the narrative, it is just a plus.The plot is about a man who lost his memory and while trying to recuperate it finds the books that were important to him when he was a kid and adolescent. Both writer and narrator, Giambattista Bodoni, try to elicit the connections. On the other hand, they aren't that interesting.Eco is one of the most important semiotician working today, and this is always there in \\"The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana\\". The book is loaded with symbols and messages, and never fails to deliver an essay throughout the narrative. This at the same time is provocative and frustrating. While the readers starts thinking about many topics, one has to recognize that such lectures never come at the right time."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"to one another. To live is to remember and to remember is to live. To die is to forget and to forget is to die.\\" Samuel ButlerI approached Umberto Eco's new novel, The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, with some trepidation. I have sometime found Eco's work to be a bit difficult to get through. It became very apparent that I would have no such problems with this book. The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana was not only a very accessible book but, more importantly, it was at once both immensely enjoyable and thought-provoking.Before turning to the book itself, I found it interesting that the book is filled with illustrations. Throughout the book World War Two propaganda posters, newspaper clippings, comic book pages, and ads from Italian fashion magazines are printed alongside the text. Some might assert that Eco's reliance on illustrations may detract from the text or represent something of a gimmick. I think the illustrations are visually stunning and serve to recreate the social and political atmosphere of Italy in the 1930s and 1940s during which time much of the book takes place. They add a visual punch to the thoughts of Eco's narrator.The book opens with Giambattista Boldoni, a 59-year old rare book dealer, awaking from a light coma in a hospital after suffering a stroke. It is determined quickly that Boldoni, known to his friends and family since childhood as Yambo, is suffering from partial amnesia. Although he has a vivid memory of social and cultural events through his life he has no memory of anything relating to his personal life. The first chapter is a classic of pop-culture allusions and metaphors. Yambo's sentences come out in stream of consciousness fashion with no personal context at all. Yambo's sentences consist of a series of bits of quotations from Poe, Conan-Doyle, Robert Lewis Stevenson, songs, ad slogans and other reference that I could spend weeks trying to identify. The rest of the book, like Eco's Name of the Rose of The Island of the Day before is something of a detective story. Yambo turns sleuth and sets out to discover who he is and how he came to be him.Yambo and his wife agree in short order that this mystery would best be solved if Yambo moves back to his family's country home were Yambo spent most of his childhood. He arrives to find that most of his possessions and those of his parents and grandparents are stored in the attic or in various locations throughout the house. He begins opening boxes to find old phonograph records, school notebooks, photographs, Italian and American comic books and newspaper clippings dating back to the 30s and 40s'. Some of these items ignite a little spark in his head (as Eco puts it) but nothing really serves to restore his memories. Those little sparks seem futile and frustrate Yambo, like a butane cigarette lighter on a windy day must frustrate a smoker just dying to light up a smoke. Nevertheless, Yambo makes some progress. About halfway through the book Eco introduces a dramatic twist in the plot (which will not be divulged) that changes the nature of Yambo's quest.The second half of the book is devoted to Yambo's examination of his life as he now remembers it and the meaning of his quest for his identity. Answer to questions raised in the first half of the book, such as Yambo's strange attraction for foggy days, are explained. The tone of the narrative in this half of the book is quite different from the narrative in the first. As more information is revealed to Yambo, and to the reader, the focus turns not just to Yambo's quest for memory but the importance of memory in one's life. At the same time, what we choose to forget is sometimes just as important to the structure of our lives as that which we choose to remember.The intricate thought processes of Yambo as he seeks to recreate his life are set out beautifully by Eco. It is hard to describe the impact of Eco's writing except to refer back to the sentences that Samuel Butler wrote after those lines that started this review:\\"Everything is so much involved in and is so much a process of its opposite that, as it is almost fair to call death a process of life and life a process of death, so it is to call memory a process of forgetting and forgetting a process of remembering.\\" Memory and forgetfulness are as life and death to one another, for Yambo and, through Yambo's thoughts, to the reader.The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana is well worth reading.L. Fleisig"},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Umberto Eco is one of the few writers whose incredible intelligence blazes on every page of his books. Fortunately, despite the fact that his intelligence cannot be ignored, he generally doesn't make his reader feel small and stupid. In fact, when Eco is at his best, the fascinations of the story draw you in and make you forget the challenges of what you are reading. When he is at his worst, the going gets tougher, like listening to a professor who is interesting but not really entertaining. In The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana we get Eco at his best and worst.This novel is divided into three parts and the first part is as good as anything Eco's written since The Name of the Rose. We are given the interesting premise of a man, Yambo, who has lost the memory of the events of his life while retaining the memory of the things he has learned--the books he has read, the music he has heard, etc. Eco is able to believably evoke the experience of this man whose mind is like a textbook, full of facts but with no connection to the people who sees before him. It is a fascinating point of view. As the story progresses, he and his family and friends attempt to figure out ways to bring back his personal memories. To that end, he is packed off alone to his childhood home in Solara.It is in part two, the stay in Solara, where the going gets tougher. This section is basically a review of the music and literature of pre- and post-WWII Italy. Not being Italian, I had very little connection to the bulk of the material described though it did evoke some memories of my own childhood literary experiences. It is amazing how much literature really does become universal in Western culture. Still, this section basically came across as Eco's own stroll down memory lane and I think, even for an Italian of similar vintage, it goes on rather long.In section three, Eco gets back on track with his story. Yambo has had another \\"episode\\" but this time his personal memories are returning. We hear Yambo's unconscious mind answer some of the questions about his life that have been raised, the bulk of which centers around a great story of the young Yambo helping some Partisans escape capture during the war. I was less than thrilled by Eco's version of the \\"going into the light\\" death at the end of the book but he gained back a lot of my goodwill in this closing section.In the final analysis, this is a pretty good novel. Eco's work will forever suffer in comparison to his truly great first novel, The Name of the Rose. I have read all of his novels since then and this is without a doubt the best complete novel he's written since Foucault's Pendulum. Some of the writing in section one may be the best he's ever done. It is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Memory is a subject recurring in literature. Umberto Eco's latest novel is an exhilirating romp through pop culture. Readers are left as dazzled as the narrator Yambo in dissecting everything from poetry to illustrated postcards, gramophone records to newspaper articles. Yambo never manages to recover his sense of identity after his journey through his childhood library at his country home in Solara. Is memory tied to a recall of the larger culture? Eco seems to say no to this question and at the end of the novel we are like Yambo in still being enshrouded in the fog of memory. In contrast to Marcel Proust's \\"Temps Perdu,\\" in which the famous tea and madeleine cake recapture a lifetime for the narrator, in \\"The Mysterious Flame Of Queen Loana\\" Yambo's efforts to rediscover his persona is thwarted by all he reads, sees, hears and experiences. Eco's reading of the human experience is as elusive as his subject and the novel above all is an ode to a lifetime of scholarly study of the hidden meanings of literature and life."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana is one of Eco's richest novels in a while...perhaps the richest since The Name of the Rose. Each of his novels, all of them, have provided the patient reader with rewards aplenty. The Mysterioius Flame, you will find, is worth the effort it takes to read it.Yambo, a 60ish antiquarian book seller has a stroke that virtually wipes his mind clean...clean as if someone had erased a chalk board. The only memory he has is of the words he has read...all of them. His personal life, the fine points of reference we all need to know who we are...to define ourselves is gone. No recollection of family, friends, history....gone.Yambo retreats to the family estate, Solara, where he has kept virtually every scrap of paper, every photograph...all the things we all keep to keep track of ourselves. He hopes that by surrounding himself with this material he will be able to regain his memory.Eco is a superbly rick novelist. His stories are made up of various layers, each supporting and enhancing the other. The characters are memorable, the story well weaved. Even his setting, Solara is a treat. I can't help but believe that part of the difficulty in reading his work is due to the translating. Certainly Eco is several levels above most of his contemporaries. Does America have anyone like him.You'll love the Mysterious Flame."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Umberto Eco's writing is great but not easy. This will stimulate your imagination and thinking, but an easy romp it is not. If you want to stimulate your imagination and thinking this is for you. If you just want a mystery this may be too much for you. This is probably not the best book to introduce you to Umberto Eco's writing, but If you already like his other books you will like this."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"This is a fascinating journey - be warned it is a long journey - through 60 years of Italian history through the eyes (or memories) of book dealer named Yambo. The journey is the plot, I think other reviewers missed this. The whole book is a reminiscence like a grandfather telling his grandchildren of his youth, but with the twist that the grandfather is reconstructing his past after his memory is lost.The book is published with color illustrations, cartoons, book covers, cartoons, sheet music, poem, lyrics, etc. of the things Yambo finds in his childhood home and uses to rediscover his past. It's a great idea. A cultural history. It will be much more meaningful to Italians who remember these things. Still, reading the book I was able to get into the shoes of an Italian boy before, during and after WWII. I enjoyed it for that and kept reading.There's a philosophical subtext about how real something is if you don't remember it. Reality and memory are linked, or at least it feels that way.Not light reading, but a remarkable fictional cultural history of 20th century Italy through one man's memories."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I've just finished listening to an unabridged audio recording of \\"The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana,\\" and thought it was pretty wonderful. I have \\"read\\" read other Eco novels in the past -- \\"The Name of the Rose\\" and \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" -- and liked them both very much. When I finished listening to \\"The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana,\\" I went online to see what others had made of the novel, and read a number of reviews -- from the Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, New York Times and others, as well as many of the reviews published here. Almost all were lukewarm. Maybe it's because I listened to this novel rather than read it that I feel as though I've experienced this novel so differently from other reviewers as to wonder whether we're writing about the same book.We've all gleaned similar basics -- that this is the story of an antiquarian bookseller named \\"Yambo\\" Bodoni, who, after having a stroke, has lost his personal memory -- but not his memory of books and other cultural artifacts. In Part 1, he wanders around Milan trying to recover his memory. In Part 2, he sifts through his childhood books and papers in the family's country house. In Part 3, having had another stroke, he now remembers almost everything, but is in a coma and cannot communicate with anyone except himself (and, through the mysterious proxy of fiction, the reader).This much doesn't seem in question. But to me, something fascinating and original (yes, I know, nothing is original) happens in that long, second section of the book -- the one that many reviewers liked least -- that seems valuable and important. Here, Yambo is trying to reconstruct his childhood from adventure books, comics, school papers, phonograph records and Fascist propaganda, and although he doesn't succeed in actually remembering his childhood, something much more interesting happens. It's not so much that he reconstructs his own childhood -- through these \\"paper memories\\" -- from the perspective of a \\"stranger,\\" as he puts it, but rather, that he does it from the perspective of an adult. That may seem obvious, but in fact, it's something no one (except the odd amnesiac) can ever do. Our memory of childhood events is necessarily subjective and emotional -- and any true recollection is necessarily limited by the narrow frame of reference we possess as children. So it seems to me Eco is trying something very unusual by having his narrator reconstruct his own childhood without the limitations imposed by a sense of self. This is an ambitious undertaking, and rather than resulting in a constrained self-portrait, in many ways, it is a much fuller one.For example, Yambo the adult discovers that Yambo the child was a Barilla Boy, a kind of Fascist boy scout. A Yambo with an intact memory would probably have remembered this -- and remembered his eventual rejection of Fascism as he grew older. But a Yambo with no memory would come at this knowledge from the other direction -- from the position of knowing about Fascism before he knew about himself, and therefore having a kind of time traveler's understanding of the forces that shaped him. In this way, he might know important things about himself better than he would if he actually remembered them.Similarly, he would have an adult's perspective of the adventure stories in which Yambo the boy immersed himself -- a fond, maybe even nostalgic, but ultimately detached voice that accompanies the reader when the young Yambo becomes involved in the true adventure of rescuing a group of men from the Black Shirts, which, while heroic, is horrific and tragic -- and stands in stark contrast to the tone of the adventure books themselves.Eco's narrator is telling us a story he can't remember -- and somehow in attempting to tell it anyway, it becomes richer -- the ultimate detective story. Not that I as a reader have succeeded entirely in solving it -- for instance, I'm not at all sure what to make of Lila, Yambo's \\"Beatrice\\" -- but being a woman and a nonbeliever, I have always been mystified by female figures symbolizing yearning, loss, love, holiness, and the unattainable -- it's completely over my head, I'm afraid, so I leave that to other readers to make sense of.But I liked this book, very much. It tells a good story from the point of view of a provokingly unusual narrative voice. It's my feeling that the press has given it short shrift -- and could stand to take another look."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I have often joked that I would rather read Umberto Eco's shopping list than many of the so-called popular novels. In this book, Eco goes to prove me wrong. Eco has written a book that is a struggle to read, not because it is deep, complex, and rich but because it is an utter bore.The story tells of the case of Yambo, a rare-book dealer living in Milan. Yambo suffers a curious brain injury straight out of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. In his case, he can not recall anything that ever happened to him but he can remember every book he ever read. Curious. But Eco fails to do anything of much interest with this defect. For example, Yambo runs a book studio and has a female assistant. Yambo worries that perhaps he had an affair with her and wonders how she would react. He need not have worried, because like everyone else, she treats him with no mention of the past. Yambo's wife is perfectly accepting of his condition and Yambo is able to bluff his way through conversations with any friends or acquaintances he meets. The end result is that nothing much happens and the book drones on.Yambo decides to ride off into the country to visit his childhood home in hopes that something there may trigger his memories. Yambo wonders around and gives us a detailed description of his bowel movements. \\"A lovely snail-shell structure still steaming.\\" I was underwhelmed. Yambo wanders through the house finding secret rooms and reading old books. But none of this seems to go anywhere. In fact, it seems more like an excuse for Eco to discuss (although not in any detail), pre- and post-World War II Italian novels that Eco fondly remembers.The book does pick up a little towards the final part but by then I just wished the book would end. I cared nothing for the main character of the story and found the whole enterprise an absolute chore to pull myself through. Eco has done much better. If you are a true fan then go ahead and read the book to see that Eco is, indeed, fallible. Otherwise choose one of his other books instead."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"When he isn't writing complex, genre-twisting novels, Umberto Eco is one of the leading scholars of semiotics, a discipline that explores the ways symbol systems (like language) work. All of his fiction, to greater or lesser degree, is an extension of his fascination with the symbol-system of language and its relationship to the people who use it. (The Name of the Rose is a good case in point.) The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana is perhaps as close as Eco may ever come to writing an \\"autobiographical\\" novel. The main character, a middle-aged Italian who makes his living selling rare books, suffers a memory loss. This provides Eco with the chance to explore the relationship that every individual has to their memories, and to consider whether memory (and our thoughts in general) are truly \\"personal\\" or all culturally derived. So this work, with all its gaudy cartoon illustrations, is perhaps the most overtly about the very subject Eco is best versed in (semiotics) and the most clearly anchored in the reality of growing up in Fascist Italy (as Eco himself did). Sure, there's a lot of detail flying by, as there always is in Eco's work, but I found the book uniquely moving. The narrator in this book is not just a clever symbolic construction (like Baudolino) or a trope (the main character in The Name of the Rose is a medieval Sherlock Holmes), but a cartoon stand-in for the author. This might be Eco's greatest novelist achievement. A stunning surprise of a book, and a visual treat."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I think this is my favorite book by Eco, although all of his books are so rewarding, each in it's own way. This book might not be appealing to everyone, but if you've grown up loving books (including comics), this might be one of the most moving, exciting, and beautiful things you'll ever read. The more stuff you've read the more you'll enjoy this book, since it is packed full of references and allusions to other great works of literature.The story is about an amnesiac, trying to reconstruct his past by perusing books, music, letters, etc. from his past. The character comes to life vividly as the story develops. There is a little of the excitement and mystery found in Eco's other books, and a lot of good story telling. I highly recommend it, and hope there is more on the way."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I loved the Name of the Rose and Foucault's Pendulum - since then, Eco's storytelling has gone downhill.

OK - I get the point - life is like that - but the book is simply a waste of time."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"As an Eco fan, I could not wait to read his latest novel.

It can't fail!Oh...but it did.What I got was pages and pages and pages about Italy before and during WWII, about the comics of the day, the newspapers, the music, etc. I kept waiting for it to get better. I kept waiting for SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. He worried about his blood pressure. He made a phone call. He discovered a chapel hidden in his boyhood home that was full of old writings of his. NOT EVEN THAT WAS EXCITING!No, no.And then he finds Shakespeare's long lost First Folio. \\"Ah,\\" I thought to myself, \\"Here's where things get interesting.\\"Then the section is over, and in the next section of the book he's in a coma or dead or something He doesn't even know. We live through 150 pages of his memories coming back. We get to see where pieces of his findings gain relevance. We get to read over and over again about his obsession with some girl in his life whose face he can't remember. And just when he's about to see her in his dream/coma/whatever?Spoiler alert.HE DIES! End of book.I slammed it shut and threw it across the room. It never got any better. I just kept reading because I thought, \\"Well, it's going to get interesting here shortly. He's going to find something.\\" And when he does, hundreds and hundreds of pages later, he goes into a coma. And then when he's about to find something there...HE DIES!Seriously. Worst. Book. Ever.Has anyone else read it? Did I miss something?"},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"This novel is broken into three sections. The first, \\"The Incident\\" is funny, irreverent, fast-moving, and satisfying. Read to the end of this section and then go find another book. The remaining 368 pages barely budge; mostly the author shows us his comic book collection under the guise of a novel.So one section out of three is good, that's 33%, and a two stars out of five would be 40%. That seems fair, if a bit optmistic."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I recently saw an interview with Umberto Eco promoting this book and I thought it was rather intruiging. I liked the idea of the story, but I got so lost in the comic books, school books, records and goverment propaganda. I skimmed the last section, hoping to find an ending to the story.This is my first Eco and I do plan on reading some of his other works. I just can't find it in me to recommend this one."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"The first section of this book is really very good, so it was particularly disappointing that Eco did not follow through with his initial idea. Instead, he uses the main character to rehash some fairly common criticisms of popular culture. For some reason, he gives detailed plot summaries of numerous comics and books for young people, which is tedious. One just cannot understand what it is that so fascinates the narrator about all of these old comics and mystery novels. By the end, Eco has completely forgotten about Paola, and the persona of his narrator. Then the book just ends. Pffft."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"A nice premise that ends up being like watching some guy listening to himself talk and he knows he's clever."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"My only previous experience with this author was the book Blanteno which was so huge that I felt it collapsed under the weight under its own narrative and put me to sleep. This book is much better; an old Italian bookseller has an incident of retrograde amnesia and has to relearn his past. So what is reality? How can a man forget everything but still remember how to drive a car? Can quotes in the English language or half remembered stories from childhood help you remember who you in old age? This part of the story you have to be in right mood for I love quotes from the English language and other languages so this book fit me like a glove. Not being Italian I don't really have a sound grounding in Italian history and new facts were presented here that where incredibly interesting.The main characters grandfather is an incredibly interesting character not to be missed. Even if the plot wanders around a little bit the ending is still quite satisfactory when it finally arrives."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Umberto Eco is one of my favorite contemporary authors and his newest novel did not disappoint me. Although it is his first novel dealing with modern times and not as imaginative as The Island of the Day Before or Baudolino, it is still Eco at his best. Great narrative, interesting and clever plot, and lot of information about the past, this time near past, make this novel enjoyable reading. Perhaps even easier reading than some of his previous works, that need a lot of concentration to throughly follow."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Not one of Eco's best. sometimes quite engaging, other times eco goes to some other plane. Definitely for the die-hard Eco fan."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"This is definitely the culmination of Eco's fantastic fiction career, and he's writtten some doozies. He continues to go beyond impressing to capping his reputation as one of today's best writers, if not the best. I was really amazed at this book, part Modernist (T.S.Eliot would have been proud), and part post-Modernist, he weaves a tale here that makes us all look in the mirror and think really hard about who we are & how we come to that conclusion. Thank you, Mr Eco; I think this is his best yet. Would have rated it twenty if I could have."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"As a fan of Eco's work, I was expecting an intellectual and cultural smorgasbord. The concept is quite intruiging -- learning who you are through the frame of reference in which you live--but it turns out to be less an exploration of that idea and more a testimony to popular culture and a smattering of history from the 30s and 40s, the images and words of which will not strike a chord unless you share the same repertoire. There are a few dark quiet observations on the Holocaust and Fascism but we're kept at arm's length from the experience and how it may have shaped our dear narrator. Overall, it's hard not to feel cheated, like Eco took the easy way out writing this; I waited for the story to unveil something until it ended with a quiet sigh. I was disappointed, but I'll look forward to his next book -- which will hopefully resound in my heart and feed my brain like Foucault's Pendulum or Baudolino."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"It would be somewhat secretive of me to not first say that I am in fact a fan of Umberto Eco, both in his literary work and in his editorial work.Even so, I can't help but feel that this book is not so much a novel as it is pieces of editorial criticism very loosely gathered together here and presented to the audience. The premise is both simple to understand and quite intriguing. A man has lost his knowledge of his self and his life, but continues to remember the things that he has read and seen that do not actually relate to him. If yesterday he sat down with his wife and ate breakfast while watching the news, then it would be the news alone that is in his head today.Starting off in this way, the novel appears to be a sort of coming of age again novel. An exploration of self, unbiased by actually having lived the life and seeing it from your side. A great gate is opened in the opening of this book.Unfortunately after the gates swings open the main character does not charge through to the awaiting world, but merely leans against said gate. It really is a shame.The story consists almost entirely of a man, alone, going through the children items collected in his late parents' attic. And, as the character goes through these things there is a brief narrative of what was happening as these items came into being.There are definately interesting parts in this wanderings, but in the end they turn out to be simply wandering. There is really no tying together at the end or any great message derived from any of the pieces of the old life that he finds.In the end Umberto teaches us a lesson from the Bible. Do not sew together an old cloak with new patches. The fabric stretches and wears in different directions and the whole is only made more severe."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I'm embarassed to say that even though I'm a voracious reader, this is the first Eco book I've read...and I was pleasantly surprised.Eco's writing is mesmerizing. It's very unique and everyone should pick up at least one of his books to experience it.He uses Yambo's career (antiquarian book dealer) and circumstance (amnesia) to dive into moments of history in Italy. As Yambo travels to his old house and rummages through his papers, momentos and literature from his childhood, he begins to not only remember his life as a youth but also, life in Italy during WWII. Even though I am not Italian, I could appreciate the beauty, strangeness and artistry of literature and culture of that time period in Fascist Italy.Although parts of the book veered off onto some vague road of incoherency, the majority of Eco's novel was wonderful. I especially loved young Yambo's dialogue with his friend (or uncle? I can't remember - I'm moving and my books are packed!) about God and why he doesn't exist). I don't think the book was all about his relationships or finding that mysterious girl Yambo had an ever-lingering obssession with, but about Italy's political, artistic, religious and cultural climates during the war. I believe Eco wrote this book to allow people of the world to discover and his countrymen relive a virtually forgotten parts of this time period in his country."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I started out an avid Eco fan. I read Focoult's Pendulum. Twice! Name of the Rose, Island... and Misreadings. Loved the first two, learned a lot from all of Umberto's books. Brilliant man and tireless writer.But when I read The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, I kept glancing ahead to see if it would get better. Quite a bit went into the pictoral essay of 20th Century book art. I gave Eco the benefit of a doubt; after all, when has he ever let me down before? Though I commend his errudition...isn't it dreadful when the word comes up in a review? It isn't enough to bring a promising premise out of the flat-line of death (no pun intended). The final act of the book just plunges into an absurd pageant of kitsch, that must have been a tribute to pop-culture icons, but in the end the payoff was meniscule.My overwhelming aftertaste of The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana was disappointment. It seemed the book had promise to deliver the kind of excitement and intrigue of Focault and Name...but instead, ended up reading like a bibliography catalog of Out-of-Print/Permanently Discontinued books that died on dusty shelves, now long forgotten."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I am a huge fan of Eco. I've really enjoyed all of his essays and books till I read The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, but unfortunately,it didn't impress me as much as the previous ones did. His books are getting harder and harder to read. This one was full of unnecessary information and literary references. It is really easy to get lost between all those Italian origin comic books,magazines and foreign words which put the translator into very tough situation."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"There isn't much I can add that the previous reviewers haven't already - and very eloquently -- written about this unusual book.As a life-long reader & amasser of books, I knew by the time I reached page 30, I was hooked. The narrator, having lost his memory, returns home from hospital and is led by his wife to a long room crammed with books whose titles he recognizes & begins to examine:\\"I have so many books. Sorry, we do.\\"\\"Five thousand here. And there's always some imbecile who comes over and says, my how many books you have, have you read them all?\\"\\"And what do I say?\\"\\"Usually you say: Not me, why else would I be keeping them here...As for the five thousand I've already read, I gave them away to prisons and hospitals. And the imbecile reels.\\"At last thanks to Mr Eco, I have a snappy reply for the next person who says to me, what a lot of books you have, have you read them all..."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Though set in a different time period and dealing with popular culture, Eco is revisiting themes developed in the \\"Island of the Day Before' and most of his other novels, for that matter. Is truth something substantial we have 'memorized' or is it only a construct of our hopes and dreams? The 'fog' never quite lifts on this one, and that's the way the author likes it.I like Eco a lot. He always takes me places I haven't been and helps me appreciate the myth and history of periods I haven't yet explored (in this case, the popular culture of Mussolini's Italy). He will never write a 'page-turner,' but that's fine with me. Some of us enjoy the slower thoughtful process."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Nostalgia. I'd put nostalgia foremost of the feeling this book leaves the reader with. For some reason, somehow I kind of feel that's Eco's closure at least on this literature front. As for the casual reader, I wouldn't recommend this book, unless the former is patient and willing to follow Eco's own reminiscent descent into a so-typically Italian mind-set and lifestyle surroundings. By no means this book is as introverted, as say, the Island of the Day Before, and it certainly leverages more elements from Foucault's Pendulum than any other of Eco's books. At the end of the day this book asks the reader to quite literally follow Eco to the loft of his youth and past fires and open these dusty old drawers full of brochures and posters from the '50's or the '60s. If you are willing to say 'yes' to that, then please do go ahead and pick up this book. It's a good one everything considered."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"In Umberto Eco's \\"The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana\\" an Italian antiquarian bookseller (Yambo) suffers a stroke, losing all of his memories except for every literary word he's every read. Fortunately, his wife Paola is able to replenish his memories with facts of his life, such as that they have two daughters who have given them many grandchildren;; all of which Yambo understands, but is completely unable to recollect. It is only when he sees a Mickey Mouse cartoon book from the 1930's that he can retrieve a memory from his personal life. Thus Yambo is sent to the dreaded house of his childhood, Solara, where he has refused to enter because of the painful memories of his dead parents. But only in the Solara house does he begin to remember what he thought was long buried and forgotten, recalling himself through memories of his life, some of them leading him to find himself cruelly selfish towards his wife Paola.Umberto Eco writes Yambo's wife Paola as an extremely intelligent, constant woman and wife,; her general character being completely opposite to her own husband. He writes Yambo as a man who seems desperate not to live an average 60-year-old man's life; he flaunts his infidelity with countless lovers to both his wife and his best friend, and he is constantly trying to prove that his age is cutting into his wit, nor his intelligence. When faced with his possibly temporary amnesia, he faces his actions with a newfound clarity. Umberto Eco chooses to emphasize this newfound clarity by describing at length Yambo's day-to-day experiences, such as defecation, eating, as well as sex. Eco not only writes that these day-to-day experiences are Yambo's first real experiences since he2cannot remember doing them in the first place, but he explains how important each experience is so precious and basic, he even relates to the Neanderthals when he says, \\"I was feeling an ancient satisfaction....perhaps I was simply enjoying a pleasure of the Neanderthal man.\\" (Eco 86) Of course he is so eloquently describing defecation. Even so, Umberto Eco has an unparalleled talent in describing the common actions that most people find extremely repulsive, with grace and eloquence.I chose to read an Umberto Eco novel because my father has a deep appreciation for beautiful writing and has been raving about this book for months. However, I thought this novel somewhat of a slow read, but I've never seen an author describe such mundane actions with such a deep appreciation of it's inherent godliness. In the same way that Yambo saw with newfound clarity and appreciation, I now feel as if I have both. I would recommend it if you had a lot of time to read it, seeing as how it progresses slowly, and isn't meant to grab the attention of the reader as much as it is meant to immerse the reader in powerful description."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Reading this novel, I have been entranced by the idea that human beings develop personality through the works of literature, music, and pop culture with which they have been blessed. As Yambo struggles to re-discover who he is, he poses a challenge for all readers who recognize the quotes he remembers: if we are indeed at least partially created by our exposure to the arts, how shall we empower the next generation? Will we be responsible for the new generation of brownshirts, or will we help to generate thinking global citizens who understand their place in the world and their responsibility to it? Heady questions these, but Eco is a master at making his readers think. This novel is entertaining and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Incitive and breathtaking storytelling! Anyone who was alive during any of the mentioned periods, lived abroad or traveled either physically or by reading, will acknowledge the influential significance of propaganda, of smells and tastes of our past, of music and encounters. I was excited and filled with significance and fear and appreciation of our world as I read this beautifully written story. Umberto Eco is a master storyteller and he has awakened memories and senses which udually are pushed aside as overrated nostalgia, but are clearly components of our current existence."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Umberto Eco is one of those authors I really think I should like: his ideas on creativity, the connections that exist between people and culture, and his cleverness are all things that I admire. Unfortunately, I find his prose style dull and his plots prosaic and long-winded. I never could make it through The Name of the Rose and everytime I looked at one of his other novels in the store, I walked away without purchasing it. I ended up buying this one, his most recent, only because I (a) had a gift card, (b) it was 50% off, and (c) it purported to be an illustrated novel, with some kind of connection to comics, a favorite subject of mine. I figured, this had to be an Eco that I liked, if I was going to like an Eco.I didn't like it, mainly because it is a \\"little\\" novel and not as clever as I had imagined it would be. The setup is grand--a sixtyish rare book dealer named Yambo has some kind of stroke that wipes his personal memory clear but leaves his cultural memory intact. This allows Eco to play a wild game of cultural word association as Yambo tries to deal with his close family, whom he doesn't recognize at all, by connecting them to books, movies, and music that he can remember. Yambo starts to delve into his own history in the most intense way, revealing that it is impossible to \\"go home again,\\" simply because it took him 60 years to make those memories, and it would take nearly the same to recreate them through a personal archaelogy.But that's the book, basically. It fails to go anywhere from there, but stays focused on Yambo's intense internal conflict, so much that after awhile it becomes only a device for the author rather than a means to advance the plot or some greater idea. There's a jolt about two-thirds in, where I expected something to happen, and something does, but something that drives Yambo even further inside himself.I don't think it's a problem of translation, either. Simply, what interests Eco about his ideas is not the same thing that interests me, even though we both find the ideas themselves intriguing."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"This is a book for devoted book lovers. Any bibliophile who dreams of inheriting an attic full of antique books should find The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana to be sumptuous fare. After a medical incident (a stroke) that leaves him in a state of partial amnesia, Yambo caresses book after lovely old book in an attempt to trigger lost memories of his early life. Along the way, readers are treated to reviews of rare books we wish we might be lucky enough to stumble upon along with color graphics of their covers. This book evokes the odor of library dust and printer's ink. I luxuriated in every page. The only shortcoming is a pat ending that didn't do the book justice and cut the book off at its ankles. If you are looking for an adventure story (intellectual or otherwise) this book may disappoint. But if you have a passion for the look, feel, and smell of old books, dive right in and enjoy Eco at his introspective best."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"For those who are used to battling through Mr. Eco's usual brainbusting work, or having to take notes to keep things straight, here's a book more from the man's heart, more so than any book he has yet written. Other's give a good synopsis of the story, so I'll simply throw in my two sense on whether or not to read this book. I enjoyed the trip into Mr. Eco's childhood Italy, as this is undoubtedly his most sutobiograpgical work to date and much takes place in the period when he would have been in his youth that the protagonist is journeying into during dreamstates after a stroke. Always an excellent historian, Mr. Eco has created a scrapbook of sorts to show us exactly what the character is describing and goes on to explain how each item or group of items affected his life or effected his life or change in life.This is NOT a Mystery, nor is is it the type of story we are used to from Eco, although the voice is undoubtedly his, and recognizable to readers of his other works. Yet, it is simultaneously an altogether different story, more a tour of his heart and how a person grows into the adult they are via the collection of experiences they amass in child and young adulthood.what I found interesting, is not only all the comic book covers, movie posters, political war posters, (and some excellent examples of the visual arts from that WWII period of Italy and Il Duce), and the way he not only brings that period alive for the reader, but how in the end, he ties some of these disparate memories together into a new whole, quite metaphorical for the journey we all take into becoming the person we ultimately become, and how memories morph and change as we age, morph and change ourselves. Yet there are also special memories that are so embedded as to NEVER change and that these can create the strongest base of our personality.It is a fluid and easier read in comparison to most of his other works. I was struck, too, that being an American who grew up in the 60's and 70's, how different and yet how similar the formative years are the world over and throughout time. you can taste and smell the Italian countryside and the food or wine he describes and see the characters from WWII Italy in their tattered, worn clothes as well as the things and activities they used to get themselves through from one day to the next.There is one particular wartime adventure in which he takes part where his childhood activities had been a wonderful preparation for him to \\"become a man\\", almost like \\"an Italian WWII Bar Mitzvah\\". I won't ruin the experience for people yet to read it by telling it here. But life is here in 3D, the wonderings, (and the wanderings!), the building of an intellect, a view of the world around him, and even comments on his sexual awakenings and how in Europe, while Mistresses are tolerated on so many levels, the actual sexual education and the initial amazing experience of feeling the opposite sex for the first time, dreaming of a first kiss, and then the reality fulfilling, or not, that dream, in all its initial innocence and trepidation are explored.For a man I'm used to getting intricate historical or philosphical novels from, (if usually tinged with a \\"wink-wink sense of humour\\" if you're not too tired to catch it), this book comes straight from the man's heart and it shows in the different style and the ease of the read in comparison to his other books. He's always been adept as describing things and people or setting a scene over which to play some action of a philosophical, or moral, question. But this story seemed to flow more naturally from his pen, perhaps because it is such a personal story. It is simply a different kind of read that you walk into an U Eco book expecting to read. At first, I was a little dissapointed, and then, once I understood what part all the scrapbooked sections played in the story, I fell right into it and went on a little trip to Italy in the time of Il Duce. Definitely an interesting book by and of itself. But if you are a fan, I believe its even more interesting as I felt that some of what I learned here, whether truly autobiographical or not, gave me a little window to better inform me about the author as I read his other books.That said, I know this book is not for everyone. It is not a Beach Towel summer confection, nor is it a Dan Brown mystery. But its the closest we're probably going to get from Mr. Eco to that easier style of read. I'll take what I can get as I'm already a fan of his other books, even if I've had to start them a few times before I got all the way through. This book I read on three successive nights, and I enjoyed each one."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Imagine waking up and not remembering your life. Admittedly, this is something that I worry about all the time so I was intrigued when I read the back cover of The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana and found it to be the premise of the novel.The main character, Yambo, finds himself unable to remember anything about his life and attempts to piece together his past - a mystery of sorts. Throughout the novel, the reader is treated to an endless barrage of list upon list of songs, cartoon characters, magazines, books, works of art, etc.... I found this to be quite exasperating; however, I did finish the book. Why? I was hoping the book would become more interesting and I wanted to know what happened to Yambo. Mr. Eco was able to create a likable character floundering in a sea of minutiae. Sadly, this book was not for me; however, I will give Mr. Eco another read. I recommend his book for those that are nostalgic about Italian culture during World War II, the influence of propaganda, and interested in psychology."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Fantastic writing, interesting concept (initially), but Eco doesn't deliver. The first half works; the second half is tedious and boring. If Eco wants to catalog every work he has read, perhaps he should sign up with GoodReads. Ugh."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"IMHO the worst book Mr. Eco has ever written bar none. If you are not a post-graduate student of Fasict Italy do not bother with this book. Even Yambo is the least well defined of Mr. Eco's lead characters. A blank slate who remembers what he has read...no..not quite...he doesn't remember (spoilers follows) all the trivial and/or popular material of his childhood and we are forced into memory lane with this excuse for a romp through Italy of the 30's and 40's. Even when Yambo gets his second \\"stroke?,lesion?, brain fart?\\" all you can hope is that he dies. He dies but not quickly enough. There is one great story about the Gorge in his coma but not enough reason to buy the book, I only wish the sun had gone black on page 246, not 449."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I was drawn to this book by the illustrations. I had heard of Umberto Eco before, but I had never read anything by him. The first 100 pages were interesting, but after that I just got tired of reading this. I had to finish it because it is so unusual and unique. By the end, I had a deep feeling of relief that it was finally over. I wouldn't recommend."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"A poor joke on people like me who are stupid enough to continue reading it. There are warnings enough, if we would but heed them. The high point is the scenes from Mickey Mouse and Clarabelle's Treasure. I don't think that I will ever read another Eco book and may burn the one's I have. Just the effect the author hoped for."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I really liked this book. I should note that I'm a big Umberto fan, but I think I can objectively say that this is an awesome book. I think that some of the reviews that mention that the book is full of obscure cultural references are a bit unfair b/c all of his books are full of obscure references. I don't think that they affect the intelligibility of the plot in this book or any of his other books. One of the things that I like about Eco is that his books are like hypertexts... you can read a webpage without following all the links to each connected page, or you can look at every link of every link of every link ad infinitum (or ad nauseum according to the reviews that focus on the abundance of details in this book). There's more than one way to read a book like this. If you want to read a good story, I think this book has a cool plot, twists and turns, suspense, moments of realization, a comic-book style grand finale (though the end leaves a lot open to imagination/interpretation)... just don't pay attention to details that seem obscure (you might want to know who Mussolini was and Italy's role in WWII, but I don't think you need much more). Also, this book gave me a taste of Italian history, and also I'm into the philosophy of language and mind, so of course Eco hits the sweet spot there.Thanks Umberto!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I am a huge fan of Umberto Eco's Novels. I am a huge fan of his Essays. In this novel, he is using a potentially interesting plot to tie together the true intent of his novel, which is to showcase the history of fascist italy through popular culture. Anyone interested in the history will love this book. Sadly, when I buy a novel, I want a real novel.That said, although the first two thirds of the book really drag, once the narrator goes into a coma, things really start to pick up (odd, isn't it?). There is one great highlight--one of the characters makes a great argument about why god is a fascist. The rest of the novel is a painful purgatory of forced history lessons.My advice? Re-read Foucault's Pendulum instead."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"This is a very engrossing book, both in respect to its literary references and in the glimpse it provides of Child growing up in Italy in the 1930's and 40's. I marked it down to three stars solely because of the last fifty pages. I understand that the author is trying to create a dreamlike stream of conscious atmosphere, but the prose so difficult follow that the ultimate result simply confusing and should not be accepted as a replacement for literary depth. I would blame it on the translator were it not for the excellent job he accomplishes in the earlier section of the novel. The outstanding illustrations are the only redeeming quality to be found in the final pages."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Everytime Eco writes a new novel, he draws the reader into his inner world of dusty attics, gothic stuctures with mysterious rooms and paintings, a vocabulary of new words(please have a dictionary handy), and forbidden reaches of the human imagination. What a storyteller he is. I have thoroughly enjoyed his last three novels - The Island of the Day Before, Baudilino, and this gem. I wasn't expecting it out so soon. If you want to get a glimpse of what inner workings go in in Eco's brain, just look at the smile on his face and read the book slowly and savor every word whether it is English, French, Italian, or Latin. His narrative is always first rate - no cliche's or dumb sentences. He really makes you sweat and wrestle with the intellectualism of his prose. I think Eco is the only modern day author who continues the fine literary craftsmanship of Updike or Roth. While I'm deliciously enjoying this one, I can't imagine what his next novel will be about."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Eco has that uncanny way of writing in that it is though he is speaking directly to you. Great book and wonderful addition to my collection."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I've been wanting to read Umberto Eco for a while, and though the book I had in mind was The Name of the Rose, I couldn't find it in any of the bookstores I looked in, so I picked this one up.Umberto Eco is definitely a crazy Italian writer. The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loanna is about Yambo, an Italian bookseller who wakes up after a stroke. He can't remember anything about his personal life: his wife, his children, or his own childhood. But oddly enough, he can remember every book he's every read, every bit of poetry, and a huge amount of literary quotations.I thought that this was definitely a good idea for a plot. Unusually, The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loanna (I'll call it The Mysterious Flame from now on), has color illustrations. You see, in an effort to remember some of his past, Yambo goes to an old country house and searches through boxes of old newspapers, comics, photos, records, and diaries. And there are many illustrations of these things. I'm not sure if the pictures were strictly necessary; they didn't seem to add that much to the book, but they were interesting to look at.In addition to his personal early life, Yambo sees the figures of that period: Mussolini, Josephine Baker, Flash Gordon, Fred Astaire.It was quite interesting because Yambo remembers so many literary things, but if he had a personal connection to it, he doesn't remember it. As he searches through the objects, however, he begins to have some hazy recollections and his memories \\"run wild, and life races before him in a series of images...\\" After reading this one, I'm definitely looking forward to The Name of the Rose.You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana is about a man who loses his autobiographical memory, but retains his general knowledge, particularly of literature and popular culture. In an attempt to reconstruct his personality, he visits the attic of his childhood home, going through his old journals, the records he listened to, and especially the books he read during his formative years.The novel traces his progression from Mickey Mouse comic books to Flash Gordon---\\"Gordon was different, he fought for liberty against a despot...And so Flash Gordon must have provided me with my first image of a hero\\"---to Dumas, to Hugo. This is, above all, a book about the important role of art in shaping personality, but implicitly about how our own personal choices determine the outcome as the protagonist tries to figure out how he went from accepting fascist propaganda growing up in Italy during the second World War to rejecting it. Unfortunately, Eco is not entirely consistent in his exploration of these themes, and the quasi-apocalyptic ending felt like a cop-out to me. Still, this is definitely worth reading at least once."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Umberto Eco is a remarkably skillful novelist. Even the finest authors, however, occasionally produce work not up to their usual standard. Eco's novel The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana illustrates that unfortunate phenomenon.The novel starts with an interesting premise and introduces an engaging, even if a bit off balance, protagonist named Yambo, an Italian dealer in rare books. Due to a cerebral misadventure, apparently a stroke, Yambo has been in a coma. When he suddenly emerges, there is cause for unexpected celebration. But there is also a problem. Yambo doesn't know who he is. He doesn't recognize his wife, his children, his oldest friend, Gianni, his valued employee, Sibilla, or anyone else. He has the same set of skills, aptitudes, capabilities, tastes, and interests as before, and he understands the world well enough to get by just fine. But the part of his memory that is the repository of that which is peculiar to him as a unique individual with a history all his own is gone.Yambo returns to what he is told was his daily routine, work, family, and friends, in the hope that familiar stimuli will prompt recollection of his life. The best he can do, however, is imagine what his life might have been like, given what he sees around him, speculating without the information provided by a personal history. Sibilla, for example, is not only an expert in antiquities from the world of literature, she is also young, personable, witty, and beautiful. Yambo wonders if they were having an affair, after all, Gianni assures him that he had not been perfectly faithful to his wife, Paola. But the time Yambo spends in his book store offers no clues.Yambo leaves the city to stay for a time in his late grandfather's house in the small, rural village of Solara. Yambo spent much of his childhood and adolescence in Solara, where he was safe from the air raids of World War II during the reign of Mussolini. But the familiar ambience from his forgotten youth has no effect on Yambo's amnesia.A man of letters, Yambo begins a thorough search of the spacious house to find anything he might recognize as a written record from his past. Eco's descriptions of Yambo's discoveries are written with the skill and broad learning we have come to expect of him. Occasionally, however, his account seems overdone, as if he's trying too hard to put his prodigious linguistic talent to best use.The search for yet more artifacts of his forgotten past becomes Yambo's obsession. Eventually it goes on too long, and the reader may find it tedious. Just when we think there has to be an end to this, Eco uses an uncharacteristically contrived literary twist to keep the story going. While this contrivance strains credibility and undercuts continuity, it also introduces some of the most interesting material in the novel.The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana is the sort of book one begins reading only to soon realize that its post-modern provenance implies more than one level of meaning, all fraught with uncertainty and ambiguity, and invites the reader to exercise his or her interpretative skills in strenuous ways. The pervasive metaphor of fog affirms that requirement. If we don't know how we are situated with regard to our surroundings, we are lost. We wait for the fog to lift, or we feel our way along as best we can.However, someone with a history, someone who has a well-stocked memory of his or her surroundings, need not simply stumble along, but can retrace, fill in blanks, and make inferences from context. A personal history gives meaning to our current circumstances. Otherwise, we are rootless, incapable of interpreting, unable to progress since we have no standard to use as a gauge. Thus Yambo's obsession with recovering his memory so he can give his life meaning.This is easy to understand once it is said, but still profound. A different biography yields different meanings, different interpretations of the present. Eco teaches us the importance of biographical context in making sense of our world, and sometimes does it with truly remarkable imagination and vivid imagery. The tedium of Yambo's obsessive search, however, diminishes the effectiveness of the novel. The incident that ties the beginning and end of the story together seems oddly adventitious and needlessly borders on the mystical.Umberto Eco is an original and learned novelist, but even he has off days. Hence The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Ever the didactic professor - even when wielding the novelist's pen - Umberto Eco explores how memory serves to lead us out the the metaphysical fog that often enshrouds us. \\"A sixty-ish Milanese antiquarian bookseller nicknamed Yambo suffers a stroke and loses his memory of everything but the words he has read: poems, scenes from novels, miscellaneous quotations.\\" Eco manages to take this plot device and weave a tale that is a very personal recollection of what it must have been like for him to grow up in the Italy of World War II. Political intrigue often emerges from Yambo's fog-bound memory as images from his childhood trigger nostalgic excursions through the past.Hovering over the entire enterprise is Yambo's unrequited love for the unattainable object of a high school crush - Lili, the memory of whose face he struggles to recalls as he lies dying in a comatose state. An initial cerebral incident had left him bereft of personal memories. Back home in his ancestral home of Solara, he slowly regains a sense of perspective and history through the books, records, movie posters and comic books he discovered sequestered throughout the villa. His final discovery of a priceless original Shakespeare folio triggers his ultimate cerebral vascular accident. The final chapters take the reader inside the mind of the dying Yambo as he speeds through a dizzying kaleidoscope of real and imagined images - all the while groping for the elusive image of Lili's face. These final chapters - and Yambo's final apocalyptic thoughts and memories - are presented (in typical Eco style) as a parody of the Book of Revelation.The novel is a moving and irreverent conceit in which Eco opens the kimona and shows us not only his special mind but also his complex heart."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"A powerful odyssey of the mind that takes the reader on multiple journeys through: history; politics; psychology; neurology, pop culture; music; comics, love stories, and much, much more.This is a profound literary, spiritual journey that expands so many levels of awareness while spiriting you through the mind of a learned man who has experienced a stroke. There are delightfully kaleidoscopic twists and turns proving almost unimaginable as you follow the protagonist on an infinitely layered voyage of the mind. The novel enriches and enlightens beyond belief while it disturbs and enlivens. It proves humorous and thought provoking. There's a lot going on.Elements of racism, and nationalism, are captured in many of the images, evoking recognition of the mindset existing during more distressing times of the protagonist's youth.The book is filled with mysteries and moments of happenstance that might just make you feel a little less sorry for those often amazingly talented folks who have experienced \\"traumatic brain events.\\" Not all is lost in the world of many who have sustained such \\"shocks\\" to their medical health. Life often goes on in powerful ways. This unique novel elucidates the possibilities that the imagination can continue to flourish in substantial ways post-trauma.The illustrations are wondrous and evoke memories and imaginings that catapult your thoughts.You must have the patience to travel down endless tangential highways and overpasses; but the intellectual rewards are endless. Thoughts of mortality and the restrictive edicts of religion factor in - but you will happily navigate the challenges with your fearless protagonist who will cheerfully unearth every delicate and amusing detail around him.The sizable amount of supposed \\"personal reflections\\" from our quintessential author distinguish this book from his others (aren't they all great, though?).Enter this strange world at your own risk and stand to benefit immensely by a quite extraordinary experience. This book is perfect for a dark rainy night when there is nothing better to do but commune deeply with those highly interesting and stimulating voices in your head."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"This work, like all of Eco's I imagine, will prove irresistible to literati. The story of a bibliophile on a quest to remember his actual life, rather than what he has (merely?) read is indeed an intriguing premise, and Eco, true to form, carries it off well.-The skeleton of the plot has been articulated above by so many of the other reviewers, editorial and otherwise, that it would be quite redundant and importunate for me to do so here.-If you're reading this review, you've read it at least five times.I will go on record and say that the pictures do add punch to the work and make vivid the bygone Italy leading up to and during WWII. They also provide poignant clues to what is, in many ways, a detective story.The ending is more than a bit anticlimactic though, purposefully so, of course. But regardless, such an inextricably confused denouement detracted from the experience of reading the book for me....thus the four stars.... Yes, this is no doubt Eco's way of saying that this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but a whimper or of depicting what happens when things fall apart and the centre cannot hold on a personal level...pick your allusion. For all that, it's still a letdown.Otherwise this is a highly recommendable detective story, dissertation on memory and life, and at least three or four other delightful things.For fellow bibliophiles, I can't resist ending this review with my favourite quote from the book:\\"I'm a sterile genius, you used to say; in this world you either read or write, and writers write out of contempt for their colleagues, out of a desire to have something good to read once in a while.\\"Like this book, perhaps."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"\\"I never emerged from books\\" Yambo tells the reader. And he never does. For this story is about a man who tries to read about his own life; to become a character in his many books. It is about a boy, who after not seeing his friend kill Germans, buries himself in the fog of books and who (in many ways) never fully lives in this world again.That is not all there is to this wonderful introduction to Umberto Eco, of course. There is the plot. A man, an antique book collector loses his memory and tries to recapture it in the home of his childhood. A home he had abandoned after something happened to him there. (What, he does not know)There is the story of the boy growing up in Fascist Italy, learning from his parents to praise the Balilla Boy in his classroom compositions; learning about resistance from his poor classmate and learning about doubt from a partisan who takes a liking to him.There is the story of a first love and affairs and a family.But above all, this is a novel about books and reading and how books can come to seem more real than life, can become life itself.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"This last Umberto Eco is a gem, although more accessible to people who master Italian language and have experienced the comics of the Thirties. I have read LOANA in the original version and one couldn't imagine the pleasure I felt all over. Since the book is largely known by now, let me just add a detail very seldom found among a number of reviews I browsed through. The title of the book is borrowed from the Italian translation of one of Lyman Young's series, TIM TYLER AND SPUD, who became Cino e Franco in Italy and Richard le T&eacute;m&eacute;raire in France. But Eco's summarization of the sequel was a real surprise for me, because I instantly realized that he was actually paying tribute to a monument of the earlier fantasy novels: SHE, by H. Rider Haggard, 1887. It has been brought to the screen at least ten times (several stills until 1925, by Irving Pichel with Randolph Scott and Helen Gahagan in 1935 - the best - in 1965 with Ursula Andress and in 1985 with Sandahl Bergman - of ALL THAT JAZZ. This version was mentioned by some as the worst movie of all times... However, please don't get me wrong. Maybe Lyman Young, helped by the graphics of Alex Raymond, took his inspiration from Haggard's book, but Umberto Eco just quoted Young's comic, thus not commiting any copyright offence. He used the story of Ayesha and her eternal flame only as a trampolin to the fantastic end of his own book, which I leave intact for the readers-to-come. This part of the book was the most difficult to absorb, but it is there that Eco attempted his jump into immortality, and did it even better than Bob Fosse with ALL THAT JAZZ. I sincerely hope that this review with help future readers to plunge into this marvelous world of memory and eternity. Henry Caraso, Paris"},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"I'm not a fan of memoirs or biographies, so in retrospect, I'm not really sure why I thought I'd like this rather bloated novel. Its premise is that 60-something Milanese rare bookseller Giambattista Boldoni (aka Yambo) suffers a stroke which kills his memories of everything he's experienced and yet left intact memories of everything he's ever read. Yambo can ramble on and on about literature and music, but can't summon up any feeling for his wife or grandchildren. To try and kick-start his emotional memory, he retreats to his family's old country home, where his childhood artifacts (books, comics, magazines, notebooks, records, photos) are all archived in dusty boxes. The idea is that by poking through these items, he will be able to reconstruct his \\"self\\".Unfortunately, this means a rather tedious trip into pop culture arcana of the 1930-40s, as Yambo immerses himself in his childhood. Much of this goes on and on far too long to be of interest to most readers and is a case study of a novelist piling on too much repetitive material. Indeed, those who don't share a the same reference points as Eco (oops, I mean Yambo), will likely cease to care and become bogged down about halfway through the book. However, there are some interesting tidbits to be gleaned about growing up in Fascist-era Italy during the war. Especially good is a lengthy story about some Russian commandos who need local help escaping a German patrol. But as interesting as this episode is, it's not enough to make the 440+ page trek down memory lane. Ultimately, despite devices straight out of the romantic/adventure fiction Yambo celebrates (examples include: a hidden room, a valuable Shakespeare folio, and an unrequited childhood love), the story never picks up pace or leads anywhere interesting.A large part of the problem is that Yambo is the only character of note. His wife and his assistant are both developed slightly in the first part and then completely dropped. Yambo's obsession with his books and music make him rather remote, and while that may be Eco's ironic point, it doesn't make for a good fiction. And while Yambo's peculiar form of amnesia is in itself a somewhat interesting comment on the debate over whether life is to be lived or read about, it all feels rather superficial. Perhaps those with a strong interest in how memory works, or philosophy of the mind, will find this somewhat less tiresome, but readers looking for a story will likely be disappointed."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"This is a minor book by a major writer, but a fascinating one. Proust had his madeleine, Citizen Kane his Rosebud; Eco has a treasure trove of period artifacts ranging from cigarette packets to fashion magazines, all reproduced here in full color. On that level, it is like visiting a junk store or thumbing through the catalogue of a museum of popular culture.The premise is promising. The narrator, Giambattista Bodoni, nicknamed Yambo, is an Italian dealer in rare books. As the result of a stroke, he has lost all memory of things that have happened to him at first hand, but retained all the knowledge he has gained from others, for example in the course of his copious reading. As he attempts to recover his past, he has only his books to guide him, together with various objects salvaged from his youth. Will one of them be the key to unlock all his memories at once, or will he find himself in a series of small ephiphanies, or not at all?The book falls into three parts. The first is the most interesting in a conventional novelistic sense, in that it deals with his personal relationships: with his wife Paola, his daughter Nicoletta, an old friend Gianni, and his young assistant Sibilla. But it is quite unusual in the way that Yambo juggles references to a vast range of literature in an attempt to make sense of this revewed life. It also raises philosophical questions about the way we tend to \\"write\\" our lives as we live them. Yambo, for instance, is unsure if he has ever had an affair with Sibilla; he can certainly imagine several ways the relationship might have gone, but these are literary scenarios; he has no idea whether any of them took place in real life, or if so whether the \\"real-life\\" attraction was not merely the acting out of a previous literary scenario.In the second and longest part of the book, Yambo goes back alone to his childhood home in the foothills of the Savoy Alps. Looking for his particular Rosebud, he hunts through childhood comics, adventure stories, children's encyclopedias, school readers, and records of popular music. Together they tell the history of Italy from 1935 to 1945. The objects themselves are interesting, and Yambo's discoveries about what it felt like to live during the heyday and fall of fascism may contain much that is new for the reader also. But, even for Yambo, it is mostly a third-party interest; the artifacts seldom elicit the intense emotional reactions that would unlock the past on a personal level. Although we can share experiences that are common to every growing child, such as the discovery of sex, true Rosebuds are personal, private, unique, and non-transferable.It is curious that the two themes which come to dominate the latter part of the book -- Yambo's search for his first love and his specific memories of the last days of the war --- occur almost without visual correlatives at all. The catalogue approach of the second section of the book (almost exactly half the total) in the end gets nowhere. The final part takes an entirely different tack. It contains some wonderful material, especially a gripping wartime incident with the Partisans, and ends with a beauty of its own. But the illustrations, which had hitherto fascinated by their authenticity, ultimately give way to third-rate montages by the author. Fortunately, this visual let-down is in no way matched by Eco's prose, which remains as virtuosic as ever."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"This book is certainly as erudite as all previous novels of Prof. Umberto Eco, but differs essentially in the way the suspense is designed. It is not a suspense like one could expect in Foucault's 'Pendulum' or 'Baudolino' with thrills and murders to be solved or even the race to find the longitude in 'The island of the day before'. In this novel, it takes a long time to work out what is going to happen during the course of Yambo trying to find the memory he lost This novel could be almost identified to a biography to be written and is being written as the bits of memory are being found. One also wanders how much of the author youth is in Yambo. The ending is also somewhat unexpected but it takes over 400 pages to get there. So a very different novel from Umberto. One could not say unusual because all his novels are. It should also interest comics and antique books collectors alike as there are some interesting passages on books dealers and collectors. Towards the last few chapters of the novel, there are ambivalence as to the state of Yambo. Is he alive,asleep dreaming or actually dead, in a coma ? It is the point which from a novel/story point of view became really interesting as that when we really look for answers."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Quintessential Eco: Hard to read, but rewarding if you stick with it. This is not one of the hardest of his novels, Focault's Pendulum was a lot harder to complete, in fact it flows rather smoothly without a lot of changes in time. Nevertheless, it is rather uneven, with some chapters which are a joy to read and others that even if you concentrate, your mind wanders. The description of the events ar the Gorge (do not spoil it by telling you what they are) are marvelous, you are there, you can sense the fog, feel the rocks. The description of Yambo's infatuation with Lila makes you understand what love must me. The final chapter is incongrous, impossible to follow, but it does give the feeling of the chaos of collecting all your final thoughts, before closing down your life.The illustrations, that at the beggining looked to me as they would detract from the reading and cheapen the novel, are in fact one of the best parts of the book, they get you inside the events and the feelings of the narrator. Needless to say, they make a lot more sense to over-60 Italians that to the rest of mortals. The novel must be a lot more enjoyable for those that lived through WWII or have lived in Europe in the 40s and 50s, especially in small towns. Nevertheless, the mood that it conveys, the richness of feelings and the extraordinary treatment of partial loss on memory are worth the effort. As usual, Eco shows his breath of knowledge, but it not arrogant or in-your-face, as some other authors that just learned their stuff and want to show off. Recommended, but not highly."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Eco brings you into a world of memories and passion for what we want most dearly - our first true love. Weaving a story through the amnesic fog of Yambo, a 60 ish antiquarian book dealer from Northern Italy we are drawn in to a world of Mussolini, fascists, simple country life and the passions of a boy at the first stirrings of manhood. Wonderfully intertwined with comic book heroes, villains and femme fatales it is insightful in commentary on how we weave together our lives and closes with a hauntingly beautiful ending."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"This is my first encounter with Eco's work, and it may possibly be my last.The premise of the novel was promising - a sixty-year-old man (Yambo) wakes up from a coma having lost all of his memory except for all the books he has ever read. Eco also served up some delightful prose in the first few pages, presenting in vivid contrast the richness of our hero's cultural memory vis-a-vis the depressing poverty of his personal memory. The stage was set for a narrative with a good plot and a healthy blend of introspection.The rest of the novel, however, presented a plot I felt was far too shallow and introspection that went a tad too deep. While there were certain hints on possible plot twists arising from Yambo's re-discovery of his love life, the plot thinned out by the middle of the novel and suffered increasingly under the strain of Yambo's (and Eco's) excessive self-absorption and also fascination with the like of sixty-year-old Italian comics, most of which I found difficult to relate to. It was really Eco's stroll down his own literary memory lane - a journey I found increasingly tedious as I progressed through the novel.Two-stars for good prose, but nothing more. An ultimately unsatisfying read, probably best reserved only for Eco's die-hard fans."},{"Title":"Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"Umberto Eco's latest novel is one beautiful book. Loaded with full-color reproductions of icons of daily Italian life in the 1930s and 1940s, The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana--named after a particularly insipid romantic comic--reveals the mysterious hold that popular culture has over us. The novel's hero, an amnesiac, can only reconnect with his vanished past byrevisiting the beacons of his youth--the comic strips, book illustrations, posters and advertisements whoser images impressed themselvs upon him. In this regard, he is like all of us living in an age in which a Calvin Kline ad or a pop tune from the 70s is as likely to do the trick as the whiff of a Madeleine."},{"Title":"Be Transformed (John 13-21): Christ's Triumph Means Your Transformation (The BE Series Commentary)","review":"Everyone regardless of biblical skill level, this will really take your thinking to a new level.

I suggest tackling it the same way I did: read The Tin Drum, start Reddick's book at the same time you start Cat and Mouse (Reddick reads faster than Grass, and you'll get through a lot of Reddick while tackling Grass), and when you've caught up, read Reddick's section on Dog Years and the actual novel concurrently.Those of you who feel the revelation of anything having to do with a book before you get to that part in the book is a spoiler should probably avoid this technique; Reddick revelas the major &quot;mystery&quot; in Dog Years towards the end of his section on Cat and Mouse. However, one cannot really consider Dog Years a mystery, despite the various things that happen within it; while there are some elements to it that keep the reader guessing, Dog Years is, more than anything, a savage satire on Germany during the WW2 years. And as such, finding out the main mystery-that's-not-a-mystery should not detract at all from one's appreciation of the book itself.Dog Years can also stand on its own, without being read as a part of the Danzig Trilogy, but the reader's appreciation of many facets of this novel-- most notably Edouard Amsel's character and the satire itself-- are more easily appreciated when you have The Tin Drum and Cat and Mouse under your belt as comparisons. Amsel, the main protagonist of Dog Years, stands as a direct comparison to both Oskar and Mahlke, and his character is more easily understood when those two have already been assimilated by the reader.The plot of Dog Years is a simple enough one; it charts, through the use of three narrators, the frindship of Edouard Amsel and Walter Matern from grade school through their early thirties. Amsel, the intellectual one, is picked on constantly by his classmates (including Matern) until one day, for no apparent reason, Matern befriends Amsel and chases away the others. It's a typical buddy-relationship in that Amsel is the brains and Matern is the brawn, but we don't get the bonding we've come to expect from seeing too many Hollywood buddy films. The relationship between Matern and Amsel is far more complex than that, and Reddick has done a passable job of interpreting it, one which I won't attempt to recreate here (it would be ludicrous to attempt something that complex in such a forum as a review). In an odd lapse, though-- especially given how much emphasis Reddick has put on Grass' enmity and stire of the Roman Catholic Church in the previous two books-- Reddick seems to have overlooked one of the most obvious interpretations of Amsel's character (and also that of the more minor protagonist Jenny Brunies), as a christ figure. In the novel's central scene, both Amsel and Brunies (who are both made out, in the first half of the novel, to be almost comically fat) undergo a transformation that transforms Brunies into a ballet sensation and Amsel into another character entirely, the omnipotent Goldmouth; while there is no physical crucifixion here, the path taken by Amsel's character through the rest of the novel certainly implies the path of christ after the resurrection, until his assumption into, in this case, Berlin. For the next hundred or so pages, Goldmouth is never actually seen, only referred to in the good deeds he does for others, and he achieves an almost legendary status among the rank and file for his goodness, his power (in postwar germany, his power is in his connections; who he knows), and the fact that no one really sees him much, but everyone is aware of his presence and his acts. However, Reddick, in his attempt to (successfully) parallel Amsel's character with that of Grass himself, never examines this aspect of Amsel.This lack also leads to Reddick drawing the conclusion that Dog Years is the weakest of the three books, while still proclaiming that as a whole they rank as the finest piece of modern German literature extant today. I feel Reddick is giving Dog Years short shrift here; while the book does, in fact, have its faults, they are faults shared by the other two novels as well, and I came away from Dog Years thinking that, to the contrary, it was the strongest and most absorbing of the three. While it was more difficult than the other two, it was also more rewarding and more absorbing; it's not often I'll put in three months on one novel, but at no time did I feel that it ever stopped moving me along, and at no time did I ever feel that it was time to put the book down for good.Keeping this seeming oversight of Reddick's in mind, I still have to recommend his book as a perfect accompaniment to Grass' most famous three novels, and all four of them deserve the attention of every serious student of literature."},{"Title":"Dog Years","review":"As good as 'Tin Drum' but far more accessible and direct in its impact on the darkness and light in the German psyche.

A gem of a book."},{"Title":"Dog Years","review":"Grass uses wonderful, dense, invented words and peppers his novel with wonderful, dense, twisted imagery. Which is why I admire the work and why I was determined to finish the book although it was as intellectually heavy as a brick and occassionally tried my patience. This is not a book for an MTV-hyperactive attention span. More than a reflection of German mentality, it is a journey into the German mind, because so many times it follows a stream-of-consciousness approach. Sometimes it feels as if you're on a rollercoaster ride through the tunnels of a character's mind. Which is why I hated it too. I felt that many times the book became self-indulgent... that is, Grass wasn't writing for the reader but for himself or as a catharsis for his characters.I only realized Dog Years was part of a trilogy after I bought it, and I enjoyed The Tin Drum much more because I read it after seeing the movie (it relieved the mind from loads of exertion). Although I am immensely relieved to have finally finished Dog Years, I still can't wait to read the other book of the trilogy, Cat and Mouse. Love to hate Grass."},{"Title":"Dog Years","review":"I am not going to attempt to describe Dog Years other than to say it is a stunning work by a brilliant writer at the top of his game. It should be required reading for anyone seeking to understand the German psyche in the 20th century. Some may find the style challenging, but there's a method to Grass's madness, and if you give it time, Dog Years will reward you like no other book you've ever read. Personally, I was hooked right away, but even allowing for taste, Grass will win you over sooner or later. The Tin Drum is a masterpiece, but Dog Years is even better."},{"Title":"Dog Years","review":"Two boys and a dog are on the banks of a river, watching debris stream by--furniture, uniforms from past wars, clothing from other eras, the carcasses of cats and farm animals. In other words, German history.The two friends are Walter Matern and Eduard Amsel, who is not-so-secretly half-Jewish. Eddi is an artist and a thinker; Matern is more physical, acting as his bodyguard. With a gang of friends, he was happily beating the overweight Eddi in the schoolyard, when for no reason he could understand, he suddenly switched sides.The two boys are inseparable, growing up together in the flat farmland near the Vistula. One day, little Amsel discovers that he's an artist; he makes scarecrows out of sticks and pipes and discarded clothing, wonderful scarecrows that do a miraculous job of scaring the crows away. Everyone wants one. But over time, the scarecrows come to resemble people he knows, culminating in a fearsome bird monster. The townspeople turn on him, making him destroy his collection and his studio, forcing him to leave town.Later in the novel, when Hitler is firmly in control of Germany, Amsel, now a young man, smiles and tries eagerly to fit in. In the novel's most chilling scene, Matern, seduced by the deadly tribal brotherhood of the Storm Troopers, leads a brutal attack on his oldest friend, viciously breaking every one of his teeth. A changed Eddi Amsel rises from the earth, packs a suitcase and slips away into the night.The second section of the novel is written as a series of letters from the morally ambivalent everyman Harry Liebenau to his beloved cousin Tula, detailing their childhood, his experiences as a soldier, and the history and pedigree of the German Shepherd Prinz, Hitler's favorite dog. The final part of the narrative belongs to a repentant Walter, with a hilariously vengeful tour through postwar Germany, eventually bringing him back together with his old friend Amsel.I don't have the words to properly laud this immensely powerful book. It's a distillation of poetic wordplay, human nature, philosophy, myth and history. It is by turn gentle, witty, wise, unforgiving, sorrowing, frightening, compassionate, critical, and savagely funny. Dog Years is a masterpiece of German literature, a deep, long, broad exploration of that terrible time in history when millions of ordinary people, all together, took leave of their senses--a book that manages to be an apology, a celebration, and a warning."},{"Title":"Advanced Fly Tying: The Proven Methods and Techniques of a Master Professional Fly Tyer--37 Important Patterns","review":"What I like about A.K. is his ability to teach me to tie better flies, faster. From the tiniest details of maintaining my vise and other tying tools to the layout of my tying bench, to specific patterns, each designed to teach me something. The chapter on hand positioning is worth the price of the book alone. If you are past the absolute beginner stage of tying, then you need this book. Whether you tie a few dozen or a few thousand flies per year, you'll find something in this book to help you tie more durable flies faster than you did before."},{"Title":"Advanced Fly Tying: The Proven Methods and Techniques of a Master Professional Fly Tyer--37 Important Patterns","review":"There has a been a certain amount of carping about whether the material in this text is really \\"advanced\\". I think that's fair. This isn't a PHD in flytying, but if you like AK, there is lots more here to like.There is advanced material here like his chapter on dry fly collar shape. There is other material, like that on buying hackle, that is for professionals no doubt, but not useful unless you are buying hackle by the gross, and willing to dye it all. Though the approach he takes to the task is interesting, this is professional, not necessarily advanced content.I found the chapters on vise maintenance and hand position baby. I have one of the earliest HMH vises too, and I haven't oiled it in 25 years, and I have tied heavily including professionally. I certainly wouldn't oil it with facial oil, which can be salty or acidic. On hand position, the fact is that if you can secure material to the hook properly, then you are probably already doing the stuff described here, though it might be useful to a beginner.I loved the long sections on small flies, almost a book within a book. I also liked the other section on new or revised flies. It is, however, hard to know the validity of these patterns. I don't fish the same waters he does, and in general, his patterns aren't top sellers, nor are they likely to be correct as sold, given his sharp standards. But there is something about his flies that seems right, and I don't tire reading about them. Even his close friend Gierach makes the point, however, that some of these new innovations may only help 1 out of 10 times. So rather than the information in all cases being that useful, it is just fun to see what he has been up to with his flies, and where they have taken him since his last book.AK has produced another classic."},{"Title":"Advanced Fly Tying: The Proven Methods and Techniques of a Master Professional Fly Tyer--37 Important Patterns","review":"After reading all of AK's books they have one thing in common. Teach you to tie better flies. His advice is very in depth, one whole chapter on hand postion sounds boring, but is very interesting and the reading goes by very quickly.

Anyone serious about fly tying will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Advanced Fly Tying: The Proven Methods and Techniques of a Master Professional Fly Tyer--37 Important Patterns","review":"If you are learning or have experience this is a GREAT fly tying reference book for your library. Wish I'd heard of it sooner."},{"Title":"Advanced Fly Tying: The Proven Methods and Techniques of a Master Professional Fly Tyer--37 Important Patterns","review":"A.K. Best has more than a little skill in an esoteric field. His prior books: Production Fly Tying, A.K.'s Fly Box and Dyeing and Bleaching Natural Materials are all invaluable to a serious fly tier.The latest book starts with an obsessive rant about caring for your vise. Archie: don't you think that some of us read the manual?Aside from the vise care clinic, the book is a continuation of the kind of observations about materials and techniques that made his Fly Box and Production Fly Tying so useful. In other words, buy the book.I would not be without the latest A.K. Best book...but I hope that his next work continues to provide us with his tying insights rather than ranting about vise care or some other trivial issue.I don't own an expensive vise: I own a Thompson A and a pair of Griffiths and they have suited me just fine for the past many years. If any of them were damaged due to my misuse I suspect that it would have been very obvious. I simply don't fathom the rant about vise care. . .and it is a rant (thou shalt anoint a piece of T-shirt with 3 & 1 oil and store same overnight in a plastic bag so that the oil may penetrate the fibers of the cloth...)on a par with the Old Testament.Archie, before you set a hard and fast rule about some physical mechanism I would suggest that you try reviewing the rates of surface adsorption of hydrocarbons in cotton-poly blends.And this brings me to one other little matter: A.K. uses Chlorine Bleach to remove feather fibers from quills. This is a fine way to accomplish that process. A.K. has stated that he uses a baking-soda rinse to stop the action of the bleach. Well, NaHCO3 (baking soda)forms, in solution, Na+ and HCO3- ions making an alkaline (pH >7)solution. Common household bleach is Sodium Hypochlorite (NaOCl)and it is an OXIDANT meaning that it gives up electrons in a reaction known as a REDOX reaction. Alkali solutions are Proton Acceptors and Oxidizers are Electron Donors.At best, A.K.'s the use of baking soda is harmless as a rinsing agent and at worst it has no effect other than to dilute the bleach remaining on the quills.If one is going to give definitive instructions, one ought to review the science first.This little issue aside, all of A.K.'s books have a place in every serious fly tier's library."},{"Title":"Men and Masculinities in Modern Africa (Social History of Africa Series)","review":"In this anthology, scholars juggle regional studies with men's studies. They question whether Connell's theories on masculinities can apply to the African continent. In exploring masculinities, they see four lines of inquiry: 1) the idea of the African \\"big man\\" is changing; 2) colonialism helped to shape African views on manhood; 3) independence struggles were gendered; and 4) the modern era has affected African masculinities.This book brilliantly discusses how Africans are subjects, rather than objects. Though whites, imperialists, and colonialists are brought up often, African wars, unionizing, bravery ceremonies, and other willful actions are emphasized. Though Foucault is never mentioned in this book, the idea that power is never absolute resounds clearly here.Though the editors very consciously view their work as lying within the men's studies field, in no way are women left out of the picture. The desire to find wives, keep wives, and be with wives is a continual staple of African manhood. See my discussion of female masculinity, infra. Further, men are not only distinguished from women, but from children, or what are called \\"junior men.\\" The ability to pay for a child's education or for the building of a school in one's birth village helps to define masculinity often. This is not a unideminsional text: manhood is consistently matched with issues of age, wealth, marital status, parental status, and occupation.Traditional scholars should not be scared away from this book. Many academics may feel that masculinity is a nebulous topic that should be left for babbling postmodernists. However, this book would satisfy traditional scholars. The book discusses history, economics, and sociology in very concrete ways; it merely adds gender into the broader picture.From one-third to one-half of this book focuses on Nigeria. This may disappoint some. However, as the scholars are English-speakers, English-speaking African nations are probably the easiest place for them to study. Additionally, Nigeria is the most populous nation on the Continent. Still too, East Africa and Southern Africa are not forgotten.Only two of the contributors have African names. Forgive my indirect promotion of essentialism. I just think people should know in advance that the writers are talking about \\"them\\" and not \\"us.\\" This work definitely felt much more arm's length than a \\"scholar from within\\" approach would have enacted.Unsurprisingly, \\"Africa\\" means sub-Saharan Africa here. Maybe postcolonial theorists have already agreed to lump North Africa with the Middle East. The surprise in the title comes from the word \\"Modern.\\" Almost no article limits itself to the 1960s and afterwards/independence and its aftermath. Some articles reach back into the 18th century, let alone the height of the imperial age.The editors do wrestle with Judith Halberstrom's reminder that not only men practice masculinity. This anthology includes two entries on masculine women. Nevertheless, I was slightly disappointed that while the editors cite Murray's book on African homosexualities, no other contributors ever once mention African gay men. How sexual orientation affects gender on the Continent is not touched. This book might as well have been called \\"Men and HETEROmasculinities in Modern Africa.\\" Further, though the AIDS pandemic is ravaging the region, it is not mentioned at all. Very odd and disappointing.I probably would have edited this book differently. Let me give an example of my critique. In the chapter on Mali, a phenomenon was described and then its history was brought up. It would have been much more coherent to mention the history and then discuss the phenomenon. This scholarly technique merely excludes people outside of the academy, even though it may help the contributors get tenure.Endnotes take up much space here, so the book reads faster than what one would originally imagine. Still, you must read at a sophisticated level in order to understand what is going on.I liked this work. I hope more scholarship is produced on African men and other men of the developing world. This was an important intersectional work. I applaud the thinkers paving the way in this burgeoning field."},{"Title":"Der Chinese des Schmerzes (German Edition)","review":"&quot;Der Chinese des Schmerzes&quot; is one of Handke's more elusive works. Its essence are some keywords of which the most important is the &quot;threshold&quot;: &quot;not a frontier, but a zone&quot;, in this case between a mental emptiness or loneliness and a life full of perceptions, stories, sense and love.Actually, there is very few action in this book: a game of cards, a visit to the narrator's family and other things like that; and all action comes to an end in the epilogue, which tells just how the narrator stands on a bridge, looks at the water of the canal and perceives what the people that pass around him are doing (and HOW they are doing it) or looking like. The most important person is the 1st person narrator, named Andreas Loser, a teacher; other characters hardly appear. Most of the book is made of Loser's perceptions and the feelings he connects with them. But the manner of these perceptions is subtlely changed by the things that happen to him in the book's pivotal moment and his &quot;search for a witness&quot; afterwards.This book must be read very slowly and comfortably. Read EVERY word, stop after each phrase and try to imagine the narrator's feeling. Don't ask why he is doing certain things without clear reason. You must be able to make yourself quiet inside and then be stirred softly by Handke's narration."},{"Title":"Academic Listening Encounters: Life in Society Class Audio Cassettes (3): Listening, Note Taking, and Discussion (Academic Encounters)","review":"Academic Encounters Listening is a terrific book for Academic environments.

Although Andrew Jackson was a political figure who served as President of the United States, this book serves a &quot;cultural study of Jackson's time&quot; rather than a political history of his presidency. The thesis of the book is that Jackson, &quot;who was the age's hero in a wider sense than has been commonly realized&quot; symbolized to the people of the United States all those things upopn which they based thier national pride. This national pride, Ward contends, rested upon three main concepts; &quot;Nature&quot;, &quot;Providence&quot;, and &quot;Will&quot;. These three concepts serve as major themes in the developmnet of Ward's thesis. Ward makes a very compelling argument and thouroughly supports it throughout the book with relative evidence including a variety of newspaper articles and headlines, political cartoons, speeches, poems, songs, letters, diaries, euolgies, government documents, and historical biographies. Overall, the structure of the book, the development of the thesis as it relates to the major themes, and the way in which Ward skillfully interweaves descriptive information with analytical reasoning makes for a very clear, concise, relatively easy, and interesting read. Although this book is not a political or narative history, it is a valuable and stimulating resource for any student seeking to understand this particular period in American history."},{"Title":"Andrew Jackson - Symbol for an Age","review":"My first impression of this book was that it was nothing more than rampant ramblings of senseless quibble. Once the reader understands that this is a psychoanalytical, socio-political, cultural and philosophical study of Andrew Jackson the man, versus the times he endured, it is truly an insightful work.Touted as a man of iron-will, determination and unbound democratic principles, Jackson was a man for the ages which he represented.Praised for his efforts in the Florida Indian battles and the Battle of New Orleans against the British (and denounced by some for his disregard for orders), he nonetheless came out on top of the situation for the people and his country.He exhibited qualities of the self-made man and this is what swayed his popularity. Jackson started from humble beginnings, and with his resolve and perceptiveness, became not only President of the United States for two terms, but was also looked up to as a hero with no self-limitations."},{"Title":"Andrew Jackson - Symbol for an Age","review":"As one generation describes slices of history to another, the events and personalities are altered in the process. Ward shows how Jackson's persona emerged in the transfer of historical knowledge from one generation to the next.In earning a national reputation as a war hero in the Battle of New Orleans, Jackson credited God with the victory and saw himself as a chosen instrument in His hands.A city-wide religious ceremony was held in the aftermath of that victory. All New Orleans acknowledged humble thanksgiving to God for the successful defense of the city.Riding the crest of this military popularity Jackson was elected president and the masses who turned out for his inaugural events were unlike any other before him. His administration was a shift from the elite to a populous approach to government. Ward includes helpful anecdotes to keep the readers abreast of some of the details of the time and places covered."},{"Title":"Andrew Jackson - Symbol for an Age","review":"Ward was a deep, even radical, but at the same time understated, American thinker at a time when almost all of his colleagues preferred either to play it safe or to grandstand stylistically. His books were dry and careful, but produced definitive classics of the field. Jackson is his best known, but he himself preferred his translation of Grimke. To see true American thought at work, read this book."},{"Title":"Andrew Jackson - Symbol for an Age","review":"More than we would like to admit, America lives through, and is defined by, the myths and symbolism created during the period when it was basically a \\"Slave Republic,\\" or better yet, a \\"Slave Aristocracy.\\" Arguably, even today, if the U.S. reputation were based solely on the nation's expressed deeds and the actual implementation of the principles and intent of its Constitution, rather than on the lip service paid to it and the high-minded rhetoric and myths of white supremacy based on it, one would be at hard pressed to point to anything about this nation that is concrete, lasting, or not subject to quixotic reversal?While the myths surrounding our first president, George Washington, the father of the nation, are understandable even when not always true, those surrounding Andrew Jackson are much more complex, much more revealing, and needless to say, much more difficult to understand. Because although they embody the spirit of the American white man, they also contradict the U.S. Constitution in fundamental ways and ignore his demonstrated hostility towards Native Americans and slaves. But more importantly, they also betray an uneasy but mostly latent hostility that has always existed between poor and wealthy white men, too.The cover notes to this book begin: \\"Every age creates heroes to suit its needs.\\" For a young nation of the early 19th Century, Andrew Jackson filled the need of a hero of the common man.\\" So long as the term \\"common man\\" is interpreted to mean the \\"poor white man,\\" then it can be said to reflect the realities of Jackson's times.Thus, the real value of this beautifully and carefully written (almost poetic) book is that it gives us a template for the psychology of American heroism. Through Andrew Jackson, it attempts to capture perfectly the spirit of the white man during the era of 1820-1850. It shows how myth making and symbolization became a fundamental aspect of advancing this nation's national narrative. For the first time in American history, Andrew Jackson captured the imagination and advanced the cause of the common (white) man, rather than those he fundamentally opposed (and opposed him): Native Americans, slaves, and most importantly the landed gentry (which consisted of the class of most of our founding fathers).It was Jackson's heroics in the Battle of New Orleans -- where he single-handedly advanced the strategy that crushed the British -- forcing them to the negotiating table -- that set the stage for the new \\"common man\\" mythology and that was to become the basis for an enduring symbol of the ideals of an era. The book therefore is as much a study of Jackson's times as it is a study of the man himself. And in this sense, at its deepest level, and examined carefully, it is a study of the fundamental fault lines that trisected the emerging nation: between the landed gentry and the common white man, between whites and blacks; and between whites and Native Americans. Thus, like Andrew Johnson a generation or so later, it too is an analysis of an essentially flawed hero, yet one who embodied the deep essence of the very racist American spirit.The author's method of exposition is to define Jacksonianism through select episodes in Jackson's career and then trace their translation into symbols and myths. Foremost among the myths are the appropriate images of Jackson as a \\"victorious general,\\" but the overdrawn images of him as a \\"rough-hewn frontiersman,\\" as \\"a self made man of iron will,\\" and as \\"god's instrument for religious America.\\" These are all images that helped to make our seventh president a legend in his own time. However, none looked carefully at the moral dimension of this flawed hero. Given that he was a religiously devout man, that he was,and given his deeds against Native Americans and having owned more than 200 slaves, can only be a measure of how hollowed-out U.S. religious piety must have been during those difficult times.The book gets deeply into the nitty-gritty of what made him such an icon to white America. However, in my view, as usual, it leaves out the really important stuff. What is left very much understated if not unsaid entirely is that this symbol of the 1820s American spirit, of the common white man, was a brutal racist, who if he were to have lived during any other time, including contemporary times, he would undoubtedly have been hauled before an international court and prosecuted for genocide or crimes against humanity.Such is the nature of many of America's past heroes. That even with a Constitution that advanced the principles of fairness and justice, many of our heroes were consciously guilty of undermining it, and doing just the opposite. Yet through a kind of \\"historical moral blindness,\\" the author either saw no contradiction in this or deemed it unworthy to report on? The phrase \\"he was a man of his times\\" seems a sufficient \\"catch-all\\" to cover all past crimes, sins and contradictions with the U.S. Constitution. Still a wonderful read. Four stars"},{"Title":"Andrew Jackson - Symbol for an Age","review":"This quite readable book (if you read scholarly books) is possibly more relevant today than when it was written (in 1953). The author demonstrates how the concepts of Nature, God, and Will combined in the American imagination to provide the basis for beliefs about ourselves as a nation and our place in the world. The author doesn't explicitly draw a line from then-to-now (or even then-to-1953), but you will be able to draw that line yourself if you are an observer of American culture. If you are interested in current politics or the state of the nation today, read this book; you will understand more about how we got to where we are. It is not a biography of Andrew Jackson, but rather a carefully drawn picture of his times, using him, as the titles says, as a \\"symbol\\" for his era."},{"Title":"Andrew Jackson - Symbol for an Age","review":"American democratic politics, as can be easily seen in this year's presidential nominating processes, has always been encumbered with symbols. That fact is hardly new or news. What is news is that today's seemingly modern notion of proper electoral technique has a fairly ancient pedigree. Although Parson Weems did more than his share to establish the iconic figure of George Washington, arguably the subject of this work, Andrew Jackson, really was the first president to get the full public relations \`spin' treatment that we take as a matter of course in today's politics.The present volume builds the case for Jackson symbolic virtues at a time when America, after a series of nasty encounters with the British, notably the War of 1812, developed an inward look westward and away from the \`degeneracy' of the seaboard. If Jackson did not fit the bill to a tee then his agents, paid or otherwise, filled in the blanks. First place in those efforts goes to highlighting his military prowess and soldierly concerns in defeating (to what real purpose no one knows since the war was over by this time) against the British at the tail end of the War of 1812 at the Battle of New Orleans.From there it was fairly simple to make him a man of the' people'. In this case the people being empathically not the residents of the eastern seaboard but the \`fresh' yeomanry of the Westward trek. You know- the ones who exhibited all the plebian virtues as solid tillers of the soil, holders of folk wisdom against the effete nabobs of the cities and the true patriots of rising American agricultural capitalism. The author builds his case by using a series of fairly common references beginning his work with an analysis of a Jackson poetic tribute \`The Hunters of Kentucky' and dissects that bit of work to see how it fit into the scheme of making Jackson the first \\"people's\\" president. All the other tributes and, at the end eulogies, then fall into place.If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then his Whig opponents do that by learning from his handlers by the time of the \`Tippecanoe' Harrison campaign of 1840. And from there we are off to the races. Note this- as if to reinforce the argument presented by the book- can anyone today deny that that myth built so long ago still, with the exception of a dent caused by his savagery against the Native Americans, stands as the way he is thought of in the American pantheon? The Democrats continue their traditional Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinners without blushing."},{"Title":"Andrew Jackson - Symbol for an Age","review":"I love this book. Why? You should be ashamed to ask that question. BECAUSE ANDREW JACKSON IS A REAL TRUE SYMBOL FOR THIS AGE OF MANKIND, YOU MORON!!!!! Jackson understood that society back then was, indeed, a feudalistic society. But he did not knuckle under, he did not succcumb to laziness or expediency. No, he took charge of himself and rose out of poverty. He is a real man, something I look up to. He stood up for himself and took charge as an individual."},{"Title":"Andrew Jackson - Symbol for an Age","review":"Reading this I am reminded of people you meet that talk just to hear themselves speak this book reminded me of those people.

Grasping the principles of operating a business is equally important. Here, in a newly revised edition of his fourteen-year best-seller, Harry Siegel together with Alan M. Siegel show how to run a design shop smoothly and effectively. The book, the first and most' respected in the field, continues to be a must for all interior designers, architects, space planners, and certainly students.Thoroughly updated to reflect current practices and procedures, the book is divided into four parts. In Part 1 the Siegels discuss how to establish an interior design practice. In Part 2 they describe how to carry through a job and charge for it. Included are a new checklist to help the designer handle initial contacts with the client, new descriptions of the use of combinations of fees and allocation of budget amounts, as well as three completely new chapters, Analysis of Scope of Services, Approach to the Flat Fee, and Sales Taxes. Alan M. Siegel, a partner in the law firm of Levy &amp; Sonet, which is legal counsel to the American Society of Interior Designers, Inc., has completely revised the chapter on residential letters of agreement.The special requirements of nonresidential work are covered in Part 3. Here too the chapter on letters of agreement has been completely revised by Alan M. Siegel, and the discussion of the designer's responsibilities for purchases has been expanded. In Part 4 the Siegels examine forms, techniques, and special factors including actual examples of the specialized procedural forms used in the design office. The chapter on insurance has been expanded and completely revised, including a discussion of errors and omissions coverage.

It was informative about Neil and his past that i did not know about him. I enjoyed the book and it was entertaining."},{"Title":"Neil Diamond: His Life, His Music, His Passion","review":"This book is very much a cut-and-paste job with information gleaned from previous biographies and interviews and no new material save for the author's own opinions, which are occasionally very misinformed. It's one thing to have your own opinion, but very early on Jackson makes some really basic errors about the 1970s music scene and forms opinions based on those errors. Some of her descriptions of people in Diamond's life are obviously based on photographs and nothing else, and these descriptions are used to flesh out the word count. Overuse of glowing descriptors like \\"intriguing\\" or \\"enthusiastic\\" pad out the content, as do cliches like \\"knuckle down\\" or \\"talking out of school.\\"Also, Jackson full-on lies about certain events in Neil Diamond's life to cover problematic areas. These events are things that Neil himself has talked about, rarely of course, but they are easy to find either scanned online or in cheap back issues from the 70s (People, Rolling Stone, Stars and Stripes, Newsweek, etc.) The last real biographies on Neil were done in 1987, and the material in Jackson's book from 1987 on is notably sketchier and less comprehensive than what's written about 1987 and before, which tells you exactly where Jackson got all her info.Further, given that this author has somehow managed to write 15 in-depth biographies over the past 17 years -- releasing some of them with multiple titles as though they were new books -- makes me wonder just what is going on here.If you want to learn about Neil Diamond, don't start here. What you need to do is first realize that he has not been officially involved (nor unofficially, as far as I know, except perhaps with David Wild's semi-bio) with any book. You should also know that the information he has given in interviews is often contradictory. Accept this, learn to live with it, then go read He Is...I Say by David Wild if you want a nice overview of Neil's life. The liner notes for the In My Lifetime music set are also very informative. If you want more detail, try Solitary Star by Rich Wiseman and Diamond: A Biography by Grossman et al. Solitary Star is seen as more negative by the fans, and while the author does seem to be very irritated with Diamond throughout the book, he includes interviews from people who really like Neil so it's not all negative. Diamond: A Biography is more positive, sometimes so much so that they fudge the facts or completely avoid problematic areas. (For example, Solitary Star goes into a lot of detail about the lawsuit and Lee Holdridge credit fiasco for Jonathan Livingston Seagull, while Diamond: A Biography skims over it.) Both Solitary Star and Diamond have errors, but Solitary Star's errors are entirely on the part of the people who were interviewed. Diamond: A Biography has errors that seem deliberate. Also, note both were written in 1987 so they have no real new material. If you're looking for dirt, you're probably out of luck. None of the books out there go much into groupies or drugs or affairs, and most avoid discussing Neil's kids, which I personally think is only fair since Diamond himself did not contribute to any books. But you might as well buy Solitary Star and Diamond: A Biography and get the relatively original information rather than read it in Jackson's bland book."},{"Title":"Neil Diamond: His Life, His Music, His Passion","review":"For anyone who's a Neil Diamond fan, this book will satisfy, I think. I enjoyed most of the story immensely (and it's not a thick one)- but the last 1/3 was mainly made up of what's got to be public knowledge: tours and personal appearances, recordings made. But the book did satisfy lots of my need to know about my favorite singer. There's the feeling I get that the author's \\"extremely testing time\\" (in her dedication) was that of trying to write this book about an extremely private guy!So many good memories were brought back when reading this but Mr. Diamond is a private man, and we fans just have to understand and go along with that. We're lucky to have been shown the few private things that were brought out in this book! Private stars WANT to keep their lives private, remember. Just look at Paul Newman.I'm not young - I'm over 80 - and this guy (Neil Diamond) has been a force in the music I've loved for many years. When I still had my husband the music of Neil was put onto our tapes, the lyrics typed out into a book we still cherish for their poetry. And this author brought out how much Neil's feelings go into those lyrics. Oh, the hours my husband spent on his tall stool, taping those songs, getting all those lyrics down! When the album \\"African Trilogy\\" came out we played those deep drums SO LOUD the floor trembled below our heads (which were on the floor with our bodies, to \\"get all the music\\". When Neil first hit the public stage, our girls went to the East Boston, MA free concert at the City Yard to hear him; probably in 1968. We were so afraid for them (all the drugs we'd heard about at these concerts), but \\"Holly Holy\\" became a song we absolutely loved after that. And when our Red Sox play, the song \\"Sweet Caroline\\" is what the 7th inning stretch is all about! When any performer does that song, this lady is right in there \\"boomp, boomp, boomp\\" -ing with the lyrics. I've been to three of Neil Diamond's live performances and wouldn't miss a minute of them. Thank you, Laura Jackson, for bringing back those wonderful memories of an absolutely marvelous performer. May the remainder of his life be good - he deserves it for what he's brought to his fans."},{"Title":"Neil Diamond: His Life, His Music, His Passion","review":"Thoughtfully written with tons of information about Neil Diamond's life and career.

This is the best book for Friends of Neil Diamond."},{"Title":"The Winemaker's Dance: Exploring Terroir in the Napa Valley","review":"This is a wonderful book for someone interested in an understanding of the complexities and nuances of creating good wine. After reading it I have a deep appreciation for the forces brought together by the winemaker. The Napa Valley and what it produces are certainly uniquely American treasures.The authors begin by explaining the winemaker's dance as \\"an engagement with land, vine, and human understanding that is fundamental to understanding the relationship of terroir and wine\\". What follows delves into each aspect of the dance in exquisite and enjoyable detail.Initially I thought I'd be overwhelmed by the scientific details of the geological formation of the Napa Valley, however, the combination of wonderful graphics, diagrams, maps and descriptions resulted in not only an understanding of Napa, but a greater understanding of geology in general. The authors move us through a history of the forces that created the major structures of the valley up to the resultant influences on soil and the particular issues that concern winemakers. Despite being geologists, the authors have a keen respect for the limitations of scientific information and are quick to point out the limitations and resultant assumptions.Understanding more of the geologic history of the Valley allows one to understand the importance of site selection by the grape growers and winemakers. Rock, soil, sun, wind direction and temperature as well as other details of place and earth are critical in deciding what and where to plant.The second half of the book brings into focus the amazingly complex work of growing excellent grapes and then harvesting and handling them to produce excellent wine. For me it suggests that the best winemakers need a fusion of both masculine/feminine, linear/intuitive capacities. One could know everything about the science of winemaking and fail without having a feel for timing, smell and taste. No wonder some of Napa's best winemakers are women.The book contains some tasty bonuses including two tours of the Napa Valley and it's wineries, and quick-read boxes explaining such things as the tannin effect. For readers who love well-produced books, the quality of paper, color and print style make this one a treat to touch and see. The authors' writing style is also quite enjoyable with freguent use of surprising similes and metaphors.Finally, a major benefit to me as a novice wine taster is the message to trust my own taste rather than relying on the \\"experts\\". And, to find a good wine store with knowledgeable staff to help you through the process of exploration."},{"Title":"The Winemaker's Dance: Exploring Terroir in the Napa Valley","review":"Terroir, as most wine buffs know, is the elusive argument that advocates of French wine use to argue that their favorite beverage is superior to the wine produced in other countries. It is an unmeasurable quality: a combination of soil, climate, character, history, and tradition that enthusiastic tasters say they can recognize in the wine. It is why a specific wine tastes the way it does and not the way one produced a few hundred yards away tastes.Though Napa Valley is certainly a newcomer compared to the oldest wine-growing areas in France, Italy, and Germany, Napa certainly does have history, and certain patches of it are celebrated for producing wines that have enough sophistication and depth to stand up to any other wines in the world.But to what extent does that mean California wines have a quality like terroir?It's an interesting question and one that deserves a book that includes a thorough and lively treatment. The Winemakers Dance, unfortunately, is not that book -- although not for a lack of trying.Passionate authors Jonathan Swinchatt and David Howell are geologists by trade, and it shows by the way they attempt to argue for terroir in Napa from the ground up -- including scores of geological maps and aerial views of the valley floor and nearby mountains. The authors discuss many of the key players and vineyards in the region in great detail.The problem is that despite the authors' attempt to create something accessible to and compelling for the general public, the books falls far short of that, remaining for the most part an academic treatise. Amazon's description of the book got it right: \\"exhaustive and ... exhausting.\\" I am a bit of a wine buff myself, with a mid-sized and growing collection of wine books, but this was tough to get through, and a third of the way through I gave up trying to read it cover to cover and instead settled on a strategy of picking through the tests for parts that captured my attention.Am I disappointed I bought it? No, not too much, despite my complaints, The Winemakers Dance taught me a great deal about the relationship between the winemaker and the land in Napa Valley. But it's back on my shelf now, and, unfortunately, I think it'll probably stay there."},{"Title":"The Winemaker's Dance: Exploring Terroir in the Napa Valley","review":"A thorough and valiant attempt at trying to define \\"terroir\\" in one of the world's great winegrape growing regions.I liked the book a lot more than I thought I would--it starts with the soils and geologic makeup, goes into climate, viticulture, and then tries to bundle it with how the grape growers and winemakers coax great fruit out of all of it.Fabulous maps and graphics. Worth the price for this alone.Terroir is a very difficult topic to get ones head around and I really appreciate the authors' work. A lot closer than you get from talking to grape growers and wine makers.

This book has a lot ofinteresting information in it. It is especially suitable for someone interested in agriculture who will be visiting Napa county - there areprobably far more people in that category than there are peopleinterested in growing wine grapes.For my purposes I would have liked to see a summary table or listing of wineries, wine price, type(s) of grapes grown, soil conditions, soil water retention, elevation, slope, sunlight orientation, and perhaps native vegetation on the soil. It was a bit hard to get this information since it was scattered throughout the book and there were usually just a few factors mentionned when specific wineries were discussed."},{"Title":"The Winemaker's Dance: Exploring Terroir in the Napa Valley","review":"I came across this title on a search for D.

This Napa valley primer is an excellent intro on the topic and will get the 'geo-juices' flowing for research in my own backyard. See also SOILS FOR FINE WINES by White.The problem of ground water over-draft was skirted in this book. Any talk of sustainability in CA's wine country --as one finds in the final chapter of this title --will have to be honest about this issue, regardless of drip irrigation, or the perfect grape. I'd like these authors to cover what impacts on geohydrology the wine industry has had in the Napa valley in a revised edition.

Who'd have thought my favorite childhood stories would have academic value once I started Latin class? The illustrations in Myths and Enchantment Tales are as lovely as the stories.

But there's nothing scientific about poverty. Footnotes and graphs have no place in this kind of examination. It's an emotional book, intimately conveying the scorn and contempt of family that's half-starved and forced to live in claustrophobic conditions.&quot;The Children of Sanchez&quot; documents all the petty hostilities within the fragile family unit. And it documents them accurately. Living in Mexico City is hard. Rich or poor, chilangos are constantly forced to deal with incredible violence and instability; the city is unforgiving and cruel, with terrible pollution levels and wild corruption. Lewis has perfectly captured the daily horrors of this urbanized mess. Using the Sanchez family as a case group representative of many families in the capital, he shows how people are slowly crushed by their relatives, the justice system and the congestion.Nothing in this book is false or misleading. I have lived and worked in Mexico City; I have lived with a middle-class Mexican family; and I have started a family in Mexico. The experiences of the Sanchez family mirror my own experiences. I have met and have known many people like the people in this book. I have seen my own family spend countless hours attacking each other. And I have seen people desperately trying to make ends meet in a city with no opportunities.Read this book. It's all true!"},{"Title":"Children of Sanchez (Modern Library Giants, 100.1)","review":"This book for me is one of the most unbiased approaches to anthropogy I have ever read. It shocked me that he chose to take their interviews and turn them into stories using their own language. It is as if the people were talking to the reader. The conflicts are so real and believable that I do not think that Oscar Lewis allowed his own thoughts to even be part of his work. This is not a liberals approach to changing peoples positions on an issue. It is allowing people to see what it was like to be a struggling lower class family in the 1950s.We a given a window into a family of 4 children and their struggles from early childhood to becoming adults. We also are given a small snipet of the Father's perspective of his childrens accomplishments.This family's life is definately not the most glamorous look into their lives but it is very honest. We get to see them go through the struggles of poverty and being parents in a country that the only way to survive was to overcome the struggles that were given to them.I disagree with anyone who thinks Lewis is some how trying to make us simpathize with this Family. I feel he is trying to let us discover the Sanchez family for who they are and what is important to them. I have made a point to read more of his work and I have found only an honest acessment of people and the conditions they live in.Be warned this book tells the story through a Mexican perspective and their morals do follow western views so tightly. The content that is discussed is hard and should be read with maturity."},{"Title":"Children of Sanchez (Modern Library Giants, 100.1)","review":"This book is a remarkably intimate study of a family in Mexico City. How Oscar Lewis managed to get them to open up about their experiences, fears, loves, hates, dreams and suffering in such explicit detail is a mystery. Lewis must have assisted them to articulate their feelings and perspectives because their tales are beautiful to read. Five members of the Sanchez family give independent accounts of their lives of hardship. The same events in their lives are viewed from each family member's perspective providing a unique insight into the familie's life. It is particularly amazing how openly they talk about each other. I have to assume that none of them will ever read the book. Reading the account of their lives is a sociological experience that is difficult to imagine getting from a book but also a beautiful piece of writing. In my opinion a unique and outstanding achievement ."},{"Title":"Children of Sanchez (Modern Library Giants, 100.1)","review":"I read this 40 years ago and couldn't put it down; picked it back up recently as a gift for my children - it's just a great read - Oscar Lewis makes you feel you're living through the events of these young lives - a master story-teller and Sociologist; Lewis gives the reader a captivating insight into a gritty culture and the effort to find values told through the eyes of one family growing up poor in Mexico. \\"Must-read\\" is much overused; but this book - truly - is on the list of books every thinking American \\"must read\\" at least once in a lifetime; too explicit for young minds - say, under-16."},{"Title":"Children of Sanchez (Modern Library Giants, 100.1)","review":"It was hard for me to put this book down. Some of the material rings so true to life, it made me recall memories of my own childhood. Since the book is written in \\"four part\\" chapters, each part is written by one of the four Sanchez siblings: Manuel, Roberto, Consuelo, and Martha. Each one talks about his or her own experience, in a way that you get to see each of the four sides & form your own conclusion as to how life really was. I would've liked for the father, Jesus Sanchez, to have written his own \\"side\\" in the epilogue, his own way of seeing things, and why he did things the way he did. All he spoke about in the epilogue was about politics in Mexico, and he rambled on about that. He hardly talked about his children, and how they grew up. The father's epilogue at the end of the book served very little purpose in my opinion. The author's introduction was way more valuable and worthwhile.

Even though the life stories being told were compiled fifty years ago, the book is still very relevant today.

La primera clase de genero, para este libro, ser&iacute;a una novela de personajes, pues son 5 personajes principales en la novela, y se centra en ellos, tiene una trama que se desarrolla a titulo de autobiograf&iacute;a utilizando para ello los pasajes comunes de la vida de una familia en la que cada uno de sus integrantes principales tiene un capitulo especial en cada una de las partes en que esta dividido el libro, es por ello que resulta un tanto parad&oacute;jico, recoger en una sola obra ensayo, biograf&iacute;a, historia y novela, solamente un estudioso como Oscar Lewis podr&iacute;a desarrollar con tanta riqueza y detalle un estudio antropol&oacute;gico tan profundo y tan actual teniendo en cuenta que fue escrito sobre una familia que se inicia a finales de los a&ntilde;os 40s y que aun hoy es constante en toda una Am&eacute;rica latina, de clases socioecon&oacute;micas tan marcadas. La segunda clase ser&iacute;a, la parte cient&iacute;fica que re&uacute;ne el an&aacute;lisis del entorno de una sociedad pobre, machista, religiosa, ignorante, orgullosa, pero en el fondo buena; de all&iacute; la importancia de esta obra, en la que sin perder el inter&eacute;s novelesco, se descubren narrados por ellos mismos los profundos caracteres sociol&oacute;gicos de los integrantes de esta familia, por lo que se puede llegar a concluir que el autor re&uacute;ne en su obra, sinconfundirlos diversos g&eacute;neros literarios, permiti&eacute;ndole al lector conclusiones, (amar odiar sus personajes, convertirlos en buenos y malos), para entender finalmente que todo ello lleva a una explicaci&oacute;n realista, sincera, dram&aacute;tica y definitiva sobre el porque Latinoamericano y es que al analizar la obra y hacerle una comparaci&oacute;n con la realidad que vive este pa&iacute;s hoy al terminar el siglo se podr&iacute;a juzgar a autor y su obra como &uacute;nicos.Tema: El libro habla sobre una familia mejicana, pobre, el padre, Jes&uacute;s S&aacute;nchez naci&oacute; campesino, se fue joven a la ciudad, despu&eacute;s de la muerte de su madre, como muchos otros, para buscar fortuna y como les paso a todos estos le toco trabajar como obrero, portero o aseador, se caso ya en la ciudad con Leonor y tuvo 4 hijos, Manuel, Roberto, Consuelo y Marta, el libro empieza en si cuando la madre se muere, todos estaban muy chiquitos, y cada uno cuenta su historia desde ese momento hasta que ya son adultos y con familia. El libro se divide en tres partes, en las cuales los cuatro hijos narran sus historias de una manera simple, en la primera parte es desde la muerte de la madre, hasta que cumplen la mayor&iacute;a de edad, el otro es cuando son jovenes-adultos, y el ultimo ya cuando son padres y Jes&uacute;s es abuelo, este solo narra al principio, sobre su vida en el campo y la llegada a la ciudad, y al final cuando considera que como padre ha fracasado. Cada historia que narran esta llena de aventura, de amor, de drama, de sentimientos humanos sencillos, de esperanzas fallidas y de un permanente intento de mejorar sus vidas, es la respuesta a una vida llena de necesidades que justifica en muchos casos actos que rayan en el delito o aun en el incesto y actos reprobables a primera vista, cada personaje de una manera original, pero sencilla narra su historia desde que estaba chiquito, incluyendo pasajes que pudieran parecer rid&iacute;culos, vergonzosos, violentos, graciosos o aun sin importancia, pero sobretodo vistos desde su individual punto de vista. Vale la pena comparar la importancia que a cada episodio le da cada integrante de la familia, por ejemplo Roberto S&aacute;nchez, el segundo de los hijos de Jes&uacute;s, le da muy poca importancia a la &eacute;poca de su infancia, y en cambio detalla mucho mas su juventud y su vida de adulto, cuando el se escapa de la casa sus dos hermanas Consuelo y Marta narran el episodio con miedo con angustia y con tristeza, sin embargo Manuel su hermano mayor, ni siquiera lo menciona, Manuel por ejemplo para demostrar su hombr&iacute;a ante la figura de su padre decide desde muy joven participar en pandillas, llamadas en M&eacute;jico palomillas, cosa que sus hermanos no solamente justifican sino que admiran y como en el caso de Roberto las imita. Sus hermanas cuentan sus historias de una manera tierna, a&ntilde;orando en muchos casos una caricia o un cari&ntilde;o por parte de su padre o quizas un juguete, y justificando por la educaci&oacute;n que han recibido las actuaciones machistas de los hombres de la familia, la pobreza retratada por cada uno de los personajes y justificada como un modo de vida general de la sociedad le da un car&aacute;cter &uacute;nico a una obra que estar&aacute; presente en la mente de cualquiera que la lea para entender la problem&aacute;tica latinoamericana, que como se dijo antes, no ha cambiado en los &uacute;ltimos 50 a&ntilde;os.Calidad: Se puede calificar este como un libro de superior calidad, en el cual, con sencillas palabras se logran sorprendentes resultados, su lectura es f&aacute;cil, sus permanentes argumentos son sencillos y llenos de colorido muy mejicano que narran aspectos de la vida simple, con un idioma bien manejado llevando de la mano para que sea &eacute;l, el que escoja el &eacute;nfasis que le da a su narrativa, el lenguaje utilizado esta lejos de ser cient&iacute;fico o pretencioso, pero de todas maneras es entendible para el lector. El sistema de la narraci&oacute;n que recoge en la introducci&oacute;n la primera parte de la vida de Jes&uacute;s S&aacute;nchez y divide las de sus cuatro hijos para terminar con un epilogo tambi&eacute;n narrado por Manuel, es original y nos muestra la capacidad del autor para imponerle a su obra una mejor calidad narrativa. La historia es contada de una manera simple sin pretensiones de profundidad sicolog&iacute;a que logra que el lector se involucre y tome partido a favor o en contra de cada una de las actuaciones de los integrantes de esta singular pero com&uacute;n familia. El sistema de grabaciones directas y versiones taquigraficas empleada por Lewis es original y realista y me permite calificar esta obra como una de las de mas altas calidades literarias que he le&iacute;do hasta ahora."},{"Title":"Children of Sanchez (Modern Library Giants, 100.1)","review":"I received this book as a Christmas gift (Hanukka actually).

Lewis certainly has an ax to grind and a theory to prove--that there is a &quot;cycle of poverty&quot; that entraps the poor in their own cultural malaise. This theory, popular in the 50s and still popular in its neo-liberal version today, is ill served by Lewis's fictionalized accounts that are disguised as fact. How did Lewis know this family so well? The answer is he probably didn't, but made up what he lacked in data so that his theory would come out on top. In this story it becomes tragically clear that the decisions of the individuals themselves are what are holding them back. From Lewis's liberal point of view, the failures are understandable but lamentable. The problem is, as I note above, it is really just a story. The family certainly did exist, and people in the neighborhood (Tepito) can point their house out to the curious stranger, but the details are all Oscar Lewises. The proof of the pudding is that Tepito is now a vibrant urban center despite its apparent poverty, and the likelihood is that it was always so--but Lewis couldn't see the forest for the theory.Needless to say the neighborhood and the family felt ill-used when they discovered the use to which Lewis put his time with them (to say nothing of the ethnical dilemna of the fact that he was writing very salacious material about them when everyone around them knew who they were.This book certainly makes interesting literature, but the reader should be aware of the author's profound biases.

However, I was greatly disappointed to find that in this particular book, the heroine Miriam is accompanying her best friend Kate on a trip to find love, and a potential bed-hopping fest, with a married man while his wife's away (seriously, are you even allowed to be that dumb over twenty-four?)Not to be completely discouraged, I began reading the book anyway, hoping the description in the plot about \\"living without consequences\\" wasn't as literal as I thought. And happily, it's not; the heroine Miriam is a lot more grounded than her menopausing insecure friend, Kate, and spends a great deal of time reminding Kate that her old flame is married and most likely won't leave his wife. Kate listens, somewhat ineffectively, and finds to my relief that there are some complications in bouncing around with a married man. This easily may have redeemed the book in my eyes..until happily married Miriam throws common sense away and has an affair herself!! It is revealed that her husband, Alan, cheated on her years ago and was forgiven. Now, with a hot guy of the idiotic name \\"Vijay\\" giving her the eye, why shouldn't Miriam be entitled to a little fling of her own? At least this is the philosophy of Kate, Miriam's idiot friend. And for some reason, Miriam listens to her and willingly cheats on her husband with \\"Vijay\\". She gets what she deserves, I'm happy to say: Vijay moves on to other women the minute he's finished with her, and Miriam's ashamed of herself. Her sexual episode ends with both her and Kate reflecting over how lucky she is to have Alan and how blessed her marriage is. But, not without her bragging about having several orgasms with Vijay and getting a high-five from happy-pants Kate.Now really, folks: I'm as appreciative of the whole \\"middle-aged women can have fun like twenty-somethings\\" moral as anyone else, but how many times do we need to see horny old cows give high-fives to each other over their philandering? I don't find that attractive at ANY age, much less middle age. In this book a perfectly happily married woman cheats on her husband, resolves never to tell him, and doesn't really experience regret over it; in fact, she heads straight home and has a hot rekindling with him, so we're supposed to think it's all okay. Then there's the slutty Kate, who went cross-country to have an affair and then, as soon as she gets the opportunity to have her old flame without his wife, decides to leave him because things get too serious between them. She cries prettily and says she'll always love him, but it just seems too much for her now, and not what she needs anymore. If you ask me, she was a go-easy sot who just wanted to bail when things actually started resembling real life instead of soap operas.I have to ask, is it really fun to see women acting like this? And honestly ladies, would you find this equally funny if it were men instead of women? If middle-aged men in this story were cheating and high-fiving each other over their conquests instead of women, I'm sure it'd be torn apart by feminists, wives, girlfriends and God knows what else. I'm aware that this book is a comedy, but there are some things I just can't laugh at; I know of families who were torn apart by careless adultery, and there's nothing funny to me about silly middle-aged women with sex drives bigger than their morals. With all its clever dialogue and delicious foods, this novel just isn't for me.If you want truly delightful books with recipes and spunk, I recommend \\"Eat Cake\\", \\"Belle in the Big Apple\\", and \\"Insatiable\\". If you want books with fun older couples, I highly recommend the \\"Julie and Romeo\\" series. And lastly, Sharon Borstin is a fantastic author.

A statement as preposterous as this--that an academic book doesn't add anything to the field--strikes me as humorous. It would seem that the reviewer from Colorado claims that somehow academic books are not fitting for academia. The Colorado reviewer's comments only illustrate the value of Trail's brilliant book: not only do students benefit from the Contemporary Glossary, but so do would-be professors. I've taught many thousands of freshman composition students in the past decade, and I have always used Trail's book and his method, and my students--everything from poor students from the Bronx to wealthy geniuses at NYU--have universally benefited. If Trail's book were adopted by every college and university composition program in the country, we'd have a citizenry that would not only write better, but think better. I can't imagine teaching composition without using Professor Trail's Glossary, and I recommend it to any professor who truly wants to teach his students more than how to &quot;express&quot; themselves like the members of a talk show audience.

So that being said I give it five stars for how it was written but two for info ergo the three...lets call it three point five."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe test pilot: Flying captured Allied aircraft of World War 2","review":"The author flew all the major German warplanes, and the minor and experimental types. Hans specialized in flying captured Allied aircraft that fell intact into German hands. He had no flight manuals and had to fly by intuition; he never crashed of seriously damaged one airplane. This book is based on his wartime records, and tells of his test results. In 1974 a captured Dornier Do335 was sent back to Germany. This let to writing a book about his experiences, illustrated with many photographs.One story was about flying a captured Lancaster bomber at night so it could be tracked by German radar equipment. Their radio failed, and they tried to find a landing field. They were immediately enemy suspects! Hans explained the problems in an unknown aircraft (pp.12-14). Page 20 tells of the troubles with reverse operating instruments. Hans was part of an air to air refueling test (p.21). &quot;Most accidents were the result of a combination of several faults appearing simultaneously.&quot; Controls were arranged differently in every aircraft; many test flights of captured aircraft ended in crash landings (p.23). Only one kind of aircraft can be optimized for a given purpose. A fast plane should not tow slower gliders (p.27). Prone piloting allowed higher 'g' forces, but it was more difficult to judge the position of the aircraft (p.28).The main advantage of the B-17 was their turbo-charged engines. Germany lacked heat-resistant metals to build these, and German synthetic oil was of a lower quality. The B-26 was a quite passable aircraft but had to be handled with great sensitivity. Italian aircraft, just like the French, developed full power when the throttles were pulled back, unlike German design. This would sometimes create bad accidents for the unwary! Using a higher viscosity oil at low temperature could create problems in landing flaps (p.51).The first airworthy B-24 was captured in 1943, and flown to Germany to investigate this high performance aircraft. Its relatively smaller wing had higher wing loading, a faster take-off and landing speed. Its center of gravity was too far back. The nose wheel was weak, so the B-24 was restricted to concrete runways. Page 61 discusses the trade-offs in B-24 loading; it was not an easy airplane to fly. Page 63 discusses the differences between a manually controlled B-24 and an automatically controlled airplane. The chapter &quot;My flying background&quot; is a short autobiography of his life in the 1930s.The P-47's strong points were not in dogfighting or heights under 6000m. It excelled in higher altitudes, diving attacks, and long-range bomber escort. Later water-injection improved it for lower altitudes. The P-51 had an excellent Packard-built Rolls Royce Merlin engine. Its performance characteristics were very good; it had excellent aerodynamic properties. The Soviet La-5 was a very serious opponent below 3000m. The Yak-3 performed well up to about 3500m. It had plywood wing surfaces, light weight, and low wing loading. Compressed air, rather than hydraulics, operated brakes, undercarriage, flaps, and radiator gills (soap suds could detect a leak). The plywood wing allowed an easy repair on the front lines (p.125). The Hawker Tempest was a very fast aircraft said to be used to shoot down or intercept V-1 flying bombs. The Me262 jet fighter was faster than piston-engined fighters, but was shot down by Mustangs, Thunderbolts, or Tempests; page 129 explains why. The book ends with his last flight in a Dornier 335, the fastest piston-engined airplane. The book contains no index or listing of photographs. Lerche seems to be an ace technician, or trouble-shooter, who concentrated on his job. This book does not have a wide appeal to the general audience."},{"Title":"Firearms curiosa (The firearms classics library)","review":"This classic of the bizarre in firearms design and production is finally back in print after a long time, and is worth the price...if one is into the aberrant, strange and \\"steampunky\\" regarding guns.

Hops were used for centuries before their description by a nun, and gruit, a mixture of herbs and spices used to flavor beer prior to the use of hops, was actually still popular AFTER hops were introduced. Unger doesn't just quote the last \\"beer writer\\" he read when he makes these statements, he cites primary sources, economic records, contemporary correspondence in 60 pages of footnotes and bibliography.The result is a book that brings to life the beginnings of commercial brewing. Brewing went from a household chore to a commercial enterprise during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, built trade empires, influenced civilizations. Unger puts beer in its proper place in European history as an integral keystone of trade, a solid source of cash taxes, and a perfect example of how over-regulation can kill an industry.The striking thing about this book for a student of contemporary brewing is not the techniques, the character of the beer. It is the parallels between beer's rise in this period and beer's revival in the 20th Century. Nothing is new under the sun: there were contract brewers, stunningly hopped beers, hugely successful imports, fad beers that really only changed names, fruit beers, and wild advertising. Today's innovations? Not hardly.Definitely a scholarly work, and tough slogging at times to get through the tax chapters. But full of meat and well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Beer in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance","review":"The title is deceptively simple. Those looking for some sort of popular history of beer may come away disappointed that this book emphasizes primarily the economic history of beer rather than its social aspects. Nor is this book an ode to the drink itself, but rather a tightly focused study of the importance of beer to Medieval/Renaissance economics and trade patterns. Most of its chapters are focused on taxation and trade, with just enough information on the act of brewing itself to interest the lay reader--more than likely, someone with an interest in beer itself. The last couple chapters, on guilds and the decline of beer, get into the cultural aspects.This book is still an important contribution because it (understatedly) discusses how beer has evolved and how its role differs from the leisure and \\"party time\\" image it has now."},{"Title":"Beer in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance","review":"As a lover of history and an interest in life in the middle ages, this book provided a great academic understanding of beer and its influence in Northern Europe.

This is the story of one of Leith and Kess' (the hero and heroine of The Prince of Ill Luck) descendants, Druyan. Druyan is the youngest daughter of a large family and has always done what she is told: she married a much older man, repressed her magical abilities and has resigned herself to being childless. When her husband is killed by the sea raiders, she is suddenly faced with a choice: go back to her family (who will marry her off to someone else) or try and freehold her farm. If she can pay all of the tithes and keep the farm going for a year and a day, the farm is hers. However, all of the men are away fighting for the Duke against the sea raiders and she needs help to run the farm. So she bargains with Kellis, one of raiders captured and imprisoned in the attack on her farm. He agrees to help her in exchange for his freedom. It soon becomes apparent that Kellis has magicial abilities - including the ability to see the future and/or the past. The problem is, he never knows if he is seeing the future or the past and he cannot really control what or when he sees. When Druyan finds out about his abilities, she is skeptical at first. But then Kerris' vision about the attack on her farm comes true. She then urges Kerris to try and &quot;see&quot; when the raiders are coming so she can warn others and keep the sea raiders from conquering her homeland. The legendary Valadan, a wind-sired stallion who can communicate with his rider (if he chooses), whisks Druyan throughout Esdragon to warn the people of incoming danger and plays an integral part in saving the people of Esdragon.I must agree with other reviewers that this title was not as good as The Prince of Ill Luck, the first book in the series. The plot is not especially original: normal person required to do extraordinary things to rescue their country and become a hero, but it is always kind of fun to read this type of story and think that normal people can make a difference. It has a pretty slow, methodical pace until the last 100 pages or so. Kerris and Druyan's relationship was also slow in developing, but love does not always happen at first sight. Still, the country of Esdragon is a fascinating place and it was interesting to see it through a &quot;farmer's&quot; point of view instead of from a Duke's daughter. This gives the reader the opportunity to learn about how to harvest barley, thatch a roof, or weave cloth as opposed to breeding horses, swordfighting and the like.Dexter's strong female characters will please many readers - it is unfortunate that her male characters are not quite as strong and believable. Still, there was good character development and maturation throughout the story. The characters grew in maturity, strength and confidence through the story and seemed like real people. I also enjoyed the different magical abilities of the heroine: the ability to whistle up the wind and storms. The hero is a more traditional magician and can see the future/past and shape-shift. It was nice to see both characters get strong magical abilities instead of just one or the other.If you can only buy one book by Susan Dexter, buy The Prince of Ill Luck, if you can buy this one also, go for it. Just remember that they are very different from one another."},{"Title":"The Wind-Witch (The Warhorse of Esdragon, Book Two)","review":"This book wasn't as much fun as the Prince of Ill Luck, but it was still very enjoyable. The main tension in the story - about a woman struggling to become her own person in a very realistic medieval world - is intriguing. The characters are also well done, a mixture of ambiguious elements. The only problem with the story was that it needed to move faster, the same story could have been told in half the time."},{"Title":"The Wind-Witch (The Warhorse of Esdragon, Book Two)","review":"My opinion of The Wind Witch was that although it was a bit thin, it was a surprising and altogether enjoyable book. The charactors each had distinctive personalities and fears to overcome. I hope the third book will be as entertaining. Jessica Richards; 12"},{"Title":"The Wind-Witch (The Warhorse of Esdragon, Book Two)","review":"Susan Dexter's previous efforts in this series have been excellent. (Perhaps this is why I am so disappointed by this latest effort). Susan possesses excellent characterization skills and an ability to draw the reader in with vivid fantasy description and mythic plots.Unfortunately, The Wind-Witch, suffered from a predictable plot which was weak and repetitive. Minor characters were stereotypical and unbudgingly boring.Main characters Druyan and Kellis, although interesting were predictable and their relationship held no surprises.The Good:Druyan is a refreshingly bright and restrained heroine with a head on her shoulders. She is not so utterly willful as to be irritating.The Bad:More about Valadan... Surely a 80 year old stallion has something more interesting to do than follow Druyan around like a lost puppy.Kellis' constant moping and lack of assertiveness was annoying. I would've liked to see him develop a backbone at least sometime before the end of the book.Constant thread of &quot;Druyan going to warn the forces of good about evil raiders&quot; made we half wish the raiders would succeed in their invasion plans. How many times did she do this anyhow? Wasn't there anything more proactive to be done, other than to wait around for Kellis to predict something?Susan Dexter writes best in an epic 'quest' style fantasy when her characters aren't anchored down to a stationary point.Overall, I'd save your money and read the &quot;Prince of Ill Luck&quot; So far, the best one in the series."},{"Title":"The Wind-Witch (The Warhorse of Esdragon, Book Two)","review":"I've read Ms Dexter since her first book came out and she hasn't lost her talent for quirky characters and wonderful, terrible worlds. I actually like this better than the other Warhorse books. (Incidently, you don't have to read any of the others in order to enjoy the rest of the &quot;trilogy&quot;) This book is full of the reality of farm life before mechanism. More than any of her novels to date, this one reminded me a little of Andre Norton's Witch World series. I wish Ms Dexter would write some more."},{"Title":"The Wind-Witch (The Warhorse of Esdragon, Book Two)","review":"I'd never heard of Susan Dexter when I picked up a used copy of this book at a local store, and I let it sit around for awhile before I started reading it. Now I'm dying to get my hands on everything else she's written. Druyan is a great character, vividly written and very alive. The setting was already unusual enough to be memorable (a plain, ordinary old farm, home to all those _other_ people whom no one ever writes about but who must surely make up the majority of the population of any medievel-based fantasy world) and interesting before Kellis appeared to throw her life for a loop, and remained so throughout the book. Sure, she has the requisite perks of a fantasy heroine--mainly, noble relatives--but Druyan remains a freshly, believably normal woman throughout the book, even when she's doing the extraordinary. And speaking of the extraordinary (I'm not going to spoil the plot), Ms. Dexter writes that pretty well, too. That's what makes this book so pleasantly worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Wind-Witch (The Warhorse of Esdragon, Book Two)","review":"I enjoyedPrince of Ill Luck--the first book in The Warhorse of Esdragon trilogy immensely. Even better, the second book--THE WIND-WITCH--was already out at the time and, when I went back to purchase it, I was surprised to find that it took place several generations later in the same country and the characters from the first tale were the stuff of almost legend in their country now. Many years had passed since Leith followed his princess through hell and high water to make her honor her word to break his curse, and this second book followed a very different heroine. Though the black warhorse Valadin was there having seemingly not aged a day and that made me feel good and like everything would be all right. It's always hard to let go of those characters and friendships that first captured your attention. But, in this case, Susan Dexter's choice was a good one and THE WIND-WITCH is actually my favorite of the three books in the trilogy. Though they are all excellent, this one is the one I re-read regularly. First published in 1994, this series, as is so often the case with these great under-the-radar fantasy titles, this series is now out of print. But used copies are available very inexpensively.Druyan has just buried her husband. And she's not exactly the picture of a grieving widow, though she does find herself at quite a few loose ends. It was an arranged marriage and, though he was much older than she and they had little in common, she finds she misses the company and what conversation they shared. Much of this is swallowed up, though, by her realization that her farm, her land, the only place she's ever felt truly at home will assuredly be taken from her if she cannot hold the farm and keep it producing for a year and a day from the moment her husband Travic died. And so, with a stubborn sense of defiance and nothing but a couple of young girls and an elderly, arthritic cook by her side, Druyan sets out to defend her home and use the laws of the land to her advantage. Then, within the span of a few days, she becomes the unsuspecting owner of an unusually beautiful and mysterious black horse, and she discovers a prisoner named Kellis trussed up in the celler, where her husband must have stashed him without telling her when the sea-faring Errol invaders reached their land last fall. Druyan weighs his threat against her need and decides to force the obviously dazed foreigner into service to help bring in the harvest and, in the process, lets loose a force she has no inkling of. But Druyan herself is not precisely what she seems. And her own powers with the weather, combined with the marvelous horse and the mysterious Kellis, will all be necessary when invasion threatens Esdragon's coast once more.Right away I could tell this book was special. I connected with Druyan immediately and her quiet, strong personality was honestly a relief after the constant stream of vitriol and fire that was Kess in the previous book. Druyan is a weaver of some skill and, at night after working her hands to the point where they're raw, she relaxes in front of the fire and weaves cloaks and blankets and scarves of wonderful color and quality and texture. I, along with Kellis (once he's allowed in the house), watched her in wonder and appreciation at this talent I have little knowledge of or experience with. She reminds me a fair bit of Sorcha in Daughter of the Forest and Claire in Garden Spells because of the determined way she pursues her goals, the way she creates something lovely from such simple ingredients, and the way she is so hesitant--almost afraid--to grasp at the few instances of beauty in her life. I liked getting to know Kellis as well, as Druyan slowly let down her guard around him. He's a disarming beta hero and about as clumsy as a bull in a china shop. He knows nothing of farming or manual labor and Druyan has to teach him everything and bite her tongue when he displays an unusual aversion to cold iron. And it's a good thing she keeps him around despite her numerous misgivings for Kellis does have one ability she does not. And it comes in handy in a most opportune moment, when it seems everything she's worked so hard for will be lost in a moment's thoughtlessness. I love this story. I love the characters and I love the not knowing up to the last page what will happen ending. THE WIND-WITCH is good, solid traditional fantasy in the vein of the early Patricia McKillip books, some of Mercedes Lackey's early stuff, and Jennifer Roberson.Reading Order:Prince of Ill Luck, THE WIND-WITCH, andTrue Knight"},{"Title":"The Wind-Witch (The Warhorse of Esdragon, Book Two)","review":"Druyan has lived her life as the dutiful daughter. Marrying when she was told, putting her talents to the skills deemed 'appropriate' for women. When her husband is unexpectedly killed, Druyan finds herself on a precipice -- submit meekly once again to her uncle, the Duke's, choice of a new husband or keep her loss private and work, work, work for a year and a day proving her holding profitable and become her own master. For once, Druyan follows her heart and chooses the latter. With the help of her meager farm help, her mythical horse Valadan and the unsuspecting raider turned farmhand, Kellis, Druyan begins to make Splaine Garth her own.But Kellis is not simply a wounded foreigner hoping to pay a blood debt by working Druyan's farm. Cursed (or blessed) with the gift of sight, Kellis begins to see warnings of raiders invading Esdragon and even as he warns his Lady not to trust the visions, she is not content to simply do nothing. Each time Kellis scrys a vision of destruction, Druyan rushes off, fleet as the wind on the back of Valadan, to warn the unsuspecting victims. But Kellis cannot find it in himself to let his Lady ride off alone, unprotected, and their headlong flights bring unwanted scrutiny when they want it the least.Heavens above, I think I fell in love with this one wholeheartedly from the very first sentence. First of all, it's full of lovely writing with a sloooow buildup of tension that I found myself all but gripping the pages in earnest concern as Druyan hurled herself into harms way time and again. Susan Dexter is such a wonderful storyteller. Truly. Her detailed passages of daily farm life contrasted against the looming threat of war never failed to thrust me right into the moment. Each sentence seemed to be crafted with such a loving touch that I wanted to mull over each word individually and digest them slowly.Druyan has something of the wild wind within her (as you can gather from the title) but it has been battered down so thoroughly all her life, that the gradual loosening she allows was pure magic. Her quiet determination to save her farm, her friends, even her country utterly entranced me as I was constantly awed by her courage and loyalty. Under Kellis' careful and watchful eye, she becomes a woman of her own making and I loved every minute of it. I cannot recommend this treasure heartily enough and you better believe I've got the rest of the series already queued up in the TBR pile."},{"Title":"The Wind-Witch (The Warhorse of Esdragon, Book Two)","review":"I'd never heard of Susan Dexter when I picked up a used copy of this book at a local store, and I let it sit around for awhile before I started reading it.

It is fresh and new, with interesting charactors. The begining of the book is so well written, that even if Kellis hadn't seen the raders at the gate, and if the book just continued with the events of the farm, it still would have turned out to be a five star novel. As it is, with Kellis' gift (I won't give it away) there is fast paced action, and many interesting events. I really liked the ending too. Great work!"},{"Title":"The Wind-Witch (The Warhorse of Esdragon, Book Two)","review":"The Wind-Witch is Druyan, whose life as a farmer's wife has been fairly ordinary aside from the small fact of her ability to whistle up a wind or redirect a storm. This ability she has kept quiet, even from her husband, magic not being terribly well looked-upon. The only other extraordinary aspect to this simple and good life is the rather small black horse Druyan discovered one day; as no one came forward to claim him, he was, by default, hers, and whatever she suspects about his extreme uniqueness is, again, kept to herself. It is, of course, Valadan, immortal Warhorse of Esdragon (\\"of course\\" because the book is \\"The Warhorse of Esdragon, Book 2'), and he is anything but ordinary.\\"Ordinary\\" is turned upside-down when the sea raiders begin to come, killing and plundering as sea raiders always do, and the local lord calls for troops - including Druyan's husband - to try to fend them off. In shockingly short order, Druyan is widowed, left alone with a tiny group of very young and very old female servants to try to maintain the farm - and to do something about the wounded raider, Kellis, her husband captured and locked in the root cellar just before he left. In many ways it turns out just as well that of the several raiders who were put in there only Kellis remains - the others dug their way out and left him to die. But he didn't die, and though he might find death preferable to surviving as Druyan's prisoner and indentured servant, he heals. Trust slowly, cautiously grows between them as she discovers that, in many more ways than one, he is not your typical raider.This could have been the setup for a completely generic fantasy romance - but it was written by Susan Dexter, and that is not what Susan Dexter does. (Did.) The trust between the two of them is hard won, and goes little further - the elderly woman servant certainly never trusts Kellis as far as she would a rabid dog. But all he wants is to fulfill his obligation to Druyan, work out the year they agreed upon which will help her keep the farm, and then leave for parts unknown. All Druyan wants is to keep her farm and see peace return to the countryside. It's frequently doubtful that either of them will get their wishes.As always, Valadan is beautifully drawn. And as always, so are the humans; they evade the usual pigeonholes fantasy characters have a tendency to slot into, and give every indication that they have full and complete lives before, after, and beyond what the story tells. The story is (as always) excellently well told, with unexpected twists and turns and a perfectly satisfying ending. It's yet another reason to mourn the lack of books by Susan Dexter over the last ten years."},{"Title":"The Wind-Witch (The Warhorse of Esdragon, Book Two)","review":"This is one of my favorite books, for its sheer storytelling.

Druyan and Kellis are both so real. Who hasn't fought with themselves over becoming what is expected of you and what's true in your heart.

I'm certain to begin book 3 tomorrow."},{"Title":"The Wind-Witch (The Warhorse of Esdragon, Book Two)","review":"Susan Dexter has written a thrilling novel which does not stick to the normal cliches in the genre. Though the story's setting is a fantastic world and the magic in form of the horse Valadan and Druyan's and Kellis' abilities plays a key-role, the detailed description of the surroundings make the reader feel as if the country of Darlith was just around the corner and one could just look out of the window and see them. By describing each charakters fears and weaknesses as well as the good traits of charakter, she makes them appear very real. The none-main-charakters arent treated marginal, but also interestingly described. Sometimes I even had to make up my mind wether to like or dislike a person. The real nature of some of the charakters isn't revealed at once when they appear. Kellis for example seems to be a pirate first, and his origin and aims are told to the reader step by step. All in all, &quot;The Wind-Witch&quot; is the most surprising fantasy book I've read this year.

While it WAS great for traveling and seemed to keep my 1 year old son mildly entertained, I only give the book two stars.My beef with the book is that the descriptions of the babies don't really match their expressions. For example, the picture that says \\"happy\\" shows a baby who looks a bit nervous and really isn't smiling. And many of the children look like they were hot and crying when their pictures were taken (they have flushed cheeks and worried looks on their faces). The title of the book, \\"Happy Baby Faces\\", isn't really fitting.Bottom line - I've seen other baby picture books that do a much better job than this one.

It is in fact far more than that, and French-speaking singers will find his suggestions for interpretation, tempo, expression and dynamics to be invaluable. He has an unerring instinct for when a song merits a few general comments for its interpretation and when it calls for a detailed phrase-by-phrase analysis. His choice of repertoire for inclusion in this relatively compact book is surprisingly comprehensive. Particularly useful are his suggestions for when to use the liaison (final consonants being sounded before a word that begins with a vowel, which happens more frequently in poetic language than in normal speech) and when not to. Liaisons are not always intuitive or obvious, even to those who were born and brought up in French."},{"Title":"The Interpretation of French Song","review":"What a wonderful and insightful book this is!

When first published Blish basically started with what fans voted as the most popular episodes and eventually worked his way through the show's three seasons. However, for the 25th Anniversary editions the adaptations were reorganized so that there were not only three volumes, each representing an entire season. Therefore, \\"Star Trek: The Classic Episodes, Volume 2\\" represents the second season in 1967-68.The volume includes an introduction by D.C. Fontana, and the prefaces that Blish wrote for his original paperbacks, along with an essay on \\"The Transcendatal Vision\\" by David Gerrold, whose classic episode \\"The Trouble With Tribbles\\" is from the second season. The episodes are arranged in order of their television appearance: \\"Amok Time,\\" \\"Who Mourns for Adonais?\\" \\"The Changeling,\\" \\"Mirror, Mirror,\\" \\"The Apple,\\" \\"The Doomsday Machine,\\" \\"Catspaw,\\" \\"Metamorphosis,\\" \\"Journey to Babel,\\" \\"Friday's Child,\\" \\"The Deadly Years,\\" \\"Obsession,\\" \\"Wolf in the Fold,\\" \\"The Trouble With Tribbles,\\" \\"The Gamesters of Triskelion,\\" \\"A Piece of the Action,\\" \\"The Immunity Syndrome,\\" \\"A Private Little War,\\" \\"Return to Tomorrow,\\" \\"Patterns of Force,\\" \\"By Any Other Name,\\" \\"The Omega Glory,\\" \\"The Ultimate Computer,\\" \\"The Paradise Syndrome,\\" \\"Bread and Circuses,\\" and \\"Assignment: Earth.\\"Blish was a well-known science fiction author, who has won the Hugo Award for his novel \\"A Case of Conscience,\\" and what he brought to these adaptations was a great ability to flesh out both the characters and the actions. In many ways these adaptations hold up better than the original episodes, where the special effects are considerably less than what an eight-year-old can do on a home computer today. But throughout Blish shows an understanding of both the characters and the Star Trek universe that was being created, which explains why he was also the author of the first \\"Star Trek\\" original novel, \\"Spock Must Die!\\"I have fond memories of Blish's adaptations because in these primitive days before even videotape let alone DVDs, the only way to watch \\"Star Trek\\" was if the series was in syndicaton in your neck of the woods. Even then, you had to catch the episodes when they were on. I still have my four hardback volumes collecting all of \\"The Star Trek Reader\\" volumes, with Funky Winkerbean \\"Star Trek\\" inspired cartoons pasted on the inside of the covers. Adapting television episodes into short stories is certainly a lost art, but James Blish was one of its master practioners."},{"Title":"Star Trek: The Classic Episodes, Vol. 2 - The 25th-Anniversary Editions","review":"Probably the best episodes of the 3 seasons are in this the second season e.g. \\"Amok Time\\", \\"Wolf In the Fold\\", \\"The Trouble With Tribbles\\", \\"Journey to Babel\\" and many more and yet we get here very well-written stories that although are not exactly the same as the episodes themselves, we get a greater understanding of what's happening because of the greater details.

Some terrific passages about our celebrity driven culture and our &quot;remoteness.&quot; Some of the book is hilarious, some it is sad.

Autobiography or allegory or both, this book is unlike anything you have read or will read. It deserves another life back in print."},{"Title":"Remote","review":"In &quot;Remote&quot;, David Shields tells his own story through the printed and recorded parts of America. One of Shields' central themes is the difference between life and virtual-life: major events in his memory are linked directly to some form of media. His story is based on &quot;almost fame,&quot; or as a frequent title explains, &quot;the nimbus of her fame makes a nullity of us all.&quot; The idea of media remoteness is explored in amazingly honest detail, often with humor and a delicious taste of irony at the ridiculous. Through his obsession with &quot;the filmed familiar,&quot; Oprah, America's Funniest Home Videos, and anecdotes too numerous to mention, Mr. Shields' essays capture the confusion and separateness that America feels at the power of its entertainment industry. This book is a must for anyone who claims to be media-savvy or enjoys a concise, entertaining and intelligent autobiography. There isn't much that this book doesn't cover, but much more impressive is the advice that it manages to suggest. As Mr. Shields' observations add another dimension to your understanding of this world, you'll find yourself underlining and circling while smiling drily."},{"Title":"Remote","review":"This book will be of interest to those who notice the little things in life, the things that are hard to miss but always get looked over. Saying what people want to say but may be too afraid to, Shields' book is bold and truthful about the world. The minute detail that instances of his own past and the cultural past of America that are investigated in this book are thought-provoking. A book that anyone could relate to, &quot;Remote&quot; points out the absurdity of everyday life. The everyday things that we all notice but don't quite register are here in this American critique. A book for anyone who has a family, is American, is a subject of humanity will relate to and revel in this insightful quest for resolution, and feel comfort in the fact that we are not alone."},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Knock-Knock Jokes for Kids","review":"I ordered this book for my 7 year old grandson.

Celine Arneaux, a renowned photographer of Chinese and French ancestry, is the would-be matriarch, although she feels little connection to her daughter Sumin, only slightly more to her granddaughter Cam. The three women agree to meet at a cabin in Virginia for the benefit of Apertures magazine, which wants to celebrate the famous photos Celine took of Cam at the site. Cam brings along Alice, the six year old daughter of a Chinese friend, who evokes emotions and desires in the adult women as they struggle to claim her as their own.Shepard writes with simple precision, with exact and memorable details that give this book life; however, the emotional exploration - the stripping away of the outer layers of each character - gives AN EMPIRE OF WOMEN its depth. The mixed racial backgrounds of the women (Cam, for example, has Chinese, French, and Japanese blood) serves as a metaphor for their complicated and often contradictory lives. The closer the women get to the truth about themselves, the more powerful this book becomes. Issues about Communist China and the politics of art further define this story.Although the natural audience for this novel is women, anyone with an interest in human relations, the politics of art, and good literature should find this a rewarding read."},{"Title":"AN Empire of Women","review":"In this stunning debut offering, author Karen Shepherd tells the story of three very strange, alienated and ultimately cruel women. Celine Arneux, famed photographer -- her daughter Sumin -- and granddaughter Cameron are connected by blood only.Forget the warm and cozy relationships of Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club. These three women of Chinese heritage are more akin to Madame Mao.Celine is now retired and living in her beloved Paris. Sumin and her lover Grady live in the states, as do Cameron and her ward, the 6-year old Alice. The four females agree to meet at a cabin in Virginia where Celine took provocative photos of Cameron when she was a child.Not one relationship in this family is healthy or based on any kind of true respect for its circle. Celine is aloof and cruel to her daughter. Sumin resents the one-time relationship her mother had with Cameron and has never really found her way in the world. Cameron boils over with anger at grandmother for taking such intimate photos of her and at her mother for allowing the photos to be taken. There are so many unresolved issues in this book that one needs a scorecard to keep up with them all.Add to this caldron of raw anger and emotional immaturity the fate of the young Alice, whose mother has been forced to return to China without her. Each of the three women -- Celine, Sumin and Cameron -- wants to raise Alice and the battle over her future becomes bloody and extremely brutal.An Empire of Women at once riveted and repulsed me. Although the author does an excellent job of telling the story, the subject matter and its devastation were a bit too much for my taste. The only character who truly evoked sympathy was Celine's Chinese mother -- and my heart broke for her on almost every page.I look forward to other work from this author. She's got a voice and a gift -- my wish is that she finds something lighter to write about next time around. This story just wore me out."},{"Title":"AN Empire of Women","review":"Had Artaud been a novelist, he might have written a book like Empire of Women.Mannered, orderly, intensely cruel, this stunning debut novel depicts three generations of women, all single daughters of mothers who never married. The ghostly presence of a fourth woman, the great-grandmother, pervades the book. The deceased Huying, grandmother Celine, mother Sumin, granddaughter Cameron, plus Sumin's journalist lover Grady and six-year-old Alice, daughter of Cameron's best friend, spend a week together at their family cabin in Virginia, ostensibly in order to allow Grady to write a retrospective article about Celine's photography. In reality, the visit's purpose is to decide Alice's fate. Forced to return to China when her student visa ran out, Alice's mother left Alice in Cameron's care, believing that her daughter would be better off in America. While the choice of Cameron as a care-giver makes this a dubious proposition, it is Alice's presence that precipitates revolution in this aptly-titled Empire.Celine, rich, self-absorbed, famous imagier, of Franco-Chinese descent, rules her empire with an absolute hand, through cruelty, psychological manipulation, and control of the purse strings. Only her granddaughter, Cameron, subject of Celine's famous books of photographs, has ever escaped her grasp. Somehow, at twelve, Cameron's magic disappeared, and Celine has not taken a photograph since then. The woman in the middle, Sumin, Celine's daughter and Cameron's mother, has spent her life waiting, hovering, constantly in the shadow of her famous mother. Just one example shows exactly how dysfunctional this group of women is. Celine, angered by a minor infraction of an eight-year-old Sumin's, locks Sumin in a darkroom. Sumin retaliates by chopping everything she can lay her hands on into bits, by flushing all the photographic chemicals down the sink, and by destroying film, negatives, and prints. This incident is cited as proof, not of Celine's abuse of her daughter, but as an indication of Sumin's &quot;true disturbance.&quot;The case of Cameron, the subject of Celine's odd, semi-erotic, provocative, and stunning photographs, is far darker. &quot;The first time I felt a man put his fingers inside of me, it was like watching someone look through one of our books,&quot; she tells Celine. &quot;You gave me to anyone who wanted to look.&quot; Later she says, &quot;I can't get myself back.&quot; Yet Cameron's hope for salvation through Alice is just as selfish as Celine's exploitation of Cameron, for Cameron (as Celine points out) is not thinking of the child's welfare, but only of her own.The cultural dismissal of women is a constant subtext throughout the book. Lest anyone believe, since Chinese women are no longer forced to bind their feet, that modern attitudes have conquered oppression, let me recount a true incident. My husband's grandfather wrote the history and ancestry of the Yuan family out for us in English. My son's name is part of this document, but not my daughter's, since she will not be a considered part of the bloodline after she marries. In Empire of Women, Celine gives a piece of jade that should have been passed only to a son, to Alice. Is it a gesture of recognition that the historically poor status of women is changing? Perhaps. Every motivation in Empire is suspect. Every gesture is layered with meaning. This book is an outstanding achievement, and we can only hope for more books from a phenomenal writer.Read more reviews about women's books at BooksForWomen, an Amazon.com associate site."},{"Title":"AN Empire of Women","review":"Renowned photographer Celine Arneux reached the epitome of fame with her controversial pictures of her family. The collection includes a provocative set of photos of her granddaughter Cameron as a child. Now the wheels of fate have turned. Grady, the lover of Sumin, the middle generation between Celine and Cameron, is doing a magazine article on the celebrated artist and her work. The three women agree to meet in the Virginia cabin site of Celine's most famous work.Also at the cabin is six-year old Alice, whose guardian is Cameron. The three women, whose relationships between each other are poor, use the child as a battlefield as they battle to gain Alice's affection and the right to claim victory. Any deep reconciliation could mean heartbreak so the child is the pawn and the salvation in this emotional war.If the reader wants action, they need to pass on AN EMPIRE OF WOMEN. However, if the fan desires a deep look into the emotions of three mixed raced women, this novel is for them. The prime cast is all fully developed and each one's feelings understandable since Karen Shepard deftly peels away their feelings through their actions towards one another and especially towards the child. Alice serves as a final chance at redemption or a final failure. Ms. Shepard will leave her admiring audience to question the impact of his or her heritage.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"AN Empire of Women","review":"Talk about a seriously hostile look at familial relationships between women! Disturbing, to be sure, but well-written and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"AN Empire of Women","review":"This book had so much going for it, but I wanted it to be more than it was. The author's writing skills are magnificent. The relationships between the three generations as well as the two outside characters are complex. There is a lot of rich material here including Chinese thought and symbolism I especially found the grandmother's story and interior dialogue sequences compelling. The daughter and granddaughter never fully materialized for me even though there was a lot of dialogue and angst expressed by everyone, as if to spell out the meaning. I found some explanation for the characters' motivation but not entirely and not satisfying enough. I kept waiting for each &quot;ah-ha&quot; moment, and there were many, for it to all make sense, but it never did. Also, the injection of the little girl Alice into the family picture, while supposed to be the key to the family's deliverance, seemed gratuitous. All in all, this is a talented effort that ultimately does not deliver."},{"Title":"AN Empire of Women","review":"Karen Shepard creates an intriguing triad of women, united by images, dreams, and the spoils of unfulfilled dreams.

Accompanied by Celine's daughter Sumin, and Cameron's would-be adopted daughter Alice, the women engage in a week of simmering tension and hidden secrets and ambitions.Shepard's style is graceful and full of the chiaroscuro that she evokes in the legacy of Celine's photography. Her descriptions are lifelike, and the emotions of her characters are palpable.

The other two were not fleshed out enought to illicit any real feelings for them (the grandmother (Celine) at best two dimensional through her historied past - the daughter (Cameron) simply a narcissistic brat.Perhaps I don't understand the Chinese mind well enough to appreciate the strange stinginess of these characters souls..."},{"Title":"AN Empire of Women","review":"Maybe I'm thick but please somebody explain to me how the reviews I read before buying this book are of this tripe.

Morgan to Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey","review":"\\"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\\" George SantayanaSantayana has much to answer for. Heeding his warning not too wisely but too well, the acolytes of the cult of history have combed through the past to find exemplars for the future. Plundering the words and deeds of Patton, Lincoln, even Machiavelli, authors and readers have shaken the Magic 8-Ball of history and received glib prophecies, anticontextual anecdotes accepted as dogma - he did this then, so you should do this now. Sincere though their form of flattery may be, imitators rob themselves of history's true pleasures; when instruction usurps interpretation, students look to the past only for lessons, exercises, and guarantees.H. W. Brands understands. Informative, enlightening, inspiring, Masters of Enterprise never loses sight of a crucial purpose - entertainment. His proposition is simple: give him eight or twelve pages at a time, and he'll give you a birth-to-death biography that is clear, accurate, empathetic, and blessedly free of hero worship. Give him room for twenty-five such accounts, and he'll give you the history of American business.And what an amazing history it is. Vanderbilt, Carnegie, Walton, Claiborne, Gates - this is a tale of monopoly and philanthropy, robber barons and inventors, salesmen and celebrities. The heroes and the scoundrels act side by side on this stage, frequently interchangeably. Brands knows the perils of the Great Man Theory of History, and he never claims that these twenty-five were solely responsible for the successes of American capitalism. But he does leave the reader marveling at the vision, audacity, perseverance, and even luck of business giants past and present.Obsessive autodidacts will want more from Masters of Enterprise - an overarching model of leadership, perhaps, or a prescriptive and distorting conclusion on the Seven Stages of Becoming Ted Turner. Brands sensibly rejects this approach, recognizing that true history doesn't have the answers in the back. Masters of Enterprise is a fascinating book. Those who cannot remember the past should be compelled to reread it."},{"Title":"Masters of Enterprise: Giants of American Business from John Jacob Astor and J.P.

Extraordinarily successful businessmen may have the same basic character traits as their fellow men (and women) but often in more extreme forms. Some of these traits are admirable: ambitious, industrious, driven, resilient, clever. Some, not so much: greedy, cruel, ruthless, opportunistic, dishonest.Don't count on Brands to notice the latter in his subjects. H.W.

Morgan to Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey","review":"H.W. Brands' Masters of Enterprises devotes each of his 25 brief, but enjoyable chapters to a successful entrepreneur. I particularly like this book because the author recognizes the importance of the individual in building a business dynasty. Tragically, this recognition is very rare from many business historians today who seem more interested in focusing on the post-retirement philanthropic activities of many great industrialists as opposed to the prodigious effort which was required to first accumulate the wealth.This book contains great chapters on all of the well known productive geniuses of the U.S. Industrial Revolution, including the following: John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, J. P. Morgan, Henry Ford and Cornelius Vanderbilt.One of the great values from this book is that it contains a satisfying amount of material on several important and often unsung heroes in business history. This includes, but is not limited to:* Ray Kroc: The man who turned the McDonalds' franchise into the world's most recognizable fast food empire.* Robert Woodruff: The man who made the Coca-Cola logo the world's most recognizable logo.* Alfred Sloan: The man who built up General Motors to defeat the Ford Motor Company as the most dominant automobile manufacturer in the United States.* Sam Walton: The man who turned Walmart into the retail giant that it is today.* Andy Grove: The man who made Intel.* Henry Kaiser: A true renaissance industrialist. He built the Hoover dam, the Bonneville Dam, innovated cement manufacturing, reduced the construction time of cargo ships during WWII to five days (when they previously required 30 days!), and even developed Waikiki beach into a resort.* H. L. Hunt: discoverer and innovator of oil drilling in East Texas. Unfortunately, he also crippled the industry by lobbying for more government regulation.The main downside of this book is that I think the mix of entrepreneurs covered could have been more interesting. For one, James J. Hill, the great empire builder of the Northwestern Railroads, is conspicuously absent. For example, if it were up to me, I would have added chapters on James J. Hill, E. H. Harriman*, Warren Buffett, Herbert Dow and C.J.

His purpose is to show the historical development of how Americans have made money in a country where the making of wealth has became almost a divine calling.Brands' selection of business giants could have been better. He seems to have picked his membership more for their diversity as people than for their masterful entrepreneurial skills. Why include Berry Gordy, but not Warren Buffett?

He's also sensitive to the larger issues raised by these stories of entrepreneurs. Oddly enough, something more than money explains their motivation. While American business is based on the dynamic of the individual, self-made entrpreneur, the irony is that they are motivated by a pre-capitalist sense of calling and perfectionism. They are not the profit-maximizers hypothesized by capitalist economists.And Brands touches on the supreme irony of America, which consists of the tension between all-men-are-created-equal ethic of the Declaration of Independence and constitutional political system and the inequality-of-wealth-and-talent ethic of the capitalist business system. Cynics would say that the some-men-are-more-equal-than-others ethic of the economic system trumps and subverts the equality-based ethic of the political system.

I can't say enough about how much I revel in these brief , yet brilliant works. Sandition brought me the light read and humour I desperately needed after the meatier books I last dove into.Sandition, is the name of a new beach resort village in its coming of age. Because it is a relatively unknown area in need of new residents, travelers and reputable people-the then local entrepreneur, Tom Parker, starts up the story on a tour in search of a physician for his new community. Along the way (and due to a small injury) he must stop for help in a town - and lucky for him, the people are very welcoming and readily available for help. Mr. Parker and his wife, appreciating the warmth and kindness of these accidental hosts, as a gesture of appreciation, offer to take the daughter of Mr. Heywood (the main man who helped and hosted them) a Miss Charlotte Heywood, back with them as a guest in their home in Sandition.Charlotte is the heroine of this story and everything is pretty much seen through her eyes. In Sandition we meet such colourful characters as the very rich, elderly and twice-widowed, Lady Denham; her niece and nephew by her second husband, her cousin Clara- a beautiful and demure young lady. But- the funniest of all characters are Mr. Parker's siblings who have endless ailments (all of them purel y made up). One of these, Diane (Parker's sister) is on a mission to \`fill up' the town and in doing so, she is constantly busy and bustling around , leaving Charlotte to wonder if the illness isn't but an act.Sadly (for me), the story ends abruptly with the arrival into Sandition, of the dashing Mr. Sidney, Parker's brother . I say sadly because I was just getting into it- just when the characters started coming together for the meshing of a story line...Sandition has got me wondering how this one could have turned out. The characters are delightful and true to Austen's originality and good sense of build up to a story that would surely have become another of her great masterpieces. It also saddens me to think that it was during this very year of writing Sandition that Jane Austen passed away."},{"Title":"Handbook of Psychological Assessment","review":"Groth-Marnat's Handbook of Psychological Assessment has been a great book in all of its editions.

Really good to read.-Thomas Scheuer"},{"Title":"Memoirs of an infantry officer","review":"Continuing tale of the Cambridge-educated English Officer living the hell of warfare on the Western Front: replete with adoring batman, blustering colonel Blimps, out of control colonials (Australians and Canadians), journeys to England on home leave to meet misinformed civilians. Sasson has a style that waxes between light and lyrical, cynical and dark and starkly realistic. It is reminiscent of Graves but less dark than Blunden.This is a tale of the human mind (an upper crust mind) that makes the journey from old world to that of the lost generation -- but Sassoon never loses himself. It shows that the mind-set was already there capable of dissecting and throwing away the old world view tradition. With capable honesty Sassoon relates the contradictions in life, army and mind set of the pre-war generation. He still takes advantage of the liesure of the educated class; his batman pours his tea, he still sees the colonials as slightly quaint and backwards (especially the Australians), still finds refuge among his educated Cambridge intellectuals -- this is no tale of class struggle.This book can read as part of his trilogy lifestyle or on its own.

Sassoon, of course, was a war hero on the battle of the Somme, decorated twice for bravery.The book reads lyrically and is convey's nicely the daily life of soldiers moving back and forth from the front fighting trenches to the rear area of the battle field. He also does a great job portraying the strangeness and inner conflict of being back in British society (while recovering from illness) with people who know nothing of the war or its cost to the participants.A Brit's version of \\"All Quiet ...\\""},{"Title":"Memoirs of an infantry officer","review":"\\"Memoirs of an Infantry Officer\\" by Siegfried Sassoon is certainly one of the classic pieces of literature to have emerged from the Great War. It is above all a work of literature; though it does have lengthy sections describing life in the trenches it is a book beyond the typical memoir of war. Of all the books I've read Sassoon is perhaps the most articulate and schooled man to have placed his experience on the page, albeit in a semi-fictionalized format. This places his work in a strange and unique category between novelized fiction and combat memoir.Sassoon's decision to displace his own experience onto a fictional character is an interesting one. It is a literary device that is quite common to writers who draw on autobiography to create a story that weaves fiction and reality in a seamless way. This choice can serve many purposes; I would assume in Sassoon's case that he was able to voice some inner conflict and doubt concerning the war's progress and management without pinning those thoughts directly to his person. Throughout the tale Sassoon's character George Sherston displays a subtle and subversive sarcasm towards his involvement in the war and the senselessness of its carnage. At the story's conclusion, this manifests itself without disguise as Sherston entertains the notion of speaking out against the war in a public forum. I can only assume that these were thoughts that the author himself had, but due to a sense of propriety never fully acted out on them. In that way the stories' ending presents an alternate reality for Sassoon. I am not fully aware of the author's biography so I am unable to say for certain where reality ends and fiction begins, but I would assume that the combat narrative is close to reality, while the ending is a departure from it.Sassoon's story begins as the narrator is pulled from the line in spring of 1916 and sent to an Officer's Training School in France. This begins the main pattern for the book which juxtaposes life in the trenches with the relative freedom of time behind the lines. His writing in these chapters of down time is quite beautiful. It is clear that despite Sassoon's typical English obligation to serve his country, his temperament is not suited for the ugly reality of World War I (though so few men were). The tone for the book is established in the very first pages as it is obvious that the author has a genuine talent for written language as there is poetry in even sentence.As spring turns to summer Sherston participates in the epic Somme offensive. Again, without knowledge of Sassoon's actual war record I do not know if the narrator's experience is a direct reflection of the author's, but I would think it safe to say that it is a close approximation. I was a little disappointed by the nature of combat segments; his writing is so powerful but it seems that his unit is perpetually in \\"reserve\\" and thus the reader does not get a real description of the war's harshness. I found his language to be excellent, but there is a slightly reticent nature to it that removes the reader from the hard truth. That is not to say that the misery and hardship is not expressed, but rather is veiled behind clever writing as is the nature of Sassoon's true experience.Sherston develops some sort of illness (which is never really clarified) during the summer and leaves the lines before his battalion experienced horrendous losses in the latter weeks of the Somme offensive. It is quite clear that despite a solid record in the combat zone, Sherston is in no hurry to return to it as his introspective and peaceful nature takes hold away from the front. Somehow he does not return until early 1917 before receiving a wound in a trench raid. Once again he avoids the epic battles that defined the Western Front. The book ends in a interesting way, as Sherston ponders futility and shell shock."},{"Title":"Memoirs of an infantry officer","review":"MEMOIRS OF AN INFANTRY OFFICER is the second volume of Siegfried Sassoon's \\"Sherston Trilogy\\" - the mostly autobiographical series of memoir-novels he wrote detailing his youth in Edwardian England, his coming-of-age in the trenches of the Western Front during The Great War, and the conflicted life he led in the years following it. Although the books are not very well-known in the United States, they are penetrating accounts of a world which is totally extinct but - if the success of \\"Downton Abbey\\" is any indication - still holds a peculiar fascination for English-speakers everywhere.The first book in the trilogy, MEMOIRS OF A FOX-HUNTING MAN, is a finely painted picture of what Oliver Edwards called \\"the lazy country-house life\\" of prewar England: a life of fox-hunting, horse-racing, cricket, pipe tobacco, port wine, expensive clothes, debutante balls, gardening, and snobbery. Indeed, if the book has a serious flaw, it is the relentless shallowness and triviality of \\"George Sherston's\\" life. An orphan raised by a well-to-do but dotty aunt, he spends every waking moment worried about appearances, social positioning, and how many trophy cups he has in his study; by the time World War One comes around to wrench him out of his life of genteel indolence and fling him into the mud of Flanders, the reader is a bit weary of this selfish manchild. And yet by the time MEMOIRS OF AN INFANTRY OFFICER opens, George Sherston is quite a different bloke. At 28 years old, he has finally come to grasp a horrible fact: that the world he left, and is ostensibly defending from the Germans, is finished regardless of the war's outcome. This realization is his first step toward maturity, and in a sense that is what this book is about: the belated transformation of a venal, callow, fox-hunting boy into a man who at first embraces and then bitterly rejects the war which has made him a hero.Like its predecessor, INFANTRY OFFICER is written in a meticulous, thorough, gentle English prose which is often slow but always attractive. Sassoon was a deeply thoughtful man, and relates the horror, indignity and black humor of war in a measured way which may disappoint those looking for a \\"hot lead and cold steel\\" battle story. At first enthusiastic about combat, he slowly comes to misgive and resent the civilians for whom he is fighting, as well as his blundering superiors and the British government. Called a hero for his exploits in No Man's Land, he begins to suspect that his heroism is being put to sinister ends. Convalescing from injuries back in England, he is jarred by the bloodthirsty, callous, exploitative, selfish attitude of those he left behind. No one understands what is going on at the front, and many do not care, so long as the champagne at the Savoy is still flowing. In one of the book's most effecting moments, he is even told by one of the titled snobs he used to admire that since he is not an heir to a great name, his death in battle would be no great loss. In another, when he decides to come out against the war, his close friend David Cromlech (alias Robert Graves, later the author of GOOD-BYE TO ALL THAT and I, CLAUDIUS) informs him the government will shut him up in an insane asylum rather than give him the satisfaction of a court-martial. The destruction of all of his youthful ideals is painfully recorded, along with the futile assaults on the German wire and the deaths of his close friends and comrades. We sense, amidst all the gas and shell-fire, that it is not so much George Sherston's old self which is passing away, so much as the illusions of the Edwardian era. George Sherston the fox-hunting boy would never dare publicly question the war...but what about George Sherston, the man?It's true that the book is not perfect. Sassoon is a gifted writer and a very intelligent man, but he is not a master storyteller. In addition to its occasional sluggishness, Sassoon never once mentions the poetry which he published throughout the war and which made him somewhat famous even before his well-publicized struggle with the British Army began - a notable omission, especially since Sassoon's fame as a poet is largely the pivot on which the third act of his real-life story turned.What's more, a thread of conflict runs throughout the entire book: Sassoon is clearly embittered by what he sees in the war, but is constantly qualifying every criticism he makes of society and his superiors, as if the etiquette he learned as a boy prevents him from venting his true feelings. The British use the phrase \\"he never lets rip\\" to describe a man with too much self-control, and this appellation fits Sassoon rather well. However, these flaws are largely canceled out by what he does well: description, character sketches, interior monologue, and - let's face it - prose-writing for the sheer joy of putting words together in an agreeable way. A very different book than its predecessor, INFANTRY OFFICER is still visibly cut from the same cloth. The arc of George Sherston's journey through life continues, and while each book can be regarded as a stand-alone piece, together they make for a very satisfying journey."},{"Title":"Memoirs of an infantry officer","review":"Siegfreid Sassoon's wonderful war memoir is thinly disguised as the story of George Sherston. Based solely on Sassoon's life in the trenches of WWI, it recounts the horror and scale of carnage that occurred. More importantly it shows the emotionally scars that the survivors carried with them as a result of exposure.Sherston (Sassoon) was a rather spoiled and pampered young upper class Englishman. The war changed all that. Confronted with death, destruction and idiotic leadership from the High Command you sense the inner turmoil of Sherston.Relieved when he is not involved with the fighting he is driven by guilt over the loss of the soldiers in his battalion. Consequently when his platoon is on the line he takes great risks in reconaissance of the German positions.The effects of non-stop total war, stupid leadership and the complete contrast between England and the trenches (only a few hundred miles apart) is staggering to Sassoon. Sassoon becomes anti-war and considers becoming an objector, but his obvious connection to his comrades and loyalty to them wins out in the end. He hates the war but won't abandon his comrades in the field.This is a great war memoir written by a poet who survived and was changed for life by his experiences in it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of an infantry officer","review":"I already knew Siegfried from his poetry. Little did I know or suspect what a madman he was on the battlefield. Makes the poetry read a bit differently. He led raid after raid (and voluntarily!), possibly hurling more havoc and grenades on the enemy than any other single soldier. Luckily he was on our side. Toward the end of the war this highly decorated soldier begins to have his doubts about the madness of it all but few practiced it with more gusto. I first read about his heroics in Graves' Goodbye to All That(which is another excellent war memoir,&amp; which also features a strange meeting at Oxford with that other legend you have probably heard of, T.E. Lawrence), both books will give you the war experience from the insiders who lived it. I would make a quick mention of the best war book of them all All Quiet on The Western Front but you read that already I'm certain, as well as that gem by Hemingway A Farewell to Arms. Graves and Sasson belong in that company.....Ghastly dawn with vaporous coasts/Gleams desolate along the sky, night's misery ended.(from Sassoon poem &quot;Wirers&quot;)"},{"Title":"Memoirs of an infantry officer","review":"Even if you are not a student of history or the First World War this is an interesting read. Sassoon paints pictures with his words which not only perfectly describe his surroundings but also give the reader a unique glimpse into the mind of a man suffering, yet unable to help those around him.This book is important historically not only because it is a first-hand account of almost the whole of The Great War, but because it is a record of a psuedo-successful personal revolt against the British Military establishment, as well as giving the reader the author's experiences with meeting some very famous people, including winston churchill."},{"Title":"Memoirs of an infantry officer","review":"This book, along with Robert Graves' &quot;Goodbye to all that&quot; are simply the best combat memoirs ever written by officers. Horror is mundane, desultory; selflessness is the literal order of the day. Yet senior officers are lost in form as always. Even better both men served in the same division, although never together, and even better yet, were prewar friends. This book is Sassoon's answer to Graves' book, and I don't believe anyone can feel the full impact of the mindless brutality on the Western Front without reading both. These books convince me that the Western Front was a lot like Vietnam without end, the years came and went... and Sassoon became an accomplished killer for God and King."},{"Title":"Memoirs of an infantry officer","review":"While perhaps best known for his poetry written during WWI, Siegfried Sassoon was a very talented wordsmith in general, a trait that is demonstrated in his second semi-fictionalized autobiography, \\"Memoirs of an Infantry Officer\\". Sassoon chose to fictionalize his accounts of his life, an odd technique that allows him to distance himself from these experiences as he intimately describes the raw emotion and response behind them. In his three memoirs he is George Sherston, a thinly veiled version of himself, who thinnly veils the real-life characters he encountered during these times.Readers are automatically flung into Sassoon's war experience, from the disjointed and fantastical training, to the brutal reality of life in the trenches. Sassoon describes these experiences in vivid detail, the sheer misery of trench warfare, the almost callous attitude toward the dead on both sides, and the surreal life led by those back home. Sassoon, nicknamed \\"Mad Jack\\" for his stubborness and seemingly sheer lunacy at times, was awfully lucky during his battle campaigns. He was wounded a few times, always sent back home to England to recuperate, and almost happy to return to the war.However, after one session as an invalid, Sassoon begins to recognize that the war may not be all it's cracked up to be, that those in power are not telling the truth about their war aims, and that he may just be a lowly pawn in a game he doesn't want to play. Towards the end of his narrative, Sassoon tells of his decision to speak out against the war, even if it meant being court martialed. This act, filtered with courage and fear, is achingly portrayed as an act both necessary and questionable: as Sassoon places himself in danger, he questions his true beliefs in the matter. This account ends just as Sassoon enters the hospital in Scotland, avoiding court martial with a diagnosis of shell shock, 'lucky' as usual.\\"Memoirs of an Infantry Officer\\" is a vividly descriptive account of life in the trenches during WWI. Sassoon is a gifted storyteller, who can make even the direst settings come to life. He offers a unique insight into the soldier poets who first questioned whether or not war was such a noble and glorious pursuit and if the sacrifice of lives was worth the price in the end. While a little slow at times, the last quarter of the narrative which details Sassoon's questioning of the war, is a brilliantly written firsthand look at how a too little celebrated writer finally found his voice."},{"Title":"Memoirs of an infantry officer","review":"Siegfried Sassons' &quot;Memoirs of an Infantry Officer\\" is a first-hand account of life at the front line during World War 1. This is not a just a historical document or diary however. Sassoon writes via an alter-ego called George. In real life, Sassoon was an infantry officer who fought at the front, but eventually grew suspicious of the reasons for the continuation of World War 1, and as such became a dissenter. This book may be fiction, but it is based on fact and it gives an impressive account of what life must have been like in those trenches, nearly a hundred years ago. Sassoon's incredible ability with words paints a much more vivid picture than any war movie will ever provide.George was a middle-class officer who had the luxury of a university education and was an avid reader of classic English literature. He juxtaposes the themes and ideas in this romantic poetry with the realities of life at the front to great effect. Although a tad repetitive in it's ideas (perhaps to get the point across clearly), this book is rewarding and still relevant this whole century later. As one character in the book says, \\"In war-time the word patriotism means suppression of truth\\" ."},{"Title":"Memoirs of an infantry officer","review":"&quot;Memoirs...&quot; is the kind of work that appeals even to people who have no interest in war, the military, or nationalist issues.

When he returned to England all during the first year he lived in a shed at the bottom of the garden - obviously in retrospect he was suffering from shell shock. When I read the book as a young girl, I knew nothing about his history.

Eyre. He was a Rifleman in the 2nd Battalion K.R.R.C. during World War 1. This book covers only two months of service during and around the Battle of the Somme. The author does not go into detail about his earlier service in the war, having signed up in August of 1914, and having fought at Loos with the 7th Battalion K.R.R.C.We can assume he was then wounded, because the narrative opens with him just arriving back in France after a stint in a hospital. He is obviously an erudite and witty individual, casting an acerbic eye at both the French people and his comrades in arms. However lacking are any suavity's or the verbosity of the more affected literary memoirs on the First World War which are more pedantic in the literary sense. Eyre keeps the narrative moving, capturing the vernacular of the front line soldier perfectly. Though all of them are rifleman, he makes the point of showing what a loss it is to the world when his friends die. Through the numerous conversations we find that they are poets, writers, actors, and hopeful politicians. Another interesting aspect is the depiction of Rifleman Mariner a Victoria Cross winner. The book never strays from what his own personal view of the war was at the time, for him and his friends, to encompass their larger role in the perspective of the Battle of the Somme. He fought in many of the bitter, bloody early engagements of the battle, including: Bazentin wood, Becourt Wood, Bazentin-le-Petit and the deadly Battle of Pozieres Ridge. The latter of which marked the end of not only his war but the war for most of his battalion who were killed there. Over 600 members of the battalion would not walk back out of the Somme, including the author Giles Eyre who was taken prisoner he does not go into detail about his captivity though. He remains faithful to his retelling of the two months of hell on the Somme that would claim all of his friends and the battalion he loved. It's a haunting tale that remains with you for a long time after you read it. He movingly states at the end of the book that he still can see his friends as they were all those years ago. It is my favorite book on the First World War. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Celebrating Friendship","review":"There is a total of 6 of these Bible study book from women of faith.

Tozer had a profound understanding of the enemy of our souls and the One who has vanquished him. I have not been disappointed. This collection of 12 sermons focus on the courage and fighting-fervor of the Christian. Founded in Christ through faith, we are armed with great strength to engage in battle with that great adversary the Devil. Pressing forward into maturity in Christ is the main theme of the book. The chapter titles listed below will better illustrate the contents of the book than anything I could say. Suffice to say that this is one of my favorite of Tozer's works (and is included in my Top 10 favorite books).Chapter Titles:1. I Talk Back to the Devil!2. Christianity--Fun and Games?3. Always Slamming on the Brakes!4. You Can't Be a Baby All Your Life!5. Stopped Dead in Your Tracks?6. Denominations Can Backslide, Too!7. Dark, Dark Night of the Soul!8. God Heard Elijah Because Elijah Heard God!9. Don't Throw Your Head Away--You'll Need It!10. Forget That They Told You to Shut Up!11. Caution: Self-Will Will Scratch Your Back!12. How Long Can You Slight the Christ of God?From the Preface&quot;I have never given more time and more pain and more prayer to any other series of sermons in my ministry. Because of their importance, I have literally felt Satan attempting to thwart the purpose of God. I have felt I was in raw contact with hell.... But, I will tell you something--it is a delightful thing when you know that you are close enough to the adversary that you can hear him roar! Too many Christians never get into 'lion country' at all!&quot;From the Back Cover:From Chapter 4&quot;God will speak to us if we read and study and obey the Word of God. But when He does speak, we should speak back to Him in prayer and devotion.&quot;From Chapter 6&quot;Paul knew something that many Christians still have not learned--that the human heart is idolatrous and will worship anything it can possess... Whatever we refuse to surrender and count as loss we will ultimately worship.&quot;From Chapter 8&quot;I earnestly believe that God is trying to raise up a company of Christians in our day who are willing to be completely seperated from all prejudices and all carnal desires.&quot;May we be able to say with this great saint of the 20th century, &quot;I talk back to the Devil.&quot;"},{"Title":"I talk back to the devil: Essays in spiritual perfection","review":"Pastor Tozer brought a revelant message for the church today in this set of sermons. gutsy, honest and straight forward. a challenge to all who sit on pews."},{"Title":"Ask Marilyn: Answers to America's Most Frequently Asked Questions","review":"When I first read this book, I balked at some of the logic.

Mr. Csikszentmihalyi (who came up with that rediculous spelling?) has taken advantage of our capitalist society while promoting pure socialistic undertones in his book. Don't fall for the jargon. There is nothing here that is tangible or practical. It is by far the worst book I have ever read. Please spare yourself. There are many other self-help books out there with much more to offer."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"Man will always continue to seek the meaning of life. Each generation asks what purpose they serve to bring true meaning and purpose to existence. Without purpose and a greater good, man suffers in mediocrity and daily chaos. Most people desire to achieve a new goal or higher status in life only to discover that once obtained, dissatisfaction occurs and a new goal must be established. It is this intuitive hunger for achievement beyond that which we possess that prevents long-term happiness and peace. Most people never utilize positive entropy to find true fulfillment but continue in the dark, an abyss, which consumes their daily lives.Throughout the book, Csikszentmihalyi hinges his flow premise on the idea that man through evolution continues to gain more freedom and consciousness. He cites the Protestant reformation and the American Constitution as moments in time that freed man from existing ideologies and oppression from either the Roman Catholic Church or the aristocratic government as examples of this evolution of our consciousness. [pg. 22] It is my belief these negative entropies were actual paradigm shifts that occurred because man naturally desires freedom over oppression and tyranny.The author does not address how our physical well being affects our physic energy? Depression, a chemical imbalance with the brain or physical discomfort from the pain of an injury can play a major role in how we perceive the world. Granted, our days are full of choices. We can turn negative entropy into a positive attitude; however, there can be a lack of control over consciousness because of the physical or chemical imbalances that occur along the journey of life. Where does one find happiness when our physic energy is affected beyond our control?Personally, I regard the ideas of Csikszentmihalyi and other philosophical writings like his as man's feeble attempt at achieving \\"god like\\" status. If he had read scripture not as simply a bibliography, but as a guide on how to live, believing in its divine inspiration, his heart would be opened to see the entropy of God's flow. He would find the happiness he writes about and the true awakening of a slumbering consciousness."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"What is 'flow'? Simply put you know you're having a flow experience when the adage &quot;time flies when you're having fun&quot; is operative.Applied to life I guess this means not getting locked into a job or a career or way of life that bores you. Do what you can't have enough of, whether that's tennis, driving buses, playing the equities market, healing, writing, .... If you want to have a happy life then get into the flow experience.Incidentally here's a pronunciation guide to (University of Chicago professor of psychology) Dr. Cziksentmihalyi's most daunting name: chick-SENT-me-hi"},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"Professor Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, (known as \`Mike' and for the record his family name is pronounced \\"cheek-sent-me-high-ee\\", His name comes from \\"Saint Michael from the province of Csik,\\" Csik being originally a Hungarian province) is one of the world's leading researchers on Positive Psychology. The author of numerous books and published papers, Flow is recognized as his most influential book and has had a far reaching impact, selling millions of copies, and used extensively in academia, business, sports, psychology and life coaching.Flow integrates research on consciousness, personal psychology, and spirituality to;\\"Present general principles along with concrete examples of how some people have used these principles, to transform boring and meaningless lives into ones full of enjoyment.\\"Our Professor describes his work as the effort \\"to study what makes people truly happy.\\" The emphasis here is on the word \\"truly\\"--because to him, happiness is not simply an emotional state. The happiness he points to involves the continual challenge to go beyond oneself as part of something greater than one's own self-interest.Mihaly acknowledges throughout that Flow research is deep rooted in Ancient Wisdom starting with Aristotle's the good life. Aristotle's model of the good life is \`Eudaimonia', \\"the state of being well and doing well,\\" often translated as meaning \`happiness'. The Taoist philosophy of \`doing without doing', Yogi traditions, Jesuit teachings, heavy reliance on Stoic and more recent philosophy and his own extensive scientific research of which he documents many examples, including in the notes section reference to a \`pot pourri' of high achievers.We are introduced to how the principles of Flow can help us overcome external influences by so doing this also positively impacts, first of all ourselves, and then our experiences with close \\"Full\\" interpersonal relationships, good health, wisdom, awe, maturity, charity, moral development, self-control, purposeful striving, creativity, and professional accomplishments. Mihaly indicates;\\"The reality is that the quality of life does not depend directly on what others think of us or on what we own. The bottom line is, rather, how we feel about ourselves and about what happens to us. To improve life one must improve the quality of experience.\\" \\"To gain personal control over the quality of experience, however, one needs to learn how to build enjoyment into what happens, day in, day out.\\"So just like Krishnamurti tells us, \\"We must open the door ourselves\\" Mihaly reminds us that the impediments to Flow are located within the individual or \\"the roots of discontent are internal\\" and each individual \\"must untangle them personally, with his or her own power.\\"to our Professor teach us how \\"whenever the goal is improve the quality of life, the flow theory can point the way\\" and like some people, we can also have a \\"good time standing at a bus stop\\" or \\"waiting in a dentist's office\\" and live a happy life. A magnificent Book."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"This book explains what optimal experiences are and how they relate to the psychology of happiness. This book also provides some intriguing definitions for consciousness, attention, and intention, which I think are useful in reconsidering how to purposely use such elements of our behavior to prompt flow. It's a good book overall, with the author providing some excellent examples of how people have used flow states to overcome adversity as well as create works of genius. It also presents some psychological theory which isn't rooted in Freud, Jung, or the eight circuit model, which is refreshing to read, and much needed in order to better appreciate psychology as a discipline and how that discipline can be related to one's spirituality.If there's one area where this book suffers, it's that the author is sometimes too wordy and overly repetitious. While I enjoyed this book, there were times, I felt the author was repeating himself too much, in order to get a point across. That said, it's definitely worth picking up, to broaden your understanding of psychology and optimal states of experience."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"While I do not agree with Csikszentmihalyi's philosophy or religious positions, I think he has some valid insights on the process of creativity. In writing on the internal rewards of creativity, he says &quot;There is no question that to survive, and especially to survive in a complex society, it is necessary to work for external goals, and to postpone immediate gratifications....The solution is to gradually become free of societal rewards and learn how to substitute for them rewards that are under one's own powers.&quot; One such system of internal rewards is the enjoyment of accomplishing something creatively. He says such an experience can become a positive addiction.In the flow experience, one loses a sense of self in that one expands beyond self to an &quot;undreamed of state&quot; of consciousness. One is lost in one's work. &quot;Everything the body can do is potentially enjoyable&quot; he tell us. He quotes Thomas Carlyle saying, &quot;Blessed is he who has found his work; let him ask no other blessedness.&quot;There are some highly useful insights in this wonderful book. He causes you to realize overcoming obstacles is not the exception, but the expectation in life. Flow is the process whereby creatively overcoming challenges is redefined in a positive perspective."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"It may be that this is one of those books that becomes ever more relevant as time passes. Written in 1990 (I doublechecked the copyright date several times as I was reading, because it just didn't seem possible!), the things Csikszentmihalyi has to say about human experience in general, and more specifically how we experience satisfaction and happiness, remain vibrantly pertinent. His philosophy is solidly backed by research, and his writing is accessible and friendly (i.e., not academic!).Many books claiming to help us understand ourselves better and find ways of improving our lives have limited usefulness because they are written from a single perspective - but people learn and experience in many, many different ways, so what works for the author is likely to work for only a small percentage of readers. Csikszentmihalyi avoids this problem brilliantly and simply, because he presents the concept of flow from many different perspectives - physical and mental, solitary and in groups, and so on. Thus, there is something here for everyone - different learning styles, different behavioral preferences, different life experiences.It's a wonderful book that has already affected my life and my coaching work.

Between the two extremes of boredom (too easy) and frustration (too hard) we find the flow channel -- blissful execution, seemingly effortless progress, and an overall feeling of happiness. The author goes on to explain learning as excursions out of the flow channel -- becoming too comfortable (bored) so that we seek harder challenges, or seeking more skills so that we can overcome the frustration of failing at difficult tasks. Hence all learning is seen as driving us back into the flow channel from either above or below. There is even a beautiful graph to illustrate the process. This book gives you a new way of looking at the world, and makes you wonder why we all can't spend more time in the channel being happier.

Csikszentmihalyi's Flow and Rao's Are You Ready To Succeed stand atop the pile. Flow and Are Your Ready to Succeed can help you achieve happiness perhaps quicker and more consistently than any other book. Reading these will help you internalize the notion that being in control of the mind means that literally anything that happens can be a source of joyFlow explains that achieving control over experience requires a drastic change in attitude about what is important and what is not. Control over consciousness is not simply a cognitive skill. At least as much as intelligence, it requires the commitment of emotions and will. It's not enough to know how to do it; one must do it, consistently in the same way as athletes.Without discipline, he explains, we are always getting to live, but never living. When you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but that your own judgment of them disturbs you.

While many of these facets seem simple, it can be incredibly powerful to recognize just how much influence they have over your enjoyment of a particular task. I have used found these concepts to be especially valuable when it comes to managing people, not the least of which is managing my own career.Many other books in the realm of personal effectiveness fall short by basing the entire text on the author's anecdotal experience, which ends up turning into meaningless platitudes. That is not the case here, as the author bases his conclusions on sound research.My one gripe with the author is his choice to jump to the conclusion that since focus is sharping there is a loss of self. It would be pretty depressing to think one's own self is what's holding you back.

All these super talented achievers live in 'flow.' This is a psychological state where you are so fulfilled that you seem in a timeless, efortless dimention of play.

The audio book was only two CDs long, so was a quick and enjoyable listen.But overall I found the message a bit disjointed. Part of the book talks about how happiness can be achieved from setting and achieving small goals. But then the other part of the book tries to connect that with being in the zone, as athletes and musicians are when performing their craft. I think these are two separate concepts and cannot be explained by a simple philosophy."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"I am enjoying this book.

We've all experienced many of these people in our lives and mostly the would not be a danger to one physically, but can and will reek havoc with you mind and emotions leaving you to feel as if you've done something wrong. You can't reason with people like this as they are incapable. Over 30 years ago, I was married to a man like this for 11 years. He is still the same as he was when he was young and charming. He has few friends left in his life, doesn't speak to most of his family, blames everything that goes wrong on someone or something other than himself such as the government, the wife, the son, the other family members & life in general.It taken me many years to realize what was wrong in our marriage and relationship.

Contrary to what we would like to believe, it's not our external environment that determines our quality of life, but our internal environment.Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has spent decades researching and developing a theory of happiness called \\"Flow\\". \\"Flow\\" is \\"optimal experience.\\" It is total mental immersion into a creative or playful activity. It's that state of mind when you are so involved in what you are doing that you don't even notice the passing of time. Csikszentmihalyi says that when we are able to experience flow in our every day lives, we'll know true happiness.\\"When experience is intrinsically rewarding, life is justified in the present, instead of being held hostage to a hypothetical future gain...Lost in Antarctica or confined to a prison cell, some individuals succeed in transforming their harrowing conditions into a manageable and even enjoyable struggle, whereas most others would succumb to the ordeal.\\"My own experience is proof of this. I've been in prison for the last twelve years. I experience flow when I play music. What I experience when I'm playing is the same thing whether I was in prison or free.

Rather, we can learn to accept unwanted events and choose to feel happy, productive, or calm despite those obstacles.And I think the author would agree that, it is illogical to believe that sadness, anger, worry, fear, loneliness and many other emotions MUST be disordered and avoided. Suffering is part of life and cannot/should not be avoided. An emotion need not be wrong or eliminated from consciousness simply because it is unwanted.Certain injustices that occur in this world cause many of us to experience a lifetime of deep sadness and suffering. And despite the ability we may have to be productive and happy by means of flow experiences, we must understand that unwanted emotions are healthy and very normal.

Gallwey's \\"Inner Game of Work\\" is a good follow-up to reading Csikszentmihalyi.

They have beginnings and endings, and while the ideas at these two places should certainly be related, reading would be a terribly disappointing experience if the beginning and ending are the same exact idea. That is the case with the terribly disappointing book &quot;Flow.&quot;The author repeats his theory on the happiness found in a mediocre life as if he's trying to convince himself of the worth of having published his less-than mediocre book. The idea he has is actually good, but the delivery is one of the worst experiences I've ever had. Want to know what it's all about? Set a goal, work towards it, and that will be a rewarding experience. Even if your goal is to stuff 129 TV's into boxes during your regular 8-hour shift at the Zenith factory, if you work towards that goal, &quot;Flow&quot; can be yours, and you don't even have to read 900 pages of dribble."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"I was intrigued while reading this book.

Ever since, photography for me was a spiritual practice. Flow elaborates on the concepts introduced to me in Zen in the Art of Archery. This book de-mystified flow experiences and made me aware of the various methods, conditions and activities which can bring about joy.Csiksentmihalyi succeeded in describing the apparent paradoxes of Zen experiences.

It has:- bad flow- is hard to follow- is sporadic hence unable to hold attention and- doesn't make any points very clear at all.Throughout the entire book it seems to simply \\"state\\" things, theories, without adding much value or making the theories very practical at all. The book just prattles on and on about \\"things\\". It's a book of statements!Ironically, you really only need to read 1 page of this book - the page with the \\"Flow\\" diagram summed up the whole book. I can summarise it like this: \\"To be in flow, ensure your skill level and challenge level go up in tandem\\". That's it!This is the problem with academic journals trying to \\"cross-over\\" into popular business bestseller territory. It's padded out to fill a book when it doesn't need to. It still reads like an academic journal i.e. not for public consumption, so shouldn't be sold as such. Perhaps it would be a more effective book with just 1/4 of the pages? Admittedly, it's not easy for any researcher to turn their academic works into a \\"cross-over\\" sensation as a popular business bestseller.

The author supports this with excerpts from interviews with people (rock climbers, artists, musicians etc) who are involved in flow-producing activities.However, the author never addresses why a person would choose one flow producing activity over another or should people cram as many flow producing activities in their lives as possible. Instead the author attempts to apply the conditions that create flow to turn even the most mundane activities into flow producing activities! In effect, he is saying, &quot;Stop whining you lot, use these techniques known to produce flow to make your job more interesting&quot;. The author contends that people are dissatisfied because of lack of flow in their activities which gets them bored sooner or later. Cant people be bored of always being in flow too? How is it different from being temporarily entertained by a good film?The work is good in that it documents the mechanics of flow but disappoints by not discussing the role of passion/liking of the performer for his chosen activity - which is probably why he repeatedly engages in it; flow being a pleasant by-product but not an end in itself."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced chick-ZENT-me-high) did some original research into enjoyment. He strapped pagers onto people and it rang 8 times a day at random. Whenever it rang, the subject was to write down what they were doing and rate their state of happiness and enjoyment on several scales. After 100,000 of these reports, he has found out some fascinating (and USEFUL) information about work, enjoyment, and creativity.I have read this book several times, and I'm always forcibly struck by the profundity of the first few chapters. The writing goes deeper and more to the heart of the human condition than anything else I've ever read. Csikszentmihalyi lays it out so straight and honest that it is almost a shock to the system.The chapters that follow are pure genius in my opinion, and they all have a solid, practical value. If you would like to &quot;get into&quot; your work more, if you would like to ENJOY your work more, you should read this book. I am the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I'm an expert on what is practical and helpful and what isn't. It's not often a book is both profound AND practical, but this one is. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"I read this book a few years back and was completely by blown away by the eloquence of the author and his incredible insights. I appreciate his numerous citations to history as well as traditional references and that they are purposefully not represented as footnotes. In my readings, he is singly able to looks across cultures to find universal truths.I suppose that this book would be found in the \\"Self-Help\\" or \\"Psychology\\" section of the bookstore, but it is not a book of lists of how to be happy. It is more of a delicious dissertation... it is so rich in content. I was looking for it recently, as I was finding myself off balance and not coping with the stresses of daily life adequately.Briefly, FLOW strives to recognize that \\"being in the flow\\" is not accidental. It is not genius. It is not based on your economic status or your state of health. It is not a given that it carries over from one aspect of your life to another easily. It's fostered by an awareness and acceptance of yourself and the idea that you need to give yourself adequate challenges. Probably the most essential part of the book for me at this time are the last two chapters that address how to make sense of tragedy and decide what it is that you are living for so you can rise above it. This book raises interesting moral questions, and above all, seems relevant in every aspect to modern life. Be prepared to be influenced in a new, positive way.

A wonderfully written book that is entertaining, thoughtprovoking, and eye-opening."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"I stumbled upon Flow and was pleasantly surprised. The book, based on extensive research into the nature of happiness and man's most fulfilling moments, promises to provide steps towards enhancing the quality of life. With many examples and concrete suggestions, I found that it delivered to an impressive degree.From the appreciation of art and science, the deepening of friendships and romance, the establishment of a long-term life goal, and the continuous challenge of one's intellect - I found almost all of the book's suggestions to be based on sound reasoning.The single most important factor in achieving happiness in life is, according to Csikszentmihalyi, actively taking charge of one's attention and creating order in the conscious mind. Csikszentmihalyi recommends a life of continuous challenge, learning, and focus; and provides many useful guidelines for doing so successfully. The reward? Enjoying the \\"flow\\" experience often, which he describes as: \\"...a state of concentration so focused that it amounts to absolute absorption in an activity. People typically feel strong, alert, in effortless control, unselfconscious, and at the peak of their abilities. Both the sense of time and emotional problems seem to disappear, and there is an exhilarating sense of transcendence.\\"While some of the above may seem self-evident, I found many principles in the book to be accurate and non-trivial. Especially in its description of the conditions for \\"optimal experience,\\" including clear goals and rules that provide constant feedback, matching the levels of skill and challenge, unselfconscious absorption, and the expenditure of mental effort as a prerequisite for enjoyment. Perhaps even more useful was a review of common reasons why most people don't experience \\"flow,\\" or enjoyment, very often.Despite some disagreements I have, such as with mechanistic or genetic explanations for chosen values, and an exaggerated stress on experience over fact, I found this book overall to be a well-reasoned and useful guide to improving daily experience."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"If you are a runner, a cyclist, or other endurance sport type, you're probably familiar with something similar to what Csikszentmihalyi calls \\"flow.\\" Think of that moment when you stop feeling as though what you are doing is \\"work,\\" when you no longer think of giving up, but only of going on.Unfortunately, many of us go through life rarely ever experiencing \\"flow.\\"The concept is simple. Happiness comes when we feel in control of our actions -- and these moments don't happen when we are at rest (usually), instead, \\"the best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.\\"Flow is not a self-help book, at least not in the sense of offering you \\"ten steps to eternal happiness\\" or worksheets or exercises. Instead, it is a popularized examination of the intellectual bases for the concept of flow. Instead of quoting long lists of scholars, Csikszentmihalyi uses copious \\"real life\\" examples to illustrate the concepts he introduces (this is an aspect Flow shares with self-help books).Even without the exercises or the ten steps or the motivational quotes, Flow can be very helpful for a reader who is experiencing boredom, anxiety, lethargy, lack of purpose, and hasn't figured out why.For me, Flow helped me understand the reasons for a years-long depression and gave me the language necessary to begin to describe what I felt was missing in my own life. I started reading this book about the same time I started seeing a life coach, and it has really helped me in those sessions.Your mileage may vary, of course, but Flow is still a fascinating and not very dense look at an important aspect of the human condition."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"With the concept of happiness being a distraction from Flow Csikszentimihalyi sets up a myriad of powerful arguments all revealing his more philosophical side towards the end.80% of adults say they would work if they had enough money not to.

It's not supposed to make sense because it doesn't, these people are working for far off rewards and not enjoying their task at hand.By age 12 the American child associates only negative things with anything labeled as work. The view of work needs to be changed. This book does just that.Working only for distant rewards will lead to regret and eventual disappointment. It is by learning how to enjoy any task can one get the most enjoyment out of life.Concepts are introduced that are really cool, and I'm not just talking about the &quot;oh that's cool&quot; cool I'm talking about the &quot;holy sh*t, are you serious?&quot; cool.

The only relevant parts of the book are chapter 3, part of chapter 4 on flow activities, and a few of the ideas from the remaining chapters, most of which consist of examples of people Csikszentmihalyi claim are engaging in flow activities.Mr. Csikszentmihalyi insists... and insists... and insists that his work is scientific and states over and over the academic rigor that has gone into his studies - not to mention quote after quote taken from Greek philosophers and modern psychologists that always almost exactly fail to be relevant to the chapter they appear in. It seems he uses them to increase the size of the references section.Then, he proceeds to shatter this illusion he creates. He provides irrelevant discussion and experimental data such as the section in chapter 4 entitled &quot;neurophysiology and flow.&quot; In it, he speaks of an experiment which shows absolutely nothing about the relationship between neurophysiology and flow. At the end of the chapter he writes:&quot;The neurological evidence does not, however, prove that some individuals have inherited a genetic advantage in controlling attention and therefore experiencing flow. The findings could be explained in terms of learning rather than inheritance.&quot;Later, he speaks of martial arts, making all sorts of errors. He claims that judo, jujitsu, kung fu, karate, tae kwon do, aikido and T'ai Chi ch'uan all originate in China (106). He says that &quot;Those who can perform it well claim that fighting becomes a joyous artistic performance...&quot; Hmmm.... Many martial artists (myself included) might object to the use of the word &quot;joy&quot; in describing the flow that comes in an intense combat situation. &quot;No-mind&quot; or Bruce Lee's &quot;serious play&quot; is not &quot;joy.&quot; It seems that Mr. Csikszentmihalyi ran out of examples to expand his 50 page book into a 250 page one so he started making stuff up.Don't buy this book - certainly don't read the whole thing. I already wasted my time doing this. You don't have to also :-)If you are curious about the concept, go to your local bookstore, find this book, turn to page 208, the summary, and read until page 213. That's the book in a nutshell.

It is very well organized, lucid & full of interesting anecdotes. It does not get into unnecessary academic details about psychology, though it explains every aspect of each experience in thorough detail.The topic itself is quite complex & inherently interesting & the skilful handling of the subject means that at no point the reader is bogged down by details she does not understand. The author gives a detailed breakdown of the characteristics of the optimal experience going on to elaborate on how such an experience can be lived in our relationships, work, leisure & the like.The author does point out that this is not meant to be a self help book; however, my feeling is that it could, most definitely, be used as one because given the detailed explanations of each aspect of the optimal experience & various anecdotal examples, there remains only a matter of personalization in terms of which actions or activities for each one of us individually would lead to this optimal experience. There are odd flashes of humour; though, I feel, these could have been more frequent.All in all, to borrow from sensationalist terminology, this one is unputdownable.S!"},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"Csikszentmihalyi's work came to me at a good point in my life. As a father and a husband, I tended to be self-absorbed and uncooperative around the house, viewing daily household chores as a &quot;waste of time&quot;. Optimal experience helped me view even small, necessary tasks like these as challenges. By playing with the variables involved in simple chores like washing laundry - by giving myself time constraints, challenging myself to complete what seemed to be a daunting task, or simply focusing on and taking joy in progressive cleanliness - I kept my mind engaged, and greatly reduced my frustration. My house has been much more liveable ever since.What I took from the book in practical terms, however, was mostly self-invention. The book is short on practical techniques. The survey of Asian mind-control techniques is very interesting, but leaves little for the average person to use.There's also a lot to question here from a philosophy of life standpoint. One has to wonder where the line is between enjoying life and tolerating servitude. For decades, Marx, Marcuse and various Socialist thinkers have decried the capitalist system as an industrial tangle where monotonous mass production replaces craftsmanship. Csikszentmihalyi's theories, as framed, seem to be a perfect doctrine to keep people locked in mindless drudgery. Where does optimal experience end and oppression begin? The tale of the assembly-line worker looking to become a technician helps ameliorate this issue, but no clear answer is given.In all, Csikszentmihalyi doesn't seem concerned with these questions - he focuses too sharply on humans as psychological subjects, and takes the current architecture of industrial civilization for granted. Still, I applaud Csikszentmihalyi for giving a name - and the beginnings of a psychological theory - for something we all experience, but often can't identify."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"I first read this book in 91 when it came out.

Though I had some idea before reading it that challenging yourself and achieving \\"flow\\" is important for your happiness, I just didn't really grasp how important it is in all aspects of your life. One can turn wasted time in optimal time, just by using a little creativity to make challenges for yourself. I would have never thought that someone could turn boring factory work into an optimal experience, for example. Often, happiness comes from within, not from without. That is perhaps the lesson that Westerners need to learn the most. We keep trying to find happiness with greater and greater riches, but it continues to elude us.However, I think that Mihaly C. overstates the importance of Flow a little. There are other components to happiness that have nothing to do with challenging yourself - love, friendship, relaxation time, comfort, etc. Just keep that in mind as you read this book."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"Mihaly's academic treatment of \\"the zone\\" or the state of \\"Flow\\" is thorough, comprehensive, and clear.

Despite the use of the word 'psychology' on the cover, I would rate it 1/3 psychology, 2/3 philosophy, anthropology, and sociology. The author's psychological contribution is based on a series of self-reporting tests where subjects were beeped at random moments and asked to record their moods and thoughts. Lord knows what happened if the beep came during a sensitive business meeting or while making love, the author does not say. He should have. Little also is made of the tendency of anyone to respond in accordance with what they feel will be expected of them or will be well received. This factor and how it was treated should have been debated. When all that is said and done however, there is an honest and provocative account of what makes for the happiest experiences of (mostly) (western, industrialised, modern) people. You could also reframe it as an account of how these same (mostly) (western, modern, indistrialised) people arrive at the state of concentrated and unified attention which throughout the ages has been recognised as the path to paradise. The author gives in fact fair attention to the Oriental paths to the same result, although he stops short of recognising that the Oriental formulation of the result is meaningful. The author's knowledge of the philosophical tradition is deep, and his references to it are always refreshing. A thoroughly interesting read, to be balanced with any modern work on neuro-psychiatry for a satisfying synthesis."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"I've read a lot of self-help books already and most of them focus too much on getting rich and being succesfull but don't tell you how you will get happy because of them. This book is nothing of that, it wont teach you how to become a success. But it will teach you how become happy.You don't want to be succesfull because you want to be better than others, it is doing challenges because you learn from it personally, your self grows, not your arrogance. Hence flow is compared a lot to eastern philosophy.This wont feel as 'shiny' as the other books. You wont get huge adrenaline shots while reading it. So I think it is normal that this book doesn't get as much attention as the others. But it will change you silently from within."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"Stop. Take a moment and think about your life. When was the last time you felt happy, satisfied, content or fulfilled? What were you doing? Chances are, there's something about the nature and structure of that particular activity that makes it pleasant and enjoyable. Flow is Csikszentmihalyi's inquiry into the pursuit of happiness.The process takes him far and wide, from the major world religions, to cultural anthropology; philosophical systems to sociological studies. The objective is to identify how to be happy in life and in respect of the formal academic process, the book is rife with footnotes and citations. This would be a great choice for the rational, left-hemisphere dominant personality. You know the type, they're the ones with the intellectual curiosity, who don't take things at face value and check the references out for themselves.The first edition is over 20 years old now, and the last couple decades have witnessed a dramatic culture-wide slide from the positive, or happiness side of the scale (the autotelic), to the negative, or unhappiness (entropy). Factors identified as negative - meaning they increase unhappiness, are expanding, and becoming ingrained. There's a story in the news today about a paper written by University of Kentucky Psychology professor Nathan DeWall titled \\"Narcissism and implicit attention seeking\\", which finds narcissism has increased exponentially over the past 30 years. As factors increasing unhappiness become normalized, than the argument in favor of deviation (following Mihaly's recommendations) becomes increasingly compelling.\\"We are in the process of creating what deserves to be called the idiot culture. Not an idiot sub-culture, which every society has bubbling beneath the surface and which can provide harmless fun; but the culture itself. For the first time, the weird and the stupid and the coarse are becoming our cultural norm, even our cultural ideal.\\"Carl Bernstein, U.S. journalist.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"After years of hearing about Csikszentmihalyi's \\"Flow\\", I finally brought a copy and read it during the flights of a recent trip. The framework work that Csikszentmihalyi laid for enhancing a person's experience in daily life is comprehensive, concise and brilliantly straight forward -- flow, or a state of enjoyment, is attained when a person is deeply focused on an activity in such a way that his sense of time and self(-inferiority) is lost. Csikszentmihalyi also observed that the type of activity that fosters flow usually have a well-defined goal and provides immediate feedback. People who frequently experience flow are those invest their attention (or psychic energy) to such an activity over an extend period of time, over which the enjoyment from the activity and the commitment of the participant form a virtuous cycle, resulting in a continuously deeper and rewarding experience.How rare are those who can find flow in their daily work? Too many of us wander into our careers after series of random choices. When we do feel motivated, it is because of money, prestige, peer-recognition and other equally frivolous matters. How often can we stand in front of a mirror can tell ourselves that we drive to excel in our careers out of pure sense of enjoyment?Flow serves as a wake-up call to us. Every moment not seeking enjoyment out our daily lives is a moment that we willfully discard."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"One of my very favorite books.Written for a popular audience, the author describes the fascinating results of his academic career of researching exactly what makes people happy.His findings are surprising. Most people don't know what makes them happy. For example, most people don't realize that they are happiest at work or why; they believe they would be happier with more leisure time. I found most facsinating the studies of people who had lost limbs. The book explains why, although parapalegics would rather still have their limbs, for many, the loss of their limbs actually made them happier.The ideas presented explain why so many people are unhappy when enjoying historically unprecedented levels of physical comfort. The book is also uplifting in that it points out that we truly can be happy in any situation.Although the book does ramble at times, this is one of the best books I have ever read. I am more than willing to put up with less than perfect writing to gain the remarkable insights that are clearly laid out in the book. Not surprisingly, the book does not provide a recipe to make you happy.

And all credit to Dr. C. for brining our attention to flow and how it influences peoples lives. But there is a teensy little problem. Dr. C. tell us what other people tell him 'flow' feels like, but in 300 pages, he never tells us what flow is. This is sort of like reading a book on headaches by Dostoevsky or some existentialist philosopher. You may get the feel of what headaches are like, but to know the physiology of headaches, a better choice would be to rely on DrKoop. Same thing unfortunately with Dr. C. Instead of a scientific analysis of flow that brings in the latest research on cognitive science or neuroscience, Dr. C. ladles on the metaphors like a never ending fountain of curdled verbal gravy. Thus flow &quot;transports one into a new reality&quot;, represents an &quot;ordering of consciousness&quot;, or represents some &quot;undreamed of state of consciousness&quot;. Hmm, may I have some psychic fries with all this psychic goodness?So Dr. C's book gets two stars for literature, but flunks out as science. Indeed, the latest research in neuroscience has demonstrated that the brain releases the neuromodulator dopamine whenever attention shifts from one salient precept to another. Whenever attention shifts a lot, as when we encounter something challenging, creative, or very interesting, a lot of dopamine is produced. Since dopamine is the pleasure chemical in the brain, as well as is responsible for drug induced highs, it stands to reason that flow is no more than a natural drug high that keeps us riveted on important thoughts. So flow is important, but is hardly best understood by the half baked Jungian analysis that Dr. C. cooks up.For a better insight on how you too can make 300+ page books by weaving together meaningless metaphors, I would refer the reader to George Lakoff's superb book &quot;Philosophy in the Flesh&quot;. For a better understanding about the emotions that may underlie flow, I also recommend Antonio Damasio's book &quot;Descartes Error...&quot;; and for those of you who would like to get a better idea about how flow like processes may arise from the brain, Donahoe and Palmer's book &quot;Learning and Complex Behavior&quot; is heartily recommended."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"\\"Flow\\" is an interesting research book detailing the manner in which everyone from athletes and performers to authors and scientists reach their peak state of creativity and performance.

Packs with good advice on the pyschology of flow and its impact on everyday life activities and how to concentrate on them."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience is an excellent read. When I first got this book, I had no idea what it was about. I figured that it would be a look into psychological ideals and I was about half correct. The book ended up being more of a self help book; a way to make one's life better and deeper. The idea of Optimal Experience is a hard one to envision, but after reading the book I definitely understand more about myself and my own life. The book is one that turns inspection inward and causes the reader to take stock of how he/she works in this world. Ideas expressed in the book include how to achieve happiness at work and within all things in one's life. If I had to sum the whole thing up in a few words, I would say that it is a book about how to be happy. It uses several psychological studies to prove just how happiness can be achieved. This may end up being a self help book, but it does not give a step by step formula for how to achieve happiness. It simply lays the ground work for the reader to take control and find happiness on their own. I found that I could relate to a lot of the topics that were covered, and that the more a read, the more I understood about myself. The book itself is well written, though it can be a little up tight at times. It was a slow read for me because of the volume of information that it contains. One has to read it slowly and pay attention, or he/she will miss out on some of the main points. It is difficult at times to follow what Csikszentmihalyi is saying, but after re-reading certain parts I came to understand. I read this book for a college course, and I am glad that I did. It focuses on ideas that can help a person better themselves and those around them. I believe everyone should read this book at least once in their lifetime, even out of pure boredom.As the book states, It offers steps toward enhancing the quality of life, and everyone should have the chance to improve something about themselves."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"Personally revealing to me.

Not reading it until 2011, I missed the original hype and exuberance associated with it. It is like many books that draw from large area of research and draw a common, larger theme out of the material-lots of interesting data but easy to lose \\"flow\\" while reading. For this book, I found the mountain of material to be higher than Everest and Mihaly says as much when he talks about having written the book for the \\"general reader.\\" His span of experience is broad covering many scientific disciplines, religions, cultures, etc. and I believe that much of the research on human behavior resonates. However, I can't help but sense that something is missing in this book. The nature of the mind and the research in the first third of the book provide a solid background of the concept of \\"flow\\" and \\"optimal experience\\". The remainder of the book was a struggle to finish. Perhaps someone like me, who considers themselves very happy, struggles to find substantial application with what is written. For me to follow one of his suggestion, which is to cast off certain belief systems in search of a new \\"system\\" is a contradiction with no value."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"If you are familiar with Zen thought, \`Flow' will have a familiar ring to it. Csikszentmihalyi pretty much just condenses and modernizes Zen philosophy, then restates it. Even if I wasn't versed in Zen teachings, \`Flow' would still come across as a little obvious. Of course one's life and happiness is based on one's preception of it. Csikszentmihalyi seems to have one major point to make, then every remaining chapter is just a reiteration of it. The book is easy to read and a little \`pop culturish.' Csikszentmihalyi quotes \`scientific' research, but I'm always wary of an author that cites and summarizes a multitude of studies to prove a point. Things are rarely that clear cut. Any psychological study can be used prove a theory depending on how the results are interpreted. Csikszentmihalyi also starts to get into other fields to help explain flow, such as anthropology. He should stick to things he knows, psychology. If you are already in the \`flow' this book won't let you understand it any better, you already know. If you're unhappy this book will explain to you why the people who are, are. Will reading this book help you achieve happiness? I have my doubts, but you have to start somewhere.

The author's name is the most challenging part of reading this book. His style is easy to read, but not condescending. I've read lots and lots of books and this one is unequalled.

I make that sound like an obvious statement, and maybe it is.I read this book through because a person I respect recommended it to me, but if she hadn't, I would have only skimmed many parts of it. The book sort of tripped over its own message, because the task it presented to me, the task of reading, became increasingly tiresome due to the repetitiousness of Csikszentmihalyi's examples.Still, there were highlights. As an avid bicyclist, I found one passage, on pp. 60-61, that rang very true -- cited in part here.\\"It is usual to explain the motivation of those who enjoy dangerous activities as some sort of pathological need: they are trying to exorcise a deep-seated fear, they are compensating, they are compulsively reenacting an Oedipal fixation, they are 'sensation seekers.' While such motives may be occasionally involved, what is most striking, when one actually speaks to specialists in risk, is how their enjoyment derives not from the danger itself, but from their ability to minimize it...\\"Csikszentmihalyi gives examples of rock climbers and scuba divers, but the same observation applies to skillful bicyclists riding down steep hills or in urban traffic. What non-cyclists may regard as terrifying, skillful cyclists find to be acceptably safe and thoroughly enjoyable.I have a couple of other discomforts with Csikszentmihalyi.One is with the fundamental precept that merely finding appropriately challenging activities can bring enjoyment in life. This raises the question, \\"is that all there is?\\" Those of us who are motivated by duty, faith, love or wonder may want to challenge ourselves with tasks of stewardship rather than only activities that match our abilities -- though I'll grant that Csikszentmihalyi makes some important points about the risks of burnout, or of falling into a rut, in political, religious, artistic and social activities as in others.Also, I often find Csikszentmihalyi's prose style unsatisfying. His long-windedness may disturb me because I see it in myself, too: example, this review! But I also found a few outright misuses of terminology. As an engineer, I was especially annoyed by the weak, vernacular misuse of the term \\"negative feedback\\" as a synonym for \\"criticism.\\" Negative feedback is a very specific and powerful engineering concept, that of reducing distortion in a system by sending an inverted sample of the output back to be compared with the input, in a closed loop. This concept is powerful in sociological modeling as well, but only as applied to criticism which is arranged to bring results -- example: wage incentives as they affect employees' performance.So, all in all, you may have a more optimal flow experience by just skimming Flow. Ah, glutton for punishment that I was, I read it all!"},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"Instead of attempting to offer the reader a condescending, simplistic recipe for success and happiness (par for the self-help course, it seems), Csikszentminalyi illuminates the processes of happiness in all their heady complexity.

This said, the book is still very accessible, replete with relavent and engaging antecdotes, careful exposition, and a thoughtful writing style.

The author's writing style is unusually concise and he is able to explain complex ideas in a simple and understandable style. The concept of flow is intuitively very appealing. The author conducted an apparently well structured empirical study of the causes and conditions that resulted in &quot;optimal experience&quot; (ie happiness) and reached some insightful and convincing conclusions. The ability to achieve &quot;optimal experience&quot; is tightly linked to the ability to focus on fulfilling personally determined goals. Although the book is useful as a personal blueprint for achieving &quot;optimal experience&quot; I found more facinating his compelling arguments about the functioning of the human mind and spirit"},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"My takeaway from reading the book, Flow by Michaly Csikzentmihalyi is that happiness can be achieved by changing consciousness in which you bring order to tasks that you do (sometimes daily) and can bring enjoyment to your life, hence happiness and it called flow.It sounds simple but it is rather complex. The book is written by an intellectual and at times its seem for intellectuals. You have to pay attention otherwise you'd be like me when I had to re-read the paragraph for it to make it sense.The premise is that for you to be happy-you have to overcome challenges and use your skills to do it. Flow and happiness are by-product of the task. But there is a delicate balance between the complexity of the challenge and the complexity of your skill. It have to be aligned. If one is greater then the other, then you will need to increase and improve your skills or lower the challenge. Only then, will flow exist. The author gives a few examples of this: a tribe in New Zealand moves every seven years as to give the tribe new trails, new enemies, new challenge for the happiness of the group. And he give examples of a culture that every year destroys a monument and re-builds it trying to make it better and more beautiful.To achieve flow , there are clear rules that must be followed: The task must have clear goals and actions needed to overcome the obstacles. Immediate feedback is needed to see what you doing is working or not working. The challenge and the skills must be aligned but it has to stretch the person, it has be hard enough to do but not too hard where he will give up. Once the goal is met, a new goal needs to be set. Once, flow is established a few things happens, one time is distorted, you derived enjoyment in you life, the reward of life is established, and regardless if you have stress in your life or not, you bounce back and establish flow.One question I had once, How can I apply this in my life? I have goals I have not reached. It begs the question, are the goals too unrealistic and complex or do I lack the skills to achieve and overcome the challenge. I think my conclusion is the latter so I have to find a way to increase and improve my skills.My other takeaway is that the author states many times, that life is inherently hard , filled with stress and for him the admirable trait is one of perseverance, resiliency and of confidence. That becomes the challenge and few individuals are able to do this, he gives examples of veterans wounded in combat who attitude and resiliency are amazing and are able to achieve flow with positive and outstanding results. He says the trick is that one has to believe in themselves. The attitude is of a pilot who knows if he runs into problems , he can safely land the plane.My last takeaway from the book, is that he repeats himself and in one of the reviews, it said it was a bad thing. When, actually for me is a good thing, he talks a lot of psychic energy and how is used. Psychic energy is what you pay attention to every day. It is limited and it has to be used wisely. He talks a lot of external and internal forces and how you cannot control external but you can control internal, the consciousness, the psychic energy, the attention and the positive attitude knowing you can do it regardless what hte external pressures are. He has a few favorite workers describing flow, the surgeon who challenge is obvious and so is his feedback, the operation was either a success or failure, the dancer who is totally absorbed in her performance, where time doesn't exit, the mountain climber who sees every little details in his quest to climb the mountain. The concentration is like breathing, they are not aware of it, an explosion could occur near by and they wouldn't be aware of it. He talks a lot about paradoxes, how you must change consciousness to achieve flow but by doing you lose your self, you become part of what you are doing- by being in control, you lose control and perfection and clarity occurs.I really enjoyed the book, overall my recommendation is positive, However, there a one thing I wish I would have seen. I am a big fan of summaries and the last chapter didn't make sense to me, he talked about the meaning of life and different models of it. For me , it would have make more sense, to tie it up and give practical example how an average person could use flow, I understand he wrote, a seguel to Flow, maybe he explains in practical manner how to use flow in your life not how dancers, chess players, musicians and surgeons uses flow.I do recommend Flow and you will see how you can use it in your own life."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"Have read almost all books written by Mihaly ,This one is the best .

We often talk about the sort of happiness associated with a big event, like getting married or having a child. We forget about the happiness that comes from a job well done -- and not the completion of the job, but rather that feeling of being truly involved in what you're doing and knowing that you're making appreciable progress towards your goal. It's that feeling of being truly involved, which has a million other names like \\"in the zone\\" or \\"in the groove\\", that is the experience of flow.Flow is when you lose track of time because you're so involved in what you're doing. People in flow are happy, and it's this kind of happiness which is probably the one that's most important to our lives. The big headline kinds of happiness don't happen frequently, but flow is something that can happen every single day.This book talks about the science behind flow, how to get into the flow state, what happens when you're in the flow state, and what the outcomes of flow are. While you can get into flow in everyday activities like washing the dishes or doing the ironing, flow can also help you attain life goals. It takes having a goal that is attainable, and doing work that makes appreciable progress towards that goal. So while it's probably not an attainable goal for me to cure cancer since I'm not in the medical field and have no intent of getting there, there are big but still attainable goals in my chosen field, not to mention in my personal interests.Overall, the book served to remind me that I've been overlooking a lot of potential happiness of late, and that it's time for me to set another big goal for myself and start on the road towards it."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"Excellent consciousness investigations given in this book.

It was just as engaging and powerful this time as it was twenty years ago.

Have you ever been working or doing some activity and lost track of time because you were so immersed in the activity? That is flow. This book examines the phenomenon and helps you develop methods for bringing it about intentionally. A side note: I have worked at a place that expressly wanted you to avoid doing this despite the fact that it improves job performance, increases job satisfaction and a few other perks that I cannot recall presently. Of course, that place was completely backwards anyway."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"Reading this book made me able to understand why I \\"get lost\\" in a pleasant way in certain activities. (I know nothing about Jung , Maslow, or Zen.) The subject matter earns five stars for giving me that personal insight, but the quality of its editing gets only two stars. The book is repetitive, repetitive, repetitive. Did I mention that it is repetitive? Another reviewer said something like \\"it could have been adequately covered in 50 pages.\\" I agree. And publishers who neglect to create an index for a work of non-fiction make it difficult for a reader to go back to find certain information---not exactly conducive to learning. Good editing would have removed the repetition and included an index. In spite of the book's drawbacks, I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"One of the main concerns that someone might have with this book is that the research is a bit outdated. The behavioral literature has been booming in the past 15-20 years and there have been numerous new findings and studies that would have enhanced the strength and validity of this book. Furthermore, even though the data that is used is legitimate and reliable, no \\"hard\\" data such as brain scans is used to provide chemical and neurological evidence to support the author's claims. Once again, this is probably as a result of the age of the book. Such studies were most likely not available when Flow was written.However, even with this limitation, Flow does an excellent job of guiding the reader through a journey about what really makes people happy. This is NOT one of those 1000's of \\"Self-Help\\" books that are advertised everywhere. The author takes a scientific approach to the question of \\"what really makes us happy?\\" and \\"how do people consistently stay happy?\\" Survey and interview data are constantly referenced and it gives the reader insight on when people experience their greatest levels of happiness. The author focuses attention on consistent patterns that emerge across numerous age groups and races. For instance, individuals report the highest levels of self growth and discovery when they \\"lose themselves\\" into what they are currently involved in and reach new heights of intense concentration and immersion. Paradoxically, by \\"losing the self,\\" they experience the most amount of self growth in the process. The author finds such an experience present across both cultures and time.Flow is ideal for anyone that is interested in an objective and academic look on happiness. The conclusions and observations can certainly be applied in one's everyday life and I have gradually started to attempt to recreate some of the principles described both during work and my leisure time. If a young person like me can make such connections, it should potentially be easier for someone older and with more life experiences."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"This is one of the best books available on the subject of happiness.

So what exactly is flow?Well, there are short and long ways to define the concept of flow. The short way is to tell you that flow is roughly the equivalent to what most people refer to as being \\"in the zone\\" or \\"in the groove\\". More elaborate definitions might be that it is \\"the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people do it even at great cost, for the sheer state of doing it.\\"Being such a desirable state, flow is naturally linked to happiness. The book feels that the path to happiness is a circuitous one that begins with one achieving control over the \\"contents of our consciousness\\". I'm taking that to mean that if I learn to find flow experiences, it will lead to greater happiness.Know from the get-go that \\"Flow\\" is NOT a step-by-step book that gives you tips on how to be happy. Instead, the book summarizes years of research, so what you get when all is said and done, are general principles along with examples of how people have used them to transform their lives. The hope, then, is that you will have enough information in the book to make the transition from principles and theory, to actual practice.In a nutshell, \\"Flow\\" is a unique and interesting book that examines the process of achieving happiness through the control of one's inner life and is a classic in it's field. Other positive psychology books I liked include \\"Finding Happiness in a Frustrating World\\"."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"If anyone is seeking a \\"recipe\\" for \\"optimal experience\\" do not read this book. This book is not a step-by-step self-help guide. Neither is it a pedantic overview of psychological studies replete with statistical analyses, i.e., hard data, proving \\"flow\\" exists. The simplest way to summarize this book is, it describes how different people create meaning in life with full intention and focus and thereby achieve an ongoing state of satisfaction and sense of fulfillment.The book begins with an overview of how people define and achieve happiness. Essentially, the author contends, most people are not happy because the universe was not created to make us happy but on the contrary, it serves to frustrate us and help us grow ... The primary focus of this book is to show us that \\"flow\\" states happen to people despite the challenges of the universe, it happens to people from all walks of life, from all cultures, throughout the world.Flow is a state of consciousness which can be achieved on an individual path. It also has common elements which anyone who is experiencing the state can identify. The author examines the common experiences which people who are in a state of \\"flow\\" describe. It seems people who are in \\"flow\\" achieve a state of consciousness that is in harmony with their surroundings and feelings. They do not make distinctions between work and play ... people in \\"flow\\" create an inner state of being that brings them peace and fulfillment that is separate from their external environment. They are focused, what they do is meaningful and has purpose, they are absorbed in their activities and they have a sense of connection to their inner self and and also with others. The state called \\"flow\\" pertains to enjoyment and satisfaction with one's quality of life. The basis for the flow experience seems to be creating meaning and controlling consciousness where a state of unity exists which is consistent with a person's life themes. Some people experience it for minutes, some for hours, some for days on end ... evidently it can be sustained for long periods of time by some people. This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in the \\"psychology of being alive here and now.\\"Erika Borsos (erikab93)"},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"Flow are those inexplicable moments of indescribable happiness that we experience at rare intervals, when we are \\"surprised by joy.\\" These precious moments seem to be gifts, almost accidental peak experiences in which life seems rich with meaning, joy and wonder. When and why do these magic episodes intrude upon our humdrum existences? Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's answer may surprise you: \\"Contrary to what we usually believe, moments like these, the best moments of our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times ... The best moments of our lives usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to the limits in a voluntary moment to achieve something difficult and worthwhile. Optimal experience is thus something we make happen ... For each person there are thousands of opportunities, challenges to expand ourselves.\\"Csikszentmihalyi's theme is happiness. This philosopher-psychologist points out the Aristotelian concept that all other things we seek, riches, fame, power, etc. are valued only because we believe they will make us happy. Based upon decades of research on the mystery of happiness, Csikszentmihalyi defines it as moments of self-forgetfulness when we are totally absorbed in the process of life ... intervals of peak creativity and self-expression. He expands upon the research of Abraham Maslow and agrees that peak experiences are within the reach of us all. The theme of this book is the introduction of techniques to make this glad to be alive feeling occur more often. It may be stated that this book is no self-help step-by-step program, nor could it be. Each of us is plowing new snow, creating a path that no one else has traveled. The guidelines and the principles are here, but the journey into the sublime uncertainty of our destiny is individual and precious. Flow is one of several extraordinary contributions by this great mind."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"Amazon already did a good job summarizing Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's Flow, so I will instead focus on evaluating its content.The book is set up in a way where the first few chapters concentrate on defining and analyzing the intricate relationship between human consciousness and happiness. Once this is firmly established, Csikszentmihalyi goes on to introduce the concept of flow, its physiology and its conditions. All subsequent chapters then examine flow in various aspects of our lives and the last chapter focuses on the philosophical implications of the concept and whether it relates to finding \\"meaning in life\\".It has been said in science that any researcher should have the ability to explain their theory clearly and concisely to a layman. I felt that Csikszentmihalyi's style of writing is very true to this statement, as he puts in a particular effort to make his book accessible and very easy to read for just about anyone. I would even say that he is overly simple to a fault - using a philosophically-conversational tone at the expense of a slightly more rigid \\"literature review\\" style that predominates more modern pop sci books. Despite this, the author is still capable of conveying a decent amount of science and methodology behind his discovery and analysis of the optimal experience model.To me, the most powerful chapters were really the first five where, as I discussed earlier, Csikszentmihalyi really puts the meat on the bones of his theory of flow and masterfully connects everything together. Some passages just made so much sense that I had to put the book down and seriously contemplate about what is being said and how it relates to my entire understanding of life. To use the author's own language it put me in a very deep and enjoyable \\"flow of thought\\".The book does have a small blemish in the fact that it gets a bit repetitive when it goes into listing the occurrence of flow in everyday settings. I don't have anything against the discussion of applicability of the theory, it just seems that sections containing very similar messages could have been condensed. Perhaps 240 pages (not including notes and references) is a bit much for this type of format and ideally it should have been closer to 200 pages. However, I want to emphasize that this small fault does not in any way make the book a \\"drag\\" and some people may find this \\"extra\\" information rather useful.To conclude, I found Csikszentmihalyi's lifelong research, his findings and the overall message of his work extremely compelling and powerful. The theory of flow does an excellent job describing many aspects of our lives and most importantly sheds light on the conditions of happy and meaningful existence. I would honestly recommend this book to anyone. It is rather short and very readable and guaranteed to make you analyze your life and the life of your friends and family through the lens of the theory of flow."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"Flow is a concept Csikszentmihalyi developed to describe his observations of human's happiest states.

I loved it. This is why:It made sense to me. It helped me understand things about myself that I didn't realize, and it made a difference. Why do I sit and watch TV when I hate TV and there are a thousand better things to do? Why do I choose an activity knowing at the time I will regret it later (such as reading a not-great book I've already read, instead of going for a walk or reading one of the great, challenging books on my shelf I haven't read)? Why do I have so much trouble starting a project I'm really excited about? Why when I'm doing a routine task like laundry do I start obsessing about past conversations and what I should have said? I thought it was a character issue - I just don't have enough willpower.What I understood from this book, the mind needs structure for keeping pyschic order (This is the interepretation that made a difference to me - it may not be a scientifically rigorous representation of his work). There are two kinds of structure - low level, meaning low challenge and low use of skills. It doesn't take any psychic energy to get there, but it doesn't provide much growth either. Examples are watching TV, reading predictable, unchallenging books, redundant social chatter, etc. Higher level structure means higher challenges and higher use of skills. Examples playing tennis, brain surgery, model building, drag racing, challenging, thinking conversations or books, basketball, pretty much any work or hobby you enjoy. It takes some energy or effort to get started, but you get so much more out of it, and generally feel better afterward. With no structure, the mind tends to wander and get caught by problems or concerns.In moments throughout the day, having this distinction had made a difference. Knowing that the pull to do something mindless and easy is not a character issue, but the mind's need for order, I find myself choosing more challenging activities sometimes. I'm not sure I've experienced what he calls flow, but I know I feel better if I put forth the energy to do a jigsaw puzzle rather than watch TV, or take a walk rather than eat a pint of ice cream, or work on my writing instead of reading a book.I found the follow-up book, &quot;Finding Flow&quot;, less satisfying because it was less dense and more chatty, and it was mostly a repeat of &quot;Flow&quot;. If you are interested in the ideas but want something less scientific and easier to read, you might start with that."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"First, the name is pronounced chick-sent-mih-high. And it is worth remembering because this is one book that will probably be around in 100 or 200 years. It is that important. Certainly, it is one of, if not the most important books in the positive psychology field. The author has spent his life researching the Flow state, and in the process, has inspired hundreds, if not thousands of other researchers to further pursue this profound, yet simple concept.Flow is a state that artists experience when they are feeling in the groove, when time seems to just fly and the &quot;work&quot; seems to soar.One key ingredient of flow is a challenge that can be reasonably responded to with existing resources. That tells us that it is important, if we are going to achieve Flow States, to challenge ourselves regularly.The book walks the reader through some of the basic research and then, to conclusions about how this amazing concept affects us all, and how it affects people who insist on finding the flow in their lives.I discovered MC's work about 12 years ago, and while working on a book titled THE HAPPINESS RESPONSE, had my first conversation with him. He's one man who walks the talk-- kind, accessible. His book opens a door to a new way of thinking about living, about psychology, and it has had a major role in the development of the field of positive psychology. Matter of fact, if you are interested in positive psychology you absolutely must have this book.If you want to get a handle on some concrete aspects of finding more meaning in your life, on specific strategies for feeling more alive, then read this book.In my lectures and workshops, I present the Anatomy of Positive Experience. One key element is the optimization of the moment-- Once you realize you are having a positive experience, there are many strategies you can use to make the experience longer, stronger, deeper, more meaningful, shared with someone you love, etc. This book gives you many specific ideas on how to do just these things.In the annual meeting I organize, The Optimal Functioning and Positive Psychology Meeting, it is common for trainers and researchers to describe how winners stay in the moment to perform their best. Flow is about the same phenomenon. But not just about winning, it's also about the little moments too.You don't have to paint a masterpiece or climb a mountain to find flow. Just stretch a little. And this book and MC's other works help you learn HOW to stretch so you feel the FLOW. This is one of those books I've recommended to hundreds of people. Try it.

Well, after reading them, one supposedly knows what successful people do, what to do first, or maybe have an increased sense of personal power. Somehow, I don't think so.Enter Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and the idea of Flow. Flow is about finding meaning in a particular activity, profession or if one is really fortunate in life. The bottom line is that to achieve maximum happiness, enjoyment, or even &quot;success&quot; a person will often have &quot;flow&quot; experiences. It's when worries slip away, when a person or a team is engaged in an activity, and is so focused that it seems effortless.Covey, Robbins, and the rest of em', will present you with a square peg which you may be able to smash into a round hole if you keep hitting it hard enough. Understanding, yourself and what brings you satisfaction in life must come before following any prescribed method for improvement or success. If you love what you do, and do what you love, you don't need some guru to give you the steps to success.Flow can help you find and understand that.

We're happy when we are in flow. Unlike many of the &quot;happy psychology&quot; books that are available, this one feels true. It's also backed up by real research; the author is not a pop psychology dude but a real researcher. (I understand from the university psych community that M.C.'s work may not be universally admired, but that may simply be because it is approachable and understandable by your average educated person.)It's rare to find a book that agrees with both what I think and what I feel. For anyone who wants to have new insights into what makes us feel happy (and who doesn't?), I highly recommend this book.Additionally, I recommend his latest book, Creativity. I would skip much of his second popular book, Finding Flow, which gets into a lot of metaphysical stuff that doesn't agree with either how I feel or how I think.

That's it!&quot; I had never had a concise description of those experiences in life that practically give meaning to our existence.As a developer of online environments (MOOs) for language learning, I have had to describe to educators in presentations and published articles just what it is that makes a low-level learner of Spanish stay hooked to the Internet for *hours* while chatting away in a foreign language, and why that experience was so highly motivating that these students were neglecting other studies (in favor of a foreign language??!!) or even missing Spanish class. I have quoted Csikszentmihalyi many times because his is the best description of that experience. The students were &quot;in flow&quot; - the experience had just the right balance of stress (they might not understand me if I don't communicate clearly) and pleasure (I'm enjoying getting to know this person!) to make it highly motivating.He says on p. 74: &quot;In our studies, we found that every flow activity, whether it involved competition, chance, or any other dimension of experience, had this in common: It provided a sense of discovery, a creative feeling of transporting the person into a new reality.&quot; And that is precisely what was happening to my students when they got involved in using MOO (Multi-user-domain, Object-Oriented) for language learning. They were able to create and &quot;live&quot; in a new reality - but all in Spanish!I suspect that some of the readers of this book either have not had many flow experiences, or have not recognized them as such when they were having them.

The key to this excellent self-help book is that it helps us understand our inner self first prior to providing cheesy solutions. Just like the 12 step AA program you first have to admit something and recognize it, only then are you ready for change. After reading this book, it was easy to admit that I am not in an optimal state all the time, when perhaps I could have been.&quot;Hello, my name is Loopy and I'm not experiencing life in an optimal manner&quot;Ok, let's get serious. In this time of hostilities it is more important than ever to recognize why humans try so hard to conquer the outer world. Mihaly concentrates entirely on how to achieve flow, therefore prescribing proven techniqes to control your state of mind (inner world) and improving the quality of your life.Flow is simply immersing yourself in an activity to the point of losing sense of time. That activity can't be too hard or too easy, just enough so that you instinctively know that you are learning and expanding. Learning to effortlessly drive a golf ball, play guitar, converse, dance and work can all provide the state of Flow.Mihaly starts the book off with an interesting general visit to the happiness subject and asks all the right questions. He presents a strong argument focusing on how humans throughout history have focused on how health, beauty, money and power will be our shining knights, yet we only have to look inside ourselves and stretch ourselves to experience precious moments. That perfect golf swing. Writing a great review. Cooking a great meal. It's just too easy in our society to flick channels and grab a greasy burger. You have to create optimal moments.In the chapter discussing consciousness he tackles a tricky subject by first admitting it is a complex subject, but offers some interesting explanations. Consciousness can be &quot;intentionally ordered information&quot;. Our conscious actively shapes events for us providing a sum of all we have heard, seen, felt, hope and suffered. He is one of the only authors that I stuck with, on this complex subject. I have a clearer understanding as to why I do things. This is an important step to changing my ways.Mihaly also looks at optimal experiences in our culture, thus looking at the bigger picture. His insight in how the industrial Revolution actually shortened some lifespans and put children at work very early is a great example how our behavior evolved innocently until it was too late. Even today we are working longer hours with modern technology. Is our present culture in the optimal state? I don't think so.The book also looks at developing Flow through the body (yoga) and senses, with examples of the joy of seeing and hearing (music).The subject of Flow and work is well presented as he provides examples of how people have found optimal experiences in mundane jobs.The family is also discussed and it is easy to understand how we become dull with our family, neglecting to input energy and time.Mihaly is one of those authors that truly cares for the human race and makes an effort to solve some very complex questions with a common sense approach.

This book has a resonance of validity that can only come from extensive study and contemplation. Understanding WHY and HOW other people fill their lives with meaning and purpose can help clarify your own life. Even if you're unable to find anything in this text that can be applied to yourself, it's no less valid a study than, say, appreciating a leaf for its green-ness or how it floats to earth in the fall. This book is such an examination of one of the most basic driving forces of humanity."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"I remember seeing a review for this book that said you could pretty much summarize what it has to say in a few sentences and save yourself the time of reading over 300 pages.I think that's a legitimate criticism in that Flow feels more like a research paper than a book in its scope, and it really does make all of its salient points within the first few chapters. But to be fair, the rest of the book is still interesting and enjoyable, if not filled to the brim with new insights. The fact is that Flow presents information that may be very applicable to all of our lives. Some readers may need the full extent of the book to gather enough elaboration and real-world examples to feel like they can put the principles in action for themselves. Others may find it repetitive and unnecessary.The bottom line is this: the concepts presented in Flow are no doubt important for us to address in our lives, and even if it is much longer than it has to be, it's still far easier to read than the author's last name, which I probably still couldn't pronounce in the time it took for me to finish the book."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"This was one of the most interesting and inspiring books I've read, ever.

Since perhaps no desire than this one is more fundamental to every human being's struggle, it's hard to imagine a more important subject for a book.Csikszentmihalyi's observations, as he notes himself, are nothing new; you can find them in an array of ancient philosophies and religions, especially Eastern ones. But what makes this book so compelling and so important for contemporary readers is that he has arrived at his conclusions through over two decades of scientific research. Therefore, they are endowed with an authority and a clarity of definition which members of our cynical, secular society often find frustratingly lacking in philosophies from other times and other places. At the same time, this scientific dovetailing with the likes of Buddhism and Taoism and other systems of thought lends those &quot;religions&quot; greater substance and relevance for contemporary readers.Some enlightened souls may find the revelations here less than revelatory. Other people may find that they suddenly hear the lyrics that have been sung to them in chorus after chorus by ancient and mystical voices, and will recognize the common truths of those verses for the first time.

Or, put another way: \\"being in the zone\\" is a good feeling; learn to maximize its occurrences.Counterpoint: What if your \\"optimal experience\\" comes from participating with others in collective activity to transform the world in some essential way, such as overthrowing an economic system that is built ideologically on the centrality and benefits of maximizing individual happiness? The general theory then falls apart (it does with lesser collective goals as well). Or, more properly, it is exposed for being a philosophical variant consistent with, and thus supportive of, the way capitalism (ostensibly) works. It's not accidental that the author finds kinship with John Stuart Mill (though Mill is not listed separately in the references - and there is no index!). Other reviewers have suggested a Zen-like underpinning to the author's ideas. Whether or not that particular analysis is accurate, he does not have kind words for those who \\"try to achieve happiness on their own, with the support of a faith...\\" In Csikszentmihalyi's view, the latter are chiefly out for wealth, power and sex. So that's what atheism is all about! (btw, what's wrong with sex as a \\"chief goal?\\")I came across this book from it being on the U.S. Ski Team's recommended reading list. Stripped of it's general approach and put in the context of focused effort, i.e., allowing oneself to get into the moment and learning to stay there, it can be a helpful psychological tool for those who have trouble doing that. Almost all of us do at least at some moment or another. But if going with the flow is frequently difficult to achieve, then there's likely a lot more that needs dealing with - and one's psychology may (or may not) be the center of it.Csikszentmihalyi's Optimal Experience is another cognitively-centered psychological approach to dealing with life. If, however, you believe that we are primarily products of our environment (actually multiple environments), and that willful human consciousness can be powerful but operates within a very narrow realm, then his general approach will not only seem thin, but also at heart anti-Darwinian."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"He recommends that rather than finding happiness through the perspective of a worldview, religion, or philosophy, its better to immerse yourself in activity. This seems like the worst possible advise to someone who's truly seeking happiness.What happens when something causes someone to temporarily or permanently stop their &quot;flow&quot; activity? Say an athlete has a paralyzing car accident. He then has no hope of happiness?The author glosses over the influence of religion and worldview much too quickly. At the very least these things give a sense of perspective and clarity. At the most they give an overwhelming source of joy and purpose, and the prospect of eternal hope. Immersing ones self in activity, no matter how temporarily rewarding, is only delaying the inevitable unhappiness, if that's the state of your soul.I don't deny the benefit of having a job or career you love, and finding &quot;flow&quot; activities that give you a temporary sense of achievement, but I would argue that &quot;optimal experience&quot; comes from a having a purpose far beyond the work environment."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"According to the author, flow is a state of mind when it is totally engrossed in an activity that it looses track of itself and becomes one with the activity being performed. The author supports this with excerpts from interviews with people (rock climbers, artists, musicians etc) who are involved in flow-producing activities.However, the author never addresses why a person would choose one flow producing activity over another or should people cram as many flow producing activities in their lives as possible. Instead the author attempts to apply the conditions that create flow to turn even the most mundane activities into flow producing activities! In effect, he is saying, &quot;Stop whining you lot, use these techniques known to produce flow to make your job more interesting&quot;. The author contends that people are dissatisfied because of lack of flow in their activities which gets them bored sooner or later. Cant people be bored of always being in flow too? How is it different from being temporarily entertained by a good film?The work is good in that it documents the mechanics of flow but disappoints by not discussing the role of passion/liking of the performer for his chosen activity - which is probably why he repeatedly engages in it; flow being a pleasant by-product but not an end in itself."},{"Title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.","review":"When I first read FLOW in graduate school, I was struck by the simple idea of it: being absorbed in whatever you're doing leads to flow, which usually leads to feeling you're living a meaningful life. I now use &quot;flow&quot; as a lens to consider everything; so many people seem so miserable because they haven't found their flow activity, or haven't been willing or able to make room for it in their lives. In my own book, WRITING IN FLOW, for which Csikszentmihalyi wrote the Foreword, I was able to apply these ideas to a writing life, which shows their universality. My life hasn't been the same since!

Some of the author's scientific research on this topic is also discussed.

Flow is his attempt to explain these ideas to a large, mainstream audience.The strengths:This book gives a lot of great information about ways that people derive enjoyment, engagement, and happiness in the work they do. His definition of psychic entropy was a particular revelation for me: the idea that a mind at rest tends to fill up with negative and occasionally crazy thoughts (OK, this is a slight exaggeration, but still). The author shares his thoughts and observations on how anyone can try to find fulfillment and satisfaction through mental and physical pursuits.Generally speaking, this is just a great book about finding happiness and satisfaction in your life by looking for quite a spectrum of experiences to full engage yourself.The areas for improvement:As good and wonderful as this book is, it can be a bit of a tough slog, especially for today's reader who scans and looks for landmarks rather than taking a book one word at a time.Other points of interest:I have read any of the author's other books, but I'm looking forward to checking out his book on creativity.

According to Csikszen (for short), flow is more or less being a state of involvement with an an activity - work, sports, whatever - to the point where everything else it tuned out. Csikszen even goes so far as to say that this is in fact happiness.I have various issues with this book. For one, it is boring. Csikszen's concept is flow is interesting for about five pages, and then it starts drag. Although expressing the concept through a variety of different stories and examples, monotonous redundancy quickly set in.Secondly, Csikszen doesn't seem to achieve exellence in any department. This is neither a good self-help book nor a ground-breaking piece of science. And for all the psychology I have read, I would be hardpressed to label this psychology either. In any event, it is certainly not good psychology. It is just one overly simple view of what happiness is, expressed over and over again as Csikszen recounts the experiences of different sujects \\"flowing\\".Finally, the book completely side-steps a real treatment of psychological neuroses. If you are unhappy because you suffer from serious issues that must be understood, contextualized and overcome, this is not the book for you. This book naively assumes that all problems vanish or are forgotten forever by focusing on the moment - and as far as the author is concerned, it doesn't matter what one focuses on. I picture a manic-depressive \\"flowing\\" on legos all day (my favorite form of flow). The Kids in the Hall film, \\"Brain Candy,\\" quickly comes to mind.This is a trifling book that is not worth your time. If you are interested in \\"flowing\\" in the first place, you need not read the book, because it will get you no closer to the immaculate \\"flow\\" experience. That said, if you are looking for ethically-charged, important, consequencial type of flow, seek out your local Buddhist organization.

The second is that it is filled with vague generalities that don't fit into any recognizable scientific or psychological norms. It is essentially one man's take on what it means to be happy. As a definition of happiness, it sort of works, but there isn't really any substance to the book. Filled with oblique metaphor, anecdotal evidence, and a loosely defined spiritualism that is most similar to Zen Buddhism, the book does nothing to provide any answers on how one can truly be happy. The pursuit of 'flow,' admirable as it may be, is in no way definable as making one happy any more than any other esoteric personal philosophy. If you're interested in the nature of happiness or in invigorating your own creative spirit, there are much better resources available.2/5 Stars.

The interface of pyschology and spirituality is fascinating and this book brings us right to the heart of that junction where we can access much higher principles of living through a practical, real world application of research and experience. Using a significant body of research, Csikszentmihalyi delves into the question of why are we here and what is our purpose. He gets there by studying optimal experience. What is happiness? How can we sustain it given the randomness of life? He supports the rather convenient conclusion that our purpose is what we decide it will be by illustrating the necessity of ordering our consciousness through focused activiities. Actions that lead to something, somewhere. He beautifully conveys the idea that our goals in life, while deemed valuable by either ourselves or our conditioning, are not apt to be valuable if not for the committment of our actions over time. That it is really this focus that brings value to any activity and goal. Further, if we want to extend meaning to our entire life, we need to find a way to tie all of our focused activity into a theme. Thus our life efforts can provide both meaningful experience and valuable results. He offers guidance as to how to tie our decisions about our life-theme into a greater whole, for example, how traumatic experience can provide the opportunity for transcendence by helping others avoid similar trauma. The last chapter, which offers the big picture perspective of the material, was particularly uplifting and helpful as I travel a journey of 'figuring out what I want to be when I grow up'."},{"Title":"Rain on the River: New and Selected Poems and Short Prose","review":"Too much is made of obscure, humorless poets with grad school vocabularies and a tenth grade idea of what passes for truth.

I read this book because I felt that I needed more of a background to help understand some of the other books that I have been reading, but I do not feel that this book satisfied my needs. I found this surprising because while the author was an Oxford Professor he was at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Princeton when he wrote this book, and I therefore expected more of an accommodation to an American's lack of knowledge of English history.Because the book covers about 2000 years of history (from Roman times to the end of WWI), it required that the history would of necessity be sketchy at best and that decisions would have to be made as to what to cover and in what detail. The author clearly took the position that the reader was familiar with the basics, so he chose to concentrate on other, less covered, aspects. However, I do not feel that this assumption was warranted for the average American reader. A reader from the UK, or an American with a degree in English history might have the required background knowledge, but it was not true for me, and I suspect for most other American readers.I found the book deficient, and for me only warranted a 3-star rating, because:1) There are no maps, so I had to continually refer to an atlas in order understand the geographical references.2) I think that the book would have been greatly improved for a reader like myself if there were an appendix listing the Kings and Queens the periods of their reign. Likewise, I would have liked a listing of the Prime Ministers. All the royalty is mentioned, but mostly just in passing, and there is no complete discussion of all of the political leaders, although there is some discussion of the most important of them.3) The author takes a lot of background for granted. For instance, there is no discussion of the distinction between Whigs and Tories, or of the more modern political alignments (Conservatives, Liberals and Labor). Likewise, there is little or no discussion of the religious distinctions between Presbyterians, Puritans and Anglicans. The Anti Corn-Law League and Welsh non-conformists are mentioned, but there is no explanation of the Corn-Laws or what the Welsh were not conforming to. No explanation might be necessary for someone educated in the UK, but such references are puzzling for others like myself.4) Important rulers are just mentioned in passing (Queen Victoria is mentioned in four places, but just in passing). Henry VIII gets a bit more of a mention, but not very much in view of his immense impact on English history. Most of the other Kings and Queens are only mentioned briefly, with almost no discussion of what went on during their reign. Likewise, Disraeli is mentioned in four places, but just in passing. Gladstone also only warrants four passing references, and Asquith is mentioned in passing only three times.5) While many of the most important figures of English history (at least to my American eyes) are given short shrift, there are long sections on many sociological issues such as agrarian reform and poverty. (I do not mean to imply that these subjects are not important, only that I felt that they were overweighed compared to many other aspects of English history.)6) Professor Woodward's area of expertise is Modern History and as a result he spends much more time on the events of the 19th and early 20th century than on earlier periods."},{"Title":"The vampire;: An anthology,","review":"This book is REALLY hard to find, but if you're really interested in the origins of Vampiric legends and folklore (not a &#34;fan&#34; who belongs to a Vampire Club), this is a good introduction.

The eleven literary critical essays examine Plath's work and life and are connected through each author's experience using Plath's archives.The books two sections divide the essays into the following themes: The Plath Archive and Culture and the Politics of Memory. Plath's archives are divided between the Lilly Library at Indiana University, Bloomington, and the Mortimer Rare Book Room at Smith College. The essays in this section concern themselves with \\"newly published, underutilized, and underrepresented material.\\" (8) Tracy Brain, Robin Peel, Kathleen Connors, and Kate Moses examine various aspects of the Plath archive. Brain discusses Plath's Ariel manuscripts and the recent publication of Ariel: The restored edition. Peel continues to draw out Plath's interest in politics, following his 2002 monograph Writing Back: Sylvia Plath and Cold War politics in his survey of Plath's political education. Kathleen Connors, mastermind behind the 2002 exhibition Eye Rhymes and co-editor of a forthcoming book under the same title, discusses the riches of Plath's visual works, a skill which was highly developed at an early age. Moses draws on the audio recordings of Plath's voice in a variety of poetry readings and interviews conducted from 1958 through early 1963.The essays in the second part, Culture and the Politics of Memory, \\"reflects the opening up of critical approaches to Plath and also the explosion of the canon.\\" These essays explore \\"works that have received less critical attention\\" but also drawn on the \\"heightened awareness of the contexts and settings that have mediated our understanding of Plath's multiple identities.\\" (8) Essays by Sandra Gilbert, Ann Keniston, Janet Badia, Anita Helle, Marsha Bryant, Lynda K. Bundtzen, and Diane Middlebrook each present valuable insight and opinion on Plath's work and help to continue a re-evaluation of critical reception.The publication of this book, on the radar for about a year, it is well-received like a delayed plane finally reaching its destination. Two enthusiastic thumbs up; my only regret is that I don't have more thumbs..."},{"Title":"The Unraveling Archive: Essays on Sylvia Plath","review":"The chief value of this book is that it gives readers access to the archives that Plath biographers rely on to construct their narratives.

I can't recommend this book highly enough, it's probably one of the greatest books I've ever read. It inspired, lifted, and encouraged me greatly. It took my heart on a journey that I pray I never forget. This book has been out of print for many years, and to have these copies available is priceless. I refer back to my copy year after year and it continues to refresh and feed my soul in many ways. You will find a treasure and a friend in Hudson Taylor.

Each recipe has pictures of both preparation and the finished product. There is a better variety of recipes than most basic cookie books which recycle the same basic dough into several \\"different\\" cookies.

We used it in Geology (specifically, geomorphology- the study of landforms) but it also has applications in geography, conservation, forestry, and surveying.The best part of the book is its organization by type of landform: wind action (dunes), ground water (Karst topography), mass movements (landslides, slumping, and flows), glaciers, effects of glaciation (U-shaped valleys, moraines, kettles, drumlines, cirques, etc.), lakes, marshes, and abondoned shorelines, desert land forms, marine coastlines, stream deposits (meanders, oxbow lakes, braided channels, and deltas), stream erosion and erosion cycles, volcanic features, and meteor crators. There is also a section on lithology (descriminating of rock types.) In addition there are sections on vegitation types, soils, and cultural features and urban areas. All of these subject areas are illustrated by multiple examples.You will of course need a stereoscope to use this book, but the inexpensive student model will work just fine. In fact, the vertical exageration really makes the features \\"pop\\" out- even to the untrained eye. You will be able to spot most types of landforms from the air after studying this book, as well as, outcrops of strata and structures. This is a big help in preliminary mapping- and prospecting- surveys."},{"Title":"AERIAL STEREO PHOTOGRAPHS: For stereoscope viewing in geology, geography, conservation, forestry, surveying,","review":"Brilent book for geomorphology study that allows you to see land scapes in 3d look by using stereoscope, great seller..

The photographs show us everyday life from a 'you are there' stand point without all of the verbiage of a reporter or professional writer. I have several students who have enlisted with different branches of the military and this book is opportunity for them to see the mundane side of war as well as the brotherhood that war creates. Each snapshot is a story in itself. We have gone from the first TV war, Vietnam, to the first digital war, Iraq. Americans will get a mixed bag of life as they go through each of these photos."},{"Title":"This Is Our War: A Soldiers' Portfolio: Servicemen's Photographs of Life in Iraq","review":"The war in Iraq is different in many ways. One that I hadn't recogniced was the impact of digital cameras on how the war is recorded. Soldiers have always taken photographs -- in fact a new book has just been published on Patton's Photographs. But the advent of inexpenswive digital cameras means that virtually any soldier can have one.In Iraq the ready availability of e-mail means that pictures taken by the soldiers and by his loved ones at home can be transmitted in an instant. Pictures can be taken without film and erased if they are no longer needed.GQ Magazine managed to get some 10,000 photographs taken by the soldiers in Iraq. These are not the highly polished pictures you will see taken by the photojournalists, these are pictures taken by the grunts and lower level officers of their day to day life. It's an awesome book. One I found hard to put down, going through it several times."},{"Title":"This Is Our War: A Soldiers' Portfolio: Servicemen's Photographs of Life in Iraq","review":"As I write this review, it is Memorial Day in the United States, a time for remembering those who have sacrificed in conflicts past and present in defense of the nation. We are currently engaged in a conflict, one like no other in many ways (however, I am reminded of the words of Anthony Swofford, who wrote 'Jarhead', that every war is different, and every war is the same). One of the differences of the war in Iraq is the ubiquitous nature of personal recording devices - virtually every soldier and marine on the ground there has a digital camera, a cell phone that takes pictures, a video camera, or other way of making a personal chronicle. This gives a remarkable view and insight into the daily life and work of those who are fighting in Iraq.This book is a collection of these photos. They are not professional-quality photojournalistic spreads - quite a number of pictures are blurry, grainy, or otherwise lacking in what would be considered 'professional' aspects. However, what they lack in that regard is more than made up for in the individual power of the subjects - the subjects in this case being both the photographers and the photographed.The pictures here show victory and defeat, as such comes in small and larger ways each day in Iraq. There is hope and there is despair, but above all there is humanity, and this book captures current history in its most basic raw form.This book has no particular political bent - like many images and icons, those contained here will be subject to multiple interpretations. What I took most from this is the need to remember those in the pictures, and realise that these are people who, like me, hope for a time beyond the war, and that such a time may come soon. This book is a tribute to current day heroes."},{"Title":"This Is Our War: A Soldiers' Portfolio: Servicemen's Photographs of Life in Iraq","review":"An interesting book made up of photos by the Soldiers, Marines, Sailors and Airmen who served in Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar. In this age of digital photography not only can anyone take a photo but they can review it in real time and when you have access to the internet you can send it home or to friends. This book reflects a wide variety of experiences of those fighting in Operation Iraqi Freedom: the grittiness, the discomfort (or relative comfort), the danger... it's all here in color."},{"Title":"This Is Our War: A Soldiers' Portfolio: Servicemen's Photographs of Life in Iraq","review":"This book is so much more than a collection of photographs. War in the digital age has provided our society with so many photographs and videos that we have become less and less affected by media coverage. This book, however, uses images taken by the soldiers themselves. As you view each page, as you read each caption, you find yourself transported to the war. Imagine snapping a photo of your battle buddies one moment, and in the next losing them to a mortar attack.This collection of work will leave you smiling, crying, and hopefully thinking."},{"Title":"This Is Our War: A Soldiers' Portfolio: Servicemen's Photographs of Life in Iraq","review":"This is not National Geographic stuff, but if you find that being able to combine war coverage from the eyes of soldiers with a documentary approach of photojournalism done by complete amateurs, then you will be impressed. The book takes pictures that our brave young men and women shot with a simple digital camera and turns them into life in Iraq for our armed forces. Sometimes it's humorous and sometimes it's serious, but all the time, it is real and from the eyes of soldiers.I love it and I recommend it."},{"Title":"This Is Our War: A Soldiers' Portfolio: Servicemen's Photographs of Life in Iraq","review":"THIS IS OUR WAR: A SOLDIERS' PORTFOLIO: SERVICEMEN'S PHOTOGRAPHS OF LIFE IN IRAQ is simply outstanding: it offers powerful and personal photos all taken by the men and women serving in Iraq, thus going beyond a reporter's outsider impressions to provide nearly three hundred images culled from tens of thousands GQ collected from servicemen and women.

I was re-reading \\"Thanksgiving Again\\" the other day and was stricken by something I had not noticed when I first read the book. Originally, I saw in these stories the heart of an author who liked to reminisce about the past and who is moved easily in the present. Now, looking at the stories that make up this book for a second time, it seems to me that the author is nostalgic for an entire era that has passed. \\"Thanksgiving Again\\" is a good read for those of us who remember \\"The Holidays\\" before they became just \\"the holidays.\\""},{"Title":"On the aesthetic education of man, in a series of letters","review":"Writing in the 1790s, Schiller united the rigorous epistemology of Kant and Fichte with Plato's dynamic account of the development of the soul to produce one of the most beautiful works of philosophy in the European tradition. The Letters on Aesthetic Education offer an interpretation of the development of the individual and the parallel development of Western civilization. These interpretations focus on the conditions that allow for mental health in a human individual and society, and especially demonstrate (as the title indicates) the crucial role of artistic experience in healthy human development. This is a great work, and a great introduction to the other German philosophers of the 19th Century (Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, et al). This edition is very good: the translation is good, and it has a facing German text. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"On the aesthetic education of man, in a series of letters","review":"Friedrich Schiller composed in a series of 'letters' a profound, stimulating and important reflection on the relevance of our aesthetic experience. He was influenced by his contemporary Immanuel Kant and goes on to explore the implications that emerge from our understanding of the sublime in relation to culture, society and our own edification. His short and erudite expositions reflect his response to the tumultuous times that existed at the end of the 18th Century. His 'letters' are insightful of a man who wants his readers to make a difference to the ennoblement of life rather than descend to the easy pursuit of the superficialities that are just as obvious in our lives today."},{"Title":"On the aesthetic education of man, in a series of letters","review":"Ok here's a little pop culture bit to sweeten the mighty load of Friedrich Schiller: The intellectuals of this period, inspired and defined by Goethe's seminal teen-angst classic The Sorrows of Young Werther. Werther's style is still seen today in the goth subculture- moopy, depressed, poetic, etc. Basically that's a combination of Anglo Byronic romanticism and German romanticism. One of the main symbols of the Werther/Schiller era of German Romanticism is the blue flower of Novalis. (Wiki)I see Schiller as being the actual embodiment of the Werther character, particularly after finishing the Aesthetic Educations of Man, a book I've now read three different times (undergraduate, law school, last month.) That's probably because I see this book as kind of the birth of Romantic Pop Culture. Basically, Schiller took Kantian idealism and crossed it with a popular format (i.e. they're written as \\"letters\\") Unlike Kant, you can actually read Schiller, since this book is only 140 pages long.The reason this book is still relevant is that Kantian idealism underlays most popular manifestations of Romanticism, but most people who consider themselves \\"Romantics\\" literally have no idea what Kantian idealism means. Myself included. Thus, by reading this one 140 page book, you can kind of get a handle on the relationship, and gain a better understanding of artists who are influenced by this time period. Like Depeche Mode... or, for a more hipster specific reference, Dr. Octagon's classic Blue Flowers. Cue lyrics:Look at the land... Blue Flowers!Drawing by the purple pond, in the purple pastures Blue Flowers!Drawing by the purple pond, yellow ink that flows Blue FlowersRomanticism runs strong and deep in all of the Western nations. It is, in fact, the primary ideology for people dissatisfied with reality Just think about the prevalence of the \\"lonely hero.\\" It's also the primary posture of artists of all stripes. The more \\"popular\\" the art, the more romantic it is likely to be.Romanticism is both current and 400+ years old. Thus, contemporary artists can manipulate the audience by being more aware of the symbols and modes of thought of something like Romanticism, since the listener WILL respond: Think of all the people wearing Depeche Mode T-Shirts with Blue Flowers and Tour Dates printed on the back. That's pure, unadulterated, 18th century German Romanticism. The modern artist is inevitably an interpreter/re-interpreter of symbols with long-standing cultural resonance."},{"Title":"Gas Dynamics","review":"I used this book in Graduate School at Purdue in a Gas Dynamics class taught by the co-author, J.D.

It was written during the war and complied afterwards. As such it includes a volume, seemingly written during the war, and two written afterward, as well as the text of several victory speeches concerning the navy. also included is a brief overview of the Marine Corps role on the Western front.I enjoyed the subject matter and it flowed at a good pace for the most part. I had little knowledge of WWI naval operations before hand so I cannot testify to the depth of the material presented.My biggest gripe is the lack of potentially interesting points due to secrecy necessary during war time. Normally this would not be an issue, I don't mind tangential learning, but it is hard to look up information on anything WWI era. I would have loved to learn more about specific anti submarine technology as well as specific methods for Naval operations, mentioned but not elaborated on. Another complaint would be the propaganda feel throughout the book, it is littered with pro US bias.I liked \\"Our Navy in the War,\\" it is no masterpiece nor a comprehensive overview of US Navy in WWI, but for the price you could do worse."},{"Title":"America in the war : Our Navy in the War","review":"I selected this book because it was in the World War II category.

From the first story on, the excitement of encountering a new (to me) brilliant writer went through me like an electric shock. The book injected an excitement and alertness into what otherwise might have been a sluggish weekend.I have found, however, that explaining the basis of this excitement to others is not easy. It comes down to the difficulty of explaining what it is that makes great writers truly great -- an elusive insight.Part of it is simple virtuosity; Cortazar possesses that which also distinguishes the writing of other greats such as Nabokov and Proust: that facility with language, the ability to find and to manipulate exactly the right words, to create a precise, vivid image, and to make music out of prose. (Note: I could perceive his virtuosity even though I read this book as an English translation.)But it goes beyond virtuosity. If Cortazar wrote about ideas to which I was indifferent, the writing would not matter to me. But his stories inspire those flashes of recognition that make reading exciting; he creates those \\"aha\\" moments through his ability to present a feeling or situation that you recognize on some level, even if it's one that never previously made it out of your subconscious and which you might not have thought to remark upon, had not Cortazar dug it up for you.From the general to the specific: This is a collection of short stories, most of which contain an element of the fantastic. Some of the flashes of recognition that I mention above are recognitions of mundane, daily feelings, but others are not. Cortazar seems to have ready access as well to our subconscious fears and to our dreams.To take but a few cases in point:One story involves a brother and sister who share a large, old wooden house, once owned by their great grandparents. At one point in the story, they hear voices and commotion from another part of the house. They bolt the doors, shut off that section, and confine themselves to living in the front part of the house. It's all left quite mysterious: Cortazar never explains who \\"they\\" are, who have taken over part of the house. But someting about this story rings eerily true; it's that bizarre combination of vivid, mundane reality, and unexplained phenomena, and illogical reactions to those phenomena, that characterize dreams.Another example is a story in which a young girl goes to live with distant relatives in their country house for a summer. The house has a tiger roaming the rooms, but let's put that aside: what is remarkable about the story is Cortazar's ability to bring the scene to life, of an urbanite or suburbanite who is new to this comparatively relaxed environment. In one small, but typically rendered scene, the main character finds a bug crawling in an antiquated wash basin. She flicks at it, it curls into a ball, and she easily washes it down with running water. This is classic Cortazar; with a few well-chosen sentences, he puts you in that world: a world where the reader senses the sunlight through the house, the smell of pollen in the air, the renewed emphasis on the freshness of vegetables at the local market, and the ease with such inconveniences as older plumbing and intrusions by bugs are encountered.Comparison with other writers is a bit unfair, because Cortazar has a voice all of his own. But in case it's helpful to you, Cortazar's precise prose reminded me a bit of Nabokov, his sense of wonder and magic recalled Steven Millhauser, and his trafficking in paradoxes a bit like Borges. But he's not quite like any of them: his prose focuses less than Borges on logical contradictions, and is more weighted toward precisely rendering sensory images.Several of the stories are outstanding. My favorites (in addition to the two mentioned above: \\"House Taken Over\\", and \\"Bestiary\\") included:Axolotls -- in which the narrator identifies very closely with an exotic amphibian species on his trips to the zoo.A Yellow Flower -- an encounter with a sort of reincarnation gone awryContinuity of Parks -- a very economical, very short story with an eerie, paradoxical twistThe Night Face Up -- a story in which reality and dreams are very difficult to distinguishCortazar is a master of the short story form. I would recommend him to anyone who likes the works of Borges, Millhauser, Nabokov, or Bruno Schulz."},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"Julio Cortazar reminds me more of the late great Spanish film director, Luis Bunuel, one of the founding fathers of Surrealism, who once remarked that, when writing a film, he always aimed for whatever was most disturbing in any given situation. Similarly, Cortazar's stories are all constructed around a disturbing vision. In &quot;The End of the Game,&quot; for instance, three children don bizarre costumes and assume attitudes for the passengers on the trains that zip by them.&quot;Blow-Up&quot; is very different from Antonioni's film. There is a menace in the interplay between the photographer, his unwitting subjects, and a third party who was watching both.My favorite story in the collection is &quot;The Pursuer,&quot; a nakedly brilliant study of a black American Jazz musician and the critic who never quite understands the demons that give birth to the music. The story is dedicated to Ch. P., who I assume is Charley Parker. Cortazar's musician lives on the edge and is plagued by disturbing visions as he spirals down into a personal apocalypse. The critic, on the other hand, tries ineffectually to help the musician, but is more worried about what people will say about his latest study of the musician's work.Cortazar's stories take place in a kind of half-European, half-Latin Neverland. Born in Belgium of Argentinian parents, he spent most of his life in Europe. It is as if the author's self-exile gave birth to a demon of restlessness that possessed his characters.Although this is the first Cortazar I have read, it will not be the last."},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"Julio Cortazar is a revolutionary but one far from home and not a political revolutionary but one that roams the further reaches of the psyche, just beyond where civilization says it is safe to go. Every single one of his many short stories is worth reading(so, if available, get all of them). His novels I find too experimental and mired in his theories but in the short story he shines like very few others. Some of his best are told through a childs perspective and all of his shorter fictions in a way take you into that kind of place where wonder still outweighs any learned way of seeing &quot;reality&quot; which in Cortazar is always in quotes. Cortazar likes to take you out of your normal context and give you a whole new set of associations, a whole new world to walk in. His novels are difficult but his stories are not. They invite the best kinds of speculation but they can also be appreciated at a glance. Cortazar is reputed to have had a very large record collection, mostly jazz, in his Paris lair in the sixties. I think he is one of those authors who would have been very interesting to know. Hip to the way peoples perception of the world were changing at the time, but persistent in his personal quests which led him down many strange avenues. To this his stories will attest. A note: Cortazar is sometimes grouped in with Borges and there are some good reasons why but I prefer Cortazar. Both play games with logic but Cortazar pleases both the mind and the emotions. The effect is more subtle."},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"Cortazar is one of the most amazing writers in Latin American literature. He is also almost completely unknown in the US. As far as this goes, then, this translation fills a huge gap; and one of this book's merits is that it makes Cortazar and his stories more widely known.The translation itself, however, is subpar. You will certainly get the gist of the stories, and since a large part of Cortazar's stories hinge on the plot lines, you will definitely enjoy this book. However, just as much (in my opinion) of Cortazar's genius lies in his use of language as it does in his crazy imagination. And, I'm very sorry to say, this translation really doesn't do justice to him at all.My recommendation, then: if you have never read Cortazar, this book will provide an excellent introduction to his works. Until a better translation is available, we must do with what we have: Cortazar is definitely worthwhile, no matter how much gets lost in the translation. Don't expect, however, full justice to be made to Cortazar's use of language. As is usual in these cases, the best way to read him is to tackle him in Spanish."},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"Cortazar was one of the more unearthly literary geniuses of the 20th century; like Borges and Nabokov I return to his short stories often (more than a decade after first discovering them), and can still get new things out of them.I agree with previous reviewers - Cortazar's precision with language rivals Nabokov, Kafka, Proust or Borges. I would add another comparison as well - though the intent is quite different, the very musical and restless, rhythmic sensuality of the writing also recalls the best of Lawrence Ferlinghetti - both were fluent in and inspired by jazz culture, and Cortazar is confident enough in his expertise to be willing to explore and shape language with an engaged, fluent playfulness. This gave him a rare ability to create extraordinary and unforgettable worlds throught this (and other) collections.This anthology is a great introduction to Cortazar, with many of my personal favorites: \\"Night Face Up,\\" \\"Idol Of The Cyclades,\\" \\"House Taken Over\\" and \\"Axolotl\\" are all unforgettable short fictions. I wouldn't stop there - Cortazar's other writing is well worth investigating (especially the second story collection, ALL FIRES THE FIRE). Cortazar seems to be sliding into unfortunate obscurity (in the English-speaking world, at least) as of late, with a number of key works currently out of print in translation. Thankfully, and for the time being, this is not one of them.-David Alston"},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"In this book are collected some of the most well-known short stories of the great Latin American writer, Julio Cortazar. Cortazar was a great experimental writer (his most famous novel, \\"Hopscotch\\", was a pre-cursor to future hyper-text novels) who drew his inspiration from French Symbolism, Surrealism and the improvisational nature of Free Jazz.Fellow Argentine, Jorge Luis Borges, once famously stated that there was no way of retelling the plot of a Cortazar story - he was absolutely right. The plot is minimal for many of the stories in this collection and in a sense, it is subsidiary. The \`essence' of a Cortazar story is largely ineffable. Attempting to capture it in words leads one to fumble just the way that his characters do (see, for example, the short story \\"The Idol of the Cyclades\\" or \\"The Pursuer\\"). In Cortazar's fictions, reality and fantasy are separated by a permeable membrane and the proper way to read his writing is to experience it, to exercise to the fullest extent possible one's sense of empathy with the writing, in a sense, to merge with it. Indeed, this merging of the fantastic and real, of several viewpoints, is a recurring theme in this collection of short stories - it is most fully manifest in \\"Axolotl\\" wherein the young boy becomes obsessed with the axolotls to the point where he actually becomes one. However, the theme also recurs in \\"The Distances\\", \\"A Yellow Flower\\" and \\"The Continuity of Parks.\\"Many of the stories are a bit like the Taoist parable of Chuang Tzu who dreamed that he was a butterfly but upon waking was no longer sure whether he was a man who dreamt that he was a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming that he was a man. Cortazar's stories seem to exist in kind of quantum superposition states where both one and the other are simultaneously being realized -- this is literature at the Planck scale. Probably no other author has managed to capture, in writing, the feel of the uncanny as masterfully as Cortazar has. There is a sense of unease, half-hinted, that permeates through almost the entire collection. This barely expressible sense of a discordant note is especially evident in \\"The House Taken Over\\", \\"Letter to a Young Lady in Paris\\", \\"The Night Face Up\\" (a stand-out story which for me had some similarities to Borges' story, \\"The South\\"), \\"Bestiary\\", \\"Blow-up\\" (on which the Michelangelo Antonioni film was loosely based) and \\"Secret Weapons.\\"I suspect that I will be returning to many of these stories in the future as they seem to welcome repeated visits. Not all of the stories were of equal quality for me - some were less enjoyable than others. In discussing Cortazar as a novelist Borges once commented \\"He is trying so hard on every page to be original that it becomes a tiresome battle of wits, no?\\" To a certain extent, I felt the same way about some of the short stories in this collection, though quite possibly this is because I am not a sophisticated enough reader of post-modernist literature.Overall however, reading the collection was an enjoyable experience which I recommend to other readers. Some of the stories are sure to persist in one's memory as beautifully strange, haunting experiences, inviting repeated visits."},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"There is an often obsessive, dreamlike quality to the writing of Julio Cortaz&aacute;r, and this quality is typically conveyed through the most prosaic and plausible details.Cortaz&aacute;r, an Argentinean, was born in Brussels in 1914, raised in Buenos Aires, and spent most of his career in Paris, where he died in 1984. He wrote with an exile's knowledge of the transitional and malleable characteristics of identity and reality, and this is one of the major themes of the stories contained in this classic collection translated by the poet, Paul Blackburn.A cosmopolitan and international literary figure in his lifetime, Cortaz&aacute;r was influenced by Poe, the French Symbolists, and the Surrealists, and he shared with them a penchant for subject matter of a mysterious and metaphysical nature, and a pronounced radical outlook. What set him apart were the highly credible, even mundane situations and circumstances that he invented in his stories as springboards to the fantastic.Take, for example, the story that lends its title to this collection, and to Michaelangelo Antonioni's celebrated film that it inspired, \\"Blow-Up.\\" In Cortaz&aacute;r's original story, set in Paris, (not Swinging London, as in the film), the protagonist is a translator and amateur photographer, who observes a young woman and an adolescent boy in a public square, and casually shoots the scene with his Contax 1.1.2. He later develops the film, enlarges the picture, and by studying the blow-up surmises that the woman was attempting to seduce the boy for an older man sitting in a nearby car.The photographic scene, and the botched assignation it depicts, encroaches on the photographer's life, and he speaks of himself both in the fist person and third persons in the story. \\"Nobody really knows who is telling it, if I am I or what actually occurred or what I'm seeing,\\" he says, \\"Or if, simply I'm telling a truth which is only my truth.\\" As the photographer is a translator by trade, the statement increases in complexity and levels of meaning.(In his film version, Antonioni borrowed the story's theme of \\"appearance versus reality,\\" and wove from it an open-ended murder mystery. It is fascinating to read phrases from this very different story, and to see how they were reinterpreted and re-imagined in the Italian director's first English language film.)Another story, \\"Axolotl,\\" is told by a human narrator who so identifies with the axolotls (the larval stage of a certain species of salamander) in an aquarium that he actually becomes an axolotl. The character does not assume his non-human identity dramatically as the character Gregor Samsa does in Kafka's \\"Metamorphosis,\\" but rather through a process of protracted observation and empathy with these languid creatures. In the course of the story he speaks of humans and axolotls in both the first person and third persons.This story hints at the covert political content of Cortaz&aacute;r's writing of this period, and it is not too much of a stretch to interpret this transition from human to non-human, and active to motionless creature as a veiled critique of political inaction and social conformity--maybe even that of the exile's position of distance and non-engagement.The other thirteen tales in the collection are each distinguished by their own exquisite details, absurd reality, and plausible implausibility.In the end, it seems unfair to marginalize Cortaz&aacute;r as a \\"Latin American Writer,\\" (or \\"Magic Realist\\"), and the labels seems as inadequate and imprecise as tagging Joyce an \\"Irish Writer,\\" or Nabokov a \\"Russian Writer.\\" Like these other literary exiles, Cortaz&aacute;r invented his own worlds, and created a singular oeuvre universal in its themes, and unique in its imagination."},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"Julio Cortazar is probably one of the best writers of short fiction! I found a collection of his writing by accident years ago while looking through the latin american writers (I was obsessed with Gabriel Garcia Marquez.)

It detracted considerably from the story, and the enjoyment of reading.

Is there a review planned for the present version?RegardsJames"},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"Cortazar is one of my favorite writers, and I bought this intending it as a gift for a friend of mine who cannot read Spanish. Unfortunately, I will have to find another gift, because this translation is going right back to Amazon.The translation is awful. Specifically, the flow of the English is choppy and is full of direct translations from Spanish idioms that sound awkward. The translator fails to convey the brilliantly chatty and colloquial style in which Cortazar wrote in Spanish.This basically reads like the translator, Paul Blackburn, was being paid by the page and cared nothing for the text that he was translating. This is not unlikely; the translation dates from 1967, long before anyone knew that Cortazar would end up being one of the most important Latin American writers of the 20th century. The fact that the translator's name does not ever appear on the cover of the latest edition attests to the fact that even the publisher is aware of the bad quality of his work.If you want to read Cortazar, look elsewhere! Something by a different translator, I'd say. One of the masters of the Spanish prose does not deserve to be read like this."},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"If you want to read creative, inventive, fabulous stories of the unreality of everyday life, you must look back into Latin American Literature for the past 30-40 years. It is all there, Borges, Cortazar, sabato, Garcia Marquez, their stories are so spectacular, they make all other literature pale in comparison, all of Cortazars short stories are wonderful, a collected edition of all his works should come out. they show they magic, pathos, and power of what happens when someone walks down a street, boards a train, and enters another reality, sometimes just be reading a book."},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"\`\` A short story can be taken in at a single glance while a work of three hundred pages depends on padding, on pages that are mere nexuses between one part and another. On the other hand, it is possible for everything to appear essential in a short story.''- Jorge Luis Borges.Besides being considered among the great modern Latin American authors, Cortazar is also a poet, translator and an amateur jazz musician. This collection of short stories provides us a glimpse of his fertile imagination.In one story the protagonist's mind gets trapped into a fish's body, much like Kafka's \`Metamorphosis'. In \`Blow-up', a photograph assumes real life proportions, reminiscent of Poe's fantastic works. The \`Letter to a Young Lady in Paris' conveys the perplexity of a young woman who vomits up rabbits. \`Continuity of Parks' is a Borgesian tale where the protagonist becomes part of the murder mystery he is reading.\`\` In literature it is only necessary to outline the steps. Let the people dance.'' says Anthony Kerrigan in preface to \`Ficciones'. This collection is one such piece of literature. His other important work is \`Hopscotch'. Along with Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Salman Rushdie, he can claim to be the author of some of the best pieces of magic realism."},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"Cortazar's craft as a short story writer is staggering. Even when I wasn't completely engaged by the characters and situations, it was hard not to be blown away by his sinuous, rhythmic way of turning sentences. Like Borges, he operates in a territory where time and memory bleed in and out of each other, where reality flirts with the surreal, the magical and the menacing but is still grounded by the concrete, charmed details of everyday existence. I can't think of many things as utterly mesmerizing as \\"axoltol\\" or \\"continuity of parks\\" and even the longer ones, while not quite as mysterious or fabulistic, are still beautifully odd and evocative. It's not Hopscotch, but at its best these are still mostly wonderful."},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"Short stories are not very dear to me, as a form of fiction. I prefer the fat novel or the slim novel/long story. This collection of stories by Argentine exile Cortazar helped me some way to try and understand why.The stories were initially published in the 1960s. They are almost all \`surreal', mysterious, esoteric, and magical. They are artful and some are entertaining (others just confusing), but most leave me with an unsatisfied feeling. And then, once in a while, a story turns out to be satisfying and justifies the exposure to the rest. In the case of this book, it is mainly the title story.There are nice technical tricks, optical/mental illusions, skillfully done, but rather meaningless. Take for example Axolotl: a man goes to the zoo to look at them, but in the course of the tale, the perspective migrates to the axolotls who watch the man coming to the zoo to look at them. (If you don't know axolotls*, don't be depressed, neither would I if there hadn't been a German mega bestseller last year titled Axolotl Roadkill.)Structurally comparable, but more complex is The Night Face Up: a variation on dreams and reality via a double nightmare. A man has an accident, passes out, wakes up, watches himself being taken to hospital, operated on, put in a hospital bed, falls asleep, dreams of being prepared for sacrifice by an Aztec tribe (as if he were a victim in the Apocalypto movie), wakes up, is in the bed, meanders between hospital and Aztec temple, where he finally dreams that he is a man on a motorcycle who has an accident. Nice. But so what?There are amusing stories of the Roald Dahl variety: imagine a house sitter, who moves into a woman's Buenos Aires apartment while she goes to Paris for a few months. He writes her a letter about the unfortunate fact that the rabbits which he sometimes vomits out and then keeps in the apartment, feeding them insufficiently from a balcony clover plantation, have destroyed the apartment.Or: a man sits in his house and reads a crime story which has him as the victim and on the last page the murderer creeps into the reading room with a knife... Ok, ok, very neat.But hasn't this kind of thing been done before?The volume is named after the story which gave the core of the plot to Antonioni's 60s cult film Blow Up. I remember that I was at the time endlessly fascinated by its elegant boredom and that I watched it several times, feeling quite heroic about it. Let's face it, the film was just a fad, nothing much to it. I expected to look at Cortazar's story in the same way, but was \`disappointed': Blow Up is the 11th of 15 stories in this book, and it is the first one that made me sit up and say, hey, this is a damned good one.The film was about a fashion photographer in London who gets into some complications over a private photo that he shoots in a park and then blows up in his studio. A woman in the shot didn't like to be in the picture (Vanessa Redgrave in the movie.) The story is about a hobby photographer, a Chilean translator in Paris, who takes a photo of people in the streets. The people are unhappy and demand the film roll, but the photographer/narrator refuses to hand it over. Subsequently he blows up the shot and puts it on the wall. While he looks at the photo from a distance, it begins to change, the lens angle moves, and we \`see' a different story than the one that we had at first imagined. This story makes me want to give 5 stars to the book, though it should overall only be 4.And there is a real outsider in this volume, a 60 pages text with a totally un-esoteric story about a jazz musician called Johnny Carter, who has an uncanny similarity with Charlie Parker. That is a strong story as well, but oddly misplaced in this neighborhood.* Axolotls are an amphibian species, or rather their larvae. The species is also called Mexican Salamander or Walking Fish, though it is not a fish."},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"The other reviews here cover Cortazazr's work and talent so well that I'm only going to add something about one of the stories. If you're a fan of his novel Rayuela, or Hopscotch in English, the last story in this collection will be of particular interest to you. In \\"Secret Weapons,\\" the main female character, Michele, is obviously an early prototype of the main female character in Rayuela: La Maga.Michele is described as being \\"like a cat,\\" and she's late for her appointment with Pierre (who is somewhat like Horacio Oliviera from Rayuela) because she's been wandering around the city looking into store windows. Quote from the story: \\"Michele can't be much longer, unless she gets lost or hangs around in the streets on the way, she has this extraordinary capacity to stop any place and take herself a trip through the small particular worlds of the shop windows. Afterward, she will tell him about: a stuffed bear that winds up, a Couperin record, a bronze chain with a blue stone, Stendhal's complete works, the summer fashions. Completely understandable reasons for arriving a bit late.\\"Cortazar doesn't develop this ability of Michele's into a deeper meaning, the way he does throughout Hopscotch, where La Maga's ability to become lost in the physical world intrigues and endears Horacio, who by contrast is so deep into his philosophies that he feels removed and lost from the world around him. But Michele and Pierre have a similar sexual interplay to La Maga and Horacio...in modern jargon it would be called sadism/masochism...but of course in Cortazar's descriptions it's something much more deeply felt and true than those words allow for.Pierre isn't too much like Horacio...you could say they both smoke Gauloises, but pretty much every Cortazar character smokes them. But Pierre isn't so into philosophy and in fact he's blonde...that sounds superficial but it creeped me out to all of a sudden picture Horacio's doppleganger as blonde. I guess it's important to the story for him to be blonde. Anyway.The characters Babette and Roland are here as well, straight from Rayuela. They're secondary characters in this story and not really developed at all, the way they are in the novel, but they're here nonetheless, a couple with the exact same names.I of course loved this collection for all the reasons previous reviewers have mentioned. This story was an extra surprise at the end. It's really fascinating to see a writer explore a certain character in a short story and then expand the same character in a novel, to see how the character changes and how the writer's approach changes with the format."},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"This collection of stories by Cortazar is an extraordinary testament to his brilliance as an inventor of the fantastical. Ranging from brief, elliptical, even metaphysical observations to the mysterious and tragic, Cortazar is a master of the short story form. In \\"Axolotls\\" Cortazar develops his style as a brilliant phenomenologist-a true observer of the natural world and its profound mysteries. I am particularly drawn to stories like \\"The Pursuer\\" and \\"At Your Service,\\" because of their combined sense of the strange and the minute particular. This is modern literature at its most interesting and exciting."},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"In my unqualified opinion some of the finest stories I have read. Cortazar has a way of evoking mountains of possibility with simple, suggestive word choices, delicious twists of phrase. His prose is never obvious, never quite linear, never expected. He captures, as it were 'en passant,' delicate, brutal, beautiful images. The strength and subtlety of his craft is enough to make scores of well-known authors come off rather like unimaginative pedants.The writing runs virtually beneath the level of consciousness. \\"The Continuity of Parks,\\" in less than two pages, succeeds in seamlessly moving from one reality to another, turning the reader completely upside-down in the ultimate sentences -- something that Julian Barnes, for example, works so diligently to do in his novella \\"The Sense of an Ending,\\" but which is so plodding and dull in comparison. His longest story here, \\"The Pursuer,\\" is a mere seventy pages, but feels as intricate, as involved, as densely packed as a longer novel. These stories are as brilliant and unsettling as anything Borges wrote, but of an entirely unique and irreplaceable character."},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"I ready many collections of short stories and I often find that they are like pop albums: a few catchy numbers up front followed by fillers, repeats and instrumental versions. But every one of these stories is entirely interesting, including \\"The Distances\\" which I admit I didn't understand at all, even the second time through.Many of these stories exist in the territory of terror and awe, but the three I liked best were all occasions of sustained compassion, and each revolved around a death. \\"At Your Service\\" is about a paid mourner who ends up grieving for real. \\"The Gates of Heaven\\" is about the death of a dancing girl. The novella \\"The Pursuer\\", based on the last days of Charlie Parker, is so convincing that I fell for it hook, line and sinker and believed I was reading an actual memoir, that he must have actually sat in a Paris hotel room with a ranting naked Charlie Parker. This novella is also a meditation on genius, which unfortunately does absolutely nothing to exempt one from ordinary misery.If you enjoy this, make sure you read \`Cronopios and Famas', Cortazar's playful eccentric book of tiny stories and prose poems - there's nothing like it."},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"Cortazar, when on his game, is on the very short list of great story writers. He has a keen eye for detail and a knack for beginning a story somewhat in the middle and letting the reader catch up. &quot;Continuity of Parks&quot; is a roller coaster in three pages with great visual details (only &quot;Grafitti&quot; is a better story by him). &quot;The Night Face Up&quot; is ingenious. &quot;House Taken Over&quot; is a great example of what he doesn't tell you being more important than what he does tell you! Expect the unexpected and possibly bizarre. Cortazar plays by no rules and knows no boundaries."},{"Title":"Blow Up and Other Stories","review":"&quot;Anyone who doesn't read Cort&aacute;zar is doomed. Not to read him is a grave invisible disease which in time can have terrible consequences. Something similar to a man who had never tasted peaches.

From the moment I started reading the first story in this collection, Axolotl, I was hooked. Cortazar is such an amzing writer, has such a beautiful way of phrasing things and his stories always involve the unexpected and are completely up to many an interpretation. Make sure to read House Taken Over and Continuity of Parks, those two were my favorites. If you can, also obtain a copy of his story All Fires the Fire, another great fantastic tale.

Even stranger is the behavior of the herd of her kin, woolly mammoths. They complain of starvation, but have no concept of feeding themselves. Instead they had been spoiled from when their former masters, the earthly humanoids, took care of them. Now the humans have deserted their pets on Mars.Icebones realizes she is different from the other members of her species. The human scientists regenerated them all but she was born in a more natural manner enabling her to understand mammoth history, legend, tradition, and most importantly how to survive in the wild. Against some opposition, she becomes the leader and begins the journey across the planet where food and water might exist so that the species can live.ICEBONES, the concluding novel of Stephen Baxter's imaginative personification of Woolly Mammoths, is an engaging science fiction tale that readers will enjoy. The story line requires a stretch to accept yet the audience will want to read this novel in one sitting. Fans will appreciate Icebones, a heroine who recognizes her responsibility to guide the unruly herd to the promised land and does not shirk away from doing the right thing though that would be easier on her. This is a strong epic morality tale that holds up with its two predecessors quite nicely to provide an entertaining insightful trilogy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Icebones","review":"Icebones ends the Mammoth trilogy quite far from the other books.

It takes a huge journey across the planet to survive and Icebones has to lead a group of mammoths who don't like it.There's adventure, there's some quite beautiful scenery, there's strange creatures and envinronmental threats and mammoths struggling to overcome them - if you enjoyed the first two books, you'll like this as well, but skipping this is not a huge loss. Icebones makes a rather nice heroine, though. Still, Baxter has written better books than the Mammoth trilogy. (Review based on the Finnish translation.)"},{"Title":"Icebones","review":"The third in the Mammoth Trilogy. About as good as the second one, if not slightly better.

First of all, there are very few examples in each chapter. And if an example is solved, it lacks steps and details.If you are planning to take advanced courses or MCAT after using this book, well, good luck. Most of us had to use this book because it was required. Rule of thumb for Math and Physics students, it is not something that can be rote memorized. You actually have to see the worked-out problems and try to solve them yourselves. If a book doesn't contain enough examples (like this one), you are one a slippery downward slope. You may be able to get an A by memorizing every word but you won't learn anything.

If someone has a good math background in Trig and Calculus they should be able to understand almost everything. Where I think it may fail is in its application for undergraduates in the Life Sciences (Biology, possibly Psychology if they are hard-core enough to take a physics class). Half of all science majors are Biology majors, and it's not fair that they have to read the same text that physical science undergraduates read. Most biology programs do not require trigonometry to be taken, so a biology major will quickly be lost reading this book.Also, life scientists like me can easily figure out things like optics, but are very confused by the terminology of Physics. For example, in Biology a &quot;cell membrane&quot; is a very understandable term. It's the protein-lipid bilayer that surrounds a cell and is semi-permeable to small molecules. It's common sense---anyone can understand it. But in physics, the terminology in this text is anything but common-sense. I will give you two examples. First they define torque as &quot;the moment-arm of rotation about an axis&quot;. I understand rotation about an axis, but what the heck is a &quot;moment arm&quot;? Define that please! Second, they define magnetism as the flux force through a charged area. I understand charges, areas, but flux force? This is why lay people and life scientists hate physics, because the terminology is deliberately arcane.

But this text somehow makes it even harder. There are almost no proofs for the formulas provided, and very little explanation. Lots of important information (which should be in the body of the text) is actually included in the examples. Even the examples are bad--some of them show the steps used in solving a problem, but most don't--they just skip to the answer.When I first started my Physics class my teacher told us we wouldn't get credit for any problem we did that was done like the book. I think it's a basic rule in Physics, Calculus, even Algebra that you should show your intermediate steps to allow others to understand what you're doing. In a textbook this is especially true, but the authors here totally disregard this rule.I have not yet encountered a really good book on this subject, but I do know that this will be one textbook I'll be selling as soon as I possibly can. It just isn't that helpful. The one thing I did like were the different levels of problems--you could always see how difficult a problem was before you undertook it. Other than that, I'm not very satisfied with the book.Most people who buy this book won't have a choice--it will be for a class. If you can't avoid it, my apologies.

What he should have done is derive all equations starting from just one principle (Newton's 3rd law) and shows how the equation for the non-accelating case is a special case of the 3rd law.I recommend any physic major to try other author because Serway is not the best place to start."},{"Title":"Humanoids","review":"A wonderfull story of hard science fiction and psichic powers.Robots are invading every planet in an unknown future ( evidently there's a rise-fall cycle of cultures all over the galaxy ) and &quot;protecting&quot; every human by totally controling and restricting his actions.A scientist works to rebel through understanding of the true nature of the universe.

Looking forward to reading the sequel, The Humanoid Touch."},{"Title":"Humanoids","review":"This book is composed of two stories. The first, called Folded Hands is nothing short of brilliant. Jack Williamson created a rather bizarre, almost tongue and cheek idea, that works well in this quick blast that had me laughing and feeling chilled all at the same time. Williamson didn't take himself too seriously but the short story had some terrific ideas. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the novella. The second story, for me anyway, felt weighed down by far too much dramatic dialog and unrelenting techno babble that dragged the story down. The Humanoids idea -- that mankind must be protected from itself ,can't help but sound a bit silly in execution and in the second story, Williamson goes for the straight dramatic and it feels awkward. Granted there are some brilliant ideas but they don't play out because the author is too busy trying to explain this bizarre science that can defeat the humanoids. That in itself sounds like a parady but he plays it straight! When Asimov wrote robot stories he understood when not to take himself too seriously. On top of that, I found it a bit hard not to feel sorry for the Humanoids. They really are passionate and just completely naive about what they are doing and its consequences. I wish logic instead of mass destruction would have been formulated to deal with the issue. Oh well."},{"Title":"Humanoids","review":"SPOILERS!!

The ending at first seems pretty horrible, and I didnt realy like it but I think if it didnt end this way this book woudnt of made such an impact.

The first is the novelette titled 'With Folded Hands...' published first in 1947 in 'Astounding Science Fiction'. The second story is the novel \\"The Humanoids\\", which was also published originally in 'Astounding Science Fiction' in 1948 (March - May) under the title '...And Searching Mind'. The two stories share the same nemesis, which are the robots known as The Humanoids.The Humanoids' purpose is \\"To Serve and Obey, And Guard Men from Harm\\", which is really just a rewording of the first two laws of robotics that Asimov and Campbell create for Asimov's robot stories that first started to appear in 1940. However, this does not make these stories redundant, as Williamson's Humanoids take their purpose to the extreme, and go so far as to prevent men from doing anything that could potentially cause harm, which includes such activities as driving, or even reading in some cases.In 'With Folded Hands...,' the hero is Mr. Underhill, who opposes the humanoids at first because they threaten his livelihood (he is an android salesman), but later because he can see the effect they have on people's lives. He works with the creator of the Humanoids, Mr. Sledge, who is desperately trying to put an end to his creation.In 'The Humanoids,' the hero is Dr. Clay Forester, who is made aware of the Humanoid menace by a group of humans with various special abilities such as teleportation, clairvoyance, telekinesis, and telepathy. They refer to these types of abilities as \\"psychophysics\\". As the story proceeds, the reader becomes less and less sure who is right and who is wrong in the conflict. The Humanoids, though still a presence, are not the main foe for Dr. Forester. Instead he focuses on Frank Ironsmith, a former colleague who is helping the Humanoids, involved with Forester's wife Ruth, and is given much more freedom than other humans by the Humanoids. Although the Humanoids use some horrible methods of forcing people to be happy (e.g. drugs, surgery), they are not nearly as controlling as they were in \`With Folded Hands....' One oddity between the two stories is that Williamson introduces a different creator of the Humanoids, whose name is Warren Mansfield.These two stories are definitely worth reading for anyone interested in Science Fiction. \`The Humanoids' rated 27th in 1952 for science fiction books, and tied for 18th in 1956 on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Polls. \`With Folded Hands...' tied for 32nd in 1999 on the Locus All-Time Poll of novelettes."},{"Title":"Humanoids","review":"THE HUMANOIDS is one of the unquestionable classics of the science fiction genre, and arguably the most important novel ever written about robots. The core idea of ultra sleek robots who arrive on a planet &quot;to serve and protect&quot; the planets inhabitants to the most logical extreme of that directive was brilliant and extraordinarily innovative when the book was published in the late 1940s. As such, absolutely no one even remotely interested in science fiction can afford not to read this great novel.Unfortunately, aside from the core concept and several excellent characters, including the marvelously conceived humanoids themselves, I found a few elements in this story to be somewhat disagreeable. Others may not find them so, but I did, and they somewhat marred my enjoyment of the novel. First, the main character of the novel was, to me, was an unpleasant individual. Now, it is entirely correct that it is important to the novel's plot that he not be especially likable. Nonetheless, he was a somewhat unpleasant character, and spending time with him even on a fictional level was not as much fun as one might like. I also was unhappy with the way the romantic elements in the novel developed. They struck me as quite implausible. Finally, I very much did not like the ending of the novel. Unfortunately, I cannot here go into my reasons without giving away too much of the plot. Suffice it to say that I am not certain that I would want to live in the world that the novel apparently endorses in its ending.I will add that one character is one of my favorites in all of sci-fi, the wonderfully eccentric, amazing enigmatic Underhill. Williamson does a great job in Underhill of producing a character who is simultaneously marvelously innocent and suspiciously sinister at the same time. After I finished the book, his character remained far more vivid in my memory than any of the others."},{"Title":"Humanoids","review":"Jack Williamson had the longest career of any writer in the history of Science Fiction; he published his first story in 1927 and his last novel in 2005. This novel is one of the highlights of his career, and a true classic of the genre.I have little to add to the numerous favorable reviews already posted of this book. But it is important to note what is, and what isn't, in this Kindle edition.Williamson dealt with the Humanoids in two works-- a 1947 novelette in Astounding called \\"With Folded Hands,\\" and a 1948 novel, originally serialized in Astounding under the title \\"And Searching Mind,\\" later published in book form as \\"The Humanoids.\\" Still later, the two works were published as one book, again under the title of \\"The Humanoids.\\"This Kindle e-book includes ONLY the 1948 novel; \\"With Folded Hands\\" is NOT here.The 1948 novel holds up very well on its own; you don't need the earlier novelette to undestand it. But if you want both pieces of the saga, you will have to go for the old-fashioned book form:The Humanoids: A Novel, because \\"With Folded Hands\\" does not seem to be currently available for the Kindle."},{"Title":"Humanoids","review":"This not just a story about some humanoid robots taking over the world/universe, Jack tries to answer the question, \\"Has technology made the world a fundamentally better place to live?\\". In THE HUMANOIDS, once again a scientific discovery is misused by technology to develop a super-weapon, a bomb capable of turning all matter within a preset radius, directly into energy. So despite advances in technology, the world was preparing to repeat the age-old cycle of rise and ruin along with their enemies, only this time there is a difference: the humanoids offer to create a benevolent despotism and to \\"serve and obey and save men from harm\\", although not necessarily in that order. They are voted in but the Old School people find they don't like the thought of giving up all control and they wind up getting drugged in order to keep them safe and happy.THE HUMANOIDS is about one of those people, Dr Forester, trying to escape and avoid becoming a victim to the humanoids \\"smother you with kindness\\" strategy. Forester learns that the only way he can do that is through \\"psychophysical\\" or paranormal powers of the mind, something the humanoids do not have...yet. So Dr Forester learns the scientific basis behind teleportation, telurgy, and clairvoyance and attempts to use his new found powers to destroy the humanoids. Dr Forester fails for two reasons, (1) he does not have the mental poise or peace to commit such a crime because (2) psychophysical energy requires mental poise and peace in order to use it since it is the basic creative force of the universe and cannot be used to destroy other people. Once again, a new technology rises up and is misused to try and ruin the world, answering the question if technology can make the world a fundamentally better place and the answer is \\"Hell no!\\". The basic problem isn't with technology, but with humans. The dark side of humans is too much for them to overcome, even with the most advanced technology.The point that Jack Williamson is making then is that humans, by themselves, will never be able to stop themselves from ruining the world, and the only way humans will ever eliminate their dark side is to replace it with a better side -- and neither thing can ever take place without it being forced onto us by an outside party that has no dark side to begin with."},{"Title":"Humanoids","review":"Williamson was a late arrival to the Golden Age, although he had written many pieces prior to this book of 1948. He still managed to complement it perfectly with this book. It is loaded with ideas, action and suspense. It is also written in a rather bland style, with wooden characters, as was typical of that time (with few exceptions). It's a tough task to try to evaluate it by today's standards, but at the time it must have seemed fresh with fantastic speculations mixed with some current science and ideas. It's a story about a grand struggle of man versus machine. The machine here is \\"humanoid\\", and the question contemplated is whether the humanoids are sinister, or if they are even capable of good or evil intentions. \\"Cybernetics\\" is a term used in the story, and that was a fresh term for sure when this was written. First used in a science context by the mathematician Norbert Wiener in 1947, it is explored here in terms of the humanoid and its crudely developed \\"intelligence\\" against the pitfalls of human intelligence.The book explores cybernetics as it tells the story of mechanical and biological control and communications between humans and humanoids. They struggle to exist together within the constraints of each being's ability to act, understand and communicate. Are the humanoids plotting control of the human race, or are they simply acting upon rigid but poorly designed instructions from their human designer? It's an interesting question that keeps the reader guessing about their true nature and intentions, if they have any. The human response provides the struggle and the suspense, as a few suspicious people desperately try to save humanity and what it is to be human, despite the promising temptations that the humanoids seem to offer. The themes here were often repeated in subsequent decades. Are machines potentially dangerous? Can they learn ambition? Or are they limited to the role of human tools, with imagined qualities reflecting their human creators? There are references in these reviews to the dark ending. It is unsettling from a human point of view. To the humanoids, a case is made that it may be just another day at the office. The office door, of course, contains only one name. That of the human CEO. This is a book of ideas, and it deserves the status of the Golden Age, with all its newly discovered flowering ideas in the untended science fiction garden. Weeds did of course grow, but not for awhile."},{"Title":"Humanoids","review":"The late 1940s was a period of remarkable creativity for future sci-fi Grand Master Jack Williamson. July '47 saw the release of his much-acclaimed short story \\"With Folded Hands\\" in the pages of \\"Astounding Science-Fiction,\\" followed by the tale's two-part serialized sequel, \\"And Searching Mind,\\" in that influential magazine's March and April 1948 issues. \\"Darker Than You Think,\\" Williamson's great sci-fi/fantasy/horror hybrid, was released later in 1948, and 1949 saw the publication of \\"And Searching Mind\\" in hardcover form, and retitled \\"The Humanoids.\\" \\"With Folded Hands\\" had been a perfect(ly downbeat) short story that introduced us to the Humanoids, sleek black robots invented by a technician named Sledge on planet Wing IV. The robots' built-in Prime Directive (hmmm...why does that phrase seem so familiar?) is \\"To Serve and Obey, And Guard Men From Harm.\\" Unfortunately, this leaves mankind with very little to do, as the mechanicals prevent humans from participating in anything that might be potentially dangerous; in other words, just about everything! Sledge's efforts to wipe out the master brain on Wing IV that is controlling the billions of self-replicating mechanicals are, sadly, fruitless, which sets us up for the action in \\"The Humanoids.\\"Flash forward 90 years. (Actually, this novel takes place a good 6,000 years from our present day, the reader infers.) On an unnamed planet, a physicist named Forester, head of a secret government project that is constructing a prototype \\"rhodomagnetic\\" bomb, comes to realize that the newly arrived Humanoids on his world are a bane, not a boon, to mankind. This realization is strengthened when the robots give his wife the brain-wiping drug known as euphoride to keep her happy, and when his beloved pet project is dismantled by the Humanoids as being too dangerous for men to engage in. Forester joins a band of \\"paraphysical\\" misfits--gifted with the powers of clairvoyance, telekinesis, telepathy and teleportation--to fight the Humanoids and alter their Prime Directive by going to the distant world of Wing IV itself. Readers expecting a traditional humans vs. ray-zapping evil robots story (such as Williamson's 1939 novel \\"After World's End\\") may be surprised to learn that this engrossing tale is anything but. The robots here are not at all presented as evil; if anything, they are guilty of killing mankind's spirit with too much kindness, and their benevolence is ultimately a mixed blessing at best. In the book's ambivalently downbeat ending, a case is made for the Humanoids' positive aspects (by Sledge himself, here, for some reason, renamed Warren Mansfield) that is almost a convincing one. Depending on the reader's outlook, I suppose a society in which the individual is free to do nothing but laze, paint, think and play (no sports, though; too dangerous, say the Humanoids!) could be regarded as a paradise or a hell. \\"The Humanoids,\\" besides offering those convincing (?) sociological arguments, also gives us some impressive pseudoscience to explain the very nature of reality, extrasensory abilities and the binding forces that hold nature together. \\"Rhodomagnetism\\" is a made-up word that Williamson uses often to describe a source of energy based on a different triad of elements than electromagnetism, and before things are done, Forester comes up with a group of equations involving \\"platinomagnetism\\" that allows its possessor to gain various \\"paramechanical\\" abilities. This use of arcane scientific equations to cause changes in the power of the mind was very reminiscent, for this reader, of Henry Kuttner's classic short novel from 1946, \\"The Fairy Chessmen\\"; as in that earlier tale, \\"The Humanoids\\" grows increasingly \\"way out\\" as it progresses. It is a finely written, suspenseful, action-packed yarn that is at the same time chock-full of interesting scientific speculations. It has been called Williamson's \\"greatest science fiction novel,\\" and while I cannot claim to have read more than 1/10 of the author's nearly 80-year output (!), the greatness of the novel is hard to deny. I would never dream of revealing whether or not Forester & Co. are successful in their efforts against the Humanoids, but can report that the author did come out with a very belated sequel, \\"The Humanoid Touch,\\" in 1980. Say no more, right?"},{"Title":"Humanoids","review":"Science fiction has always strived to reveal something about human nature, and this disturbing book achieves this goal like no other.

Quite some time after this book a sequel was published, &quot;The Humanoid Touch&quot;. It is just as disturbing, partially because having read the first novel, I think the point of view of the author, or perhaps better, the 'implied author' has changed. This in no way decreases the value of the books, which are a must for any sci-fi reader."},{"Title":"Humanoids","review":"Jack Williamson was one of the guiding lights of science fiction during the \\"golden age\\". His writing is always excellent. That said, this has to be one of his greatest achievements ever. It's dark, hopeless and tragic, but still filled with the possible triumph of the human spirit. The main story, \\"With Folded Hands\\", though, is one of the most touching pieces of writing I've ever read. Please, I beg of you, read this book. It is one of the greats."},{"Title":"Humanoids","review":"This book made me think. That's the first positive. It's also well-paced. That's the second positive. The ending took me by surprise and was totally acceptable. That's the third positive.But the fourth positive is really what made me love this book... Some may laugh at me for writing this, but this author seems to have described &quot;the force&quot; in scientific terms waaaayy back in the forties. In fact, it's a better explanation than even Lucas' &quot;Midichlorides&quot; or whatever they were in 'Episode I'. I have to think that George Lucas read this book before writing &quot;Star Wars&quot;.Anyway... The author seems to have created fictitious sciences that actually make sense. I'm not a scientist, so that's probably why it worked for me. I almost felt like the answer to the universe was in this book... even though 2 of the 3 sciences don't really exist.As for the ending, I though it was great. It was the only way the story would have made any sense. If the OPPOSITE of the ending had happened, the story would have been as pointless as most action movies. Contrary to another reviewer's dislike of the world at the end of the book, I thought it was actually a desirable place to be. I think that reviewer misunderstood what was goin on at the end.I had to force myself to put the book down. It was that good. really quick, to the point, nothing to bog the story down. Just the events that needed to be there.A very quick read.

We Earthlings welcome them at first, for they do all the grotty little jobs we don't like to do; they help with almost obsequious servitude; they are there to protect and to serve - their motto, indeed, 'To serve and protect, and keep men from harm' might be the motto of the modern, omnipresent and omnicompetent government. And, like that government, they take away one freedom after another, until...well, you must read the book to find out.

They mention a grocery store that has been closed since 1999. They mention a deli that has been closed since 2000. The do NOT mention one new business....besides one restaurant. It is obvious Lonely Planet did not send one writer to Caye Caulker, Belize.If they didn't take time to visit Caye Caulker ONCE in over 4 years, I can only assume the rest of the book is absolute garbage as well.For a real Travel Book for Belize, check out Rough Guide by Peter Eltringham. He actually sends scouts out to every location before he visits. He does this to ensure that every place has a fair shot...and that they write about a real experience, not one based on a hotel or restaurant putting on a show for a known writer. Peter's writers do not announce they are writers.That is what a real travel book should be.Lonely Planet needs to quit relying on their name to sell books. Their information is completely outdated, and not worth your money.Wendy Cassonwww.belizecayecaulker.net"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Belize, Guatemala & Yucatan","review":"If your travel are solely to Guatemala and the Yucatan this guide is for you. But if your planning on traveling in Belize (Central America's best country) this guide seriously lacks in Belizian facts and data. That is why I only gave it 2 stars.

I bought this guide expecting it to deal with Belize thoroughly, as the title of the guide was &quot;Belize, G and Y...&quot;; however if you look at the actual Belize contect it just amounts to a hundred pages or so out of 600. Vast parts of the country were absent, and though northern Guatemala was a little better there were several ruins missing compared to my partner's Rough Guide to the Maya World. I have always wanted to visit the Peten ruins of Piedras Negras on the Usumacinta river, but the LP did not even cover the site.

There was barely any information for Cozumel, which is a popular destination these days, although maybe a little &quot;upscale&quot; for the average backpacker. Belize is a country with so many more things than what were highlighted in the book...best to find another guide before going off to explore on your own."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Belize, Guatemala & Yucatan","review":"This Lonely Planet travel guide is valuable but flawed. Like the best Lonely Planet books, this November 2004 edition is concise, readable, and puts vital travel information at your fingertips. There's much information for budget travelers on local customs, possible hazards, changing currency, low-cost accommodations, transportation, getting to and from airports and bus terminals, etc. But this edition has a few weaknesses, which is not what you need when far from home. Several reviewers have noted that this guide has much out-of-date information on Belize. The book falls short in the maps department as well. A couple tiny maps could be added to show small towns near popular destinations to help travelers avoid getting off their bus at the wrong stop. The only map of Guatemala City doesn't show Zona 13 south of the airport where many hostels and cheap hotels are located. Also, the book warns about colder nights in the highlands but doesn't specify temperatures - a windbreaker was sufficient for a June visit.Lonely Planet is usually a top-notch choice for backpackers and budget travelers, but this one falls a bit short in some areas."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Belize, Guatemala & Yucatan","review":"I was sorely disappointed in this LP travelbook!

I'd never seen a book covering both of the languages before, so I checked it out, and this looks to be an excellent little phrasebook and dictionary.You can learn a lot even from a little book like this, and it turns out Hindi and Urdu are mostly mutually intelligible, although written in different alphabets, Urdu using the Permo-Arabic script and Hindi using the old Devenagari alphabet, or more accurately, syllabary.The book starts out with a 30-page section giving basic info such as a pronunciation guide and an intro to the grammar. It also includes common phrases, numbers, telling tiem, and so on. Most of the book is taken up by the dictionary and phrasebook, but interspersed throughout there are sidebars that provide extra info. Often these are cultural tips on such things as customs, etiquette, and slang, but occasionally you get some grammar, too.Finally, there is a reference section in the back with sections on signs and notices, how to read menus and food items, numbers, place names, road signs, public holidays, and many others, in both the Hindi and Urdu. Also, although as I said they're very similar languages, any words or phrases that are only for on Language are indicated by a &quot;U&quot; or &quot;H.&quot;The text uses &quot;keyword referencing&quot; for the dictionary, so if you need to find out how to ask for a hotel room, you just go to the &quot;hotel&quot; section in the dictionary and look for that word, and then you can find the phrase from there.I also learned some interesting things about the grammar, such as that there are only two genders and two noun cases in Urdu and Hindi, the direct and the oblique. What we call prepositions occur as postpositions, or after the noun, and pronouns lack gender, so there is no &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she.&quot; The verb has the same tenses as English and most Indo-European languages, which are strong on time relationships in general (unlike, for example, Arabic and Japanese, which lack a true future tense and are not especially detailed in this regard), and so there are past, present, future, past continuous, past perfect, past imperfect, etc., tenses, as well as the indicative, imperative and subjunctive moods as well.Given all the features and at 240 pages, it's a lot of information in one little book. And at six and a half dollars, the price is right. The paper is also higher quality than I've seen in other small, inexpensive phrasebooks. All in all, I think this is a great little dictionary/phrasebook book for the price from the Rough Guide."},{"Title":"Study and Solutions Guide for Calculus Vol. 1","review":"I am currently involved in a course which uses the Calculus text authored by Larson Hostetler and Edwards. I find the text to be clear and understandable, and also well laid out(with very few exceptions). The student solutions guide( or the solution guide for students if you prefer) which accompanies the text is a rip-off. The cover says study and solution guide, and apparently what this means is whatever easy problems they could get Mr. Heyd to work.

Here?s why. You cannot travel when you want to because travel dates are set by the courier company, which of course is not practical for the average traveler. Other hassles involve not going directly to your desired destination. For example, if your destination is London you may wind up being transferred first at Amsterdam before going on. Most courier packages are ?one-way? ? and a return flight is not easy to book. If you chose to courier a package you ?must meet a representative upon arrival?, and in some cases this can take hours before the item is ?back-tracked? and deemed ?clear to proceed? (as happened to me once in Ireland); not to mention the many forms that you will be forced to fill out. The author does not bother to mention that most courier companies request that you ?become a member? for an average annual fee of $45. Or the fact that it is next to impossible to travel with a loved one because the odds of finding two packages going to the same place at the same time are astronomical. But the worst is yet to come. Courier packages are not widely available as they were before 911 because private security companies are now picking up the slack. When they are available, they are subject to new and evolving international laws which may bring the courier ?under suspicion?, even though, as the author misleadingly claims, ?He never touches the package?. Courier traveling is based on a gap in international law which authorities are currently attempting to close. Couriers may soon be held liable if it can be demonstrated to some degree that ?proximity? or ?association by proxy? can be established. Many people have been questioned or held ?under suspicion? on Money Laundering charges and some have even been arrested. Many illegal items are shipped through courier packages often not to the knowledge of the courier company, but as a matter of fact to the authorities. The companies themselves are covered by insurance and by various disclaimer laws that do not apply to the courier. Shipping companies courier their packages through customs faster and cheaper as luggage. But this expediency sacrifices security for the sake of saving money. In a post 911 world this simply should not be allowed. Under international law, any given country is allowed to hold packages for hours or days and in some cases for weeks at a time. It is not worth the hassle or the risk! This is the kind of book someone can paste together in a few days, or hours from readily available sources on the Internet.

If at all possible read each book in a row they will overlap into one another and you will travel back in time and you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"Daughter of the Mist (Merlin's Legacy, Book 2)","review":"Brianna is introduced as a fragile creature and for all intents and purposes she is. But beneath that fragile exterior is a very strong woman. And fortunately she meets, in Tarek, a man who understands strength and her unique gifts. He falls in love with a glimpse of a woman he barely has time to speak to, and arranges things so he has to go all the way back to Scotland, supposedly on a mission for the king, but really to find Her. And find her he does, and claims her for his own.This book is not a formulaic copy of the first. The characters are their own people with their own minds and their own destinies. I was very happy to finally meet Brianna and enjoyed watching her and Tarek get closer. It is yet another fabulous love story! I'm looking forward to the next sister's story."},{"Title":"Daughter of the Mist (Merlin's Legacy, Book 2)","review":"Of all the books I have read I have also found this one the best that I have ever read. I extremly enjoy Brianna's character. Even with all the tradgey that she goes through she finds the courage to stand up for her people and for herself. She hides her feelings and shows how storng she is and that she really doesn't need anyone or at least that is the way she acts. But unfortunately she really needs a strong man to set her free. All I have to say is that if you are thinking of buying this book, buy it, it is definatally worth it."},{"Title":"Daughter of the Mist (Merlin's Legacy, Book 2)","review":"I love all of the Merlin books and this one is no exception. Great buy."},{"Title":"Daughter of the Mist (Merlin's Legacy, Book 2)","review":"Very detailed, with all the sensuality of a first rate romance novel. Many references to Normandy invasion of England; don't know if they're accurate, but they *sound* authentic! &lt;g&gt;Only complaint? Books 1 and 2 of the series have the covers switched! Book 1 shows a blonde, and is about a redhead, and Book 2 vice-versa."},{"Title":"Daughter of the Mist (Merlin's Legacy, Book 2)","review":"This book was well written very engrossing I couldn't put it down. I read everything I can out there on merlin and arthur and this is an excellent book. I've recommended to all my friends. Made me a believer in magic and this book had great humor in it also."},{"Title":"Daughter of the Mist (Merlin's Legacy, Book 2)","review":"Book is in great shape!! No ripped or folded pages, and no markings inside the book that I have noticed. I LOVE the story, excellent choice for sci fi lovers!"},{"Title":"Daughter of the Mist (Merlin's Legacy, Book 2)","review":"This book, along with daughter of Fire and Daughter of the Light, has to be the best series I've ever read! Quinn Taylor Evans has a knack for writing sexual content without making it seem vulgar. I expect that when I read Shadows of Camelot I will find that it is also a great book,like the other Merlins Legacy novels."},{"Title":"Deep End of a Shallow Ocean: A Collection of Poetry","review":"I have had the honor of knowing Ms. Arroyo for four years. We met in high school during our biology class. Throughout the years, I have grown to know her as one of my best friends. By doing this, I was able to see the creating process and writing process of this book in creation. I have read poetry by many authors, however I have never seen such talent and creativity in an authors, especially at such a young age. This book is definitely something that should be read by everyone. Either by the gothic freaks like us, men and women who are confused about themselves and their identities, and even possibly by high schoolers on their AP English tests. This book hits you so hard and takes you to the unknown where you thought you'd never want to venture. However, by the end of the book you realize that this is your guiding hand and flashlight for the unknown. As I say to Ms. Arroyo now, \\"welcome to the deep end of a shallow ocean.\\""},{"Title":"Deep End of a Shallow Ocean: A Collection of Poetry","review":"I cannot fully express the brillance of this book. It is pure genuis. I personally am not a fan of poetry; I always thought it was all Old English love and flowers. This poet takes some traditions to her heart but also inject a vibrant originality into what I see now is a misunderstood genre. To truly understand you must go out and get a copy of this book. It is a necessary addition to anyone's bookshelf because it possesses so much depth. It has both elements of surrealism and reality. I can't say enough to justify this book. Even the introduction is a pleasure to read. It also gives a hint of what's in store. You really must just pick up a copy for yourself. Oh, and I was shocked to discover the writer is only in high school! She is a prodigy in the truest sense of the word."},{"Title":"Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies: A Theory of Image Restoration Strategies (S U N Y Series in Speech Communication)","review":"If this book represented the totality of Benoit's work on apologia it would easily garner a five star rating. However, even a quick google search reveals Benoit's original work is outdated and stands in desperate need of renovation and consolidation. This is one of the most creative and interesting reads you have never heard of."},{"Title":"Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies: A Theory of Image Restoration Strategies (S U N Y Series in Speech Communication)","review":"How does a corporation possibly apologize for spilling thousands of gallons of oil in to the oceans? Sticky situations such as this are the subject of Dr. Benoit's work &quot;Accounts, Excuses and Apologies.&quot; The book offers a fascinating view of the range of options that are available to individuals and groups who find themselves in the position of facing the public and having to say the hardest words ever, &quot;I'm Sorry.&quot; Dr. Benoit's book offers the macrocosm which is applicable to everyone's microcosm in the world of accounts, excuses and apology."},{"Title":"The year around: Poems for children","review":"I first learned about this book on Sage Pernasus CM homeschooling blog. This book is great for: lovers of poetry of all ages; homeschoolers using a Charlotte Mason Classical, Montessori, or other approach that suggests nature journals as part of the scientific study (which includes adding pertinent poetry or quotes for the items included therein); teachers looking for seasonal poems for use with their students or in the classroom; among others. The poems are listed by month and season, and are exactly what I wanted to add to our poetry collection.

I must admit, I heartily enjoyed reading this light-hearted piece after going through Gozzi's anti-Enlightenment sentiments and Brecht's near lack of emotion.

It will break down verse by verse and try to explain it in very simple terms and always give refference's to support their theology. If they don't know they say so, and never insert a made up lie that you will later have to work hard to earse from your doctrine. Let me be totally honest, their honest and that goe's a long way with me. I'm down to just this one, but occassionally refference one of the other's, but Wycliffe is the only way to go.

SELAH!"},{"Title":"Homemade Baby Food Pure and Simple: Your Complete Guide to Preparing Easy, Nutritious, and Delicious Meals for Your Baby and Toddler","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it was very informative on how and when to introduce foods to your baby. The recipes are very easy to follow, and most people with half a brain in the kitchen can just use it as a reference. I liked how it showed the food charts, as well as how many calories and nutrition facts for each age from infant to toddler. The basic concept behind this book truely is \\"pure and simple\\" I didn't see any recipes or advice in there that would contradict that idea. Making your own baby food is very inexpensive, natural, and easy. I don't think this book condoned any bad habits i.e. over feeding, junk foods, or added sugars, I guess those other reviews were a bit confused. I highly recommend this book to all moms who show an interest in their baby's nutrition. Besides, if you don't want to eat it yourself most likely your baby won't either, and I don't see many parents eating jar baby food."},{"Title":"Homemade Baby Food Pure and Simple: Your Complete Guide to Preparing Easy, Nutritious, and Delicious Meals for Your Baby and Toddler","review":"I bought this book when our first child was about four months old. I was distressed by the lack of processed baby foods options on the shelf, and we had recently seen the difference between homemade peas and store bought pea puree. HUGE difference in color and consistency. My pediatrician was excellent about telling us which foods should be introduced when, so I did not worry about the recipes that had eggs and yogurt as ingredients. This book isn't intended as a replacement for a doctor's advice. What I love about this book, and what keeps me using it after three kids, is that the recipes are easy to prepare and diverse. My children eat vegetables and fruits like crazy now, and my friends are shocked to see my five year old eat eggplant, asparagus, pineapple, avocado, and other things most kids would turn their noses at.

Personally, I found it especially helpful when preparing meals for my son when he was between 6 and 15 months old, though I still continue to use it from time to time now that he's almost 2. The book has plenty of good information on food safety, prep and storage as well as lots of basic recipes. I didn't find following the recipies to a \\"T\\" helpful, but simply to get the general idea and then experiment on my own. Use common sense and your doctor's advice with regard to the ingredients introduced at what age (i.e., egg whites, honey, wheat) is my suggestion. My son loved having a wide variety of nutritious foods, and still does in part due to this book. Just keep in mind it's a resource, not a food bible!"},{"Title":"Homemade Baby Food Pure and Simple: Your Complete Guide to Preparing Easy, Nutritious, and Delicious Meals for Your Baby and Toddler","review":"I am surprised with some of the lower reviews on this book. Some of the reviewers seem fanatical and others just plain incorrect. I feel pretty strongly about this which is why I decided to write my first Amazon review.I am not yet a mother, but I do know a lot about health and nutrition. I am a Pilates & Yoga teacher and a former health columnist. I studied several books before purchasing this one for a shower gift years ago. The then mommy-to-be told me it was so helpful and that she used it all the time, especially when first starting to feed her baby boy. She still refers to it today as she cooks for her 3-year-old! I have since bought it for 3 or 4 baby showers. I've found that this book is appropriate for people with a deeper understanding of health & nutrition as well as nutritionally-challenged people who need a book that will inform them without scaring them off.Back when I first bought this book, I was at the book store for about an hour comparing various babyfood books and Homemade Baby Foods was by far the best when it came to providing a lot of great information in an organized, reader-friendly, and non-intimidating way. \\"Search inside\\" the book and see for yourself.Linardakis gives great \\"side tips\\" that pop out in colored print. In one tip, she explains how to thoroughly wash produce to remove pesticides using a natural bristly brush and warm water or a vegi-wash.Go to a bookstore and compare the different books. I think you will see what I mean!"},{"Title":"Homemade Baby Food Pure and Simple: Your Complete Guide to Preparing Easy, Nutritious, and Delicious Meals for Your Baby and Toddler","review":"I've read the book cover to cover, but I can't say that it gave me any cooking ideas I didn't already have.

I found it very easy to read and helpful."},{"Title":"Homemade Baby Food Pure and Simple: Your Complete Guide to Preparing Easy, Nutritious, and Delicious Meals for Your Baby and Toddler","review":"I thought this book would be helpful in preparing me to make my son's baby food. In that respect, I suppose I should have given it 5 stars--because it did in a backhanded way by exposing what I shouldn't do. The recipes aren't as \\"pure\\" as I had hoped. I question some of the timing she gives for introducing certain foods as well as the ingredients! She uses Jell-o...one of the most processed foods out there!Additionally the tone is awful. So high and mighty. From page 1, the author seems to liken herself to Diane Keaton's character in \\"Baby Boom\\" and gives her high-powered background. Essentially she seems out of touch with real moms. The chapter on breast vs. bottle is heavily biased. Again, shows the author is out of touch. We all know that breastmilk is best, however there are circumstances where moms must choose formula for either health or lifestyle reasons. Perhaps she doesn't know that most moms in America don't have the luxury of high-powered jobs (or even taking off work for much longer than 8 weeks) with long lunches and the place to pump...not to mention the funds to buy one that could efficiently pump during a 15 minute break.And the \\"personal stories\\" throughout the book may irritate and nauseate you.Some of the charts are useful--like the one about caloric intake. But overall the book is subpar. There are just better books out there--like The Petit Appetit Cookbook. Or heck, use you own common sense. Steam and puree fruits and veggies, freeze and serve later. Then after a few months puree the family's meal. It's not so complex as this book would like you to think."},{"Title":"Homemade Baby Food Pure and Simple: Your Complete Guide to Preparing Easy, Nutritious, and Delicious Meals for Your Baby and Toddler","review":"Homemade Baby Food gives you easy, fresh recipes to make for a baby.

There are many recipes that introduce foods in too early compared to the information in other baby cook books. I was shocked to see recipes which included eggs and yogurt for four month olds! (both of which should not be introduced until after six months) Check out &quot;The Healthy Baby Meal PLanner&quot; or &quot;First Foods&quot; they are much easier to read and in my opinion safer choices."},{"Title":"Homemade Baby Food Pure and Simple: Your Complete Guide to Preparing Easy, Nutritious, and Delicious Meals for Your Baby and Toddler","review":"I was disapointed with this book. While it did include some good information, such as the reccommended age to start baby with at many foods, I could've thought the recipes up myself. For example the carrot recipe took up a third of a page and was basically: Boil the carrots until soft, then blend until smooth. The recipe for rice cereal is to go buy a box at the store and add water. I make rice cereal for my baby by boiling brown rice in distilled water until it is very soft, then putting it in the blender with more distilled water. It tastes much better than the boxed crap at the store and if needed formula can be added to improve the iron content. THis book is also not for the nutritionist. Many of the recipes for toddlers have sugar and butter added to them. I don't even eat butter or sugar, why give it to a baby? I make my baby's dinner every night when I make my own. Only takes a minute to blend.

I was also very dissapointed to find that it did not even start into a description of how to prepare your own baby food until chapter 5. Half the book has information on breastfeeding and formula feeding. I also was dissapointed with the recipes that were included, the recipes do not include detailed preparation information and asume that you know exactly how to prepare it already."},{"Title":"Homemade Baby Food Pure and Simple: Your Complete Guide to Preparing Easy, Nutritious, and Delicious Meals for Your Baby and Toddler","review":"I wish I had this book when my baby was 6 months old and just starting out! Many of the recipes would seem to be common sense: boil or steam a vegetable/fruit and puree it. However I'm not very creative at meal planning and being told exactly how to steam a peach is actually quite helpful. She explains how to prepare foods I wouldn't have thought of for a baby like celery or cucumber or red bell pepper. She even explains how to make your own teething biscuits. For those who need simple instructions and basic ideas, this book is great. Plus it draws info from a panel of experts including two doctors, a nurse, a dietician, and a nutritionist.Most of the ingredients are common and probably in your kitchen. There are several fun ethnic recipes too which may contain a few unusual ingredients but they aren't hard to find. It doesn't pretend to be a health-food book but is not filled with unhealthy recipes either (except the holiday foods chapter).She does not recommend eggs or yogurt for a 4mo baby as someone said. She clearly states that yolks wait until 8mo and whites 1yr, and yogurt 7mo. In fact she is careful to list a number of allergenic and/or dangerous foods to avoid in the first year including honey and peanut butter (although I was surprised by honey-peanut butter icing for \\"First Birthday Cake\\" as friends at the party may not be a year yet). The recipes containing these foods are obviously intended for toddlers.There is plenty of helpful information on specific nutrients and nutritional requirements at various ages. There is one chapter of 10 pages on breast/bottle; it's not half the book. This book is excellent for a new mom during the first year and after that you'll probably want to collect a few more references."},{"Title":"Homemade Baby Food Pure and Simple: Your Complete Guide to Preparing Easy, Nutritious, and Delicious Meals for Your Baby and Toddler","review":"This is the only book I found written with pediatrician guidelines and was real simple to read. The author did an outstanding job dividing this into categories of 4 months, 7 months and Toddler age.

Many of the recipes contain age-inappropriate ingredients, and the most important thing seems to be that the recipes appeal to the adult palate rather than meet the child's needs. According to the book, the author became interested in writing a baby food book before she had children and when she was working in a completely unrelated field - sounds a bit suspicious to me. Perhaps she just thought it would be fun and didn't take the time to do the proper research. Choose one of many other excellent baby food books rather than wasting your money on this one."},{"Title":"Homemade Baby Food Pure and Simple: Your Complete Guide to Preparing Easy, Nutritious, and Delicious Meals for Your Baby and Toddler","review":"This book sounds great from the title, but when you read it you find that you don't learn anything you didn't already know.

So aposite; it is about the laborer's life on the river. Like Buck,the simplicity of the language captures the simplicity of the thought process of the peasant. It is also an eduction in the dark, noir,beautiful past of the river.Martin J Kaplan,Ph.D."},{"Title":"A Single Pebble","review":"A single pebble is probably one of the few books in my life that I would read more than once. I like the clash between cultures because it is something we could all relate to if we have traveled to another country. The story is about a young engineer who goes on a journey up the Yangtze River trying to find a good spot to build a dam to make the river safer for boats. The young engineer is faced with many challenges such as the language barrier between himself and the boats crew and the fact that no one else on the boat wants him there because they think he is bad luck. He also starts to think that he is bad luck because on the trip their lead tracker falls into the river to his death, and he blammed the the trackers death on himself. Over all, the book was good with a mix of a little bit of action and some suspence to make you want to keep reading."},{"Title":"A Single Pebble","review":"First of all, I was surprised to see this title on lists of recommended reading for high school students. I had read Hersey's A Bell for Adano and loved it; so I thought A Single Pebble would be about as good as it was. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much. The novel is pretty good. It is about an engineer who is traveling down the Yangtze River looking for a place to build a dam. Along the way, the engineer faces a cultural shock especially when he discovers the people on the boat he is traveling on do not want a dam to be built. They don't want their lives to change. The author did a nice job conveying the clash of cultures and the need to try to bridge the gap between cultures. I think the problem I had with the novel was its style, and the fact that it isn't as good as A Bell for Adano. The prose the author uses consists of many simple sentences. Hersey was obviously influenced by Hemingway even though the tone was a little lighter than Hemingway's is. Unfortunately for me, I'm not a big fan of Hemingway's style; so the novel came across as pretty boring. The book isn't as good as A Bell for Adano. A Bell for Adano is also very much about a clash of cultures as it is set in Italy during World War II after the Americans' takeover. It explores the clash of cultures better, and it is a much better read. Overall, A Single Pebble is a pretty good novel, just not a great one."},{"Title":"A Single Pebble","review":"I read a single pebble as a part of my nineth grade reading standards. I found this book quite boring along with pointless. If I had the choice I would not have chosen this even as a free choice book. I don't recomend this to ANYONE!"},{"Title":"A Single Pebble","review":"Although published almost 50 years ago, this book deserves another look using a modern, critical lens. Overshadowed by Hersey's other works, specifically Hiroshima and A Bell for Adano, A Single Pebble offers a great deal to the reader. The book is far more than a fictionalized travelogue of a trip up the Yangtse River. It is a work that documents exposure to the acts and ideas of another culture by an American used to thinking of himself as representative of all that is modern and educated, and therefore all that is to be considered as desireable or superior. As a reader, I came away from the book with the idea that all that I think glitters may not be gold. It should be noted, however, that this is not an American-bashing book; both sides--the narrator and the Chinese people he meets--are guilty of a type of national myopia when viewing the &quot;Other&quot; in their midst. Those interested in Postcolonial and Cultural studies will find plenty to occupy them, whichever side of the debate they fall on."},{"Title":"A Single Pebble","review":"When I recieved the list of the six books that we had to read for freshmanyear in high school I was devistated. &quot;There goes my summer.&quot; But, fortuantley, the first book I picked up was John Hershey's &quot;A Single Pebble.&quot; I was drawn in when I read about the American engineer who would travel through China to look for spots to build dams. Then I was touched when I met the cast of characters aboard his junk boat. The owner's wife treated the American engineer with much love, when no one else really did. This eased his homesickness. The others, such as Big Pebble, and the owner, Old Big, were mysterious characters. This book, lathough I had been to China before, helped me understand Chinese culture better. I thought that they would be open to something as useful as a dam, espically after you read all the hard times they have to go through to get through a single river and how long it takes. But I was suprised."},{"Title":"A Single Pebble","review":"This is a great short novel. A young engineer, he's never named, goes to China to plan a dam. Culture shock sets in. What do these Chinese need with a dam? The main Chinese character is the man who walks the towpath ashore, taking the little boat upriver. Conventions and mores and customs interfere. Even the flipping of your hand can get you into trouble. Beautifully written; Hersey loved each sentence. The towpath man, his feet knowing every inch of miles of towpath, is unforgettable."},{"Title":"A Single Pebble","review":"I was required to read the book &quot;A Single Pebble,&quot; for summer reading. I thought it would be terrible, but I loved it. The book is a symbolic novel, about a boy that goes to china looking for a place to build a dam. He went there thinking he would be superior to all the others on the boat, but shortly realized he was looked down upon. The engineer experiences a culture shock, and is upset to find out the trackers, owner, and old pebble are upset that he wants to build a dam, even if it will help them. He later decides whether to blame himself for the death of a crew member- believing he killed himself as fear for change in the ways of the river. As he rides the junk, he learns of chinese tradition, fear, and superstitions, and faces the mighty power of the great Yangzee River"},{"Title":"A Single Pebble","review":"Set against the backdrop of the mighty Yangtze river, A Single Pebble protrays the culture shock experience by an American engineer. The book has great meaning today considering China's dubious efforts in building the Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze which will displace millions, destroy habitat, and perhaps in the end be reclaimed by the wrath of the mighty river itself."},{"Title":"A Single Pebble","review":"I had read John Hershery's &quot;A Bell for Adano&quot; and enjoyed the subtle nature of his writing so decided to read another of his works. As a student of civil engineering, I found &quot;A Single Pebble&quot; far from boring. When you read it, let yourself become omnipresent within it."},{"Title":"A Single Pebble","review":"I became an engineer, also.The ASE and IEEE magazines printed lists of books favored by other engineers--some of my heroes, in fact. The book is written simply, probably appropriate for a junior high school literature class. An adult should devour the book over a short business flight.Other reviewers, as well as the synopsis here, have explained the story. But I haven't read any that explain how this book relates to engineering. The protagonist is an Engineer, and is culturally distinct from his hosts despite his knowledge of many customs, cuisine, and the language. However, he adversely affects the chi of the boat, subtly disturbing everyone on board.Further, he is also at odds with thier purpose. He brashly announces his intent to dam the river, intending to simplify and protect their lives with his technology, when he's actually threatening their comfort.The story is something that all engineers should read--particularly young students--such that they might begin to understand one way that the process of engineering might take shape."},{"Title":"A Single Pebble","review":"Hershey has written a small, but very powerful book. It is full of whimsey and cultural contrasts. It entertains such questions as what is true progress. Indeed, it is a great book for group discussions."},{"Title":"A Single Pebble","review":"Many of Hersey's other books are moving, memorable stories. A Bell for Adano and Hiroshima are among Hersey's best, and these books should be read by any well-rounded individual. A Single Pebble, however, is more forgetable. Hersey does do a good job presenting the clash between traditional Chinese culture and modern Western culture in the early twentieth century. However, the clash between the main character, an engineer representing Western culture, and another leading character, a boatsman representing traditional Chinese culture, is so artificially strong that the reader can sympathize with neither character or position. The book anticlimaxes and concludes with some overly abstract thoughts on the future of China. Ultimately, it is not a book of the same quality as many of Hersey's other works, nor is it a story of the same quality as other stories (in multiple media) that probe the differences between East Asian and Eurpoean culture."},{"Title":"A Single Pebble","review":"My cardiologist recommended this book and said that it was his favorite.

I also like that the book included cautions for different EO's (i.e. for pregnant women and sun exposure) as beginners would not know about needing to be careful of these things.One thing that I WAS NOT impressed with was that she has you buy an organic base for different things (soaps, shampoos, etc) and just add the EO's rather than tell you how to make it completely from scratch yourself.One word of caution - DO NOT USE THE SHAMPOO RECIPES for everyday use. The author is an RN and herbalist not a cosmetologist. She has you buy a baby shampoo for your base and just add the rest. I am a licensed cosmetologist and can tell you that baby shampoo is the worst shampoo you can use on your hair for everyday use. It is a clarifying shampoo used to strip your hair completely of everything and you will end up with dry, brittle, split end prone hair. It is ok for babies as babies have different kind of hair that is coated and needs the harsh shampoo in order to get it cleaned. It doesnt bother babies hair for one because you should only wash their hair at the most 3 times a week and for two their hair produces more oils to protect it. Bottom line - if you are going to use this shampoo, limit your usage to no more than once every two weeks to remove product buildup (use less than that if you dont use a lot of product). Consult another book for better hair care recipes - I highly recommend the book \\"Organic Body Care Recipes\\" by Stephanie Tourles (a licensed esthetician."},{"Title":"Natural Beauty Basics : Create Your Own Cosmetics and Body Care Products","review":"This book is great- I've tried a bunch of the recipes and they were actually pretty easy to make and worked well, unlike another book I have on making your own lotions and shampoos.

The book implies instructions that are not included.As other readers have stated the shampoo section just adds to baby shampoo. What they didn't say was the soap section has you just adding essential oils to castile soap in all the recipes. Don't waste your money on this book, you can find the same recipes on the internet.

There are two problems with this book. It is not well written, and there just isn't that much information for the money. Of the book's 88 pages, only pages 9-65 are part of the biography. There are 18 chapters in these 57 pages, often 2 pages in the book contain only one page of writing. The whole book reads like it was written as a college project last minute. Definitely not nearly as captivating as many other rock biographies I have read. Great band, bad book."},{"Title":"Bruised and Broken","review":"Highly clever! It breaks down the prejudices and so-called &quot;urban legends&quot; that are linked to Brian. It goes behind the screens to mingle through Molko's past, to reveal the truth behind the Placebo-Limp Bizkit &quot;fueds&quot;, and demonstrates how a talented man's love for music made him surfrace to the top no matter how many tried to knock him down. An inspiring read for anyone who's ever felt like pursuing a dream and witnessing it unfold before you. Whether you're a Placebo fan or not, this book will make you feel close to Molko and feel respect for him no matter what the media says."},{"Title":"Bruised and Broken","review":"Yuck! I bought this book primarily to learn more about the frontman of one of my favorite bands, Placebo. While our hero, Brian Molko, is obviously fascinating \\"Bruised and Broken\\" is a real let-down and certainly not doing him or the reader justice! The prose and grammatical structure contained in this book is truly poor writing. Didn't anyone proofread the manuscript before sending it to print?! I expected a deeper, more captivating and more meaningful insight given the subject; reading this is like reading a fifth-grader's (that's age 10 to 11 years old) composition about Brian Molko. I waited three months to receive this book and spent $15.00 for 65 pages of drab expression - the book actually contains 88 pages but pages 69 to 88 are quotes from Brian and the Placebo's discography. Save your money; just peruse Bravo Magazine or the band's website if you want to learn more about Placebo."},{"Title":"Bruised and Broken","review":"Informative but fun. This book helps break the clich&egrave;s surrounding rock's most ambiguous men. It's filled with enough anecdotes to not bore the reader but not too many to overwhelm the reader. Plus the quotes section is filled with Molko's best remarks ever (clever one-liners worth quoting!). The best thing about this book is that it doesn't verge on the negative and at times you feel that the author is merely celebrating the positive qualities of this strange but charismatic icon, that is Brian Molko."},{"Title":"Bruised and Broken","review":"Begin the journey into Molko's world from the very start, what spurred him to move in the direction of music, and was he always headed there? What kind of people made him or broke him? All these questions are answered in the book. But not only those. For a newbie Placebo fan, this book gives you the 101 on everything that you need to know about Brian Molko, for others who are more \\"seasoned\\" fans, can find that some information you may already know, but it's how it's presented and the way everything is put into one \\"compact\\" easy guide that makes all the difference. Why spend ages trying to find out everything on various internet sites or fishing through articles if everything is put together in one book? You get the complete package, the bio, the complete discography of albums and singles, and even a section of famous quotes. Sure, the book isn't as lengthy as other biographies on other rockstars may be, but it's still one wild journey to tread into Molkoland for a day."},{"Title":"Bruised and Broken","review":"this is a great book with great info about Brian's early years. my only complaint is that this book is so short! i read it in less than a day, because a portion os this book is discography and quotes, so the book's actual text is so short. but overall, i love that i bought this book."},{"Title":"Bruised and Broken","review":"I'm a recent Placebo fan so I found this book very interesting in displaying the information surrounding the band's lead singer.

But all in all it's enjoyable."},{"Title":"Bruised and Broken","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It depicts Brian in a positive way as the author mainly focuses on his musical talent. But also focuses on his early life, on the experiences that molded his personality and allowed him to achieve the top."},{"Title":"Bruised and Broken","review":"This book gives you a new approach on looking at Brian Molko more as a person than solely as a rockstar. The anecdotes are entertaining and funny. Brian's public caricature is broken and a more realistic guise is witnessed. An amusing read."},{"Title":"Bruised and Broken","review":"Good book for someone who is not really familiar with Placebo and wants to know more about theladylike frontman of the best band in a decade, like he might be mentioned.Bruised and Broken describes the backgrounds and upcoming of a young excentric looking musician, who became frontman of the band Placebo with which he now steady and stable fills the stages in- and outside Europe, by putting all information together the writer could find about him and add sort of a personal touch.Nonetheless I missed something: some information is not mentioned, or only slightly. Therefore I ask myself if this book was produced with or without the co-operation of the band. Maybe that's the reason why the book counts only 87 pages (including the exclusive Molko Quotes).I also missed the photos that could have given the book more meaning, style and charisma.Nevertheless I read the whole book in one breath and especially the last chapter was one of my favorites; not because it was the last one. I could have read more.It's still inspiring to see how a \`born loser' succesfully struggled himself out of his boring life and rised up to unknown height.Brian Molko is sort of my hero: he is THE flesh figurehead for not giving up on your dream."},{"Title":"Bruised and Broken","review":"Not the usual stuffy biography.

It's not a reference, it certainly couldn't be in it's scant 200 pages. It teaches both the language and the framework by using example projects and walking through how they are built with a combination of code, illustrations and screenshots. The writing is good, if a bit terse.If you are a VB beginner and you are looking for a step by step walkthrough, avoid the mega super bible 1,000 page tomes, and try something like this book in combination with a refernce book on the language and another on the framework. Though you could probably skip the framework one and just use the MSDN."},{"Title":"Visual Basic 2005 Jumpstart","review":"Technically speaking, there is nothing wrong with this book. This title is aimed at giving VB6 users a whirlwind tour of the VB2005 environment, highlighting additions, deletions, and changes. If you don't have a VB6 background, this read isn't for you. The overview starts with a look at the new Visual Studio environment, showing you some of the toolbar objects with and without data binding. The next few chapters show off some of the newer statements and functions to VB, a peek into the .NET framework and classes, and object oriented programming in the VB world. The last goal of this book is to apply the covered areas in the development of an application.As I said, there is nothing wrong with this title. My biggest issue is that for the first half, it reads like an advertising brochure for the VB2005 platform - and the author does an excellent job at selling the product. The second half (where you develop an application), is very step by step, covering just what you need to know to write the application - nothing more. At 188 pages, the book is too small to be a reference or even a learner's textbook. Although you are made aware of VB2005 elements, and even get to see them in action, you are not going to finish this book and be much further down the VB6 to VB.NET conversion road. VB.NET is only superficially like VB6, and when you are done with this book, if you liked what you saw, you will need to purchase another title aimed at actually teaching you the .NET platform."},{"Title":"Visual Basic 2005 Jumpstart","review":"This book is a great guide for all seasoned Visual Basic 6 developers who want to get a nice taste of what to expect out of Visual Basic 2005. For those individuals who are strictly used to using Visual Basic 6, you will not be scared off by the author's analysis of the new features in 2005 such as things like the nice addition My Namespace. For people that have already made the switch to the Visual Basic.NET and were upset to see Edit and Continue vanish, you will be happy to see it's return in VB2005.This book is a nice guide even for individuals who are not familiar with Visual Basic, as Wei-Meng Lee gives a nice overview of things like a Stack and what Intellisense is in Visual Basic.For the low price of this book I think this is a great pickup for all people that use Visual Basic on a daily basis or want to learn more about the most popular RAD (Rapid Application Development) tool on the planet. Like the author's book \\"ASP.NET 2.0 : A Developer's Notebook\\", Mr. Lee gives the reader a nice overview of what to expect in VB2005 and he does so in a concise, clear manner.

He's been able to read the book, but if he wants to work on any of the projects or flip back to a section to review, it is more difficult. The information in the book is useful."},{"Title":"Visual Basic 2005 Jumpstart","review":"This book is like sitting in one of those two-day seminars where they have a couple of examples that show things that they want to get across and as long as you are willing to stay on the guided tour, they work well. There are some nice nuggets in this book. My favorite is that Wei-Meng chose to go into the Amazon Web Services in one example. Learning about this was worth the price of admission.On the other hand, I got so sick of hearing about how VB was doing all the \\"heavy lifting\\" and such. These are terms that I would expect to hear from some rah rah salesperson, not a serious author trying to teach something. I know MS is the king and there are no serious other options in Basic with Windows, so why drive the point home with a pick axe?I also wonder about a book that is supposed to be for experienced programmers, but tells you what an integer variable is.I'm glad the book was cheap. I did get an adequate sense of direction from the book. I would wait to buy reference books since VB 2008 is coming out now. the VB2005 books will get cheap and I will get 2008."},{"Title":"Visual Basic 2005 Jumpstart","review":"This book is aimed squarely at seasoned VB6 programmers and covers the new features in VB2005 reasonably well. The code is available at the O'Reilly web site, although I often timeout accessing downloads there. Annoyingly a lot of the links aren't online, so you have to type in URLs like one at Microsft that includes the text \\"/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=06616212-0356-46a0-8da2-eebc53a68034&displaylang;=en\\" to access essential downloads needed to work through the examples. The book also appears to have originated as a project aimed at people converting to VB.Net so there are odd inconsistencies you need to figure out. Although it says it is suitable for the Express Edition of VB2005, it is really aimed more squarely at purchasers of Visual Studio 2005.That the book has frogs on the front is quite appropriate since you will find yourself jumping around a lot. Figures are frequently on different pages to the text where they are referred and things you might have wanted to sort out before a chapter are raised later on.I don't want to carp too much. Given the wealth of stuff still around about VB6 anything for VB2005 is to be welcomed. The author is clearly technically competent, if not the most fluent writer around.A final point, if you think this book will help you port your apps from VB6 to VB2005 it only provides some broad guidelines. In virtually any instance migration is far from being a trivial activity and one that you are invariably better off avoiding. The book will help you migrate your skills, but you are probably better of re-writing your apps."},{"Title":"The Complete Dolls' House Book","review":"This book has lots of great decorating techniques and different ideas for different home styles.

It is a wonderful book full of ideas and color photos to inspire.I have a home library, which has a section devoted to dollhouse miniatures. I enjoy looking through the colorful ones over and over. The older black and white ones, or instruction ones I keep for reference. I tend to purchase only those books that are worthwhile for reference, or to browse through over and over for inspiration and enjoyment. At 175pages, this colorful book is more of an idea book than a how to manual, which is fine. Jean Nisbett knows her stuff when it comes to dollhouse miniatures.It is well-illustrated and divided into three parts: Part 1 focuses on the house from choosing a dolls house, deciding on a style and dolls. Part 2 covers different periods: Tudor, Georgian, Regency, Victorian, William Morris, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, and the 1920s and 1930s. Part 3 covers other themes: the country cottage, the dolls' house shop and the dolls house garden. Part 4 covers the practical aspects: useful tools and their uses, buidling a dolls' house, restoration, lighting, decoration, soft furnishings, furniture, and finishing touches. This is another book I intend to keep and browse from time to time for sheer enjoyment. All in all, if you are a miniaturist enthusiast or enjoy reading about them, this is a worthwhile purchase.

As other reviewers have said, it does contain a lot of useful information for someone thinking about retiring to Islands. Unfortunately, however, the book suffers greatly from two serious flaws. First, it is incredibly poorly proofread; it is replete with distracting and annoying spelling and typographical errors. (One wonders what the publisher was doing!) Second, large portions of the book provide information about matters that change very quickly. In particular, the prices cited are already wildly out of date.

This is an excellent starting point for the I Ching.The introduction alone is the best you will probably find among the translations and commentaries out there.One of the keys to a good translation is that it is VERSATILE. A good I Ching allows for multiple interpretations given your question and circumstances. I find that many Western commentaries are too narrow and almost always focus on the spiritual or relationships too much. This version can answer those same questions, of course, but it can be used for any other inquiry you will have. It is what I wish had been my starting point.You will at some point need to get a true translation like Alfred Huang's, but if you are getting started, you need to start here. I would also recommend R. L. Wing's Workbook as an excellent starting point, too.My only complaint is that the cover is horrible. The I Ching is an important and enlightened book. It is meant to be revered. The cover on this one is a publisher's choice I am sure. A simple cover with the Yin/Yang symbol and simply &quot;The I Ching&quot; is all that is required. &quot;How To Use&quot; smacks of that Complete Idiot's Guide mentality.

The NSDAP attracted many Ariosophist thinkers and members of occult societies such as the Germanenorden, the Thule Society, and the Edda Society to swell its ranks.Nazi symbols, such as the swastika, the death's head, the iron eagle and the lightning rune were drawn from occult sources and imbued with occult symbolism (and some would say power). Heinrich Himmler made no bones about it (pardon the bad pun): The SS was meant to be a mystical Order. Anyone who watches the filmed funeral of Reinhardt Heydrich which is replete with Nazi occult symbolism and ritual, will see those powerful influences about which Goodrick-Clarke writes so well."},{"Title":"The Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology","review":"It's a good book but I have to say that this guy has to remember that not all of us have Phd's....

Beside Bactria,Sogdiana etc. Ibrahim Zeradust aka Abu Rama aka Ibn Rama aka Abraham after Saraswati river cataclism went thru Bactria to Canaan Valley. Abraham first tought 3 Bactrian kings. When Jesus was born there showed up 3 magi as wise men. Biblical pharisee are nothing else as Pharsi/Parsi equal Persians. Since second temple was build by Cyrus the Great and Pharsee were zoroastrian priests speaks avestan or sanskrit. Religion is not fairy tales but doctrines.

Word Veda means wisdom, greek sophia or baphomet. Sophia is goddess of wisdom. The biggest temple devoted to her is Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. Look at pictures of Hagia Sophia and pay attention to circles outside on 2 main lodges. Those circles are kolowrat, kolovrat. Check google what it means. When Hitler was man of the year in Time magazine, kolowrat is behind him. The circled swastika in Thule symbol is shaped into kolowrat. Swastika has the same roots as Basque Lauburu: four heads. It was 4 horse heads with encircled flames inside as The Sun symbol.Vedic teching- Vedanta knowledge is known under names like: gnosticism, kaballah,sufism. Jesus's Nazorean Essenes practiced kaballah, and Jesus and Solomon have Kashmir connections. Before christianity was developed by power elites, Rome was Vedic. Name of Rome comes from Rama.

When the camp was disbanded in April 1919, he went back to Munich, which was still being ruled by a Soviet republic founded by a Polish Kurt Eisner (real name Salamon Kosmanowsky).At the beginning of May, a few days after the communist revolution had been terminated on May 1, 1919 by the Bavarian Freikorps, Hitler was summoned as a member of the 2nd Infantry Regiment to attend a course on political instruction. The purpose of this course of lectures was to provide the soldiers with a background of politics, which would enable them to monitor the many revolutionary and political movements present in Munich at that time.One of the lecturers was a former construction engineer turned economist, Dr Gottfried Feder (1881-1941). His first lecture was entitled \\"The Abolition of the Interest-Servitude\\". Hitler was enthralled by what he heard, and this was to be a turning point in his political career. The following quotations from Mein Kampf reflect his initial thoughts.\\" For the first time in my life I heard a discussion which dealt with the principles of stock exchange capital and capital which was used for loan activities. After hearing the first lecture delivered by Feder, the idea immediately came into my head that I had found a way to one of the most essential prerequisites for the founding of a new party... To my mind, Feder's merit consisted in the ruthless and trenchant way in which he described the double character of the capital engaged in stock exchange and loan transactions, laying bare the fact that this capital is ever and always dependent on the payment of interest. In fundamental questions his statements were so full of common sense that those who criticized him did not deny that au fond his ideas were sound, but they doubted whether it be possible to put these ideas into practice. To me this seemed the strongest point in Feder's teaching, though others considered it a weak point....I understood immediately that here was a truth of transcendental importance for the future of the German people. The absolute separation of stock exchange capital from the economic life of the nation would make it possible to oppose the process of internationalization in German business without at the same time attacking capital at such, for to do this would be to jeopardize the foundations of our national independence. I clearly saw what was developing in Germany, and I realized then that the stiffest fight we would have to wage would not be against the enemy nations but against international capital. In Feder's speech I found an effective rallying-cry for our coming struggle...The struggle against international finance capital and loan capital has become one of the most important points in the program on which the German nation has based its fight for economic freedom and independence.\\"A few weeks later Hitler received an instruction from his superiors to investigate a political association called the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (German Workers Party). At this meeting held in the Sterneckerbrau Inn in Munich, about 20 to 25 persons were present. The main speaker was Dr Gottfried Feder.Wikipedia, Gottfried Feder:\\"From 1917 on, Feder studied financial politics and economics on his own; he developed a hostility towards wealthy bankers during World War I and wrote a \\"manifesto on breaking the shackles of interest\\" (\\"Brechung der Zinsknechtschaft\\") in 1919. This was soon followed by the founding of a \\"task force\\" dedicated to those goals that demanded a nationalisation of all banks and an abolishment of interest. In February 1920, together with Adolf Hitler and Anton Drexler, Feder--who also was a member of the Thule Society drafted the so-called \\"25 points\\" which summed up the party's views, and introduced his own anti-capitalist views into the program.\\"Feder was man of National Socialism, term developed in late 19th century in this days Czech republic. But later Germany leaned toward fascism as, wikipedia: \\"However, despite his implementation of the blood and soil ideology of the Nazis, decentralized factories, generals and Junkers successfully opposed him. Generals objected because it interferred with rearmament, and Junkers because it would prevent their exploiting their estates for the international market.After the Night of the Long Knives in June 1934, where SA leaders like Ernst R&ouml;hm and left leaning party officials like Gregor Strasser were murdered, Feder began to withdraw from the government, finally becoming a professor at the Technische Hochschule in Berlin in December 1936, where he stayed until his death in Murnau on 24 September 1941.\\"While Nazism did have fascist overtones, Nazism is not a form of government. Nazism is political ideology implemented through the use of a fascist government system. It is this system that needs to be understood and not the policy employed through it. This is vital since any form of government - yes, including a democracy - can be operated through a fascist structure. It is not exclusive to a dictatorship.Now you may argue that \\"who cares what the actual meaning of the word is, because it has taken on further societal overtones and inferences which society and it's people now attribute to the word.\\" However, this does not do justice to the reality of the word or the reality of the world we live in today. You see, if we were to associate the word Fascist with Nazi, then we consciously set ourselves up to be oblivious to actual fascist tendencies which do not exhibit the racial or genocidal image that one has of Hitler's master race. In order to analyze the events of the world today, we need a clear understanding of the true nature of Fascism, separate from its societal inferences.That fascist structure of government begins with the co-option of corporate and government interests becoming one in the same. This is the primary transition in the nature and operation of the government apparatus. Corporate power is not so much as protected; it is one in the same as government power. Hence the government is an extension of the corporate powerbrokers in society.Gottfried Feder ideology was decentralized democracy Swiss style. That what national socialism means. But power elites/bankers/industrialists, against whom DAP was developed, kidnapped NSDAP and the and was as we know it: 6 milion jews were exterminated in IG Farben slave labor camp Auschwitz/Monowitz.Main force behind this switch was Joseph Stalin. Who by 1928 paralized all west associated leaders as Lenin, Trotsky etc. He also eliminated influence of western bankers and refused to pay loans for WW1 and revolution. So bankers rearment Germany one more times. But Stalin was one of the greatest leaders and strategists in history, beside Scythians who escape before Alex the great, Fabius Maximus with the same delaying strategy defeated Hannibal,Kutuzoff defeated Napoleon.Stalin kicked off Teutonic knights crusaders from Slavic lands, except East Germany- but get it under control. Stalin screw 'em up so deeply that they turned one more times against themselfs. That WW2 did not ended as was pre-planed is suported by Operation Unthinkable. Stalin called Bretton-Woods as dollar's imperialism and refused to sign. Teutonic knights divorced from Vatican as they turned to reformation. So Vatican took all land back in Polish hands.Apropo. Sebottendorff was arrested in conection of Reichstag fire as Sefik Husnu. But fascists charged communists."},{"Title":"The Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology","review":"A very well-researched book, it made for a good read just due to the obscure nature of the subject, but i think it would seem cumbersome to someone who hasn't read much about occultism and late eighteenth-early nineteenth century Germany and Austria."},{"Title":"The Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology","review":"Great book.

It examines the influence these groups may have had on Nazi leaders in the SS, on Adolf Hitler, and on the thinking of Germans at the time. It is necessary to understand such extremist and occult groups in order to understand how the Nazis were able to take over Germany. Millenarian fantasies and a kind of cultural paranoia preoccupied the German mind, and these fantasies came to hold a unique place within various secret societies set up to propagate racist and occult doctrines (especially concerning the role of the &quot;Aryan&quot; race and it's existence in German prehistory). The author examines many eccentric German individualists, dreamers, and romantics and their role in occult societies. These include: Guido (von) List, who claimed to have rediscovered a Wotanist religion and was influenced by the Theosophist Helena Petrovna Blavatsky; Jorg Lanz von Liebenfels, who resurrected a sect based on the Knights Templars; the Ariosophists, who relied on a &quot;theozoology&quot; concerning the struggle of the Aryan race, and their secret societies, the Germanenorden, the Thule Society, and the Edda Society. The author also considers the influence of such individuals as Rudolf von Sebottendorf, Herbert Reichstein, and Karl Maria Wiligut on the SS (Himmler), and examines the role Ariosophical thinking might have played in the development of Adolf Hitler. The book includes several appendices, one of which deals with some of the sensationalist and &quot;crypto-historical&quot; literature that has sprang up around the occult and Nazism, which attributes a great role to the occult in the rise to power of the Nazis. This is an important book for understanding how collective delusions can arise in the mind of a country, particularly racist ideologies. The Nazis continue to exercise a fascination upon us, both for their brutality and for their nationalist mysticism. And, this book allows us to understand.[If you are interested in this kind of thing, I can also recommend any of the works by Norman Cohn, who is cited repeatedly in this book. He deals mostly with the medieval period, but you'll notice that the same sort of delusions and fantasies keep on cropping up throughout European history.]"},{"Title":"The Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology","review":"This is a great book on the history of the movement.

He is quite comprehensive in his coverage of Ariosophist philosophers and enigmatic volkish groups which blossomed in late ninteenth-early twentieth century middle Europe.What makes this book worth reading to the student of Modern European History, is not only Goodrick-Clarke's ability to link these movements to Nazi philosophy, but his attention to detail. Further, he carefully explains the historical surroundings and mystical, sometimes ludicrous, beliefs held by members of the various Ariosophical societies.These explanations, coupled with what must have been very tedious research, enlighten these somewhat obscure and often forgotten influences on the NSDAP.This book is well worth a read.

By no means is it a typical Shirer inspired playscript of the Reich.TAB"},{"Title":"The Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology","review":"_The Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology_ by Nicholas Goodrick-Clark is an intriguing academic study on the pre-Nazi occult scene in Germany. The cover features a rather threatening Thule Gesellschaft symbol: a sword and swastika wrapped in laurels and a halo of emanating light. Many of the occult practices described in this book--palmistry, crystals, secret orders, hidden knowledge, spirit guides, channeling, tarot cards, fortune telling, astrology--have retained their popularity today in the New Age movement. What's particularly interesting about Goodrick-Clarke's work is he compares the Ariosophists List and Lanz to the ancient duelist philosophies of Gnosticism and Manicheanism in their extreme division of reality into two eternally conflicting forces of good (Aryans) and evil (Jews). Goodrick-Clarke begins his discussion by going back to the writings of Madame Helena Blavatsky, her two books _The Secret Doctrine_ and _Isis Unvieled_, and her occult Theosophical Society. Her books propagated a form of anti-rationalism and anti-scientism, instead relying upon supposed revealed secret doctrines by hidden masters in Tibet. Blavatsky believed there was a series of seven \\"root races\\" that lived on earth, of which the Aryan race was the fifth. Other notables connected with the occult at this time included Annie Besant, Charles Leadbeater and Bulwer Lytton. Lytton wrote in his work _The Coming Race_ of a subterranean race that was to give mankind new enlightenment and psychic abilities. Ariosophy, the so-called wisdom of the Aryans, developed from theosophical ideas and the general occult subcultures of the time. The political and motivation for the rise of occultism in Germany and Austria was the situation of the Austro -Hungarian Empire and the Hapsburg monarchy. Prussia had permanently excluded Austria from a role in a united German state by Bismark's military victories before 1871. However the Austrian Empire encompassed not only Hungary but also many nationalities of Slavic, non-German descent, in addition to Jewish minorities. The status of Germans as a whole in Austria was tenuous and the conservative elements of the populace were more inclined to fall for unorthodox metaphysical beliefs that would allow them to fight against the tides of political liberalism in the Empire. Hitler, it is to be noted, was not actually born in \\"Germany\\" proper but in the Austro-Hungarian Empire near the German border. Goodrick-Clarke takes care to note that Hitler despised the Hapsburg monarchy, while his sectarian occultist predecessors admired it as a bastion of German mystical/mythical tradition. In Vienna, during the late 1800s and early 1900s before World War I, two radical German nationalists, Guido von List and Adolf Lanz (who self-styled himself with the aristocratic title of von Liebenfels) researched and published a considerable amount of literature dealing with Germany's so-called repressed history. List believed that ancient, pagan, pre-Christian Germany was a center of culture kept alive by a secret order of initiates, the Armanenschaft, who established a decentralized aristocratic hierarchy and kept the German race pure through eugenic practices. Oddly enough, their secret doctrine, according to List, was encoded and given to the Rabbis for safekeeping in the form of the Cabala, in order to preserve it from Christian destruction. Lanz, whose _Ostara_ pamphlets Hitler is likely to have read, was an ex-Cistercian monk who joined the pan-German movement. Lanz made an extensive study of ancient civilizations and the Old Testament and concluded that the ancestors of the German race lived on Atlantis, which sank, and spread to Northern Europe and the Middle East. The supposed Aryan Middle Easterners founded the great civilizations of Egypt and the Fertile Crescent, including the Hebrews. The Hebrew Scripture, according to Lanz's analysis, was a history of the attempt for Aryans to preserve their race. He interpreted the fall as the miscegenation between Aryans and lesser races. Lanz believed Jesus (\\"Frauja\\") was an Aryan savior and the medieval Christian character of Europe, with its monasteries and nobility, embodied the Aryan ideal. He believed Alexandria, known for its library and scholarship, was the center of gravity of ancient Ariosophy. The first bishop to convert the Germans to Christianity was Ulifas, an Arian bishop from Alexandria, thus Lanz equates \\"Aryanism\\" with the Christian heresy of \\"Arianism,\\" or disbelief in the deity of Christ. The Ariosophists and pan-Germanists believed the only way to preserve Germany's Aryan past was to fight against modern liberal tendencies and take aggressive action against those corrupting Germany's traditional landscape: the Jews, communists and Slavs. Several quasi-Masonic lodges were founded throughout Germany and Austria before, during and after WWI. Among these were the Thule Society and the Germannorden. There is some speculation that the Thule Society, its membership being a collection of well-educated professionals and aristocrats, founded the German Workers Party (DAP) as an activist political party to attract a mass membership. Hitler was sent as a spy to the DAP to survey its activities. Hitler later joined this party, which eventually renamed itself the German National Socialist Party (NASDAP or Nazi Party). Although Hitler never mentioned Lanz by name in any of his recorded words, Goodrick-Clarke attributes this fact to Hitler not wanting to call attention to where he got his ideas during his formative years in Vienna. Although Hitler did not have much of an interest in actual occult practices, his chief of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, did. Himmler consulted a former mental asylum inmate, Karl Maria Willigut (a.k.a. Weisthor), who claimed to possess an ancient ancestral knowledge of the German race. Himmler constructed a \\"Nazi Vatican\\" at a castle in Wewelsburg where neo-pagan ceremonies for the Nazi SS were held. Goodrick-Clarke's final appendix to this study is an examination of the mythology Nazi Germany's meteoric rise and fall from an obscure party from the 1920s to a totalitarian government that had Europe from the English Channel to the Caucasus Mountains under its thumb (albeit briefly). A considerable amount of literature has been published in various countries about how the Nazi Party's rise to power was aided by supernatural and demonic forces."},{"Title":"The Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology","review":"Folks who think that Nazism isn't all that bad would *hate* this book.

If one also reads &quot;Unholy Alliance&quot; (Levander), &quot;Die Runenkunde im Dritten Reich&quot; (Hunger), &quot;Schwarze Fahnen, Runenzeichen&quot; (WeiBmann), you'll see that this book is a first-class survey of the subject at hand.

Rather, it's a perfectly serious and scholarly work. The author, Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, is a British professor specializing in the relationship between occultism and right-wing extremism, an admittedly obscure subject.The book deals with the Thule Society, the Germanenorden and other occult groups in interwar Germany and Austria. Guido von List, J&ouml;rg Lanz von Liebenfels and Rudolf von Sebottendorff are featured. It turns out that fascist occultism was simply a more extreme, exotic version of \\"v&ouml;lkisch\\" nationalism, a much broader movement. The function of occultism, in the author's opinion, was to sacralize the purported traditions of v&ouml;lkisch German nationalism, thereby turning them into really timeless truths (and religious dogmas).Inevitably, a book of this kind must confront the question of whether the Third Reich and the Nazi party were in some sense \\"occult\\". After all, the Nazis did use the swastika as their symbol, and so did some of the \\"Ariosophist\\" groups. Was Hitler himself influenced by this kind of evil occultism? Goodrick-Clarke believes that the influence, if any, must have been negligible. Hitler may have been an avid reader of the occult magazine \\"Ostara\\" and apparently sought out its editor Lanz to purchase back issues. The hysterical anti-Semitism of the magazine would have appealed to Hitler, but overall, there is little resemblance between the ideas of Lanz and later National Socialism. Goodrick-Clarke rejects other testimonies, according to which Hitler was influenced by Guido von List (although he may have read his works). A more promising line of evidence is that the Nazi party was originally established by the occultist Thule Society. However, the society seems to have been broader than the occultist milieu, and the Nazi party disavowed all occult connections when Hitler took it over. Indeed, Hitler even heckles the occultists in \\"Mein Kampf\\".However, Goodrick-Clarke does manage to find one connection between occultism and Nazism. Himmler actually believed in occultist lore, and was influenced by one Karl Maria Willigut, an \\"Irminist\\" neo-pagan whom Himmler promoted to a high-ranking position within the SS. The occult-inspired symbolism of the SS was apparently the work of Willigut. Goodrick-Clarke calls him \\"Himmler's magus\\". Wikipedia, less charitably, calls him Himmler's Rasputin!On balance, however, it must be concluded that Nazi evil was human, all too human.\\"The occult roots of Nazism\\" is a very well written book, and a relatively easy read, despite the obscure subject. It's already something of a classic, and deserves all its five stars."},{"Title":"The Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology","review":"I am not going to summarize the extensive range of historical data presented in this delightful book because the reviewers below me have already done a fine job of it. I would like to state though that the subject of Nazi occultism has interested me for some time, yet I have often been disappointed at the quality of most of the other books on this subject. This is due primarily to the fact that most of the writers of these other books seem to be almost as insane as the volkish mystics they are writing about. I am happy to say that Goodrick-Clarke is not one of these writers. On the contrary, he presents a well-researched and rational analysis of a bizarre and malignant ideology which unfortunately causes many other people to venture into the realm of the sensationalistic and downright ridiculous when attempting to grapple with it.

A worthwhile addition to the reference library. Answered many of my questions"},{"Title":"The Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology","review":"The book points out that Hitler was basically a lunatic (no surprise there) who had an interest in the occult. Himmler was more educated in the occult, but--alas--he was nuts, too. Unfortunately, during that time period before Hitler's rise, there were a lot of misguided occult writings floating around, especially in Germany and Austria. Weak minds are easily influenced, and Hitler took the bait. I always wondered what part the occult played in Hitler's thoughts and actions, partly due to my own theosophist interests, and now I know he was just a racist egomaniac who cherry-picked his occult writings with the help of Himmler and ultimately created a very corrupt and destructive way of thinking. I find it interesting that the Devil does the same thing: he uses half-truths to make the real truth even harder to decipher and uses that power to sway the masses.(I also find it interesting that Hitler supposedly never liked nor read Nietzsche, another pre-21st Century racist/sexist slap jaw. Why can't these freaks get along?)In the end this book makes you realize the power of occult ideas. Plato warned against putting powerful ideas into the hands of those who lack the discipline to use it properly, and Hitler was/still is a prime example.Interestingly, and this is outside the book, Franklin Roosevelt also had an interest in the occult. In fact, many political leaders today have deep interests in the occult. (Ever heard of Bohemian Grove?) The scary part is this: what kind of occult are they following? With such a huge push towards a toxic way of life (24+ vaccines for our children before the age of twelve, fluoride in our water, etc), I have to wonder if Hitler's evil is still around--just more covert. The Devil has gone underground (pun intended).Should the economy tank, the time will be ripe for another Hitler. After all, Hitler was elected through a democratic form of government, and history has a nasty way of repeating itself.Speaking of history, I find it very interesting how history has brushed Hitler's connection to the occult under the rug. With the exception of The Lost Ark (giggles) I can't find a lot of widely publicized sources that make this connection clear. Personally, I attribute this to the societies that actually run things in this world ... societies that have a vested interest in making sure the public doesn't condemn or burn at the stake these occult teachings. As a theosophist myself, I understand the angst, but it disturbs me that so many black arts work in secret and in powerful positions in this world. I really had no idea until I read this book.I would also like to mention that I feel the author of this book didn't particularly like theosophist teachings. I find that a bit irritating because I actually respect the teachings--when they're interpreted correctly. For the record, Madam Blavatsky (interesting that my spell checker caught that name) was not a racist nor a lunatic. The author of this book speaks of Theosophy with a sharp tongue, and I found the negative slant a bit vexing. Okay, so Hitler and Himmler took the teachings, then used and abused them, but let's not take it a step further and suggest that the theosophist teachings as a whole are somehow inherently racist and evil, which is outright untrue--if you know how to follow them."},{"Title":"His: 30 Erotic Tales Written Just for Him","review":"This collection of 30 stories is written directly to a male reader and is filled with the sort of fantasies that would delight any guy.

Lots of other fun stories, all with a light, playful and sexy tone."},{"Title":"His: 30 Erotic Tales Written Just for Him","review":"I know this book is aimed at men, but I liked it enough to buy my own copy. First, I read \\"Hers,\\" which is filled with stories for the ladies. Both books are written to the \\"you\\" of the reader, which seems to have confused some of the other reviewers. They stories are amazingly sexy and cover many different fetishes and genres. My favorite stories were \\"Every Friday Night\\" -- an outdoor threesome between two girls and a guy, \\"Two Dirty To Clean\\" -- which is a cheating story, \\"Paddle Brush\\" -- a spanking story (obviously!) and \\"All Access\\" about back stage at a rock concert. It's very easy to get inside the stories and to put yourself in the character's shoes."},{"Title":"His: 30 Erotic Tales Written Just for Him","review":"Shoddy fiction, stories written in first person, present tense, none the least bit erotic. Written just for him, primarily by her, from you know who's viewpoint. No variation in tone, each story reads like the one you just finished, assuming you forced yourself to read more than two paragraphs. Few writers successfully pull of writing a book of erotic stories, certainly not the ones who attempted His. A male reader's time would be better spent reading, or re-reading, the classics of the genre -- The Pearl, My Secret Life, A Man with a Maid, My Life and Loves (Frank Harris). And anything by Anais Nin (Delta of Venus, Little Birds). Opus Pistorum (aka Under the Roofs of Paris) by Henry Miller is about as hot, and off track, as male fiction gets. His -- 30 Erotic Stories -- is as short on imagination as heat. Look elsewhere if you're into erotica, or think you might be."},{"Title":"His: 30 Erotic Tales Written Just for Him","review":"Length:: 0:51 MinsNo one gets in my way when I'm reading erotica... NO ONE! As par for an Alison Tyler edited work, there are too many lusty stories in 'His' to pick my Top 5. They are all very good and aberrantly sexual. While this is an extremely erotic collection of stories, the last story alone is worth the price of this book! Matter of fact I'm going to read it again once I finish this review... bye."},{"Title":"His: 30 Erotic Tales Written Just for Him","review":"This is not only an outstanding collection of erotic stories, but also one that employs an unusual strategy--to wonderful effect. As other reviewers have noted, the stories in His (and, I believe, the companion book Hers) are all told from a hybrid first/second-person point of view. That is, each tale here is related by a female \\"I\\" narrator, while also involving the male \\"you\\" character. This is not an easy technique to use; but Tyler and Roche handle it masterfully. The reader's identification with the \\"you\\" is offered, not forced--in fact, I chose to read some stories while vividly imagining myself in the shoes of the \\"you,\\" and others more as a fly on the wall. The point of view is applied so subtly, organically, and seamlessly that I often found, in the course of reading, that I was barely aware of it--and yet it was doing its job all the time, adding a special layer of intimacy to each story.These stories also show marvelous variety--in subject matter, characters, and tone. And it's not as simple as two writers writing in two styles. Both authors are as versatile as they are gifted, and the result is a range of voices that often defy the dedicated fan's ability to tell who wrote what. And this just makes one realize that it doesn't matter who wrote what: what matters is how beautifully all the stories work together.Some of my favorites were \\"Machine Wash Hot\\" (full of lovingly described, visceral details of an imaginative fetish); the luscious three-way experience of \\"All Access\\"; the frisky, cuddly \\"Playing Possum\\"; and the exhibitionistically ecstatic \\"Beethoven's Exiles.\\" And the collection concludes with an extended confession called \\"While She Was Dancing,\\" in which one of the most vivid and compelling voices I've ever encountered leads the reader through an outrageous page-turner of an erotic adventure, moment by riveting moment."},{"Title":"His: 30 Erotic Tales Written Just for Him","review":"bought this as a gift and he wasn't very impressed with the stories."},{"Title":"His: 30 Erotic Tales Written Just for Him","review":"Guys typically don't like to read erotic books.

Radclyffe Hall was attractive, wealthy, adventurous and talented, and Sally Cline faithfully shows her successes, as well as her weaknesses, and manages to bring together a sense of what this literary upper class world was like.This book traces Radclyffe Hall's life as she grew from party girl into a prolific author, later writing her magnum opus, \\"The Well of Loneliness\\" and shows the inevitable obscenity trials that followed. Radclyffe was a tremendously successful author at the time of the books publication, and though she knew this book would destroy her career, she was driven to write the novel that would open the eyes of middle class heterosexual readers to the realites and difficulties of lesbian life. The book was ordered destroyed in England and the ban has never been lifted.Sally Cline does a great job of portraying the bohemian literary and art world at the turn of the 20th century Europe this time when England was just shaking the strictures of the Victorian era, women were coming into their own and demanding representation in government, and the role of women were changing in the home and in society, while the shadow of war and economic uncertainty loomed.

Lustbader excels himslef with this, the sixth of the Nicholas Linnear novels. I have followed his work since the release of &quot;The Ninja&quot; and haven't been able to put his books down.Second Skin takes Nicholas on a journey which will almost see him lose his entire corporate empire, to almost losing his re-found childhood love, to discovering the other secrets within him as a result of him being Tanjian. In typical Lustbader fashion, the story switches from the past to the present providing the necessary historical content that brings him to the point in his life that we read about as we progress through the book.The great thing about Second Skin also is that it fills in many of the gaps that were left in &quot;Kaisho&quot; and &quot;The Floating City&quot;If you enjoyed those two, you will be embraced by Second Skin.My most sincere congratulations to Mr Lustbader on magnificent book. I have alreasy read it 3 times. I only hope and pray there is a seventh Linnear novel."},{"Title":"Second Skin","review":"This is the sixth and final installment of Lustbader's saga of Nick Linnear. On the plus side it does clear up all the loose ends that were left hanging in the previous five volumes. However the main problem is the final battle scene. After five books, each over 500 pages long, the final battle between Nick and his ultimate antagonist only last a page and a half! I felt that Lustbader was working his way up to a real no holds barred fight but just sort of sizzled in the end. An overall great series and overall a good ending if you discount the brevity of the final fight."},{"Title":"Second Skin","review":"SECOND SKIN is simply thrilling. I raced through the last 200 pages, almost breathless. Lustbader keeps four or five very suspenseful storylines afloat with the frenzied deft of a juggler; my favorite being the mother's attempts to save her teenaged daughter, a plucky heroine in her own right when it comes to playing gangsters off one another. SECOND SKIN is easily the best of the trilogy started in THE KAISHO and continued in FLOATING CITY. I read the three as one long book and found myself endlessly fascinated with the interlocking character relationships and their attendant complications. Lustbader is a pro, with Linnear and Croaker being his best literary creations."},{"Title":"Second Skin","review":"This fourth in the Nicholas Linnear series is excellant.

He's desperate to impress us by showing he's read some Nietzsche, and can spell both his and Goethe's names (probably better than I can), but someone needs to remind him that the central message of Buddhism is not \`every man for himself'. He does, for example, just get deconstruction wrong, and tries to portray a nun as a seriously devout believer who has no concept of an afterlife. He tries to give his standard action novel (with formula use of seedy sexual background, plus some eastern mysticism thrown in) the pretence of profundity: difficult when, poor soul, he can't actually conceive of anything more impressive than having a lot of money and being able to punch out, spiritually or physically, any comers. Think of Simon the sorcerer trying to buy a slice of the Holy Spirit. Even his \`enlightened' characters are as driven by materialism as the bad guys, they just aren't (quite) so arbitrarily bloodthirsty. Oh, and they do stupid things, despite purported intelligence.If, however, you can ignore the deep contradictions, just enjoy the vibe of the trash spirituality/philosophy and take the ride of standard thriller characters and violence, sure, Lustbader will take you along."},{"Title":"Second Skin","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read"},{"Title":"Second Skin","review":"Absolutely one of the WORST Books I've ever had the displeasure of reading.

Remember he was a spy and while he does much to reveal the inadequacies of the German military machine and extol that of the British, he was a man used to lying and deceiving. His view of 'truth' might just differ from yours and his whole account is best viewed sceptically. There is a lot that does not ring true. The coincidence of him being invited to the very party where the very man assigned to hunt for him is present. It makes good, exciting reading. Is it true? How could a man who was German pass himself off to establishment Englishmen as their fellow countryman and it not be noticed? His accent and use of English must have been exceptionally good. Americans could be fooled but the English? Highly unlikely. I think there is some truth in the book but he has, for artistic reasons done substantial embellishing. I agree with the other reviewer, it would make a great film or short TV series. Lots of uglier sides to life shown, high drama and comedy thrown in. We should seach for an historical perspective though to get a more rounded out picture of the man and what he really did. I would really recommend the book-I read it in a day and a half and was so sad when it finished. A very satisfying read, leaving you wanting more of the same."},{"Title":"The dark invader;: Wartime reminiscences of a German naval intelligence officer","review":"This is a real gem of a book. It was recommended to me by a friend and the very next day I found a 1938 Penguin Edition staring out at me in the second-hand book store. For the 50cents it cost me, it was one of the best reads in my life.Von Rintelen was a German Naval Officer in WWI and was one of those cobbled together in desperate times to work on espionage eassignments all over the world. Speaking either North American or British English, he could disguise himself effortlessly as a businessman interested in buying armaments for the western allies in New York. While America was still neutral Von Rintelen planted bombs on transports and munitions ships, disseminated false imformation, and even organised his own labour union (inviting US congressmen to speak at some of its conventions) all usually with the help of disgruntled Irish Americans wanting to help cripple the English war effort. All the while he established a string of false companies to buy and trade in NY.The vignettes are incredible and worthy of a hollywood thriller. He ends up at a hotel party in Massachussets and finds out that the British Naval Attache assigned to look for him is attending the same party that night. Von Rintelen, decides right away to join the party and introduces himself to the British Attache as .... of all people... a British Naval Commander sent from London on special assignment to apprehend this Von Rintelen chap! (Really himself). Of course without instantaneous email or transfer of pictures over the wire, the British Attache has no idea that he is indeed talking with Von Rintelen (hillarious!), while Von Rentilin, over drinks, proceeds to draw out all the information British Naval Intelligence know on hilself.He was eventually arrested in the Channel while on a Dutch Liner heading back to the country disguised as a Swiss National.This is WWI and the ruthlessness of later wars is not present. His opponents are mainly honourable &quot;genetlman&quot; where he enjoys the commraderie of other English Officers whilst in confinement in England. His first glimpse of &quot;democracy&quot; happens when he is shipped back to the US as common spy (despite the fact that this may have been technically illegal under international law --- even at the time) and incarcerated in Atlanta until 1921. That he only got 4 years for espionage and sabotage is a interesting indication how far the US has come: in 1917, during wartime,they gave German Spies guilty of espionage &amp; sabotage 4 years in jail. In 2002 the US is executing teenagers and the mentally handicaped for capital crimes -- progress?His descriptions of Southern Jails is also interesting and his empathy with the criminals is an interesting refrain for this German gentleman.A highly interesting and fast paced book that should be made into a movie."},{"Title":"The dark invader;: Wartime reminiscences of a German naval intelligence officer","review":"Interesting story of Europe dragging America into war.

I bought it on the strength of Peacock'sShoes: The Complete Sourcebook, and the fact that Thames & Hudson was the publisher (another reputation bites the dust). One problem that both books share is that the title doesn't really convey the scope. I realize that it is hard to define vague areas, but this is more or less Western European and American fashion, it is only about women's clothing, not even the 2003 reprint covers the entire 20th century (it's 1900-1990), and \\"complete sourcebook\\" is a bit of an exaggeration. Christian Lacroix claims in the Preface that the fashions of the 1990s are too diverse to be covered. How \\"fashion\\" is defined is one of the chief problems with the book.The basic plan is a good one: fashions for various occasions along with their associated underwear and accessories. The book is broken up into sections covering 5 years (e.g.,1900-1904) Each section has a page each of haute couture, accessories (usually shoes, purses, hats, wraps, and oddly enough, tops such as blouses and sweaters), leisure wear, underwear, evening wear, bridal fashions and two pages of day wear. Coats, jewelry, wigs, gloves, etc., are covered only sporadically. All are illustrated in color by 1100 drawings of a number of garments with dates; only the haute couture are attributed to specific designers. Apparently in order to save pages, the keys to the illustrations, with detailed information about the items, are grouped together in 10 year increments. I find this a bit annoying, but I understand the motive. This is followed by a very useful section with silhouettes for the beginning and ending of each five year period, with description of typical details: e.g. fabrics, trimmings, necklines. This is followed by brief vitas of designers and a bibliography.There are some oddities in this admirable plan. I was born in 1953, so I remember several decades. Slips start vanishing from the illustrations in the 1960s, even though Peacock still shows plenty of dresses, and are pretty much absent in the 1980s. I suspect more women wore slips later: dresses and skirts were actually more popular than a decade earlier. Contrary to the impression conveyed in the drawings, women did not stop carrying purses in 1970-1974 and 1985-1990.Worse, Peacock has ignored some of the major trends in 20th century clothing: blue jeans and denim; the decline of hats; and the rise of the woman's business suit. Even given that a book of this size can't really be \\"complete\\" this is a major failing.The industrial revolution made clothing relatively cheap: even the poor could afford new clothing and affect designs. As Christian Lacroix says in the Preface: \\"... the more the century progresses, the greater the gulf between magazine images of fashion and what is actually being worn on the street.\\" Peacock seems to ignore this. Lacroix continues less accurately: \\"There is no risk of that with this book ... the every day is ... side by side with fashion's idealized images.\\"Peacock himself says: \\"As dictated by the couturier, fashionable dress represents an ideal which few women attain but to which many aspire.\\" He states that this book is his impression of the \\"ideal\\". I question defining fashion as strictly determined by couturiers or designers. They are a phenomenon of only the last couple of centuries; fashion existed long before they did. Historically, fashionable clothing was available only to the fairly wealthy and was an indication of their status. Now more people can afford designer clothes, but choose not to wear them. Bell-bottom jeans were as much a fashion of the 1960s-1970s as mini-skirts. Further, jeans were later created by some of the fashion designers that Peacock lists.There are only hints that hats were pretty much abandoned except for cold weather and, in some cases, religious venues. Someone once described this as the greatest revolution in Western costume! When I was young, most women would never have gone to church or anything other than the most casual event without gloves and a hat. If they didn't have a hat, many put a handkerchief on their head. Now it is very common for women to be bare-headed.Lastly, the business suit, particularly the knee-length versions that have probably been the most common, are virtually ignored.The variety of types of garments are a major strength of this book, and some people may want it for that reason. I think it is a very poor representation of how people, even those consciously following some fashion, actually dressed. I suspect that many people with a great interest in the fashion of these years have this information already, and it is questionable as a sole, basic source. Certainly I wouldn't suggest that a novelist, say, rely on this as a representation of clothing in the last half of the century at least. One wanting typical clothing would do better to consult Tom Tierney's American Family paperdoll series (American Family of the 1940s Paper Dolls, etc.)"},{"Title":"Twentieth-Century Fashion : The Complete Sourcebook","review":"Comprehensive, but brief enough so that one does not get lost in a tangle of illustrations and texts.

It consists of nine first person narratives, the first eight belonging to the inmates and the ninth, and last, being that of the nurse or &quot;House Mother&quot;. The innovative technique used by Johnson is to make each line in each section correspond to the same moment in time. Each section is prefaced with a list of the various infirmities and deficiencies suffered by that person (including a CQ count, used to assess senile dementia, which is the number of correct questions answered out of 10 such as who is the prime minister, what day is it etc), giving us an idea of how that individual's perceptions of events might be affected. Another typographical device used is that interior monologue is shown in roman type, speech in italics and absence of thought or speech by white space.The technical device used may sound contrived, but it works marvellously to create a vivid three-dimensional effect. Johnson gives us an insight into the geriatric mind with humour, compassion and empathy. The accounts are by turns, both funny and tragic. A couple of the inmates who are at the extremes of senility are portrayed with great feeling and the use of white space and other typographical techniques augments the writing wonderfully in these sections. The final section, that of the House Mother's, is the only disappointment of the book. Her ostensible &quot;normality&quot; forcing us to reassess the apparent &quot;abnormality&quot; of the inmates' perceptions. However, her revelations seem insignificant compared to the human suffering we have already experienced.Overall, this is one of those rare examples of a perfect fusion of form and content, and another wonderful piece of work from a great, but neglected writer."},{"Title":"House Mother Normal: A Geriatric Comedy (New Directions Paperbook)","review":"House Mother Normal tells the story of a night in an old people's home as told by eight of its residents - all with varying degrees of senility - and their perverted carer, the &quot;House Mother&quot; of the title. Each of the nine narratives is synchronised in time and within the text, so that a multi-layered panorama of the evening's events slowly emerges. Johnson was a working-class Londoner who was a disciple of Joyce and Beckett. His novels display a range of experimental devices and tricks and he was in many ways ahead of his time. His books are hard to get hold of, but Picador are about to re-issue &quot;The Unfortunates&quot; his famous &quot;book in a box&quot; (27 loose leaf pamphlets to be read in any order)and Jonathan Coe is writing a biography. He is well worth reading."},{"Title":"House Mother Normal: A Geriatric Comedy (New Directions Paperbook)","review":"This was such a strange novel. I like the way Johnson writes out the dialogue or musings of the individuals on one side of the page while writing the atmospheric conversations on the other. I say it was strange because of the ending....but I won't spoil it for you."},{"Title":"House Mother Normal: A Geriatric Comedy (New Directions Paperbook)","review":"Johnson's experimental novel focuses on an evening in a geriatric home, where a house mother tries to amuse eight patients of varying mental and physical capabilities. The novel is comprised of nine sections, one for each character. Each section has twenty-one pages - except for the last section, the House Mother's section, which has twenty-two. Each section includes a short case sheet before the narrative, ostensibly as an introduction to the mental and physical state of each character. They seem to function as a rationale for the narratives following them. The narratives themselves are written in stream-of-consciousness style, following the characters' thoughts and spoken words as they occur.You'll notice as you read that the events are static throughout each narrative: what happens on page seven of one narrative occurs on every page seven. Your understanding of the evening's events evolves slowly, one piece at a time, as you read each section. Also, the narratives start with the most lucid and able character (Sarah Lamson) and work their way through increasing levels of dysfunctionality and abnormality, culminating in the House Mother's narrative.It is a very involved way of reading, of course, and one cannot help but feel sympathy for the characters as they see the world through each individual set of eyes, minds, and impairments. The House Mother's narrative is, again, an exception. Delving into her mind is absolutely repulsive. This technique would work, except for page twenty-two: Johnson speaks through the House Mother, reminding us that she is a construct and that, as the author, he has full control over the novel. It's an interesting move, but at the same time, it invalidates the universe of the novel by removing our suspension of disbelief. For many readers, this move renders the entire novel meaningless.Also, the stream-of-consciousness style detracts from character development. The main concern of the narratives was memories of the past and reactions to the present, so there is little room for meaningful characterization. I still developed sympathy for the characters, but it felt contrived, especially since we as readers are forced, by the last page, to become aware of the fact that Johnson is using techniques.With techniques aside, the contrast between the cold, scientific distance of the case sheets and the human warmth behind the first eight narratives, and the contrast between the patients' sympathetic narratives and the house mother's disturbing narrative, reveal a criticism of how ineffectively society deals with deterioration of the body and soul. During Victorianism, people with mental illnesses and venereal diseases were sent to asylums, where they were sequestered from the general population that had no understanding of their conditions. Now that science has evolved and has a complex vocabulary for nearly every condition known to man, society has adopted those terms. However, these technical terms are more comforting than enlightening: we have some control over ourselves, their existence assures us, we have found some semblance of order in the vast universe. And yet, we are still insulated from the horrible reality of illness because we give power to these meaningless words (many of which, in the case of the novel, are high-flown technical terms for well-known conditions). This labeling and empirical \\"knowledge\\" neglects that there is humanity behind these conditions, and that there are very real people suffering in ways that the healthy cannot understand. Scientific language has become the modern-day insane asylum. Johnson illustrates that point well, even though the novel suffers from a couple poorly devised techniques."},{"Title":"Playboy Adult Magazine:June 1990","review":"Playboy Adult Magazine: January 1996 is 202 pages long.

From theovergrown, dimly-lit sun room where she holds court, she gives Marlowehis latest p.i. assignment. He's to find a rare coin, the BrasherDoubloon, that was stolen from her possession. He's also to find herdaughter-in-law, a former nightclub singer named Linda Conquest, whodisappeared at the same time as the coin. &quot;A charming girl--andtough as an oak board,&quot; Mrs. Murdock tells him, through sips ofher port.Marlowe's search for the pair leads to a tale more denseand tangled than the thick foliage of his client's sun porch. Hequickly finds himself enmeshed with a rich gambler and hisphilandering, showgirl wife; a thug with a frozen eye; and a morticianwho delves into politics. Marlowe also has to contend with the policeand a man in a sand-colored coup&eacute; who keeps tailing him. Then thereare the corpses that keep piling up in his path. There's also hisclient, who has her own share of tightly-bound secrets. Anear-invalid who spends her days lying on a reed chaise lounge,Mrs. Murdock still holds an iron grip on her effeminate son and thefragile woman who works as her secretary.The plot is fast-pacedand engrossing, but the real power of the novel lies in the snappydialogue and beautifully conveyed atmosphere. Chandler's style hasbeen copied endlessly by other writers over the past fifty years, butno one can touch him. Marlowe's is a world filled with hard-eyedFilipinos answering doors, nightclubs named the Tigertail Bar, andwomen who are &quot;all cigarettes and arched eyebrows and go-to-hellexpressions.&quot; Even his butterflies take off heavily and staggeraway &quot;through the motionless hot scented air.&quot;As withthe other Marlowe novels, there's the usual gratuitous wisecracksexchanged with minor characters--the sourpuss maid; the streetwisechauffeur; the old, watery-eyed elevator operator who breathed hard,&quot;as if he was carrying the elevator on his back.&quot; Despite hiscynical words, Marlowe holds a special place in his heart for thelosers in the world. He sends cash to a pitiful handwriting expertand takes an inept detective under his wing. &quot;The shop-soiledGalahad,&quot; an associate calls him.For the rest of thecharacters, however, he has nothing but contempt. A tough man in atough world, Marlowe doesn't hide his true feelings under a bushel.He describes the gambler's wife: &quot;From thirty feet away shelooked like a lot of class. From ten feet away she looked likesomething made up to be seen from thirty feet away.&quot; Hisinstructions to the portly Mrs. Murdock: &quot;Tell her to jump in thelake...Tell her to jump in two lakes, if one won't hold her.&quot;Chandler's master stroke as a writer is hyperbole.

He's getting his life under control, he's right on top of the bad guys, and his honorable intentions save the day.In this outing, Chandler is hired by a rich woman to track down a missing coin. The woman assumes that a misbehaving family member has run off with it, but of course the story ends up far more complex than that and Marlowe wends his way through gritty LA streets in search of the truth.Marlowe's penchant for doing the right thing is even more in evidence here, as he works to help out characters that many times don't realize they need help. He does it not for fame or fortune, but because it's the right thing to do.Chandler's writing style shines with its usual brilliance, and he crafts his characters with an easy hand. He has brought Marlowe along from his initial hard-drinking despair into a detective who - buoyed with past successes - is now more comfortable with himself and taking better care of himself. The wit crackles, and the novel is as enjoyable and entertaining as anything Chandler has written."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"Chandler wrote his first four novels in rapid succession, then went to Hollywood for four years before writing the fifth Philip Marlowe novel, &quot;The Little Sister.&quot; These first four are &quot;original recipe&quot; Chandler -- the novels that defined high-brow hard-boiled.&quot;The High Window&quot; (the third) is the anomaly of the first batch because it is the only novel prior to &quot;The Little Sister&quot; that was written as a novel; &quot;The Big Sleep,&quot; &quot;Farewell My Lovely,&quot; and &quot;The Lady in the Lake&quot; were all built using three to four of Chandler's earlier pulp short stories. Chandler called this practice &quot;cannibalizing.&quot;Chandler actually put aside the third cannibalized novel, &quot;Lady in the Lake,&quot; to work on &quot;The High Window.&quot; It's plot is only slightly less convoluted than the other three early novels, and it is slightly contrived, but what is interesting is the way in which it deliberately re-emphasizes concerns developed in its predecessor, &quot;Farewell, My Lovely.&quot; Chandler was pressed to make sense of a detective with so much cultural capital and the ability to turn such a fantastic phrase, and in these two novels the emphasis is on developing Marlowe's class animosities and his determination to preserve the free-agency afforded him by his vocation. He comes across as a relative high-brow determined to take out his sense of failure on those who pretend to be his betters, and who employ him, but who are phonies. It is a novel about class and about Marlowe working to control the exploitation inherent in hiring himself out.It may not be the best of the early four novels, but &quot;The High Window&quot; provides a clear and deliberate vision of Chandler's original conception of Marlowe. After the hiatus in Hollywood, he would begin to loosen the detective conventions and develop Marlowe as a man in existential crisis (in &quot;The Little Sister&quot; and &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;)."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"Raymond Chandler wrote 4 noir novels in the late 30s and early 40s that defined the Southern California hardboiled thriller forever after. I first discovered them 41 years ago and instantly fell in love with them. The High Window, though, I thought at the time, and through several subsequent rereadings, was by far the least of the four. I hadn't reread it in at least 20 years now, but, based on some of the favorable Amazon comments, I read it again yesterday. My opinion of it, I'm sorry to say, hasn't changed in 41 years....Why do I think it's only a mediocre book? Forty-one years ago I couldn't have articulated it. Now, however, it's obvious:Because, basically, it's a boring story.As an earlier reviewer in these columns told us, The High Window was the only one of the first 4 Chandler books that was plotted as an entirety and not cobbled together from earlier short stories that Chandler had written for the pulp magazines. This, however, instead of being a virtue, actually turns out to be the major fault in the book.Philip Marlowe, the first-person narrator and hero, is as beguiling as ever but the story he tells -- basically the search for a missing coin of great value -- is dull and listless. Each individual character is nicely sketched, as only Chandler could do at the height of his powers, and the writing sparkles and pops. But -- and this sounds strange but is absolutely true -- the story itself could equally well have been written by Agatha Christie with Hercule Poirot as the main character. An investigation is mounted; the detective moves from one character to the next; a couple of bodies are discovered; the detective exchanges banter with the police; he talks with a few more characters; he wraps up the case and tells us who murdered whom -- probably.There is no menace directed at Marlowe, there is no suspense, there is no interest in finding out what is going to happen to any of the other characters, there is no action at all (unless you can call finding a couple of bodies action), and the plot itself is pretty dull if you stop and think about it for a few moments.Why is this?The short stories that Chandler wrote in the 30s for the pulp magazines (mostly Black Mask, I believe) were just that: pulp stories. They had action, violence, movement. Things happened to Marlowe (in his various incarnations) and Marlowe made things happen to other people. Guns went off, Marlowe got bopped on the head, he -- and other people -- were frequently in danger for their lives.When Chandler cobbled these stories together into three of his first four novels, he brought all of these elements into the freshly created books. Guns fired, Marlowe was bashed on the head, locked up in padded cells, beaten up by crooked cops, menaced by *real* gangsters. There was danger and suspense -- even if you (and Chandler) didn't always know exactly what was happening or who was doing what to whom -- or why. Chandler's exquisite writing and marvelous evocation of Los Angeles of that time was laid over these pulpish elements and transformed these gothically plotted books into literature. But literature that was exciting and impossible to put down. What *is* going to happen next in The Lady in the Lake? And why? And how is Marlowe going to get out of *this* predicament? In these three books you really want to know.In High Window there are none of these elements and the only reason you turn the pages is because of the wizardry of Chandler's writing and the picture he draws of 1941 Los Angeles and Pasadena during a few hot summer days. Here the cops are more friendly than threatening, all violence is off-page, the semi-gangster nightclub owner and his supposedly deadly bodyguard are minor characters who manifest nothing more than a few lines of tough-guy dialogue -- which then disappears when Marlowe is hired by them to do a job....The transportation back to this vanished era of South California is well worth reading this book for (at least for me); but as a thriller up to the standards of the other early Chandlers it is simply a non-starter.Beware...."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"The High Window is a fast paced, intricately plotted story inhabited by an abundance of interesting and colorful characters.Once again, Raymond Chandler has succeeded in painting very vivid pictures of the various locales depicted with his unique brand of highly descriptive prose. A relatively short novel, The High Window is packed with page after page of interesting twists and turns, memorable characters and sharp dialogue.Hard-boiled detective Philip Marlowe is, as always, hard drinking, wise cracking and supremely self confident. A walking, breathing paradox, he adheres to a very high minded code of honor when it comes to protecting client confidentiality yet is not above tampering with evidence.What starts off as a rather mundane search for a missing rare coin quickly becomes much more complex. Murder, blackmail and the psychological abuse of a vulnerable young woman all play a role in the compelling plot. This novel should appeal to all fans of detective fiction as well as to those who appreciate good writing regardless of subject matter."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"After jumping into the mystery-genre spotlight at the age of 51 with his classic first novel THE BIG SLEEP, Raymond Chandler went on to write six other novels which received considerably less acclaim than they deserved. THE HIGH WINDOW, published in 1942, sees Philip Marlowe, perhaps the most hard-boiled of all classic hard-boiled detectives, searching for a stolen rare coin and once again involved in the sordid affairs of the Los Angeles underworld, dealing with wealthy widows, tall blondes, showgirls, cops, and hitmen, and handling each in turn with the panache that only Marlowe could. Exquisitely plotted and written, THE HIGH WINDOW, like the rest of the Chandler library, is noir and the hard-boiled detective novel at its finest."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"Raymond Chandler's \\"The High Window\\" is catchy; far more so than any similar novel penned by Mickey Spillane or James M. Cain. It has all the noirish elements needed to be a great read: a rare coin is the perfect MacGuffin; a sultry, adulterous blonde provides the jaded sexual appeal; an emotionally-abused young lady is the damsel in distress; a psychotic villain is flawlessly despicable and the labyrinthine plot is well-nigh impossible to predict until the very last page.The above having been said, this well-written novel is not without its faults. My three qualms lie with what essentially was the waste of a spectacular character (Eddie Prue), the retread of \\"The Big Sleep\\" formula and the lack of suspense.Addressing the first qualm, a subtle tension builds between the one-eyed Eddie Prue -- an emotionless bagman -- and wise-cracking Marlowe for the latter half of the novel. This mounting tension is left entirely unresolved and, thus, is dissatisfying.The second qualm is that the Mrs. Murdock character seems to be carbon copy of General Sternwood from \\"The Big Sleep.\\" They share far too many characteristics: a very wealthy recluse, physically disabled, world-wearily disillusioned, hampered by ailments, grim outlook, wayward offspring, etc. It seems that Chandler could have fleshed her character's uniqueness out just a tad more.Lastly, the lack of suspense throughout the novel may bore the casual reader. If it was not for Chandler's lively prose, I would have nodded off. The only time in which I was worried as to Marlowe's well-being was when he first hears Prue's voice in a very well-written piece.Despite these trivial flaws, it is a first rate novel and well-worth picking up."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"I decided to give this Raymond Chandler novel a shot after a vexing round of midterm examinations. If I didn't read something light and entertaining, my head would have exploded! I'd never read noir before, but I found this book to be pretty representative of what one pictures when one thinks of noir: seedy characters and snappy dialogue in a big, dark city teeming with danger. Chandler apparently gave new life to this genre when he wrote a few (an unfortunate few) crime novels starring Phillip Marlowe, a private detective who has since become immortalized in film and T.V. Chandler didn't even start writing these books until he was in his late 50's. Thank goodness he did write them, because this book is a real hoot!The High Window finds Marlowe on the trail of a missing coin called the Brasher doubloon. Within a few pages we begin to see an endless parade of seedy and suspicious characters, such as Mrs. Murdock, a port-drinking hothead who hires Marlowe to find the coin. Other characters include a scummy nightclub owner, a couple of dirty dames, and a cast of supporting characters both wicked and wise. At the center of it all is Marlowe, doggedly pursuing the truth through all the deceits and danger. I really can't go into the story because doing so would probably ruin the suspense for anyone who hasn't read the book. Just be prepared to see some wacky characters and great scenes.This book wouldn't be worth mentioning at all if it weren't for the dialogue. The language in this book is so clever and snappy that it literally makes the story. You'll howl out loud at some of the smart quips Marlowe tosses off as he tries to track down the doubloon. Another interesting aspect of the book is that everything occurs in the present tense. There is almost no history to know or anything in the future to worry about. This makes the story scream along at a fast pace; so fast that you won't want to put the book down. I never really thought I'd care for crime noir, but this book makes me want to read more! Recommended."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"To be honest, it seems kind of silly giving this book only four stars. If you compare it to the vast majority of hardboiled or detective novels ever written, it would deserve five stars. It is only when it is compared to Chandler's other books that it falls short. This was his third novel, published after THE BIG SLEEP (which started the vogue for starting books and movies with the words \\"The Big\\") and FAREWELL, MY LOVELY. In none of those books is plot and story as important as Chandler's exquisite prose, his wonderfully detailed descriptions, or his magnificently decadent characters. But even so the plots of those two look brilliant compared to this one.The number of problems with the plot of THE HIGH WINDOW is legion, but I'll highlight only two. Chandler wants Philip Marlowe to discover a body. There are a million ways to do this, but instead of something elegant and simple, Chandler creates incredibly unlikely scenarios whereby the future corpse gives Chandler a key to his apartment so that he won't be forced to wait around if he somehow doesn't happen to be there. This is such a cheap device that it is almost as if Chandler were trying to parody storytelling. Perhaps even sillier is a bizarre gun swap, in which the killer goes into a nearby apartment, finds a gun under the pillow of the tenant, and switches it with his own. Much of the subsequent story hinges on the strange gun swap.So, as an example of plot, THE HIGH WINDOW is a failure. Nonetheless, there is still the prose. Although Chandler is unquestionably one of the most imitated writers in literary history, no one has quite been able to match his power with words. Marlow enters a club. \\"A check girl in peach-bloom Chinese pajamas came over to take my hat and disapprove of my clothes. She had eyes like strange sins.\\" He prepares to question someone. \\"From thirty feet away she looked like a lot of class. From ten feet away she looked like something made up to be seen from thirty feet away.\\" He describes the residents of Bunker Hill: \\"Out of the apartment houses come women who should be young but have faces like stale beer; men with pulled-down hats and quick eyes that look the street over behind the cupped hand that shields the match flame . . . people who look like nothing in particular and know it.\\"And there are the characters. Though the best characters in THE HIGH WINDOW are not as memorable as the many, many memorable characters in THE BIG SLEEP or FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, there are still several so striking as to not easily slip out of mind.But substandard Chandler or not, he is one of those writers so brilliant and original that he deserves to be read in toto. One should read not this or that novel, but all of it, short stories included. He is one of the few writers to have played a major role in shaping our culture as a whole. But besides that, his books -- even the lesser ones -- are just a great, great read."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"Having read a lot of Raymond Chandler through the years and now, finally going back and re-reading everything with a more widened perspective on the genre, The High Window easily stands out as his finest work.The High Window, unlike a lot of genre Private Detective stories, which so many other authors have spent lifetimes struggling to copy and coming up short, keeps you guessing until the very end. Some authors give you a nibble about half way through a story and it falls apart in your lap and you figure it out. The High Window defies that solidly. You will be guessing about this one until the very end. Nothing is done ham-handedly or over-quick just to wrap it up either. This book could serve as a role model to other authors about how to write an ending, as I'm sure it has -- even if you don't write Detective Noir fiction.If you're reading this review and a certain Humphrey Bogart film brought you here, and you don't know much about Raymond Chandler, just know that he was and is considered one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century. During his lifetime however he was dismissed as just a regular struggling hack novelist, because of the Genre, and not given a lot of attention. A lot of other authors, like Philip K. Dick for instance, another Angelino, suffered greatly under this prejudice during their lifetime because of supposed conventionalities. Sometimes, looking back you just have to wonder if it really was a West Coast prejudice, where anything outside of the New York circle of authors was thought worthless, or the critics just didn't have enough insight into life. Probably both.The High Window moves very quickly, very smoothly, never misses a beat or falls flat for a single page. Chandler did drink a lot and it sometimes shows in his other novels, but with this effort you can see a lot of genius, planning and careful, methodic work ... just like the protagonist Philip Marlowe working a case.The dialogue is as witty as Farewell, My Lovely and the wisecracks are even sharper than The Big Sleep. This book is also absent of the one problem that I have Chandler and that is his disconnection of information from novel to novel. Some of his stories never mention a single word about anyone or anything from his other books, however, in The High Window, I underlined five direct references to his other works. These are nice touches and just things I like, because it's like going to a friends house and being able to recognize the furniture. The Little Sister does a better job with bringing out a familiar cadre of Policemen, but this book is seriously where it's at.The main thought regarding the story though is all about protection of the client and their anonymity. Marlowe knows that if he has to turn over and talk, he's pretty much out of a job. This is a story about just that and Marlowe goes to great lengths to protect that trust and Chandler does a deft job in making it a subtle undercurrent throughout the book, giving The High Window a sort of 'Moralist' back-drop. While he takes on only one paid client, it feels as if he makes an exercise in proving that his word is his bond with just about everyone he meets.Personally, this is easily my favorite Chandler novel to date.There's a few youtube links in the comments regarding some documentary footage concerning Chandler as well a Chandler interview with James Bond author Ian Fleming, where Chandler states that he believes himself to be one of the greatest living American writers -- and Fleming agrees. Fantastic stuff...."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"Phillip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler's classic noir hard-boiled private detective forever literarily associated with Los Angeles and its means streets is right at home here in his search for a missing family heirloom thought to have been 'taken' by an errrant family member. As always there are plots within plots and it is many a false lead and bump on the noggin' before the intrepid Marlowe puts this one to rest. As usual there is plenty of sparse but functional dialogue, physical action and a couple of plot twists, particularly around the motives of the parties involved. And where does this novel stand in relationship to the other Marlowe epics? Give me those background oil derricks churning out the wealth while looking for Rusty Regan in Big Sleep or the run down stucco flats in pursue of Moose's Velma in Farewell, My Lovely any day. Nevertheless, as always with Chandler, you get high literature in a plebian package. Read on."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"We're catching up on Chandler's private-eye Philip Marlowe novels published in the 1940's, having read \\"Poodle Springs\\" (his last work, actually finished by Robert Parker) and \\"The Big Sleep\\", his first and perhaps most well-known entry in the set, possibly due to the movie with Humphrey Bogart. The book is classic Chandler: beautifully descriptive prose almost wasted on the seedy characters that populate the storyline. The plot kicks off with a wealthy but crotchety old woman hiring Marlowe to recover a valuable gold coin she is sure was stolen by her now missing daughter-in-law. As Marlowe learns more about the matter, a young guy starts tailing him, then admits to being a fellow private dick who might need Marlowe's help with a case. Soon that guy turns up dead; in fact, throughout the tale Marlowe has a nasty habit of finding dead bodies, which only serves to exasperate the police, whom our leading man tends to frustrate by refusing to part with what he knows about whom.In the end, of course Marlowe figures it all out, but not before some surprises bend the plot this way and that. [We won't spoil what the novel's title implies...] One would not suspect this novel is some 60 years old; that it so readily entertains is certain testimony to its withstanding the aging process. Chandler's fine writing skills, bordering on literature, as usual tend to create a screenplay in our heads for us, which adds to the enjoyment.

It's author Raymond Chandler (1888-1959) is a poetic master of hardboiled noir crime fiction. His metaphoric and colorful language; fascinating characters and sparkling prose make Chandler an American original. His works leap the high wall between mystery fiction and true literary art.The High Window opens at a house in the Oak Noll Section of Pasadena. An obese, obtuse and cruel double widow with the name of Elizabeth Bright Murdock has called Marlowe to her home. The grotesque woman wants Marlowe to locate a rare coin known as the \\"Brasher Doubloon\\" which belonged to her late husband. The doubloon has been stolen. Murdock wants Marlowe to locate her former showbiz girl daughter-in-law Linda Conquest whom she suspects is guilty of the heist. Linda has been recently divorced from Lester Murdock the weak little Uriah Heepish cipher who is Mrs. Murdock's son. Marlowe also meets the intriguing Miss Merle Davis who is the virginal secretary of Mrs. Murdock. What lurks beneath the surface? Who stole the coin? What dirty secrets are being hid from the eyes of the police? Answers await as we join Marlowe on a dive into the inferno of sin which lies at the belly of the beast of Los Angeles.This is the opening scene in a novel filled with all the twists and turns we expect in a Chandler novel. Along the way there are three murders as wheel spins within wheel in the shady, cruel, cynical and convoluted morality of the characters inhabiting the Chandlerian universe.We remember Chandler for his skill in realistic dialogue and word paintings of Los Angeles and its 1940s environs. The plots are hard to follow and forgettable.

That, perhaps, is Chandler's greatest talent--he makes his world inviting while never pandering to prurient or common tastes. In A High Window, Philip Marlowe, Chandler's famous American icon of cynicism and subtle honor, is tasked with finding a rare coin and the person who stole it. His client is a bossy, asthmatic, hulk of a woman who downs glass after glass of port and who doesn't mind telling Marlowe her low opinion of his character and skills. Of course, she's wrong. And she's hiding all sorts of secrets of her own. As in all Philip Marlowe adventures, the ride is always more fun than the destination. When you read Raymond Chandler, you're lovingly dumped into a landscape filled with bums, dames, rich psychotics, corrupt cops, and sleazy hotel managers. And those are the ordinary people in his novels. Read A High Window. Get out your trenchcoat. Be sure to pack a .45. You're going to \\"noir\\" town.Donald Gallinger is the author ofThe Master Planets"},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"In this one, Marlowe seems to have gotten a lot smarter than he was in FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, a novel in which he was so drunk most of the time that you had to wonder how he managed to survive, let alone adequately \\"investigate\\" anything. But in THE HIGH WINDOW, Marlowe is on the ball. He takes a job for a wealthy, twice-widowed matron, to track down her missing daughter-in-law who, the matron believes, absconded with a precious gold coin from her deceased second husband's collection. The widow's son, abandoned husband of the missing woman, is in the dark and wants to know what gives. He chases Marlowe, as does another detective who is apparently on another, related case. Marlowe out-slicks these guys, along with a semi-tough actor-turned-gangster and his menacing bodyguard, managing to figure out what it's all about, with the murders piling up and the cops breathing down his neck. He even uncovers a murder he wasn't supposed to and proves his good-heartedness in the process by straightening out a very unhealthy family situation. Although he continues to down his liquor as he pushes through the mires of this case, it feels more like social drinking this time, rather than the obsessively self-destructive bingeing seen in the earlier novel. In fact, though Marlowe's employer may be dissatisfied with the result of the investigation she has initiated in a moment of pique, we are not, for he solves the crime he was called in for and sets things that have been very much askew to rights in a most un-Marlowe like manner, leaving matters better than he found them, despite three murders and a darkly tangled familial history. -- SWM"},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe detective stories, while never dull, can sometimes have almost hysterical, over-the-top plots which become terribly confusing to decipher. Fortunately the cracking dialogue and bizarre characters compensate nicely. In The High Window the author takes a breather, and delivers a story which is relatively simple ... and enjoyable to read.Like in many Marlowe stories, our naughty private eye is hired by a rich recluse. This time the recluse is a rich widow who believes her trashy daughter-in-law has stolen a rare coin inherited from her deceased hubby. As Marlowe investigates we understand that the daughter-in-law keeps some rather nasty company, and before long Marlowe is tangled in multiple homicide situation. Of course in the end it is all resolved in a surprisingly uncontrived way (..at least by Raymond Chandler standards).My only real complaint, or rather disappointment, is the general absence of Marlowe's normally razor-sharp sarcasm. In other books Marlowe can be extremely brutish with the ladies, and the ladies all fall in love with him. In The High Window we do not see this side of Marlowe, and so he seems somewhat two-dimensional in this story.Bottom line: most definitely not a Chandler classic, but certainly a very enjoyable read. Recommended."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"Marlowe goes to Pasadena to meet a client about a job. First he has to get past the secretary. Miss Davis is a rather meek soul, who asks for his references, and once they check out, she takes him to see the client--Mrs. Elizabeth Murdock. Mrs. Murdock is a large, hard woman with an unpleasant attitude, one that isn't above haggling Marlowe about what his expenses consist of. The situation is this--something of value has been stolen from her, and she suspects the culprit to be her daughter-in-law, the item in question being a very rare and valuable coin known as a Brasher Doubloon.Mrs. Murdock didn't know the coin was missing until she received a suspicious phone call from a dealer named Morningstar making inquiries as to whether the coin was for sale. The thing is that any reputable dealer would know the coin isn't for sale, per the stipulations of the late Mr. Murdock's will. Then she checked and found out the coin was missing. She figures it was an inside job, as those are the only people who would have access to it. Mrs. Murdock wants the coin back, but she doesn't know where her son's wife went--plus she wants a divorce arranged. Marlowe agrees to take the case, and is handed back to the secretary to get his retainer--along with a little information, some voluntary, some not so. He learns that Linda Murdock, formerly Linda Conquest, once roomed with another girl named Lois Magic. And he learns that the secretary, Merle, has quite a thing, in her own quiet way, for Mrs. Murdock's son, which includes keeping his monogrammed handkerchief in a drawer, as well as a small caliber pistol.As Marlowe leaves the Murdock residence, he notices a sand-colored coupe that seems to be following him. But he could be wrong about that.Marlowe returns to his office, and while he's thinking about the case, he receives a visitor--Mr. Leslie Murdock, the son. He's trying to find out why Marlowe's been hired, but the PI is too cagey to divulge that bit of information. Murdock reveals more than he learns--namely, that he still loves his wife, and that he is into a guy named Morny for some big money, maybe twelve grand. Marlowe sends him on his way, and calls up Morningstar, making an appointment to see him at his office at 3 o'clock.He can't find Lois Magic in the phone book, so he uses a connection to learn what he can about Morny. Turns out he married Lois Magic. Small world indeed. He gets an address and heads over there, but the hired help say she isn't at home. Well, there's more than one way to do things, so Marlowe does it his way, and finds out from the chauffeur that Mrs. Morny is indeed at home, in the backyard, along with Mr. Vannier.Marlowe runs into the sand-colored coupe and its driver again, and confronts him. The guy breaks down and admits he's been following Marlowe. His name is Phillips and he's also a PI, working a case. Maybe they can work it together, since the cases seem to be related. He makes a time for Marlowe to come over to his place, and just for insurance, he gives him a key, in case he arrives first.Marlowe shows up, but it's too late for Phillips.And he's only the first stiff.Fake coins, missing wives, cheating wives, terrified secretaries, and a body count that just won't quit. All in the job description for Phillip Marlowe.The High Window is the third book in the Philip Marlowe series. I liked it as much as I did the others. Chandler has a way with words that is truly unique, and he paints a vivid picture of the times and the people, drawing memorable characters. I like that Marlowe has layers, and we see more and more of those layers as time goes on. In this story, he's a real gentleman. We already knew he was honest. The story has all the ingredients of a good mystery--dead bodies, people with secrets, lies, and mysteries. I look forward to reading the next book."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"THe Brasher Doubloon has been stolen, only Mrs. Murdock a wealthy window wants it found.

Marlowe works for a cantankerous old lady who hires him to find a stolen coin. Of course, it turns out to be much more complicated. Marlowe is tough but also a nice guy, and amazingly, he doesn't get 'coshed' over the head in this book!! (I was afraid it was getting to be a predictable pattern, haha...)I'm enjoying these Chandler mysteries because he weaves a plot complicated enough to keep me guessing. I usually don't catch on until the last 20 pages or so. I hate when I figure things out too quickly, and that hasn't happened with Chandler yet."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"Even with all the years long gone, Chandler is still the best. The High Window may not be high profile, but it's still top of the game. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"Having read The Big Sleep and Farewell, My Lovely, I dove eagerly into the next Raymond Chandler novel in queue. The High Window offers the standard Chandler fare of murder, blackmail and general malefaction, though its characters don't form quite as well. Philip Marlowe, the archetypical 40's investigator, is reliably entertaining, but Merle Davis, the flighty personal assistant of Marlowe's client, is so neurotic she defies description. Ultimately, she also defies the plot.It's important to point out that I appraise in relative terms. The author's previous novels were so entertaining that even the slightest Chandler misstep would resound. But, Merle Davis is a difficult proposition to get past and she eventually becomes the heart of the story.Still, it's an engrossing story and, while it might not hit the heights of previous efforts, it is classic Raymond Chandler: 40's-era LA, mystery and menace, and a cunning private eye. Because of this, it deserves to be read. 4 stars."},{"Title":"The High Window","review":"I love Raymond Chandler. And Marlowe, the joke cracking private eye who's tough on the outside and golden on the inside and who would be cliched except he's the original everyone else copied...it's vintage noir, hard-boiled action, the world without frills, a trail of murders and blackmail and robbery. It's flawed the way America's underbelly is flawed but it's always clear where Marlowe's sympathies lie...with the poor, the lost, the wicked, the desperate doing all they can to get out of poverty's trap. But he takes everyone as he finds them and gives them their due. It's a fast-paced quick read with suspenseful twists and turns that spin you through an L.A. that is still recognizable, and definitely the L.A. that I love."},{"Title":"Vintage Modern Classics","review":"I have a little bit of a problem with the words 'Modern Classics' usually, but in this case it is appropriate. All five titles are worthy of the prefix.Midwives is undoubtedly one of the finest pieces of fiction in modern years. Bohjalian mixes suspense with drama to create a masterpiece. Its starts out with a tragic death during labour, which may or may not have been the midwife's fault. As you follow the story through the midwife's daughter's eyes, you discover the truth in what is an interesting finale.A wonder of translation, The Reader is a fascinating novel of morality and social injustices in postwar Germany, It focuses on the Holocaust through the eyes of 15 year old Micheal, whose older lover Hanna, as it turns out is guilty of unspeakable crimes. Emotional and stirring, The Reader is a must have.Snow Falling On Cedars is a brilliant mystery set in San Piedro. A Japanese American man is on trial for the murder of a white man. Still reeling from racial distrust, the town is baying for blood, but one man must recover from his own distrust and jilted feelings rooted in his past to discover the truth. Beautifully written and vividly imagined, Snow Falling On Cedars is one of my favourite novels.Believe the hype, Memoirs Of A Geisha is here to stay. This novel is incredibly popular and rightly so. It uncovers Japan's hidden Geisha trade and stuns us all with its revelations. Through the eyes of Japan's 'most famous Geisha' as we are led to believe, we see it all from the youth up, the training, the social manuevering, the infighting as our very own Geisha struggles with her own morality in her search for happiness.Cold Mountain is in truth a beautiful love story. Winner of the US national book Award this book is strong, maybe not so as the rest, but entertaining and beautiful in its own right.And finally, A Lesson Before Dying. Always controversial, this story focuses on a man set for execution. Jefferson is the black man on death row, and as he faces social and racial tensions, his grandmother wishes that someone might teach him to die like a man, and that is where our narrator steps in. Beautiful and poignant, Not to be missed.So there we have it. Beautiful writing didn't die with Austen, the Brontes and Dickens. 20th century authors may just have what it takes to be classics hundreds of years from now.

I too would love to see a sequel of some sorts from Mr. Bova...!"},{"Title":"The Exiles Trilogy (Star Flight Saga)","review":"Someone recommended Bova's EXILES trilogy to me and at first, when I read the description, I wasn't too sold on the idea but I went ahead and decided to take in this adventure.The three books that make up this trilogy are as different as different can be. EXILED FROM EARTH, the first in the series, was my least favorite. In fact, after reading it, I wasn't sure I wanted to read the rest of the series. It basically focuses on the world government forcing many scientists off Earth and onto a satellite that orbits Earth. It ends with the exiled crew voting to turn their satellite/prison into a spaceship that will carry them to another planet so that they can live in freedom once again. There's a lot of pulp-style action in it but a lot of it just wasn't very compelling and didn't make sense, ie, Lou escapes capture only to immediately return to work and grow suspicious that the place is deserted and then acts surprised when they come to capture him again. Unfortunately, if you're going to read any of this series, the first book is necessary to set up the real stories to come later on. I don't think the first book would make a good movie at all. On the bright side, it's a short, quick read.However, book two is where things really get cooking. FLIGHT OF EXILES is somewhat of a murder mystery/political drama played out in space. The situation was much more compelling, as were the characters. This would make an excellent Sci-Fi channel movie-of-the-week.My favorite book in the series was definitely book three - END OF EXILE. Talk about coming out of left field! It focuses on Linc, a kid amongst many other kids on the now century old, falling apart spaceship. There is almost no explanation given as to what happened to the adults in the prior book. Bova does a great job of leaving stuff up to the reader's imagination and I'm glad about that because I didn't necessarily want him to break away from the story he's telling here to take a time out and fill in the blanks. The story plays out almost like a LORD OF THE FLIES in space. There are a lot of themes about religion and faith - Linc ascending \\"up\\" the ship to consult Jerlet (more or less, God in this story) and then coming back (\\"resurrected\\") to face the masses and lead them to salvation. This third book would make an excellent made-for-tv movie."},{"Title":"The Exiles Trilogy (Star Flight Saga)","review":"People like to divide Science fiction in many genres: hard sci-fi, soft sci-fi, alien sci-fi, whatever. I don't even know what each one means. All I care is if it's good sci-fi or not. \\"The exiles trilogy\\", though not a masterpiece, is one very enjoyable story.Ben Bova wrote the three parts of his trilogy between 1971 and 1975. The first part, \\"Exiled from Earth\\", set in the near future, tells about how the World government decides to cast away all the top-most genetic scientists and people working with them, least they un-balance the already precarious staquos quo of the overpopulated planet. This first part is the most action packed and has little science fiction in its lines, and is in fact the least likeable part of the trilogy. But what I noticed is that Bova's style is very similar to some of Asimov's stories, the ones featuring Lucky Starr, Elijah Bailey and Hari Seldon in the prequels to the \\"Foundation\\" series (books that I constantly re-read). Full of little plots that get together in the end, shallow but likeable characters, fast-paced reading.The second and third parts, \\"Flight of the exiles\\" and \\"End of exile\\" are set aboard the sattelite/spaceship that becomes home to the exiles. These two parts have little or no connection between themselves or the first part of the trilogy, except for the fact of the earlier exile. They're darker, better written and the main plots are much more interesting. I won't say anything because I don't want to spoil the fun of reading them.But my two comments on \\"The exiles trilogy\\" are: 1) Although the three parts were written in separate and were meant to be standalones, I think they must be read back-to-back. They'll be better enjoyed this way. 2) There are many things that happened between the three parts of the trilogy, but Bova hardly explains what happens. I was left with the feeling that I wanted something more, and I kept looking for it till the end, but those explanations never came. Maybe Bova could write new books about the Exiles. The story is very good and has potential for further development.Grade 8.1/10"},{"Title":"The Exiles Trilogy (Star Flight Saga)","review":"I read this book when I was about 16, and it was one of the works that really got me hooked on this genre.

This is the kind of book which is hard to put down even at 1:30 a.m. This is true sc-fi - i.o.w. this storyline could not be transferred to our present or past. I did not like the fact that there is no continuation of the characters from one part of the trilogy to the next. Most disappointing though is the fact that the story ends when the exiles set foot on their new home planet! But - as I said - I want to find out if Ben Bova continued this story or if he has plans to do so in the future. What happens next, Ben?

Lou Christopher contemptuously writes off the world's rejection of reason and indifference to the forced exile of its greatest minds. Caught in a power struggle over her destiny, Valery Loring emerges triumphant on the premise that human freedom lies in a basic choice: to think or not to think. His thinking undercut by superstition-still, Linc must know before he can decide to save himself and his peers from disaster.AN OPEN LETTER TO BEN BOVA:Dear Mr. Bova,I am writing to thank you for creating The Exiles Trilogy. I have read many of your novels, but regard The Exiles Trilogy as your greatest work. I first read it when I was thirteen, and recently bought a new copy. Today, at twenty-seven, I am just as moved by your heroic vision as I was fourteen years ago.Back then I could not explain my emotional response to what your heroes sought and why. But I have learned much in the last few years, and I am deeply indebted to you. The Exiles Trilogy dramatizes the importance of the human mind and the value of human beings. It confirms an intense conviction that, until a few years ago, I had only sensed: that my own life is important -- an end in itself to be nurtured and kept, not sacrificed to the ignorant of the world or to the whims of brutes.I do not presume to know your explicit philosophical beliefs. What is important is that your saga dramatizes, in terse plot structure and characterization, the rejection of the mind and its exile from human existence. Your heroes' struggles and ultimate triumphs suggest an impassioned plea, by you, for man to discover and embrace his own rational nature. Intellectual understanding is something I had continually sought as a teenager, but never found. I sensed only on an emotional level the life-preserving connection between thought and action, that action without thought leads nowhere, that to think or not is the fundamental choice and issue of human existence. Without a dramatic example like The Exiles Trilogy, my emotion would have remained precarious; your story bought me time to make explicit the important sense I had of myself and of life.Your heroes are tremendous; their actions and purposes are a joy to contemplate. Not only do they possess great physical prowess, they also recognize and deal with their conflicts at the deepest level. They share a common quest for intellectual understanding. Lou Christopher, a computer engineer resolved to continue his life's work in exile, grasps the government's aimless, brutish nature; the people's indifference to the scientists' plight; the world's ignorance of the mind. He persuades the exiled scientists to turn their orbiting gulag into a purposeful starship. Valery Loring, a computer programmer determined to control her own life, is caught in a futile power struggle which threatens to destroy the ship and all aboard. In her search for truth she embodies the locus of human freedom, the choice to think. Linc, an active-minded boy stifled by hostile, superstitious peers and by his own fears, senses danger to them all. Still, Linc must know before he can decide to save himself and his friends.It is not as if your heroes could decide, act, and triumph without knowing -- as if reason was desirable but optional. Your universe succinctly dramatizes the inescapable connection between individual thinking and human survival. This is what makes the heroes of The Exiles Trilogy so real and compelling.I was a structural engineer at NASA/JSC for seven years before I quit in order to become a professional philosopher and intellectual. My favorite philosopher and top hero is Ayn Rand; perhaps you have heard of her. I highly recommend her novels. For The Exiles Trilogy you are my hero and mentor, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.Respectfully yours,Neil Erian"},{"Title":"The Exiles Trilogy (Star Flight Saga)","review":"Monday, April 10, 2006\\"The Exiles Trilogy\\" by Ben Bova, 1971, 1972, 1975This has to be one of the most presceint science fiction stories. The first part is developing the scene, so to speak: the exiles are exiled. The rationale is good and still a little far fetched. I do not see any government, national or international, sending a bunch of people off into space because they know, or have learned, too much. The idea is that there has to be some push to get us, as a species into the interstellar world. This was this story's push.The second story I just of skimmed through. It was a predictable plot and the science in it did not seem to be of any great imagination. In the end, it was as I expected.The third story was better and more interesting. The flaws were in its miracle work: how do those machines stay working or where do the replacement parts come from? It must have been some great foresight to have all the labatory equipment for developing zygotes and nuturing them to childhood. Why are these children not active sexually (obviously, the author did not want to deal with the inherent social problems, within and outside the book, that would ensue, but I think that children naturally have a curiousity about their bodies and sex, so there should have been some development)?The growth and development of the characters was good, though, for purporting to be geniuses, they sure did not think things through very much. Some of the logic of what they were doing was just os much ordinary folks doing ordinary stuff, creating problems that required some adjustments. The sad part is that the children ended up on a virtual Eden, with all the hope that entails, but you know that problems will begin, and evil will enter the world. This will necissitate more growth and development, probably for the next million years or so. Lord be with us.I find that the more I read science fiction books the more I am aware of the probability of finding and colonizing a planet like Earth is about nil. Taken separately: Finding: Is there a possibility of there being a planet out there like Earth? I would think that there is almost no likelyhood of it being one of the first planets we explore. I can not imagine that with all the ranges of planetary development, that one like ours would be nearby. Colonizing: the growth and development of our species to be able to develop machines and conquer the distances between planets, much less stars, is one thing, to do so with our social structures, would require a bit of growth and change.

Mill's encyclical is a perfect example of the tendency of the Enlightenment to believe something to be reasonable if it is couched in the proper language.Mill walks a tenuous path between Locke &amp; Bentham, taking up a defense of liberty, but unwilling to risk his utilitarian street cred. Thus, we have beautiful assertions such as &quot;the unchallenged idea is that which is in most danger&quot;, along side a perverse and logically twisted injection of &quot;duty&quot; into what is otherwise a syllogistic approach.Mill insists on a Lockian sphere of rights approach, then qualifies it in the cases of children (up to whatever age the law defines them), as well as in those societies that aren't developed enough for liberty (by Mill's definition?). Liberty is also to be restricted in such cases as a man might &quot;sin by omission&quot; and &quot;fail to help his Brother.&quot; These wonderful sentiments are followed by more cognitive dissonance, various ad hominem attacks on Christianity (particularly those sinister Catholics), and a lot of hand-waving about polygamy.As an aside, I imagine that G.K. Chesteron had Mill in mind when he wrote &quot;The worst judge of all is the man now most ready with his judgements; the ill-educated Christian turning gradually into the ill-tempered agnostic, entangled in the end of a feud of which he never understood the beginning, blighted with a sort of hereditary boredom with he knows not what, and already weary of hearing what he has never heard&quot;Throughout the work, Mill's passions and prejudices skew his arguments. It is a fascinating display of intellectual agility, to watch him extolling freedom while restraining it; to see him preach tolerance, and even go so far as to tolerate intolerance. Note that this last feat reminds me of the Kobyashi Maru Strategy - win the unwinnable game by changing the rules. The typical cultural relativist will divide by zero when approached with the self-contradiction of the tolerant society. Mill side-steps the issue and goes along his merry way, proclaiming not a full page later that &quot;there is always hope when people are forced to listen to both sides.&quot; It's refreshing to hear a champion of responsible liberty who's ready to practice coercion.Ultimately, Mill produces a monumental work that speaks volumes about more than its subject. His observations are supremely valuable, even when they are irrational, but most of the time he manages to define a system in which the interests of the state and the interests of the individual are balanced to his particular tastes.As a final note, unlike the introduction for Clausewitz' On War (another Penguin Classic), the Introduction here has value. Gertrude Himmelfarb thoroughly ties together Mill, his physical and intellectual parents, Mill's wife, his society, and peers, and manages to wrap the whole thing up in 42 pages."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This Kindle book was clearly created from a text file and little, if any, editing or formatting was done for the Kindle.Paragraphs are fixed width, so unless you size your screen to the paragraphs, you will have lines breaking all over the place.

His liberty concerns thought, opinion, sentiment, taste, pursuit and combination (freedom to unite and to trade).The limit to his liberty is based on one very simple principle: the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others.He has also responsibilities: it is a moral crime to bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able, not only to provide food for its body, but instruction and training for its mind.SocietySociety has jurisdiction over any part of a person\`s conduct which affects prejudicially the interests of others.

This is probably now his most famous work, and it is very easy to see why; his argument is not only compelling philosophically but widely applicable and, at about 140 pages, easily read by nearly all.

Many of Mills' words have passed into common usage in the years since the book was published in 1859. To quote one famous example: \\"Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\\"Mill writes in a florid, orotund style that often defies the rapid reader. One frequently has to plod through an over-punctuated verbal and syntactic thicket twice or thrice in order to extract the meaning of a passage. In this respect, Mill was perhaps no worse than other philosophical writers of his day - or indeed of any day.However \\"On Liberty\\" is definitely worth persevering with; not only for its exposition of the subject, but also for some wonderful passages of writing. Mill has a gift for simple exposition of complex philosophical questions.Liberty is always under threat, even in countries perhaps best known for valuing and promoting individual liberty - at least in the rhetoric of political leaders, if not in their practice. That might sound incredible, but one has only to reflect on the encroachments on liberty occasioned by the \\"war on terror\\" and the general support of the majority for such encroachments. In this case both governments and governed conspire to deny others liberty; the former by diktat, demagoguery and secrecy and the latter by strident bigotry.But, if I might be permitted a facetious remark, perhaps those countries have taken Mill too much to heart where he asserts that \\"despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided that the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.\\"Such a patronising, indeed ignorant, view is repugnant to libertarians today, but it was a commonplace view among officials and churchmen in the high noon of the British Empire. But lest we feel too smug about the superiority of our own age, I will observe that we can see echoes of similar odious attitudes today in foreign policy, and the same will no doubt be true of future dominant powers yet to come onto the world stage.However, to be fair to Mill, his passing comment on \\"barbarians\\" is only one very minor part of this great book. More to the point, he asserts strongly in the book that views which are considered to be settled truth in one era may often be rejected in another. He goes on to say that conventional wisdom should always be rigorously tested and not merely assumed to be true on the authority of others.There are also large parts of the world where freedom of expression, and indeed freedom of thought, are suppressed. It is to be greatly hoped that \\"On Liberty\\" will one day be as influential there as it has been elsewhere. Mill himself states eloquently (but perhaps optimistically) that while the truth may be suppressed many times, it will ultimately prevail.After an introductory Chapter, Mill discusses liberty under four broad Chapters that I will touch on briefly below.In the Chapter on liberty of thought and expression, Mill has a swipe at the Christian faith. Some believers may be offended by this discussion, but why should they? The truth should be able to withstand the assaults of opposing views - indeed (as Mill says) it should welcome contrary views both as a means of strengthening the truth, and as a means of rooting out error.Moreover, Mill was writing in the middle of the 19th century, just before the publication of Darwin's theory of evolution, at a time when Christianity in England enjoyed many advantages and official protections. He quotes the example of a man who went to prison for writing an anti-Christian sentiment on a gate - an exemplary message to others who might be tempted to express their true thoughts.In the Chapter on individuality Mill maintains that liberty of thought and expression must necessarily lead to the desirability of people living as they choose, providing that they do not infringe the liberty or well-being of others. However, the arguments in this chapter are less well-presented than in the former chapter. Mill also makes an assertion that most people would reject today: \\"No government by a democracy.....ever did, or could, rise above mediocrity.\\" However it is important to remember that Mill wrote shortly after the extension of the voting franchise in Great Britain, when fears about democratic government were widely discussed, since experience of democratic government in modern industrial societies was quite limited at that time.In the Chapter on the limits to the authority of society over the individual, Mill makes the point that while the individual is sovereign over himself, the society in which he lives and from which he derives protection and other benefits also has rights over the individual. The individual is not accountable to society for his actions if they affect him alone; but as soon as one person's conduct adversely affects the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it.The wide-ranging implications of this principle are discussed comprehensively and lucidly - with good reason, because the allocation of rights and responsibilities between the individual and society is the most important business of coherent groups of human beings.In the final chapter, Mill discusses the practical application of his ideas, accepting that this is not always an easy matter."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"In many ways, one is tempted to think that there is no such thing as liberalism alive in America today. It would do many well to read the work of the Englishman Mill in order to understand much of what is called both \\"liberalism\\" as well as \\"individual liberty.\\" In addition, one of the growing issues of the contemporary political landscape in America is a polarization which is wholly unnecessary when analysis is applied the current plane of consideration. The reason for this conspicuous lack of reason for polarization is made obviously clear when one reads a work on liberal thought like that of Mill's. For Mill, individual liberty is a question both of social and political proportions, demanding a lack of interference by both government and social pressures. Additionally, he is keen in his analysis of the need for humility when it comes to humanity's apprehension of the Truth, thus necessitating free speech as a vehicle for the continual realization of those parts of the Truth which man so often forgets because of personal bias.However, the analysis is weak insofar as it also denies the need for structures to educate humanity in a fallen world. His criteria for legal and social sanctions does overlook the necessity to draw on tradition to properly shape those in the world (while maintaining individual dignity). While he acknowledges that it would be preposterous to deny the necessity of interrelationships and sharing of experience, Mill remains somewhat weak on the necessity of tradition and community as related to individual liberty. However, on the whole, the work presents a decent overview of the need to acknowledge individual dignity through the liberty of the individual. Indeed, all communal criticisms aside, On Liberty does indeed serve as a corrective against crass traditionalism which propagates itself without true individual consent and embrace. Therefore, even in its weakness, it remains strong as a key text on the primacy of the human individual as the recipient and follower of the Truth. In a day when liberty is shouted by groups who have no interest in talking to each other, such a small text would do well to make all groups realize that our American (and indeed Western) goals aren't that different, that we are united in trying to express human dignity through the individuals."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Unlike the clueless and completely contradictory rantings of &quot;white_anglo_saxon_muslim&quot;, this book is entirely in favour of the freedom of the individual - personal freedoms that are entirely opposed to the thoughts of socialism and the notion of a government or body removing those freedoms in favour of a &quot;greater good&quot;.This book argues that it is not the role of anyone else to decide what is best for any one person, but that person's decision. Liberty - this book is ON LIBERTY.Anyone who thinks this book is in favour of socialism is completely misguided and confused."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"It is surprising to me how many people assume that \`On Liberty' was written before or during the American Revolution - Mill was certainly influenced by the spirit of American liberty, which was variously romanticised and adapted in Britain and Europe during the nineteenth century. Published in 1859, \`On Liberty' is one of the primary political texts of the nineteenth century; perhaps only the writings of Marx had a similar impact, and of the two, in today's world, Mill's philosophy seems the one that is triumphant.One of the interesting ideas behind \`On Liberty' is that this may in fact be more the inspiration of Harriet Taylor (later Mrs. J.S. Mill) than of Mill himself; Taylor wrote an essay on Toleration, most likely in 1832, but it remained unpublished until after her death. F.A. Hayek (free-market economist and philosopher) noticed this connection. Whether this was the direct inspiration or not, the principles are similar, and the Mills were rather united in their views about liberty.\`On Liberty' is more of an extended essay than a book - it isn't very long (104 pages of the text in the Norton Critical Edition, edited by David Spitz). It relates as a political piece to his general Utilitarianism and political reform ideology. A laissez faire capitalist in political economy, his writing has been described as \`improved Adam Smith' and \`popularised Ricardo'. Perhaps it is in part the brevity of \`On Liberty' that gives it an enduring quality.There are five primary sections to the text. The introduction sets the stage philosophically and historically. He equates the histories of classical civilisations (Greece and Rome) with his contemporary England, stating that the struggle between liberty and authority is ever present and a primary feature of society. He does not hold with unbridled or unfettered democracy, either (contrary to some popular readings of his text) - he warns that the tyranny of the majority can be just as dangerous and damaging toward a society as any individual or oligarchic despotism. Mill looks for a liberty that permits individualism; thus, while democracy is an important feature for Mill, there must be a system of checks and balances that ensures individual liberties over and against this kind of system. All of these elements receive further development in subsequent sections.The second section of the text is \`Of the Liberty of Thought and Discussion'. Freedom of speech and expression is an important aspect here. Mill presents a somewhat radical proposition that even should the government and the people be in complete agreement with regard to coercive action, it would still be an illegitimate power. This is an important consideration in today's world, as governments and people contemplate the curtailment of civil liberties in favour of increased security needs. The possibility of fallibility, according to Mill, makes the power illegitimate, and (again according to Mill) it doesn't matter if it affects many or only a few, people today or posterity. It is still wrong. Mill develops this argument largely by using the history of religious ideas and religious institutions, in addition to the political (since the two were so often inter-related).The third section is perhaps the best known and most quoted, \`Of Individuality, as One of the Elements of Well-Being'. It is perhaps a natural consequence of Enlightenment thinking that individuality over communal and corporate identity would dominate. Our world today goes back and forth between individual and communal identities (nationality, regionality, employment, church affiliation, school affiliation, sports teams, etc.). Mill's ideas of individual are very modern, quite at home with the ideas of modern political and civil individuality, with all of the responsibilities.Mill states, \`No one pretends that actions should be as free as opinions.' He recognises the increased limitations on individual liberty given that we do live in communal settings, but this does not hinder the idea of individuality and individual liberty, particularly as it pertains to thoughts and speech. Mill explores various ideas of personal identity and action (medieval, Calvinist, etc.) to come up with an idea of individuality that is rather modern; of course, this is political personhood that pre-dates the advent of psychology/psychoanalytic theory that will give rise to a lot more confusion for the role of identity and personhood in society.The fourth primary section looks theoretically at the individual in community, \`Of the Limits to the Authority of Society Over the Individual'; the final section looks at specific applications. Mill discounts the idea of social contract while maintain that there is a mutual responsibility between individuals and community. Mill looks at the Temperance movements and laws as an example of bad laws (not only from the aspect of curtailment of liberty, but also for impractical aspects of enforcement); in similar examples, Mill looks at the role of society in regulating the life of the individual, calling on good government to always err on the side of the individual.Mill puts it very directly -- Individuals are accountable only to themselves, unless their actions concern the interests of society at large. Few in the Western world would argue with this today; however, we still live in a world where \`thought police' are feared, and \`political correctness' is debated as appropriate or not with regard to individual liberties.Mill wrote extensively beyond this text, in areas of philosophy (logic, religion, ethics). The particular text I use here, the Norton Critical Edition, has a good annotated text of \`On Liberty', a copy of Harriet Taylor's essay, \`On Tolerance', and a criticism section, including five essays written against Mill's ideas and constructions, and four essays in favour. There is also a useful bibliography and index.This should probably be required reading in civics classes, if not in the pre-university years for students, then certainly in the early university years."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"J.S. Mill has written the best promulgation of classical liberalism in his book &quot;On Liberty&quot; (OL). Although a socialist himself, many of the ideas in OL are actually tenets of modern libertarianism (also called classical liberalism). Mill states that the only reason that force can be used on any man is to prevent harm to others. I consider &quot;focre&quot; to be either social or economic. Mill saw it as only social, which explains his socialism.Not to detract from Mill or OL, the book is a resounding defense of civil-liberties. OL completes modern democratic theory as promulgated by John Locke in his &quot;Two Treatises of Government.&quot; While Locke argues for some kind of democracy reminiscent of Athens, Mill qualifies Locke's point by protecting the minority from the majority. This book should be read by Americans who want to know more about freedom, and by our elected officials.Sadly, it's our elected oficials who probably won't get it."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Few works argue as forcefully and eloquently for individual liberty as this one book. Written by one of England's greatest humanitarians, philosophers, and social scientists, this is one of the great classics in Western political philosophy. This book uses plain reason, clear logic, and objective reasoning to argue that the freedom of speech and its related freedoms such as freedom of assembly, press, petition, and religion, are ultimately beneficial to not only the individual, but to society as well. The latter argument goes as such; society is composed of individuals. Hence the knowledge and wisdom of a society is composed of the contributions of every individual. In order for a society to determine the truth, or best opinions on any particular topic, it must be allowed to see/hear all the opinions possible, which is only possible if everyone is allowed to voice their opinion.This reviewer read this book in high school, and was quite impressed with it back then.

This is a vibrant and passionate defense about the thinking and expression liberties, a vehement apology of the tolerance and respect beliefs or dissident minorities, a fearless recovery around the human spontaneity and singularity against the exerted oppression by authorities, costumes or public opinion.Under the lucid perspective of the elapsed years, this was a visionary text whose importance perhaps still has not been evaluated in all its wholeness."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"What J.S Mill proposes in \\"On Liberty\\" is still now convincing and interesting and I believe it should draw more attention than is the case today. True, Mill's ideas are not easily applicable to practical problems and his arguments are sometimes so defective as to be justifiably called \\"fallacies,\\" but still his fundamental principle is noteworthy and defensible: You can think, speak and do, as you like, unless you do any harm to others. Mill claims that this freedom, rather than spoiling our society, contributes to the progress of human beings in the long run, and this in the sense that so long as we humans do not achieve absolute infallibility, it is nothing other than human diversity that prevents us from falling into limited attitudes and courting fatal consequences. I agree from the bottom of my heart with this idea of his, and hope more attention will be paid to the book and its philosophy."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"A very definite view of legal rights, in that no interference from government should be permitted, save for when the actions of one harm others. This, of course, brings in questions about what constitutes 'harm', but all in all, a forceful argument for absolute free speech, unhampered by any law. I think this is interesting given the later restrictions placed on free speech. I was also interested to see how this book is rated on the high end of the 'difficult to read' scale, because I found Mill easy to follow and quite straightforward."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Have you ever tried to read that fun twentieth-century philosophy, especially the Frenchy-continental strain that is so loaded with jargon and neologisms that you feel as if it was deliberately created to make you feel stupid? The alternative is that the arc philosophy from structuralism through postmodernism is obtuse because there is nothing left to say so you have to hide behind \\"Being-in-itself\\" and you have to drink vodka until being becomes nothingness.Mill's masterwork is nothing of the sort. It is a short, structured argument written in defense of a premodern libertarianism as \\"liberty\\". I won't gloss on it too much here, since others more qualified can talk about his ideas. My copy is marked up with individual passages highlighted and !!!ed, but it is not in isolation that these passages have strength. Mill is able to define his conception of Liberty very directly, and he is not utopian since he senses the limits of Liberty as he defines them. These limits necessitate a state structure that in my reading, is incompatible with the modern conception of Libertarianism. The problems were evident 150 years ago, and I read it as more against bureaucracy per se than as against Government as a whole.Overall, readings and interpretations can vary across readers and across time, but this is a very important and interesting book to help build or challenge a world-view."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"An advocate for the development of individuality/ human potentials for social progress, the author believes and emphatically promotes liberty as essential foundation for freedom of conscience, free will as well as diligent exploration of diverse and opposing/contradicting ideas. He warns against mental complacency/laziness/conformity in many forms of public opinions, custom, doctrines and religioius dogmas with underlying notion of infallibility. He calls them \\"despotism\\" that hinders human advancemen and also quotes \\"slumber of a decided opinion\\" as dangers of uncontested ideas. Reading intoductory biography also helps to understand the personal background that influenced his political philosophy. His beliefs in liberty of one's actions are qualified in the sense and context of individual responsibility for self and \\"others\\", for example, he calls it \\"moral crime\\" against the offspring and society to \\"bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able to\\" provide education. In our current culture where McDonald (not individuals or parents) is blamed for obesity and some people claim entitlement about having multiple children even when they are being born into an environment that will most likely cause suffering and cycling through welfare system, John Stuart Mill's ideas of responsible liberty sadly cause feelings of disorientation. A psychologist once said, (perhaps, Rollo May?) we have to choose between \\"neurotic necessity and responsible freedom\\" This was a great read."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"\\"On Liberty\\" is one of the most important books on political thought of the nineteenth century. Fortunately for the 21st century reader it is also one of the most accessible. Mill was a libertarian who chose not to base his defence of liberty on natural rights but on his own revised version of utilitarianism:\\"I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions...grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\\"This enables Mill to argue that freedom is needed if man is to be able to explore all the avenues of human development that allow the human race to progress. Total freedom is impossible so what determines the legitimate boundaries of freedom? Mill distinguishes between self-regarding and other-regarding actions. The former should never be interfered with and the latter subject to limitation only if they harm the legitimate rights of others.For Mill free thought is a self-regarding action which should not be curtailed, and free thought is virtually useless without free speech. Mill then proceeds to add a utilitarian argument in favour of free speech: if an opinion is silenced then mankind is necessarily the loser whether the opinion is true or false. He advances a number of arguments to support this, concluding with the claim that a climate of freedom is essential for \\"great thinkers\\" and \\"it is as much, and even more indispensable to enable average human beings to attain the mental stature they are capable of.\\" He has no truck with paternalists seeking to guide people's thoughts in the \\"right\\" direction. He was equally hostile to the idea that people had the right not to be offended; hence he opposed the blasphemy law. The single case Mill gives of an acceptable limitation of free speech is the case of corn-dealers and an excited mob. An opinion expressed in a newspaper that corn-dealers are \\"starvers of the poor\\" is legitimate, but the same view stated to an angry mob outside the corn-dealer's home may be limited if it \\"is a positive instigation to a mischievous act.\\"Mill concedes that actions cannot be as free as speech and seeks to establish the proper limits of freedom of action. Mill proposes that \\"the sole end for which mankind are warranted...in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" Because he rejects paternalism he opposes all interference with self-regarding actions. Mill would not have prevented people from taking drugs and he would have led the opposition to seat belt legislation. Mill even rejects state interference with liberty for the sake of crime prevention, e.g. poisons can be used for criminal purposes. Mill was willing to accept a register of their sale but not the banning of them. Mill believes we must not interfere with the \\"rights\\"of others but these are narrowly circumscribed and Mill makes it clear that \\"rights\\" are not the same as \\"interests\\". Hence cut-throat laissez-faire is legitimate. As for moral decency arguments Mill does say that sexual intercourse in public is unacceptable, and though fornication and gambling are acceptable he is in two minds about whether pimps and casino-owners should be allowed to operate. Mill says it is a difficult case that is on the borderline, but adds that in general we must resist attempts to limit behaviour for \\"moral\\" reasons because any such action is likely to be the thin end of the wedge.Though Mill is a very determined anti-paternalist he makes three exceptions: children, primitive societies and the disabled. Children must be guided until they reach maturity and they must be given compulsory education - something not given legislative force until 1871 in his native country. As for primitive societies we must resist the notion that Mill was a typical Victorian believing in the \\"white man's burden\\" or inherent differences between races. He simply observed the reality of the world in the mid-nineteenth century but made it very clear any intervention in backward societies must be temporary with the aim to bring about self-government as soon as possible.Hence Mill was a much more determined libertarian than most modern writers on the subject. There is just one example where, at first sight, Mill may seem reactionary to modern readers. He wished to restrict the right to have children to those who could prove that they could support them. However, those who today wish others to be allowed to procreate at will do so on the grounds of human rights. Mill based his theories on utilitarianism, and not on rights. There was no welfare state when Mill wrote \\"On Liberty\\" and he was concerned with the well-being of children born to people without the means to support them.In view of the growing restrictions on freedom in many Western nations this is a book well worth reading again. In particular I like Mill's argument that every restriction on freedom is the thin end of the wedge, providing a justification for further restrictions."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This is Mill's statement of the ' one very simple principle' he wished to establish in ' On Liberty' \\" The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion or control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. The principle is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively , in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do, or forebear because it will be better for him to do,because it will make him happier, because , in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise or even right... The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society,is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself , his idnependence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.This is in a nutshell the creed of Mill's faith in ' On Liberty ' Gertrude Himmelfarb in her brilliant introduction explains how that faith developed in part out of the personal situation in which Mill found himself after years of close friendship with the - then married Harriet Taylor after her husband died, became his wife. One great controversy relates to the vast credit Mill gave her with being a full partner in every way in creating this work. The social isolation both suffered as a result of their relationship is an important element in Mill's fierce defence of the individual's right to be free of social coercion, and opinion. Another central element in the development of Mill's thought is his reaction to the Utilitarianism his father John Mill and Jeremy Bentham instilled in Mill from childhood. 'The greatest happiness for the greatest number principal' is rejected by Mill as first basis for social action. Mill in effect says that it is not society's business to be a Grand Inquisitor and bring it bread and circuses to make it happy. Happiness is not the first principle any longer in Mill's thought rather individual liberty is. The sole curb on such individual liberty is when it leads to the harming of others. This faith of Mill can be recognized today as part and parcel of the fundamental ideology of democratic societies.This work is thus one of the fundamental political classics which form the Western political tradition. And it is one of those works which should be part of the curriculum of any true liberal arts education. The question of the excesses of this principle and whether Mill in his thought has provided sufficient check to it by consideration of other human values isa very real and debatable one even today."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"In the Introduction to \\"On Liberty,\\" Currin Shields, an English egghead, bemoans the fact that Mill's most \\"famous\\" essay is \\"more talked about than read.\\"I'm surprised it is even talked about, and I am very much NOT surprised that hardly anyone reads it. Mill takes about a hundred and twenty pages to say what could be (and was) summed up in an epigram: People should be free to do whatever they want, as long as it does not harm anyone else.Not only does Mill subject the reader to pages and pages of supererogatory writing, but his prose is the epitome of Victorian verbosity, with more modifiers, clauses, footnotes, and parentheticals than there are alcoholics in Butte, Montana. (And there are a LOT of alcoholics in Butte, Montana.)I guess if you're studying philosophy, you're gonna have to read this thing sooner or later...likewise if you're an autodidact."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This book represents the beginning of the peversion of classical liberalism (Algernon Sidney, John Trenchard, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry) into the tyranny of modern day liberalism (socialism). Mill is the originator of the thoughtless confounding of liberal and socialist ideas that led to the decline of the living standards of the English people. Mill is the great advocate of Socialism. All the arguments that could be expounded in favour of socialism are expounded here. Marx, Lasalle and Engels are scarcely of importance. The blood of 100 million ultimately dripped from his pen (see the black book of communism). Liberty means freedom from taxes, too many laws and respect for property rights not the right to welfare or necessarily to vote. It is no surprise to see neo-con Himmelfarb enthusing over this book considering the Kristol family are fans of the tyrant Trotsky.Of course as an agnostic he advocates that socially, individuals should be privately able to do whatever they like. Unfortunately in order for a society to be free from too many laws the people must abide by unwritten laws and that means the laws of the Abrahamic God. If a village does not want to tolerate homosexuals then they should be free not to and be able to drive them out, it's called the social contract. As George Washington wisely put it 'in order to be a truly free people,we must be a religious people'. J.S. Mill, not a very good thinker and an appalling one on the nature of liberty."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Mill's book, On Liberty, tries to answer the question of what is the legitimate power that government can exercise over the individual . His main argument regarding personal liberty is the harm principle, meaning as long as the individual's actions do not harm other individuals, they shouldn't be restricted from that action. However, Mill doesn't only focus on the philosophical aspect of the role government should have in the individual life, but he also tries to answer more specific issues such as government policies concerning drugs, gambling, prostitution, public education versus private education, the importance of freedom of speech and more. If you're interested in such questions, this book is for you."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"As stated by Mill the topic of On Liberty is the role society should take in interfering with the liberty of an individual, that is, the amount of power that society may legitimately exercise over its people.The sphere of Mill's inquiry is the system of a democracy, where the main danger to individual liberty is that of the \\"tyranny of the majority,\\" in which minorities are subjected to the whims of the majority such that the \\"weaker members of the community\\" are \\"preyed upon by innumerable vultures.\\" Mill's argument is that \\"self-government\\" is not \\"the government of each by himself, but of each by all the rest.\\"Mill's main thesis is that society and the governing bodies have no right to interfere with the liberty of thought, action or individuality in any person save when those liberties may cause harm to others; that \\"over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\\" This is to say that society is unable able to interfere with individuals unless they're harming somebody, not including themselves - a person has every right to do harm to themselves and society may not intervene simply for the good of the individual.Apart from this, Mill also believes that keeping away the \\"tyranny of the majority\\" is good not only for the individuals and the minorities, but for society itself as well; that the argumentation/discussion which leads from freedom of thought is pivotal in the development of the society and truth. It is only in this that societies can avoid stagnation and people can truly learn; they must be able to see both sides of the argument (from people who truly believe them) and the ideas must be allowed to clash, thus, \\"genius can only breathe freely in an atmosphere of freedom.\\"In arguing for freedom of expression Mill argues that because the opinions of the individual may be true (or at least contain some portion of truth) and because human fallibility makes it so there are none fit to judge whether the opinion is true anyway, full freedom must be granted; not only this, but because there are none fit to judge, [according to Mill] there is no absolute certainty.This is all to lead into a sort of Hegelian system which Mill puts forth, noting that both sides of any argument generally only contain a portion of the truth and that it is only by bringing these two ideas together that the full truth can be found; a balance must be found between the ideas. The ideas must clash and in this clashing the synthesis between them will be found.Overall Mill's text is a good read even for people today. The ideas being presented are just as relevant now as they were during Mill's time, such the fact that the voice of third parties is all but crushed in the US's two party system or the discussions over gay marriage, abortion, or even something as small as free speech zones on college campuses. All of these feed back into the issue being discussed by Mill, that is, how much power society should be able to wield over its members and just what is the nature and extent of our liberty.Memorable Quotes:-\\"The liberty of the individual must be thus far limited; he must not make himself a nuisance to other people.\\"-\\"He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.\\"-\\"If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.\\"-\\"What was not wanted was that the rulers should be identified with the people, that their interests and will should be the interest and will of the nation. The nation did not need to be protected against its own will There was no fear of tyrannizing over itself.\\"Specific CriticismsFrom a secular standpoint I'm not sure how much can be critiqued of Mill's ideas. From a Christian standpoint there are two chief issues which may be taken.The first issue that may be taken is with the idea that \`over himself the individual is sovereign.' This is exactly the mindset which Scripture rails against and sets up as the original sin, to think that we are our own sovereigns, to usurp the sovereignty of God over his creations.The second issue which may be taken is with lack of any solid judge for truth. Simply put, the Christian would argue that God is the standard against which we measure truth, and due to his immutability he stands as a very good standard by which to judge. There is still the factor of fallibility which Mill notes, however this is not to say that truth cannot be discovered or that no statements can be set as entirely false.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Good and Fast . ... ....... ... .. ..... ........ ...... ....... .. ....... .... .... .. ...... ... ....."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This is the only version of &#34;On Liberty&#34; that I own.

While the Russians were carrying out pogroms against Jews because of their intolerance, Mill was able to provide an intellectual defense for tolerating the emerging Latter Day Saints (despite his obvious dislike for them). The beauty of this book is that the arguments are still relevant and directly applicable to the issues. Whereas Marx required armies of Soviet intellectuals in order to stay relevant, you can pick up On Liberty and fully appreciate the arguments. While it can be tempting to accept some infringements on liberty, I think it's necessary to have a philosophical framework through which to understand what limitations on liberty are justifiable and which aren't.Jorge"},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"When J. S. Mill published ON LIBERTY in 1859, he was then but the latest in a very long line of liberal theorists that stretched back to Plato and continued intermittenly for the next two millennia. These theorists as did Mill attempted to ascertain what if any was that fine line between the rights of the individual to live unimpeded from the caprices of a ruling state and the duty of that state to maintain the civil order necessary for those rights to exist. That we today still have not defined this line is a testimony to the never ending struggle of thinkers like Mill to present arguments of which each succeeding generation must be made aware.From the day it first appeared in print, readers have been entranced by the clarion call for unrestrained liberty. Mill wrote ON LIBERTY in such a manner that to argue against it suggests that to do so renders one as either a tyrant or a boor. Further, those who question Mill must walk a fine line between not supporting the very tyrannical state against which Mill rails and carrying out the the logical conclusion of accepting his definition of liberty at face value. I question Mill's underlying if unnoticed logic even as I applaud his cheerleading.Mill sees society as a perpetual repressor of the liberty of its citizens. For him, liberty consists of the ability to think and do as one pleases. Barring certain exceptions this liberty is the very foundation of any society that dares to call itself free. Society, then, must bend over backwards to ensure that all possess it. The chief stumbling block in this quest lies less in the individuating traits of people and more in the the tendency of rulers to rely on the heavy hand of custom to maintain its own existence even at the cost of denying liberty to their subjects.Mill sees \\"custom\\" as a dirty word that is all that is wrong with society. Nowhere does he concern himself with any positive connotations. He limits its use only to describe that which has the potential to stamp out every last smidgeon of creativity that might otherwise emerge. He fears that it will be the ruled, and not the rulers, who wish to crush dissent. To protect individuals from custom, Mill states that only those who are daring enough to defy society may do so. He calls such dissenters as \\"eccentrics.\\" For him, it is a term of praise that brings to mind heirs of a very long line of liberal thought from ancient Greek days. Just as Mill ignores the reality that custom has two divergent senses so does he similarly ignore the same about eccentrics. Clearly, if history proves anything, it is that those who have differed in ways that are bestial are about as numerous as those that are beneficial. When Mill champions the absolute right of eccentrics to challenge custom, he opens the door to tear down the bonds of society and not erect anything of a compensatory nature. When he argues that liberty must not be used to harm others, he is using a red herring to divert attention from the grim realization that to be different means far more than than saying so."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) was interested in the nature of Civil Liberty, and the limits to the power that a Government can legitimately exercise upon its citizens. He believed that some worrying tendencies could be observed in the England society of his time, and tried to warn others about them.The author basically explains his ideas regarding the preservation of individual liberties, not only due to the fact that they are rights owed to everyone, but also because they benefit society as a whole.For example, when he says that liberty of thought and of discussion must be preserved, he tells us that &quot;Wrong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact and argument: but fact and arguments, to produce any effect on the mind, must be brought before it&quot;. How can mistaken beliefs or actions be proven wrong, if dissent is forbidden?. The loss for society is clear: &quot;If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth; if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error&quot;.In order to preserve the liberties included in the concept of Civil Liberty, the author points out that there must be limits to the action of the Government. He says that &quot;The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others&quot;. Any other reason is simply not good enough. Thus, Stuart Mill highlights the rights of the individual, but also the limit to those rights: the well-being of others.&quot;On Liberty&quot; is not too long, and I think you are highly likely to enjoy it, if you can get past the first few pages. The problem is that even though the ideas in this book are quite modern, the language is somehow dated. But then, we must remember that &quot;On Liberty&quot; was written a long time ago...Notwithstanding that, do your best to read the first pages, and you will realize that after a while it will be much easier. This book is well-worth the effort you need to make at the beginning, because it is even more relevant today than when it was first published, in 1859.Are individual rights important?. Why?. Do they have a limit?. You will found the answer for these questions, and much more, in &quot;On Liberty&quot;. What else can I say?. I believe this is a book that will help you to reflect on many important issues... I certainly can't think of a better reason to read it. All in all, recommended :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This Kindle edition has an introduction written more than a century ago that offers no insight into Mill's essay and deals almost entirely with the relationship between Mill and Harriet Taylor. It is therefore primarily of general rather than academic interest.\\"On Liberty\\" is one of the most important books on political thought of the nineteenth century. Fortunately for the 21st century reader it is also one of the most accessible. Mill was a libertarian who chose not to base his defence of liberty on natural rights but on his own revised version of utilitarianism:\\"I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions...grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\\"This enables Mill to argue that freedom is needed if man is to be able to explore all the avenues of human development that allow the human race to progress. Total freedom is impossible so what determines the legitimate boundaries of freedom? Mill distinguishes between self-regarding and other-regarding actions. The former should never be interfered with and the latter subject to limitation only if they harm the legitimate rights of others.For Mill free thought is a self-regarding action which should not be curtailed, and free thought is virtually useless without free speech. Mill then proceeds to add a utilitarian argument in favour of free speech: if an opinion is silenced then mankind is necessarily the loser whether the opinion is true or false. He advances a number of arguments to support this, concluding with the claim that a climate of freedom is essential for \\"great thinkers\\" and \\"it is as much, and even more indispensable to enable average human beings to attain the mental stature they are capable of.\\" He has no truck with paternalists seeking to guide people's thoughts in the \\"right\\" direction. He was equally hostile to the idea that people had the right not to be offended; hence he opposed the blasphemy law. The single case Mill gives of an acceptable limitation of free speech is the case of corn-dealers and an excited mob. An opinion expressed in a newspaper that corn-dealers are \\"starvers of the poor\\" is legitimate, but the same view stated to an angry mob outside the corn-dealer's home may be limited if it \\"is a positive instigation to a mischievous act.\\"Mill concedes that actions cannot be as free as speech and seeks to establish the proper limits of freedom of action. Mill proposes that \\"the sole end for which mankind are warranted...in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" Because he rejects paternalism he opposes all interference with self-regarding actions. Mill would not have prevented people from taking drugs and he would have led the opposition to seat belt legislation. Mill even rejects state interference with liberty for the sake of crime prevention, e.g. poisons can be used for criminal purposes. Mill was willing to accept a register of their sale but not the banning of them. Mill believes we must not interfere with the \\"rights\\"of others but these are narrowly circumscribed and Mill makes it clear that \\"rights\\" are not the same as \\"interests\\". Hence cut-throat laissez-faire is legitimate. As for moral decency arguments Mill does say that sexual intercourse in public is unacceptable, and though fornication and gambling are acceptable he is in two minds about whether pimps and casino-owners should be allowed to operate. Mill says it is a difficult case that is on the borderline, but adds that in general we must resist attempts to limit behaviour for \\"moral\\" reasons because any such action is likely to be the thin end of the wedge.Though Mill is a very determined anti-paternalist he makes three exceptions: children, primitive societies and the disabled. Children must be guided until they reach maturity and they must be given compulsory education - something not given legislative force when he wrote. As for primitive societies, we must resist the notion that Mill was a typical Victorian believing in the \\"white man's burden\\" or inherent differences between races. He simply observed the reality of the world in the mid-nineteenth century but made it very clear any intervention in backward societies must be temporary with the aim to bring about self-government as soon as possible.Hence Mill was a much more determined libertarian than most modern writers on the subject. There is just one example where, at first sight, Mill may seem reactionary to modern readers. He wished to restrict the right to have children to those who could prove that they could support them. However, those who today wish others to be allowed to procreate at will do so on the grounds of human rights. Mill based his theories on utilitarianism, and not on rights. There was no welfare state when Mill wrote \\"On Liberty\\" and he was concerned with the well-being of children born to people without the means to support them.In view of the alleged growing restrictions on freedom in many democratic countries this is a book well worth reading. In particular I like Mill's argument that every restriction on freedom is the thin end of the wedge, providing a justification for further restrictions."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"In his classic essay \\"On Liberty\\", John Stuart Mill deals with the issue of \\"civil liberties\\" -not the metaphysical issue of \\"free will\\". While most attacks on civil liberties have historically occurred from the right within the context of a tyrannical or an aristocratic rule, Mill deals with threats against liberty from within the institutions of democracy itself. The issue is especially relevant at a time when widespread domestic wiretapping and surveillance violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.The aim of early libertarians was to limit the power of the ruler over those governed; Mill, however, identifies a need to limit the power of elected governments and officials as well. Mill is not merely addressing the issue of \\"who should rule?\\", he seeks to establish limits on the power that government may exercise over minorities and individuals. His work is more relevant now than ever.While \\"government of the people\\" is an ideal to be aspired to, Mill argues that such an ideal is often not the case in fact. He argues that those exerting the power of the government -elected officials, bureaucrats, the judiciary -often develop their own interests. They are sometimes influenced by those constituencies in ways that are at odds with the interests and liberties of individuals or other groups.Mill makes no distinction between a tyranny of one and a tyranny of many. A tyrannical majority running roughshod over the rights of individuals and minorities is no less a tyrant because it is a majority, because it is elected, or because it is elected by a majority.While society may not tolerate criminal behavior, for example, society may not legitimately interfere with or suppress all non-conforming behaviors indiscriminately or because a majority may not approve. What then are the powers that society may legitimately exercise over the individual? Mill answers:\\"The only purpose for which power can be rightly exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\\"-J.S. Mill, On LibertyJames Madison -called the \\"Father of the Constitution\\" -may have anticipated Mill's ideas in his draft of the Bill of Rights -the first ten amendments to the Constitution. Implicit in the Bill of Rights is the recognition that the power of the state is a blunt instrument. Abused, it can oppress and repress individuals and minority groups alike. The Bill of Rights addresses this issue by guaranteeing \\"due process of law\\", limiting state power over individuals and groups, guaranteeing that groups and individuals may speak freely, worship freely.The Fourth Amendment specifically is a promise that our government made to us in its very founding:\\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\\"-Fourth Amendment, Bill of Rights, U.S. ConstitutionLet's make something abundantly clear: there are no \\"inherent powers\\", \\"Implicit\\" authorizations\\" that would, in any way, overturn, limit, or repeal the Fourth Amendment. Many politicians are not only wrong about that, they may have deliberately lied about it. Moreover, Congress may not overrule the Fourth Amendment with statutory law. Constitutional Law is supreme and provisions in the Bill of Right are valid until amended as set out in the Constitution itself. Widespread domestic surveillance is illegal whatever is done by Congress ex post facto -and until the Constitution is amended, it will remain illegal. At last, ex post facto laws, themselves, are expressly forbidden by the Constitution.Mill is all the more remarkable for his insight into issues that remain contemporary. In every literate criticism of \\"special interest groups\\", PAC's, the gun lobby, the tobacco lobby, the Military/Industrial Complex, one sees the lasting influence of John Mill.On Liberty is essential reading for anyone interested in law, the principles of government, political science, political philosophy, indeed, freedom itself. It is also essential reading for anyone interested in learning about the intellectual underpinnings of Anglo-American civil liberties."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This edition is subtitled \\"Optimized for Kindle\\". I was therefore quite surprised that it lacked a table of contents. What does \\"optimized\\" mean in this context?"},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"This book deserves to be studied closely; I cannot praise too highly the man or his work. As Mill writes in his AUTOBIOGRAPHY, his education under his philosopher father James was perhaps the most tortuous experience imaginable for a young child, leaving the adolescent John with the impression that he was something of a facsimile of his father. Nevertheless, after much difficulty in assimilating what he was taught and defining who he was, the adult Mill respectfully stepped out from under his father's shadow and went on to make staggering intellectual contributions of his own. In this book, ON LIBERTY, Mill tackles the problem of \\"the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual.\\" With some reflection, it can be seen how important this question is, for its implications touch every part of our social and private lives. Unfortunately, few recognize its importance, and the question is more often decided by unthinking custom or self-interest than reason. With scrupulous rigor, and impeccable intellectual honesty, Mill asserts the absolute necessity of dissenting opinions, of diversity in all things, and the dangers of concentrated power, be it in the form of a dictator or a democratic majority. The problems treated in this short book are just as relevant today as they were in Mill's time. Perennial political issues such as education reform, gun control, abortion, freedom of speech, taxation, the role of government, etc., are addressed either directly or indirectly; the book abounds with other, more personal, lessons on life as well, not the least of which was later encapsulated by Wittgenstein as: \\"If you want to improve the world, improve yourself.\\""},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"In On Liberty, Mill attempts to define when the authority of society can rightly limit individuality and the &quot;sovereignty of the individual over himself.&quot; He writes that people are not accountable to society for actions that only concern themselves. The only means society has to express disapproval of such actions is through &quot;advice, instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by other people if thought necessary by them for their own good.&quot; He also writes that the individual is accountable for actions that hurt others, and society can punish a person socially or legally as is deemed necessary for such actions. Mill observes, though, that sometimes when an action causes harm to others, such as when a person succeeds in a competitive job market, the general social good is positive, and there is no right to punish people for the harm caused. Throughout On Liberty, Mill's argument proceeds with a discussion of the appropriate level of authority that society should have over the individual, along with particular examples and applications of the theory, to clarify the meaning of his claims. The examples are just as relevant today as they were in Mill's time. Continuing political issues such as education reform, gun control, alcohol, freedom of speech, taxation, the role of government, etc., are addressed either directly or indirectly. Mill was ahead of his time. His book was insightful, thought-provoking and ahead of its time. The questions and viewpoints Mill argued are the same issues in political debates today. When reading On Liberty, I found myself reading the same paragraphs over again to understand his main issues and points. Also, in parts of the reading Mill never really comes across and answers his own questions he argued, but his ideas and arguments leave the reader thinking."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"America's defense department should take some of the billions spent on the stealth bomber or the B1 and spend it to make Arabic and Farsi translations of this book in the hundreds of thousands. We could pack the bomb bays of a squadron of stealth bombers with the translations and carpet the cities of Muslim countries with this treatise on freedom. This is The Book, folks. You cannot read this little book without it changing your life. It is an extended argument about freedom, about true morality, about freeing your mind, about untrammeling the possibility of peace and prosperity in the world. This is the book that lays out the path for treating other human beings with respect and opening the way toward progress in any and all societies. For the discussion of the \\"harm to others\\" principle alone, this book merits the world's attention and praise.Perhaps the most famous aspect of Mill's extended argument about liberty is his discussion of the \\"tyranny of the majority.\\" His argument grows from the long history of religious persecution suffered throughout Europe that led to book bans, bigotry, and even torture and burning at the stake for people who did not conform to the majority superstition, namely the dominant form of Christianity wherever one lived. Mill lived in a time when even the staid and relatively moderate views of the English Church forced people to conform their lives or face public humiliation and financial ruin, and sometimes lynching. The resulting dynamic was that free thought was thus discouraged and progress thwarted. Mill's point is that in such a psychological milieu, people are not mentally free to seek a better way. They are rather trammeled to superstition and the concomitant tyranny of the majority, the majority being emotionally dependent and mentally ham-strung by religion and religious fears and prejudices.America today is witnessing the truth of this dynamic through the virulent and underhanded tactics of the fundamentalist X-tian political right who seek to thwart medical research and impose a legislated theocracy in parts of the country. The effort to put dark-age arguments about \\"intelligent design\\" on a scientific par with evolutionary theory is a perfect and alarming example. Mill's argument in On Liberty was prescient in demonstrating what can happen when people allow religion to influence political life. The brand of literalist religion we see in America has been the bane of societies throughout history and respresents a true pragmatic evil on a scale far worse than any imagined \\"Satanic\\" sinfulness that Christians associate with popular and secular humanism. Fundamentalist religion, especially in the forms of Christian and Muslim extremism, is a societal cancer when viewed through the lense of reason and of Mill's enlightened utilitarianism. No society that allows religion to make in-roads to politics can flourish. Proof is in the failed Middle East, where no country can manage to pull its people out of poverty and squalor in spite of sitting on the world's richest oil reserves. Mill's argument in this small book speaks volumes about why Muslim countries are doomed to failure and why the Christian right in America (the blood cousins of Islamic radicals) represent the biggest and most un-American evil in our country's history. If America represents freedom, there can be no room for the \\"ten commandments\\" in the county court house.Highly recommended as a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"I agree, how hard is it to put a table of contents in, it is very frustrating trying to navigate through this book."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"John Stuart Mill, author of On Liberty, defines the nature of civil liberty, and most importantly, the harm principl. He aims to give readers a better understanding of the nature and limits of power that can be exercised by society over individuals. The purpose of this book is to inform interested individuals about the rights of individuals and the limitations of the government. This book of philosophy was written almost 150 years ago. By reading the book, the reader is able to apply Mill's message and examples to our lives in America today. The ahead-of-the-times ideas that are in On Liberty can be related to our world because it discusses controversies that are still seen in our courtrooms today. Mill is able to accomplish his purpose because he uses many examples, thoughts, and theories about individual and social rights. He works through each of his ideas, looking at both sides of the issue to enable the reader to make their own informed decision about each matter. This book has a practical meaning because it allows the reader to develop and reason ideas about government power and when that power should be exercised over the people. Unfortunately, this book does have one draw back. Mill was a very educated man and wrote very well for his time. Yet today, our style and writing techniques are not the same as they were in the nineteenth century. This makes On Liberty a difficult book to read. His book is very decriptive, yet his wording is not easily understadable and some paragraphs have to be read two or three times to fully understand what he is writing about. Aside from his writing style, John Stuart Mill has put together an essay full of educated ideas about society and individuals. John Stuart Mill wrote an informative book geared towards an educated audience.

Mill's primary concern was to address the potential problem of the \\"tyranny of the majority\\" posed by the emerging democratization of society. His concern was prompted specifically by de Toqueville's account of the USA. Mill is concerned not just with the way government could impose conformity to majority views but also with general social pressures for conformity. In opposition to the dangers of majoritarianism, Mill proposes 2 versions of the Harm principle; the first the basic idea that whatever doesn't cause harm is permitted. The second and more restrictive version emphasizes violation of duties to others. Mill argues his case very well, addressing both general principles and specific problems of contemporary British society. In line with his utilitarian approach, he argues vigorously that human improvement requires the type of freedom and tolerance implied by his Harm Principles. This is also in a real sense the weakness of On Liberty. Mill's version of utilitarianism is not the hedonistic utilitarianism of Bentham and his father, nor preference utilitarianism, but a more vague assertion of what is needed for human progression. Well written, and often quoted, this is one of the accessible major texts in the canon."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"The modern age is a dangerous age, an age in which we might be alienated from that individual independence in work and in mind which defines our humanity. Confronted by this crisis, Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill offer the world diverging solutions: annihilate the existing world and march toward communism, or guard against the dangers of the existing world as we further embrace liberal democracy. Despite these divergent paths which arise from differing views on the driving force of history, both systems aim to rescue the supreme interest of our individual humanity-for Marx, this interest lies in reaching absolute prosperity for the material man, and for Mill, it lies in the search for absolute truth for the idealistic man.With its emphasis on individuality and diversity, Mill's theory is in a sense more encompassing than Marx's. Mill's theory, however, is fundamentally flawed in comparison to Marx's because of its ignorance of property as a danger against human liberty.Marx sees in the industrial age the death of the property-less class. This death is brought by the industrial age's five qualities: division of labor, accumulation of capital, competition, financial crisis, and monopoly. In this age, machineries and the division of labor reduce the skillful artisans to the proletariats who merely work on one monotonous element of production. The capitalists who own the machines enlarge their capital by exploiting the proletariat's labor, leaving them only with enough to eat. Competition forces capitalists to lower prices, but this is good only until each factory produces more than demanded and a financial crisis emerges. The small capitalists are reduced to the property-less as millions of workers are swept into deeper hell. Only the biggest capitalist survives, and he becomes the monopolist who can lower wages and raise prices at whim, destroying the lives of all. (Part 1, Bourgeois and Proletarians, Manifesto of the Communist Party)The above scenario is unavoidable because the accumulation of more capital is the only end of capital. If the capitalist stops investing capital for gains he ceases to be a capitalist, and becomes a mere consumer of goods, enjoying the fruits of old exploitations. Tragically, capital can only increase when it exploits the difference of what labor costs and labor produces, as Marx writes,\\"The modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.\\" (Marx p484)The rich man sitting in his patio who has inherited a million pound and who lets others manage his money has not done anything to deserve profits, indeed, since he himself did not work, his profits must come from the works of others who he exploits. In the capitalistic system, there exists no pity, only keen self-interest, \\"all are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use...\\" (Marx p479)The workers might die, but before their body ceases to be exploited, their mind is already died-capitalism has alienated them from their humanity which is defined by their creative productivity. This alienation from our humanity was Marx's greatest worry. Animals make nests and produce goods just as we do, however, as Marx writes,\\"...a bee would put many a human architect to shame by the construction of its honeycomb cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is that the architect builds the cell in his mind before he constructs it in wax... Man not only effects a change of form in the materials of nature; he also realizes his own purpose in those materials.\\" (Chapter 7, Das Kapital)In order to freely produce as the creativity of his mind directs him and as his productive ability allows, the material man must be endowed with control over the means of production. In the world of private property, however, the workers have turned from the master of production to the slave of the machine-they are reduced to programmed animals that produce merely for the end of survival.The proletariat can only reassert his humanity by violent overthrowing the capitalists and through the \\"abolition of private property\\" (Marx p484). Once in communism, the workers will own the means of production and enjoy the full produces of their labor. He will be motivated to constantly transform the world into a more prosperous kingdom. As Marx writes, \\"In communist society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the labourer.\\" (Marx p485) The abundance of material goods will allow man to work not for survival, but for his own enjoyment. In this society, there will be no family and nor religion, everything is made for the love of all and enjoyed by all. Any vestiges of private interest would result in the return to capitalism with all its evils.To Mill, the modern life is also threatening because the voice of the majority might alienate men from their individuality. The differentiation of society is essential for the vitality of the society, and this vitality empowers men on their search for truth.Political debates, according to Mill, have been about striking the balance between the ruler and ruled. It is necessary for the ruled to have a ruler in order to preserve peace and law, yet the elected or unelected ruler's power must be restrained so that he does not abuse it against the ruled. In contrast to Marx's class struggle, this \\"struggle between liberty and authority\\" (p59) from Mill is more amiable. In the current era of democratic nations, however, since the ruled are also the rulers, the opposition no longer exists. People feel that all actions taken by the people's government will be good for the people, and hence they lose the old vigilance against the invasion of public power into their private spheres. The voice of the majority becomes the equivalent of the truth and justice.Mill is worried that this majority voice will obstruct man's search for truth, the attaining of which is the goal of life. Truth is not reached once and then preserved for eternity, it is an organic being with a thousand facets whose survival requires continued inputs of each person's active mind. This truth is the individual treasure of each being, fitting perfectly to his taste and preferences; yet it is also a truth for the whole community, since it is only through the struggles of different truths that humanity as a whole reaches a higher truth-a higher level for the activation of the mind. As Mill writes, \\"There is always need of persons not only to discover new truths and point out when what were once truths are true no longer\\" (p71) If the majority religion is the only religion and taste the only taste, then people will no longer think but simply follow; society will be bogged into the swamp of mediocrity with a mind that is dead. Marx also feared the death of the mind, the mind of the creative worker. Despite the differences, both philosophers are concerned about the destruction of man's defining qualities.To counter this, Mill proclaims that the only defense for \\"interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" (p68). The government must be restrained in the sphere of public affairs, and individuals shall live as free as they want to following their individual passions.Marx and Mill both want to regain humanity. In one case, the enemy is the benumbing effects of majority rule, and man's mind for truth is debased forever into mediocrity, in the other case, the enemy comes from the benumbing effects of subjugation to the machine, and the man is turned from the master of production into the slaves of capital.The core difference between the two theories in practical operation arises from their different views on individuality (both systems serve individuals as their ends, however, individuality, allowing people to be different, are treated differently). For Mill, we must preserve individuality to bring truth (Chapter 3, On Liberty), but for Marx, the destruction of private property is the only task. The communistic society will be a union in which man can \\"...hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner...\\" (The German Ideology). This free life of a communist in communism is all good until one day the comrade does not want to be a communist anymore-but he must be one, there is no choice. In Communism, one does not have the individual liberty to have families, nor try to build a little store of private wealth.On the other side, if someone in Mill's world decides to be a communist, he has the full right to do so. He can even segregate himself away with his friends and enjoy the life of a commune. In another word, Marxism can not destroy Mill's democracy-it will just be one of the many ways of thinking allowed by the system-but Mill's cry for diversity will destroy Marx's world within a second.Confronted with the above, Marx would reply like he did in the Jewish Question, that the so-called liberty and freedom of the capitalistic world are nothing other than man's desire to keep himself a self-sufficient nomad. As he writes, all the rights of man are simply \\"the right to enjoy one's fortune and to dispose of it as one will; without regard for other men and independently of society.\\" (Marx, p42) Marx will say that only seeing the superficial political liberation is not to see the deeper human liberation which could only be achieved with the abolition of private property. Marx might not be completely right, but he does stand at a higher ground than Mill in this analysis of property.Mill in On Liberty is focused solely on avoiding the abuse of power through government, but he ignores the abuses that property owners are capable of against the property-less. In an agricultural society where everyone is equal and land unlimited, the government might be the only thing capable of suppressing individual liberty, but when one sees child-labor and 12 hour work day in modern industrial society, there is no doubt that capital could be a pitiless monster. Even when one ignores the industrial age, and tries to give Mill credit for drawing the best possible life for the pre-industrial man, one still can not avoid noticing the subjugation of the slaves, the suffering of the serfs, and all the other dark stories of the property-less in all the ages previous to the industrial one which Marx gives a full account of.Marx and Mill were faced with the same modern phenomenal, the danger of been alienated from the defining quality of humanity in the face of a new economic and a new political system. Marx might not have made the best analysis, but he did have a deep understanding of history and the problems in history. He stood at the level of the common people and tried to solve their problems caused by their material desperation. Mill did not stoop to the common people, he looked up into the sky of truth and tried to preserve the march toward truth first embarked on by Plato."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"On Liberty by Locke was very interesting and analyzed how humans see the world.

Mill's book about liberty was of vast importance in freeing the individual from the tyranny of communal opinion. Someone may dislike homosexuals, but has no right to harass them or pass ethical judgements on them for what is their choice, of no harm to anyone else. Those are opinions of an indeterminate validity. Socal intervention may only be used to protect someone from restriction of their liberties. What Mill lacks in rigour, he makes up for in persuasiveness. He has some great lines in defense of liberty, a pre-dominant value of human life. Although, it is to be noted that the book can be somewhat tedious in areas which it is repetitive. This book also illustrates what can be seen as a fault in utilitarianism. Utilitarianism takes no notice of other values, or of a conflict of values, such as liberty of existence over the majorities happiness, in which ethics slides into absurdity."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"Mill's inconsistent treatment of liberty is so schizophrenic that is seems to be written by two different people, a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde. His flashes of brilliance are marred by his incongruous forays into authoritarianism. It is incredible to me how anyone can read this book and come away viewing it as a legitimate defense of liberty. Mill is clearly guilty of wanting to have his cake and eat it too, and the resulting work is a litany of completely irreconcilable rules for civil society.The brilliant:\\"If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.\\"How elegant. But Mill is a double-edged sword:\\"Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.\\"And:\\"Though society is not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit, and the fact of living in society renders it indispensable that each should be bound to observe a certain line of conduct towards the rest. This conduct consists, first, in not injuring the interests of one another; or rather certain interests, which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be considered as rights; and secondly, in each person's bearing his share (to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labors and sacrifices incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and molestation. These conditions society is justified in ENFORCING, at ALL COSTS to those who endeavor to withhold fulfilment.\\"Mill at once complains about expected group conformity, then turns around and suggests that community scorn is a justifiable weapon to be used against non-conformists. He talks of liberty, then of the duties we owe for the \\"general welfare.\\" On Liberty could as just as well have been written by a Marxist theorist."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"John Stuart Mill was a liberal's liberal or a socialist's socialist- ahead of his times (or just hanging on Karl Marx's coattail.) His utilitarian socialist philosophy was a real u-turn away from the classic liberalism preceeding his times. What is particularly disturbing is that this book is passed off by academia to represent classical liberalism. This book is good for its historical value and studying political theory, but don't be fooled into thinking 'On Liberty' is at all faithful or indicative of the classical liberal or libertarian philosophy on liberty.Get Liberalism in the Classic Tradition by Ludwig von Mises to understand true classical liberalism."},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"I would certainly rank John Stuart Mill as the most overrated philosophical windbag of all time. I don't find it a coincidence that Mill was described as a \\"very ladylike person.\\" That seems to explain a great deal of his writing style, which bespeaks a certain dizziness of the mind.Roger Kimball summed up Mill well:Together with Rousseau, John Stuart Mill (1806-73) supplied nearly all of the arguments and most of the emotional weather - the texture of sentiment - that have gone into defining the Left-liberal vision of the world.Mill's peculiar brand of utilitarianism - a cake of Benthamite hedonism glazed with Wordsworthian sentimentality - accounts for part of his appeal: it provides a perfect recipe for embellishing programmatic shallowness with a cosmetic patina of spirituality. It is a recipe that has proven irresistible to those infatuated with the spectacle of their own virtue.Another large part of Mill's appeal rests on his \\"feminism\\" - his conviction, put forward in The Subjection of Women, that differences between the sexes were accidental and that, as Leslie Stephen put it, \\"women could be turned into men by trifling changes in the law\\". Both are indispensable elements in the intoxicating potion that constitutes Mill's appeal and makes much of his thinking seem so contemporary.Mill's arguments and pronouncements about man as a \\"progressive being\\", the extent of individual autonomy, the limits of acceptable moral and legal censure, the importance of innovation and (perhaps his most famous phrase) \\"experiments in living\\" are all familiar to the point of invisibility. Likewise his corollary insistence on the poverty of custom, prejudice and tradition. Mill's contentions on these subjects are nowadays less objects of debate than of reverence. But the public success of Mill's teaching (especially in his manifesto On Liberty) says nothing about the cogency of his arguments. In fact, Mill's central arguments are open to - and have from the beginning been subjected to - serious criticism. Yet they have raged like wildfire through the Western world, consuming everything that stands in their path. Which means, among other things, that they exert an appeal quite distinct from any intellectual merit they may possess.As for the nature of Mill's arguments, consider, for example, his famous plea on behalf of moral, social and intellectual \\"experiments\\". Throughout history, Mill argues, the authors of such innovations have been objects of ridicule, persecution and oppression; they have been ignored, silenced, exiled, imprisoned, even killed. But (Mill continues) we owe every step of progress, intellectual as well as moral, to the daring of innovators. \\"Without them,\\" he writes, \\"human life would become a stagnant pool. Not only is it they who introduce good things which did not before exist; it is they who keep the life in those which already exist.\\" Ergo, innovators - \\"developed human beings\\" is one phrase Mill uses for such paragons - should not merely be tolerated but positively be encouraged.The philosopher David Stove called this the \\"They All Laughed at Christopher Columbus\\" argument. The amazing thing about the success of the Columbus argument is that it depends on premises that are so obviously faulty. Indeed, as Stove observes, a moment's reflection reveals that the Columbus argument is undermined by a downright glaring weakness.Granted that every change for the better has depended on someone embarking on a new departure: well, so too has every change for the worse. And surely, Stove writes, there have been at least as many proposed innovations which \\"were or would have been for the worse as ones which were or would have been for the better\\". This means that we have at least as much reason to discourage innovators as to encourage them, especially when their innovations bear on things as immensely complex as the organisation of society. In On Liberty, Mill presented himself as a prophet of individual liberty. But if liberty was always on Mill's lips, a new orthodoxy was ever in his heart. There is an important sense in which the libertarian streak in On Liberty is little more than a prophylactic against the coerciveness that its assumption of virtuous rationality presupposes. Mill hoped that liberty would replace the reign of prejudice with the reign of reason. In fact, it has had the effect of camouflaging prejudices with rational-sounding rhetoric. The effort to unseat customary practice and belief has resulted not, as Mill predicted, in encouraging a drift towards unanimity but in increasing chaos.Nor is this surprising. As Mill's great critic James Fitzjames Stephen noted, \\"the notorious result of unlimited freedom of thought and discussion is to produce general scepticism on many subjects in the vast majority of minds\\". Such \\"paradoxes\\" (to put it politely) show themselves wherever the constructive part of Mill's doctrine is glimpsed through his cheerleading for freedom and eccentricity.Mill claimed a monopoly on the word \\"rational\\". So long as that monopoly remains unchallenged our paralysis will be complete. The antidote to the moral helplessness that Mill's liberalism generates is not to be found by digging deeper in the trench of liberal rationalisation. On the contrary, it begins with the recognition that no \\"one very simple principle\\" can relieve us of the duties we owe to the inhabited world that we, for this brief while, share with many others.See Kimball's excellent November 1998 article in The New Criterion entitled \\"One very simple principle\\""},{"Title":"On liberty","review":"I don't really like the fact that Mill wasn't religious- I don't believe you can have a just person who doesn't believe in a higher power, but the economics in On Liberty and the politics are amazing.

However, before you buy this outline of college chemistry or any of the other Schaum's Outlines, you need to ask yourself what your needs are. If you are looking for a brief review of a subject, you should look elsewhere. If you are taking a course in general chemistry and need a little help with some areas of it, you should look elsewhere--preferably, ask someone with a thorough grasp of the subject to explain those areas to you.The Schaum's Outlines are best used as a self-study tool. Let's face it, reviewing an entire subject and solving all the problems to gain a solid grasp on the material is difficult and time-consuming, and I suspect few students already enrolled in a course will have the extra time to rehash what they've already been told by reading through a Schaum's Outline, and even fewer will want to go through so many problems--at least in my courses, the problems we are provided are too much to begin with.For review purposes, Schaum's may help some students, especially if you are reviewing years of material such as I did for my IB exam. However, since you need to know what your course will test you on specifically, you would need to go through the outline along with your notes. Therefore, spending more time reviewing your course notes might be a better use of your time.Schaum's Outlines are essentially cheaply made textbooks, and, as with other texts, the writing varies widely from one book in the series to another. If a cheap self-study course is what you seek, or you'd like to preview a course you plan to take, by all means go with Schaum's. If you are a student looking for help with a subject, seek it elsewhere.For help with grades, I suggest you try the Scham's &quot;How to Study&quot; guide and follow their suggestions."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of College Chemistry","review":"This book is concise and complete. The reviews are great, and the problems aren't just busywork--they actually will help you understand the material. For the higher level International Baccalaureate chemistry exam, I have had to review 2 years worth of general chemistry, and this book has helped me immensely."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of College Chemistry","review":"I am a chemistry major and found a lot of informative material included. The book explained the ideas thoroughly and the problems at the end of each section were a good source of review and practice. Everything was straight forward and easy to comprehend."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of College Chemistry","review":"This has got to be just about one of the best Schaum's outlines available, and that is saying a lot, since there are many good ones. I picked up a copy for self study due to a domino effect - I was attempting to learn molecular biology, which caused me to review my college biology, which in turn meant remembering my college chemistry.I bought this book and read and worked through the exercises from chapter one on quantities and units through chapter 17, acids and bases. At no time did I need to seek out another textbook to solve the problems. Everything you need as far as \\"lecture\\" is in the outline. All included tables, figures, definitions, explanations, and example problems are complete and excellent. None of the mathematics involved in chemistry calculations is difficult, but the rules can get involved and you need a good book like this one to explain all of the variations involved in solving problems.Chapters 1 through 14 cover what you would normally learn in a two semester sequence of college chemistry. From that point on in the outline there are a series of miscellaneous topics. Of course, the one I appreciated the most was chapter 15 on organic chemistry and biochemistry, because it directly relates to what I needed to know so I could read the references to chemistry in the biology books without scratching my head. There are also additional chapters on thermodynamics and chemistry, acids and bases, metal ions, electricity and chemistry, and the chemistry of nuclear processes.Whether you are a college chemistry student, or someone like me who needs to review the topic, I strongly advise you to pick up a copy of this inexpensive yet extremely clear and complete Schaum's outline. It also serves as a great reference after you finish your studies."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of College Chemistry","review":"A few years out of high school, I was working construction and decided that it was time to go to college. After doing an agonizing reappraisal of my finances, I realized that I could not afford to either take the time off work or pay a great deal for tuition. I had recently read a brief article in an issue of Reader's Digest that described the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) tests. Realizing that this would be an option for college credit and then discovering that there was a CLEP test for chemistry, I purchased this book and began studying.It was very hard at first, balancing the chemical equations was a form of algebra problem far beyond those I was familiar with. Nevertheless, I persevered in two ways. I managed to work my way through the book doing nearly all of the problems and I also passed the CLEP chemistry test with flying colors. I then went on to get a chemistry major and only once did I slip below an A.While I don't belittle the amount of time and effort I put forth, it was the quality of this book that got me through. While the problems were hard, they were still doable and once done, you have learned the material. No higher praise can be given."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of College Chemistry","review":"I got this and some other books to get my son ready for HS Honors Chemistry over the Summer. It is just the right level. The many detailed worked examples are clear and there are lots of extra problems to practice on. I looked at quite a few others including Schaum's more general \\"General Chemistry\\" and this was the best."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of College Chemistry","review":"This is a superb self help textbook which provides concise, clear and easy to understand material. The solutions are really simple to follow.

One can feel her heart race at the thought of full surrender to a love while at the same time her ear is cocked for the first sign of withdrawal. Her ability to balance on the knife blade between hope and despair is extraordinary. Her sense of romance is almost medieval in that there is always a yearning for a love that reality can never assuage or fulfill. Always some twisting and pulling away -- a recognition that this will end and not be remembered. Her imagery is fresh and immediate -- like an early spring with an unexpected frost. It is a particularly poignant book for those who are recovering from a disappointing love, because it also carries the ring of truth and therefore hope. Her work reminds me of ee cummings. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"I Stole a Rock: Poems of Love and Romance","review":"For a long time recently, I felt as if I were sleep walking through life, with my soul outside my body (choosing perhaps to live in the poetry section of Amazon.com or somewhere equally exotic....) and then I picked up this book of poems. I laughed, cried and sighed and I nodded my head with each poem I read and felt my soul come back to me......The magic of words!Two of my favorites are \\"Finding Your Wife Was a Lesbian\\" (the last stanza is poetry at it's finest) and \\"The Clean House\\" (as a cat owner and wife of a \\"Mr. Clean\\", I wanted to frame this one....)It's always exciting to discover a new poet, especially one whose poems you feel as if you could've written yourself. Such are the poems of Sara King. I highly recommend this book to all poetry lovers, women especially...it's on my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"I Stole a Rock: Poems of Love and Romance","review":"I think of these poems as sharp arrows that hit their target. Perhaps because so many are addressed to &quot;you&quot; I think of them as zooming through the air to some ONE, to some PLACE. They are zingers. Full of experience. King knows what's up and doesn't spare words....though she uses words sparingly. There's plenty of regret but no self-pity. Her voice is her own. The real thing. You will be glad you bought her book."},{"Title":"I Stole a Rock: Poems of Love and Romance","review":"A poem from this book was TWICE featured on Writers Almanac and read by Garrison Keillor, Oct 17, 2003 and Oct 17, 2004. Check the archives link at lower left at www.writersalmanac.com to hear Keillor read the poem."},{"Title":"I Stole a Rock: Poems of Love and Romance","review":"Sara King's style is evident in all of these poems. While there are obvious strong pieces, there are several that should not have been included in this collection.Any description that I could plot down with letters would not equal the range of emotion reached by Sara King's metaphors. Therefore, I will not try. I will urge you, however, to read the &quot;Laundry&quot; poem and you will agree with me. (I heard this poem via Garrison's Keillor's Writers Almanac program on NPR.)I will admit that I did not, indeed, purchase a copy of this book--I read the complete text via the Publisher's Web site, but believe me: this is worth buying. I intend to order my copy this week.Allan St. JamesBowling Green, KYAuthor of Banner"},{"Title":"CIA Field-Expedient Key Casting Manual","review":"This book uses basic principles to creat a key. The book is easy to understand, and the process is possible with some practice. However the book tells you at the end to use the copy of the key you made to duplicate it on a machine(or by hand) because the metal you use is to frail. This book would be better if it told you how to either harden the metal you use after you key is made, or if the instructions used a different metal, and possibly a different heating process for that metal."},{"Title":"CIA Field-Expedient Key Casting Manual","review":"The book was informative but the materials neede for the project were not as stable. The product had to be redone several times."},{"Title":"The Vastu Home: Harmonize Your Living Space with the Indian Feng Shui","review":"I purchased this book hoping to find a practical guide on Vastu. It turns out to be a picture book full of contempo-modern indian styled spaces with little to no practical instruction.Vastu is a design system based on the Square (which represents the spirit/demon Vasta Purusha covering earth) and this book only explains how to decorate square rooms in a square space. I could find no advice on how to handle non-square rooms or solutions to problems that go along with renting a home that can not be significantly altered. I have seen plenty of Fung Shui books that suffer from the same problems. I understand that this design philosphy is ancient and most historical practitioners would have built their homes using these ideals, but this book is marketed to the modern public, most of whom are already living in their home and unable to make use of the chapters on \\"Choosing the Vastu Home: The Site\\" and \\"Choosing the Vastu Home: The Structure\\". These chapters might be informative, but they are only helpful to a small portion of the people who will read this book. There are no chapters for Apartment dwellers or on problem solving existing situations both of which would have a wider audience.All in all, I wish I had not spent the money on this book. The pictures are nice, but hardly inspirational and the text is a little boring and dry. Also the page layout is very boring and each page looks exactly the same. I would suggest that you keep looking for another source of Vastu information. And when you find it, please let me know because I think the topic is fascinating!"},{"Title":"The Vastu Home: Harmonize Your Living Space with the Indian Feng Shui","review":"This interesting book provides a useful introduction to the Vastu tradition, which many have compared to feng shui. However, the photographs in this book demonstrate a great sense of style, color, and design. Designers and even architects will find something of use here."},{"Title":"Life Among the Apaches","review":"This book was one of the most sorry documents of American history. Not only was the author appointed translator without knowledge of either language or culture of the tribe, he was also totally inept and a complete idiot. He claimed to have compiled a &quot;complete&quot; dictionary of the apache language in one of his notebooks, while listing only some chinook words and distorted spanish terms with a residual vocabulary of Navajo hardly sufficient to sustain a &quot;me Tarzan - you Jane&quot;-conversation. However, I noticed this piece of totally superfluous self-aggrandizement to be the original source of Mark Twain's description of native awe before an eclipse as recreated almost verbatim in the &quot;Connecticut Yankee&quot;. If literature and/or history can be any worse, such examples must have eluded me. This is as bad as it gets."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"If you are looking for a page turner, this is the book to read. Lolita Files, stepped out in style with her debut novel. I really enjoyed the believable drama and look forward to reading more of Ms. Files books."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"This book was truly funny, I just couldn't put it down. It was the only book I've read in one day. I thought the part with Stefan in the bed was hilarious, I laugh my sides out.

Ms Files is definitely a good writer."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"&quot;Scenes&quot; was hilarious, I laughed out loud... However, I found it to be a little predictable, and a wee bit unrealistic... NYC is not the Babylon Ms. Files described when Misty and Reesy arrived in town...most of us do not park on the &quot;road&quot;, and you really can be outside after dark! And Honey, if you can find an affordable 2 bedroom apt, mid- town, with indoor parking, a doorman, and no CEO position...let me know!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"&quot;Scenes From A Sistah&quot; is one of the most entertaining books that I have had the recent pleasure to read. I can't remember how I initially heard about it (net??), but happened to run across it in a Border's Books, thought the title sounded familiar, was having one of those &quot;biorhythmically challenged&quot; days, and needed a pick-me-up; so, I picked it up, took it home and read it. I can't remember how many times I found myself laughing OUT LOUD, and couldn't wait to tell friends about it. There was so much in it that I could personally relate to and, in some cases, felt like I was reliving some of the events (ex. several job-related relocations). In fact, one of my friends is a producer of a daily African-American interests talk show, and I mentioned to him that he would probably want to contact the author about appearing on the show! I truly hope it is picked up for movie rights (and Ms. Files makes a TON OF MONEY from it) because I can't wait to see &quot;that Reesy girl&quot; in celluloid; she's a mess!! I can't wait for her next novel"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I mean, does that make it easy? Just pile them on and think that makes a good story? Not for this reader. I really have been waiting to read some LF books, b/c I used to see them all the time in the library I worked at in high school, but if this is what I have to look forward to, then I'll pass.I try to read a good mix of books by black authors. I mainly try to support newer or lesser known writers. Some I wish I'd never bought and others have been true gems. I was hoping I could find a decent series with LF's books, but this book has really turned me off.Firstly, the storyline was very thin and incredibly weak. The main character is not worthy of cheering on and her friend (who says all the typical stuff) is useless.The abuse storyline. I'm tired of reading garbage like this. I could see it coming a mile away. Misty's personality was pathetic. Truly.And what was with the no-life having friend that she just follows Misty wherever she goes? Come on.I really wish I could pinpoint the s/l but there really isn't one. Just a series of events and useless details. Come on, how many pages must be dedicated to your reluctance and eventual decision to shave your pubic hair?I've read books where the main characters' lives are chronicled and everything is a natural progression. So you expect all kinds of events and lessons learned, but this is just a big mess. I see most reviewers disagree with me, but I expected more."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I loved this book, Misty and Reesy are like some people I know.

I'm sure we all have friends like Misty &amp; Reesy. Misty is intelligent, career oriented, a self-starter who just doesn't seem to know anything when it comes to choosing the right man. Then we have Reesy bright, pro-black, always got something to say no matter what. These two come to understand what a real friendship is when Reesy starts to work for Misty and suddenly a secret of hers is discovered. It takes a big woman to do what Reesy did in order to save her best friends career. I enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Ms. Files knows exactly how to work it when it comes to writing a good novel. This book had me laughing and crying out loud. Her characters were two very strong women so unlike the stereo-typical heroines that I'm constantly reading about. The book flowed perfectly and her descriptive dialogue put me right at the scene. What I wouldn't do to have a best friend like Reesy! Can't wait to read the sequel."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I have read a lot of novels, mostly about the male/female relationships. This novel really focus on how a friendship should be. Misty and Reesy were the only children for their parents and they had a bond that most sister don't have. It was refreshing to read a novel that focused mainly on this and not relationship. These women were there for each other through thick and then, they had each others back when needed, and they broke each other down when needed. To be honest they keep one another grounded. I really enjoyed this book and I would suggest reading it, if you don't have a bestfriend now, when you finsh this book, you will want one."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"O.K., this is the best book I have read in a long time. I couldn't believe how wrapped up I became in the characters lives. I found a little bit of myself in each of them, which is what makes a great literary journey. I am a very critical reader and have a hard time sticking with a book that does not hook me by the 20th page. This book had me from page 2! I could not put it down! I purchased this along with 2 others (Casting the First Stone, Open House) because the excerpts were so enticing. This one was, by far, my favorite. I truly identified with the characters struggles.

Boy,was I wrong. This book had exciting events, interesting characters that I could relate to, lots of suprises and it was a lot of fun to read. I fell in love with both of the main characters and when I had finished reading it, I felt like I had lost two of my best friends. Lolita Files does an excellent job of writing a complete story that explains all aspects of the characters and their lives. The story line flows from one scene to another without effort. Each scene is fresh and new and as I finished one page, I couldnt wait to get to the next. I stumbled upon this book at a co-workers recommendation, but now that I am familiar with Ms. Files work, I will seek to read each and everything that she writes."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Lolita Files captures the spirit of the nineties. Her style is crisp and well-paced, and neither the characters nor their actions seem contrived for the sake of plot development. Any woman today can identify with Misty and Reesy's friendship, and with their career and relationship struggles.Attractive and single, Armistice \\"Misty\\" Fine represents most modern day women in search of the success that she feels can only be validated through a promising career and a romantic relationship. She, like so many women today, wants to please and be pleased, making her character as realistic as Coca-Cola and the girl next door.On the other hand, Teresa \\"Reesy\\" Snowden, Misty's best friend, refuses to be defined at any cost. She takes a real \\"cut off nose to spite face\\" approach to life and surprisingly enough, always lands on her feet. Reesy never bites her tongue even where her best friend is concerned, thus often hurting Misty's feelings, though loving her all the same.An excellent first novel, \\"Scenes from a Sistah\\" is a delightfully witty, yet poignant journey into the lives of two best friends, Misty and Reesy. Not only does the book explore their relationship as African-American women, but also delves into their relationships with men, parents and their careers. This is her first novel, but Files writes with an ease rare in today's novelists. Her style is sometimes funny, sometimes touching, always realistic. From Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta to New York, \\"Scenes from a Sistah\\" will hold your attention, tickle your funny bone and prompt some thinking about your own career, personal and romantic choices. From young sisters to mothers and grandmothers, this is a must-read!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Highly entertaining and enjoyable...although I couldn't believe sometimes how gullible Misty could be regarding men even though she was quite competent and professional regarding her career.

Even though she comes from very successful parents and is educated. Reesy keeps Misty from falling apart when her relationships come apart.Lolita made this a wonderful and enjoying journey into the lives of two unforgettable characters.

It is a story about a friendship that is everything a friendship should be. We all should be so lucky to find a friend that together we balance each other out.

This book was so good that I could not put it down. I basically finished reading it in one day. Whenever I'm in the bookstore, I make sure that I recommend it to at least one person before I leave. Even the guys will enjoy this one. So, if you don't already own a copy make sure and obtain one. I guarantee you will enjoy it.Lolita Files is truly a very gifted writer and a very inspiring person. I've had the pleasure of being in her presence on a couple of occasions and if she's anywhere near YOU, make sure you attend and get a chance to hear her read because she brings the characters to life with her voice, expressions, and attitudes so well that if you haven't read it you will and if you have, you'll read it again.

While I don't feel that all female African American authors should be compared to each other, I have to say that Lolita is hot (hot hot!) on Terry McMillan's heels. She has a natural, smooth storytelling style that draws the reader into the character's world with ease.I have only two questions for Lolita: 1) When is the movie going to be filmed? and 2) When, oh when, is your next novel being released?

I would recommend this book to all african american women."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Lolita Files you've definitely &quot;taken black literature&quot; to a new height with such a down-to-earth novel. Ressy and Misty shared a friendship that was &quot;truly untouchable&quot;. I could definitely relate to Ressy simply because I've encountered girlfriends that had similar characteristics which at the time I didn't really value their opinion(s) but later down the road I was glad I at least took the time to listen whether I wanted to or not. Even though at times I found Ressy to be quite offensive in terms of her choose of words but Misty was able to tolerate her. Sometimes you know you need that type of &quot;sister-to sister&quot; relationship in order to &quot;GET A WAKE UP CALL&quot; which makes you stop and refocus your priorities in life. As for their chose of men this is a whole different story. My only suggestion to Misty would've been you should have kicked Stefan to the curb way before the abuse occured. After all you desired better then him. He couldn't be compared to &quot;A BAG OF CHIPS.&quot; Because boyfriend had some &quot;deep rootted&quot; problems he needed to address. Need I say more? As for my Girl Ressy!! make sure you are always happy but not at the expense of men. I would highly recommend this novel to all &quot;SISTAHS OF COLOR&quot; AND PASS IT ON YOU WON'T REGRET THAT YOU DID!!."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"'Scenes from a Sistah', made you appreciate best friends. Though Reesy had a rough exterior, that was her defense mechanism, she was indeed a friend. Because of their different personalites, you wondered about the two of them being friends. But, the differences are what made the freindship so great. Misty was the stability Reesy needed, she was so volatile. But the love they had for each other is what made this book so good. I just finished reading 'Getting To The Good Part' so, I had to come back and do my review of 'Scenes'. The sequel 'GTTGP' is a must read, Lolita knows how to do a sequel. This is so good, Reesy almost out does herself, with a penmanship spun expertly by Ms Files."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I really enjoyed this book. On my way home from a long days work, I would relax with this book and lose myself from my surroundings. I will read this book over and over. I can'nt wait for the next book to come out."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"This book is a great testament to friendship. Even though Reesy and Misty were opposites in alot of regards (Misty was focused career-wise and a mess when it came to relationships and Reesy was flaky in regards to careers and tough as nails in relationships) I could definitely see how they really clicked. They always had each others backs. Their friendship/relationship reminds me of my relationship with friends that on the surface we may seem to be so different but when all is said and done we are always there for each other.I loved this book and will probably read it again.

Way to go Lolita. I've already bgun the next book. Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I must say that this is such a good book. Thank you Ms. Files. This book had me cracking up on the train to and from work. Living in NY it's just expected of you to laugh out loud, but at least I had a good reason. Reesy and Misty reminded me of me and my best friend. After reading this book I immediately sent it to her... That was a year ago, and now I have moved to another city and we just formed a book club and guess what our first selection is. We both don't mind reading this book and &quot;Getting to the Good Part&quot; again, we enjoyed it that much and know the members of our group will too. I highly suggest this book to anyone looking for a good laugh, good read, and some good ole times. Enjoy"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK.

I can't wait to read her next one, and the next one..."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Highly entertaining and enjoyable...although I couldn't believe sometimes how gullible Misty could be regarding men even though she was quite competent and professional regarding her career. This is a book that I recommend to others especially reading groups. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll get upset but you'll still want to read this book until the end."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I Enjoyed reading this book, it made me laugh out loud. I did not want it to end, but I felt good knowing I could pick up where I left off."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I bought the book and 24 hours later, I was finished. It was soooo good. I was grateful when homegirl got smacked at the end. It was such easy reading and I felt like I was always right there in the scene. Misty just needs to wake up about men. Reesy was my type of girl."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"THE CHARACTER STEFAN REALLY HAD SOME ISSUES TO DEAL WITH REGARDING HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS MOTHER.. THE TRUE MEANING OF FRIENDSHIP WAS SHOWN BETWEEN MISTY AND REESY.. THROUGH THICK AND THIN THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO STICK TOGETHER.. REESY WAS A TOUGH SISTAH AND WASN'T GOING TO LET ANYONE RUN OVER HER OR RUN HER LIFE. HOMEGIRL WAS IN CHARGE!! SHE WAS DETERMINE TO DO WHAT MADE REESY HAPPY..

CAN'T WAIT TO READ GETTING TO THE GOOD PART.."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Lolita Files captures the spirit of the nineties, thirtysomething woman in her debut novel Scenes From A Sistah.Attractive and single, Armistice &quot;Misty&quot; Fine represents most modern day women in search of the success that she feels can only be validated through a promising career and a romantic relationship. She, like so many women today, wants to please and be pleased, making her character as realistic as Coca-Cola and the girl next door.On the other hand, Teresa &quot;Reesy&quot; Snowden, Misty's best friend, refuses to be defined at any cost. She takes a real &quot;cut off nose to spite face&quot; approach to life and surprisingly enough, always lands on her feet. Reesy never bites her tongue even where her best friend is concerned, thus often hurting Misty's feelings, though loving her all the same.From the humorous and creative chapter titles to the true to life situations and episodes, Lolita Files sits quietly in the minds of most women telling our story to a tee!Scenes from a Sistah is filled with witty banter, explosive language, and vivid descriptions combined together for must read, can't put down novel. Ms. Lolita Files, You Go Girl"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"An excellent first novel, &quot;Scenes from a Sistah&quot; is a delightfully witty, yet poignant journey into the lives of two best friends, Misty and Reesy. Not only does the book explore their relationship as African-American women, but also delves into their relationships with men, parents and their careers. This is her first novel, but Files writes with an ease rare in today's novelists. Her style is sometimes funny, sometimes touching, always realistic. From Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta to New York, &quot;Scenes from a Sistah&quot; will hold your attention, tickle your funny bone and prompt some thinking about your own career, personal and romantic choices. From young sisters to mothers and grandmothers, this is a must-read"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Scenes from a Sistah is a novel that all women can appreciate. As a non African-American, I feel that I can appreciate this wonderful, brilliantly uplifting novel as well as anyone. Lolita Files has her finger firmly on the pulse of contemporary society. A literary star in the making"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Scenes from a Sistah is a down-to-earth, refreshing, and funny slice of the lives of two black women. Lolita Files had me laughing out loud and nodding in agreement on page after page. This is a great book"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"It is a bit cheesy, and the plot is questionable, but I was looking for a bathtub read and I got it. I consider myself a literary snob, but i must say I enjoyed the book, despite the black girl cliches. I did find reality in both the characters, and the stripping plot was realistic--God knows how many women keep that from their friends and family. It lacks depth and is the literary equivalent of bubble gum, but who cares? Buy it--and be entertained."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Aah, a refreshing BREAK(!) from all the McMillan hooplah. This book got my attention after my mother's co-worker lent it to her. Shoot, Mama wasn't about to read no book. So over the summer, I took it with me to my job as a nanny. I read it... around the same time I bought Disappearing Acts and found me a NEW sista-girlfriend. It was good. It was. In fact, I was laughing so much, I'm almost sure them kids was calling me crazy-- and they was on Ritalin! Here I am, two years later (still ain't got no real job, y'all) and I find myself at the Public lye-berry. The familiar colors on the cover caught my attention. I picked it up, took it home and read it over the course of a slow, lazy weekend. Ha! Take my advice: leave well enough alone. I felt like it was missing something at the end this time. I found myself being extremely judgemental- which I am not. If you want a good read and an even better laugh, indulge. Please do. Just... Don't read it twice. Go get the sequel, like I'm 'bout to do. peace."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"This book is wonderful. You must have it in your library. A tell of two women and their adventures. Laugh and cry, adventure some romance. I don't think this is a man bashing book because some men act like this and some women are with these men. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"If Terry Mc Millan is your favorite writer, run out and buy this. If you think Shaneska Jackson and Roslyn Mc Millan 'tell it like it is', run ... don't walk, to your favorite bookseller. This is definitely of that genre.From my standpoint, I should have taken a hint from the comments on the back of the jacket. One gent wrote that he carried it every where and couldn't put it down in the three weeks it took him to read it (I read it during a 4 hour plane ride ... in between snoozes). I will give you a couple more hints. The author spends an entire chapter talking about the woes of bikini and pubic hair. She spends almost another 1/2 chapter talking about some woman eating boogers (her own, of course) ! This type of writing is not my cup of tea though I am certain many find it hilarious and entertaining. This is definately 'pop fiction' ... not heady, not deep, not literature.All that aside, this is a story of a very strong friendship. Scenes from a Sistah is about two very different 'sistahs', their love for one another and how friendship endures some very bizarre scenarios. Ms. Files put forth a lot of effort and is now a published novelist. That deserves a tremendous amount of credit and best wishes for future success."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"This book was ok. its not a book that really stands out though i mean i even forgot i read it. but it was a book that was not that bad."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"This one is a good girl book and it will put you in the mood of sisterhood. Yes, they go through drama but don't all women? The situations are typical but how these friends deal with the situations is special. We all have had a friend that we can't deal with sometimes but we can't live without all the time."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Scenes From A Sistah was soooo good that I told a girl at work if she bought the book and didn't like it I would buy the book from her. Reesy reminded me of me when I was younger. I wasn't a stripper but sharp with the tongue. Misty reminds me of my best friend Carolyn. Career minded but tend to get in some bad relationships. Great book overall."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I just finished reading this book and I have to say, &quot;Hats off to Ms. Lolita Files!!&quot; This book was magnificent!! It kept me interested and thirsty for more. The characters, Misty and Reesy seemed so real that I felt as if I was there with them. I hated to see the book end. Unlike so many other books, it was not a 'rushed' ending, and it ended on a good note and not a fairy tale note!! I enjoyed this book from beginning to end, and I didn't want to put it down! I can't wait until Ms. Files' next book is published. I'll be first in line to purchase it!!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Lolita, you are wonderful! The book is excellent. YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT A GOOD LAUGH! Excellent story line of two friends and their trials and tribulations! I must say that I have yet to read a book this good. I could not put it down. I found myself reading out loud to my husband. The book is great! Reesy is really a trip! A girl after my own heart! I felt like I knew these two women and I could not get enough of their storyline. YOU GO! LOLITA!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Lolita Files is an excellent author. Her portrayal of two women and friendship is enlightening and positive. I found this book to be drama from the beginning to the end. Hilarious is also an adjective to describe this book. I read this book while riding the bicycle at the gym and I bust out laughing numerous times at the characters. I am definitely awaiting your next book!!!!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Lolita Files is one of the most talented new authors out here today. This novel is very witty and full of spirit. I found her characters realistic yet spontaneous. Lolita's in depth description made it seema as if I were watching a movie instead of reading. I applaud her debut attempt and I will definitely be at the stores for her sophmore book. Great work!!!!!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Hey GIRLFRIENDS, you must read!!! This book is humorous yet you will be able to relate to the two Sistahs. When I started reading it, I did not want to stop until finished. This was my first time reading Lolita Files work. Keep it up, girlfriend!!!!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"The book was refreshing and funny. I enjoyed the characters Misty and Reesy. Scenes from a Sistah reminded me, of a friend whom I have lost contact with and myself. I could relate to all of the happenings, celebrations and downfalls. Great book Ms. Files!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"This book had me cracking up. Both characters were a mess in good way. This is one of those book that you don't want to put down because you're dying to know whats happening next. Need a laugh, pick it up!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I could not stop laughing! I got this book from the library and finished it in 2 days!! I could not put it down. I recommended it to all my friends. The best in long time. I got one question...When's the next one coming out?"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Of course my initial response was this author just has to be numero uno. Why? Well, because I am a native of Ft.Lauderdale and I could relate to some of the places Ms. Files was referring to. This book was all of that and a then some!! I haven't read a book that kept me going in a while. She is a great writer and I enjoyed both of the characters. I felt like I could relate to some of the disappointments in black men that Misty was experiencing. Although, at first I did think that her and Theresa were kind of too close at first. But then I realized that they shared a special bond of sisterhood. I must say though that there is no way that I would've let my best friend live with me, let alone work as my assistant. Keep up the good work girl!!! I can't wait for your next novel."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"After I read this book, I forgot all about how &quot;Stella&quot; got her groove back! Lolita Files' characters, Misty and Reesy don't &quot;wait to exhale&quot; but draw us into their lives - in full force, with great detail. As a young black woman, I could really identify with this book, especially the 90's dating scene. I wanted a friend from TX to read it so much that I bought if for her, including the sequel &quot;Getting to the Good Part,&quot; which I'm reading right now. Now that I've discovered Lolita Files, I don't know who Terry M. is anymore; Lolita Files is 'da bomb !"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"&quot;Scenes from a Sistah&quot; is something that is known tobe fiction but in return it's nonfiction. In other words, this novelis true &amp; demostrates everything that actually happens in a &quot;Sistah's&quot; life. Reesy is someone I believe we all know, if it's not ourselves. I loved her, she was full of SPUNK!! Now, Misty (career wise) is where I would love to be. But the sista was totally clueless when it came to men. She reminds me of the saying, &quot; She got book sense, but no common sense&quot;. Now, that was MISTY!!! But over all I admired the friendship... the bonding between two sistahs!! This relationship really exist, it's true to the heart. Great Novel... a must read!!!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Misty Fine and Reesy Snowden show us what a 23yrs friendship is truly about. Lolita Files takes us through life with Misty in Scenes From A Sistah. Misty is great at managing her career and being in a decision making position. She has what it takes to make it in Corporate America. When it comes to her love life and getting what she wants and needs from a man she falls real short. Reesy, Misty's take no prisoners friend is the exact opposite, she wouldn't know tenor or professional stability if it jumped in her lap, but she has the man sense Misty need to capture the man she wants. These two friends show each other on numerous occassions that no matter what friends are friends. The bond they had for 23yrs shows in their actions.Lolita wrote the heck outta this story and Misty and Reesy made me envious of their friendship and yearn for a sistah friend of my own. If you think you have read a sistah friend book you have not until you read this one..."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I found this book to be very well written. The characters reminded me of myself as well as my close friends. The story line was realistic and well-developed and it's a definite page turner. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I am an avid reader of all books that are written by african american authors... but this book was really wonderful! I read the entire book in about 4 hours... I couldn't put it down. If you want to simply loose yourself into the real life trials and tribulations of real life sistahs... then this is the book for you! I just ordered &quot;getting to the good part....&quot; I can't wait!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"This book was so entertaining. I read it in less than a day, and that is counting a full day at work... I couldn't put it down. It was so good, and I just really would like to commend this author on her excellent job.. No part of this book disappointed, and I finished it feeling like I'd just had the best, juiciest conversation with a girlfriend that I hadn't seen in forever. Great job, and I can't WAIT to read Getting to The Good Part."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Scenes From A Sistah most definitely ranks up there with the greats. It is a story about a friendship that is everything a friendship should be. We all should be so lucky to find a friend that together we balance each other out. I love Misty's career mind and Reesy's ability to speak what's on her mind. They compliment each other because, one's weakness is the others strong points. This book was so good that I could not put it down. I basically finished reading it in one day. Whenever I'm in the bookstore, I make sure that I recommend it to at least one person before I leave. Even the guys will enjoy this one. So, if you don't already own a copy make sure and obtain one. I guarantee you will enjoy it.Lolita Files is truly a very gifted writer and a very inspiring person. I've had the pleasure of being in her presence on a couple of occasions and if she's anywhere near YOU, make sure you attend and get a chance to hear her read because she brings the characters to life with her voice, expressions, and attitudes so well that if you haven't read it you will and if you have, you'll read it again. She is most definitely one to watch.And if you read this Lolita, thanks for being yourself. You have most definitely inspired me. You are definitely a great asset to African American Readers and Inspiring Writers. I, along with many others, look forward to the next book"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Lolita Files is THE BEST! This book was so good, I read it twice. Then I went out and got the sequel. I didn't even know there was one until I saw an ad for it in Black Issues. I RAN out and got it. Now she's about to drop another book. I CAN'T WAIT. Eric Jerome Dickey is great, but Lolita Files is my FAVORITE."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I really, really enjoyed reading Lolita Files's Scenes From A Sistah. This girl can write! This was an excellent first novel, fast-paced and funny. I liked Misty, Reesy kind of got on my nerves, but they are a funny pair. I heard really good things about this book, and all of them were true. It held my attention, and had me cracking up laughing at times. I had to go right out and buy Getting to the Good Part, because I wanted to see what new adventures these ladies got themselves into this time. Files is a great storyteller with a funny, refreshing voice. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I have to say, that even though this book has been out for awhile, I just finished reading it. It was very fast pased and funny! The scenes and drama that unfolds reminds me of me and my best friend and the stuff we did back in the day..I'm glad Misty finally realized what a loser Stefan was. I did not like his character at all. He has some major issues he needs to deal with,and I would like to see more on him and his &quot;issues&quot; in another novel of his own. The suckling scene was hilarious...I could not stop laughing. If that would have happened to me, he would have had to go that night!Let's not even talk about Roman and his trifling self! I hope he gets what he desrves too!Very Entertaining and hilarious..would recommend it to anyone who enjoys good dialogue and a good sista girl laugh."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I had never heard of this author but after browsing through the library, I went ahead and got it. I'll tell you one thing--she's definitely not the typical female writer. She talks about crazy stuff like people eating boogers, razor bumps, bed wetting, and lap dances. I spent the same amount of time cringing as I did laughing. Two single, young black females move to three different states in search of love, careers, and satisfaction. Neither is searching for the same thing at the same time which helps them to give each other honest advice. I'm glad the author chose to tell the story from Misty's point of view though, because as entertained as I was by Reese, she was a little too extra for me to bond with. The only thing I didn't like was how the author kept calling Reese's dialect \\"ghetto talk\\", as if only ghetto residents speak the dialect. But other than that, this was a pretty funny, wild story and I thought Rick was a really cool boss."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I read this book some time ago and it was my first Lolita Files read. The characters of the two friends were drastically different and very visual. I enjoyed how Lolita seemed to let the characters direct the story. There were twists and turns that I did not expect. This book had me up at night trying to see what would be next in their adventurous life and where there life long friendship would go. Very enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"This book was an exceptional story of unconditional love and friendship. I was very pleased with this book and I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes to read. It was also very funny."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Oh my God, this book was soooo good! I never got around to reading it when it first came out, but I am so glad I finally did! This book kept me laughing and Reesy reminded me of my best friend with her in-you-face and blunt conversation! I HIGHLY recommend this one if you haven't read it! I luv'd it! After page 141 I was ripping the pages up to get to the end! This one is definitely a five star novel!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all times...I wish I had a bestfriend like Misty.I envy their relationship and finished the book in one day.I didn't want the book to end and I'm glad they told Reesy story in the sequel to this book."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Lolita Files offers a refreshing look at the trials and tribulations of two lifelong friends...Lolita's dose of humor offers a nice spin off of the ordinary &quot;sisterfriend&quot; story. ....what a treat!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I loved your books,they discribed my friend and I to a &quot;t&quot;. My friend doesn't read and she is the one who told me about your books. I knew I had to read them. since it hailed her interest. The reason why I'm writing is because, you ended the book with ressy riding off in the sunset with her honey. She also thinks she's having a baby,now who's is it,the white man or the black man. Lolita, I'm in suspense."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"LOVED IT!This book is very difficult to find.If you see one on the shelf at a bookstore or know someone who has a copy, you'd better GRAB it. This is a great book!I am a difficult person to please, so when I say it's great-BELIEVE IT!Well worth the money, if you know someone that has a copy-DON'T be ashamed to beg, it will be worth it!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I loved Ms. Files' sistah-like style. Until I read it year before last, I didn't know her style of writing was even in print! The story was a fast, entertaining, and enjoyable read for sheer entertainment. The sequel &quot;Gettin' to the...&quot; was even better! Funny and raw, it was all right with me! Ms. Files is favorite of mine and a definitely recommended writer in my book!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Misty \\"Miss Divine\\" Fine and Teresa \\"Reesy\\" Snowden are childhood sisterfriends who mature into beautiful women. They will amaze and amuse you as you travel through the scenes of their lives. You will want to holler, \\"cut\\", so that you can exhale and recover from laughing at the previous scene.While Reesy keeps you laughing and agreeing, \\"yeah girl\\", her friend, Misty, will evoke your sympathy and anger sometimes. Nevertheless, their friendship sustains each scene and will make you miss \\"your girl\\". Reesy is a racy and loyal friend... always there regardless of men that come:-) between her and Miss Divine. Reesy shares her practical (yet sometimes hardcore) advice with hopes of protecting Misty from heartache. Even when Misty listens but follows her heart, Reesy always comes in to help her pick up the pieces and move on. It's also fun how Reesy moves on with her.The novel portrays true friendship at its finest - in good times and bad. \\"A friend loves at all times.\\" (Proverbs 17:17)I'm also reading the sequel, \\"Getting to the Good Part\\" which is narrated by Reesy. The riotous laughs continue!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Miss Lolita, you know that this was one good book. I encourage all to go out a buy it TODAY! The characters were very believable and the plot flowed so smoothly that when the book ended, I couldn't believe I was done already. I found myself in Misty. She was ME alll over. So naive enough to think that Roman could only be with her for certain hours of the day, and then leave early in the mornings to go WORK-OUT. Yeah, right! And no weekends because he had to be this big brother/father-type figure for a child that he can't even remember the name of. That should have told her something right there. But of course, me/Misty, one and the same. But my best and most memorable moment was the bathroom scene, in which Reesy, while Misty is in the stall, encounters Roman's future sister-in-law. This has to be my favorite part of the book."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"What a terrific quick read. I felt compelled to review this title based upon my teenage daughter's response. I passed the book on to her as she prepares to enter college later this year. She admires and loves Misty's ability to climb the corporate ladder in spite of her inability to manage her personal relationships. I very much appreciate having read this book and look forward to Ms. Files' next book."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"The author goes into too much depth in some areas (e.g. the chapter about pubic hair) and not enough depth in other areas (e.g. the relationship between her fiance &amp; his mother). I may have enjoyed this book more if it were written in the form of a group of short stories as opposed to a novel. The book seemed to run out of steam and I got the impression that so did Ms. Files as the ending seemed weak."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I loved Scenes From A Sistah. It is an excellent read. Misty and Reesy are too funny. Especially Reesy. Ms. Files has defintely captured the true meaning of friendship in this book. IT IS HILLARIOUS!!!!. I especially loved the suckling scene. I could not stop laughing. Scenes From A Sistah reminds you of yourself and your girlfriends. Continued success to Ms. Files. I look forward to your next book. I hope to one day meet her. Maybe she will be coming to New York soon to do a booksigning."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Lolita, I could buy you lunch! I thought this book was soo good! I borrowed my sisters, but now I am buying it for my shelf! You and Sheneska Jackson are my Two favorites! This book shed some light on us sistah's with the &quot;untouchable&quot; attitude. This is a must read for anyone looking forward to moving to the &quot;Motherland&quot; (Meaning=ATLANTA) Thank You Ms Files, The book was truly great!!!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"From the moment I started reading this book (yesterday) I didn't want to put it down. But a girl's gotta eat right. I finished it today and all I can say is buy the book if you don't have it already. I feel like I know the characters. (Misty &amp; Reesy). Because the story was told in such a down-to-earth fashion. I'm waiting for your next book Lolita - You've got much flava girl! By the way I bought the book because of all the hair removal talk I'd been hearing. I started itching when misty shaved all the hair in five strokes. (wanna know - buy the book)."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I think she especially loved it cause she is ready to make her mark on the world and move all over the place like Misty &amp; Reesy trying to find her nook. I had read the book first and really enjoyed it which prompted me to share it with her and my other teenage daughter who also liked it but Jamilia was especially impressed with the boldness and spontaniety of the girl's ability to fit in wherever they put their feet down. The book was charming, witty, funny, and was hard to put down. Keep up the good works, we all look forward to reading whatever you come out with next."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Lolita Files definitely has a gift and it shows with her book, Scences... I found it particularly engaging and am anxious to read more of her work. Although some did'nt like the bikini scenes, I loved them! Includung scenes like that seemed to make the book more real and readable. Lolita, please continue to create and express yourself through your writing. You are very talented and I will be looking forward to your next project."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"A well paced, rapid, humorous novel dealing with the exploits of a pair of best friends as they go from city to city seeking love, success and happiness.I purchased the book for my wife, made the mistake of reading one page on the bus - couldn't put it down, finished it in two days. Humorous, down to earth and fast moving, this book is a good escape."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"THIS BOOK WAS THE BEST THAT I'VE READ IN A LONG TIME. IT RANKS UP THERE WITH TERRY McMILLAN WITHOUT A DOUBT. I CAN'T WAIT TO READ SOME MORE OF HER WORK!!!!!"},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Lolita's character's are fantastic. The sister waves her wand of wit and employs her passion for the pen and captures you from page one. At the end of the tale every reader will be feenin' for more words from Misty and Reesy, two ambitious, talented, and devilsih women (not in that order) that'll take us into a new millenium."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"Haven't I read this book, like, 50 times already? Upwardly mobile Black women with the looks, wit and material goods that any woman would kill for, living in relatively lavish conditions, working jobs that pay ludicrous amounts, but can't quite figure out the whole relationship thing, no? The only thing differentiating this from the other three hundred Black books on the market now just like it is that she opted to only use 2 women instead of the (stereo)typical 4. When I want to read Terri McMillan, I'll pick up \\"Waiting to Exhale\\".

I was disappointed that 3 women did not like the book at all. The other 9 loved it and 3 of the nine gave it a 5. I thought this book was great. I am even thinking of using it (in paper back) in my English 4 class because I believe it will stimulate excellent essays, discussions, and project. I also taught Waiting to Exhale, so your book should be ok. Some of the young women found Misty to be unbelievable, I was surprised. The older women also found her unbelievable. I thought I knew her.

She did a wonderful job of character development. You felt like you really KNEW the characters. It's much better that most fiction books dealing with releationships.

Lolita has a knack for writing witty dialogue and putting her characters in the most hilarious situations. Misty and Reesy reminded me of my best friend and me, which is probably why I liked this book so much.This sista is true talent and I am so happy to have come across her writing.

While I've been disappointed in her follow ups, this one is definitely Files best work. It chronicles the lives and antics of best friends Misty fine and Reesy Snowden.

The book follows their lives of the two sistahs as they city hop, with Reesy always following, as Misty finds a better job and life. If you buy this book, you have to purchase Getting to the Good Part and Tastes Like Chicken so that you can continue the story of the 2 BFF. Lolita is a good writer, especially in her earlier days, but appears to have gone a little Hollywood with her later works. If you want to read her better work, then this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Scenes From Sistah","review":"I thought this book was the most boring book I have ever read.

I was so taken with Lolita's journey into literature, I produced a radio profile that aired over WBAI-FM, Pacifica radio in New York, in December of 1997. I find her dialogue crisp and authentic. There is a plus in this read as it does not rip the Brothers apart as some Sister writers seem to (must) do. Her sincere love of literature as well as her respect for readers of the written word is almost unbelievable. God has blessed Lolita Files with a talent, and readers will be equally blessed for the experience of this read. I can hardly wait for the follow-up book - GETTING TO THE GOOD PART - which is written from Reecy's point of view. If one gets a chance to hear Lolita read live -- go.

Although it has only 48 pages, the brisk contents are packed with powerful stuff.According to the publisher, the ideas in the book were first presented to advertising students in 1939 & then published in 1965 - thus having stood the test of time. More importantly, the author, James Webb Young, was a driving force behind the creation of the modern advertising industry, and is one of advertising's most honored educators & practitioners.As the title suggests, the author outlines a simple, easy-to-use five-step approach to idea generation. He also explores the importance of making idea generation a vital part of everything you do.What I really like about this book is the author's principal premise: Ideas are just novel combinations of old elements, & we must keep thinking about them, which give order to new experiences!I strongly recommend you to buy & read it.

Yet this book (which was written in the 1940s for advertising people) is just as relevant to my work as it is to anyone else who is a knowledge worker. This little book is one of the simplest summaries of commonsense---and articulating common sense is this book's greatest virtue. The book lays out a five step process for generating novel and not-so-novel ideas, articulating them, and giving them a life of their own. There are no examples, no case studies, just crisply articulated common-sense that you can put to immediate use. Everything that he says is stuff that you likely already know, so this is not one of those books that talks the lofty talk about \\"retraining your mind\\" and such obscure, undoable things. The idea in this book that most resonated with me was his comment that novel ideas are simply unusual connections among things that already exist and you might already know. The book takes about an hour to read from cover to cover (and I'm not even a fast reader).Although Mr. Bernbach probably never intended this book for consumers like me in the scientific research profession, I'd bet my money that this little gem might be just as \\"duh\\" or \\"aha\\"-evoking to people in any other knowledge-intensive line of white-collar work. The only note of caution: This book was originally written in the 1940s and the gender bias (\\"the creative man,\\" \\"he\\") is pervasive throughout its 48 pages.If you are in a profession where your \\"wealth\\" is measured in intellectual output, this is some of the best seven dollars you can invest in your education.

The Foreword to the edition I have (published by Waking Lion Press in 2009) was provided by William Bernbach (1911-1982), one-time chairman and CEO of what was Doyle Dane Bernbach, then renowned for many of the greatest ads in the 20th century. The booklet's author, James Webb Young (1886-1973), added a \\"Prefatory Note\\" in 1960. His first publication, How To Become An Advertising Man (1963), focuses on core concepts that every ad practitioner and copywriter should know:o Knowledge of Propositionso Knowledge of Marketso Knowledge of Messageso Knowledge of Message Carrierso Knowledge of Trade Channelso Knowledge of How Advertising Workso Knowledge of The Specific SituationToday, these core concepts continue to provide the \\"basics\\" on which all effective marketing depends when attempting to create or increase demand for the given product and/or service and multi-media advertising is without doubt advertising's most powerful resource. However, for at least the past 75 years, everything begins with a compelling idea.In A Technique for Producing Ideas, Webb offers what he characterizes as a \\"simple, five-step formula anyone can use to be more creative in business and in life! \\" Although the process itself is indeed simple, completing it to achieve the given results is a wholly different matter. Webb's focus is on the process by which to generate ideas. \\"They appear just as suddenly above the surface of the mind [like a lovely atoll above the surface of a deep blue sea]; and with that same air of magic and unaccountability.

Years ago, too, I attended a great class through UCLA Extension on the Creative Process. Taught by a psychologist, he outlined over the course of weeks, what this book distills in a few pages. Not that I didn't like that class (I did, a lot), but reading a short book beats weeks in a classroom every time.The most important part of this process, as far as I can tell, is what I'd call the incubation period - where you take your focus off your problem or issue and just allow the creative process to work. That's really hard for many of us because we don't trust that this process CAN work or WILL work for us on our problem or issue. That strikes me as normal and human and yet, because I have a hard time with this too, rather sad in a way. One way I try to overcome this is to keep some sort of meditation habit in force which just helps me calm the part of my mind that doesn't believe in either the benevolence or at the very least, neutrality, of the universe. Which it seems to me, the creative process, is a big part of.This book closes with a truth - people reading this will be enthused at first and then not use the process. Oh, maybe once or twice, but over time they'll forget it. I agree with this, but I'm determined to be more active in inviting in the muse to help me creatively.

But pot somehow is a much bigger deal than anyone had thought, a world-wide obsession over a simple weed that millions find fun or useful, and others find perilous. So Brian Preston, a Canadian journalist, decided he would do a worldwide survey of the international marijuana scene. It was a perfect self-assignment: he likes vagabonding, and he likes getting stoned. The result, _Pot Planet: Adventures in Global Marijuana Culture_ (Grove Press) is a hilarious travelogue through smoke filled rooms, with a subtly serious message: \\"What's more likely to destroy the earth, pot or pollution? And there's a war on pot?\\"Preston is a dedicated journalist, or at least he loves his subject so much that he is happy to go to enormous lengths to investigate it. \\"For much of the research and most of the writing of this book, I was high on marijuana. Now then - it can't be _that_ amotivating.\\" He becomes a judge of the Cannabis Culture Cup, with the difficult task of rating all these strains, and more, in the categories of appearance, fragrance, texture, taste, aftertaste, and stone (and he remarks on the difficulties of evaluating that last category after you have already judged other entrants; he can't, like a wine taster, just spit it out). He has funny stories from all over. \\"If you want to score anywhere in Asia,\\" Preston advises, \\"just find a place where they're playing Bob Marley music.\\" In the town of Nimbin, Australia, there are \\"grass palaces,\\" houses paid for by pot cultivation: \\"They were hippies; now they're middle class.\\" One wants to franchise pot restaurants in the shape of a giant bong, the Big Bong Burger Bar. In Switzerland, searching out contacts, Preston asks a city employee, a tourist helper, \\"Do you know where I could by _hemp_ products around here? Like clothing and stuff?\\" She thinks a minute. \\"Hmmm. Hemp clothing... No... But we have three stores where you can buy grass!\\" In Morocco a shady tourist guide assures him about purportedly fine hashish, \\"Half a kilo, Brian! Very easy to hide in a suitcase for the flight home!\\" In Canada, backwoods growers have given death threats to those who wish to introduce hemp production for fiber, because of the fear that the low-stoning hemp will cross pollinate and ruin the intoxicant varieties.In every chapter, Preston shows that American politics have affected global marijuana in ways that not even the most rabidly anti-pot politician would favor. Naturally, Preston knows just what the US and the world ought to do with marijuana laws, but he usually withholds proselytization on the issue. He is an amusing writer with clever comparisons; a stoner holds in his toke so deeply that he eventually disgorges \\"a cloud of smoke huge and heavy enough to show up on a satellite weather shot.\\" He withholds most of his serious arguments until his last chapter, which is quite accurately titled \\"Pot Polemic.\\" And he has graceful ambivalence about what legality might bring, having seen a bit of it in Amsterdam, pushed like booze and tobacco: \\"Is this what legalization would be like? Would pot become just another consumer product, marketed like any other line of goods in Babylon?\\" Maybe there would be disadvantages, yes, but this book is indispensable for anyone who wants an amusing survey of the current world marijuana situation. Americans, especially, would do well to catch this bigger picture."},{"Title":"Pot Planet: Adventures in Global Marijuana Culture","review":"Brian Preston documents his travels as he encounters the people, places and events that make up the core of the world's modern cannabis culture.Preston's flobal ganja voyage begins in BC, at the first Cannabis Culture Cup in February 2000, held at Marc Emery's home on the Sunshine Coast. From there, Preston travels the world's weedy hotspots, sampling buds and meeting the locals in Nepal, Southeast Asia, Australia, England, Amsterdam, Morocco, BC, and the USA.Cannabis Culture readers will recognize many of the people who Preston encounters on his travels.

First you have 17 pictures dedicated to the story of Cinderella, starting with her humble beginnings to her wedding. There are pictures of Cinderella (of course), the Prince, the mice, etc. Then comes the reason I bought this coloring book: Sleeping Beauty. There are only 10 pictures for Briar Rose, the good faries, Prince Phillip, and the creatures of the woods. Third are 15 pictures for Snow While, the animals of the forest, the Prince, and the Dwarves. Then you have 10 pages dedicated to Belle, Beast, and the other inhabitants of the castle in Beauty and the Beast. Following those pages are 10 pages for Aladdin & Jasmine and after that there are 17 pages of images from the Little Mermaid. I like how the pictures follow a logical order of events. Even though Sleeping Beauty is by far my favourite princess, I love the attention paid to the other characters from great Disney films. I actually bought two copies of this book, one to color and the other to keep. Oh, and one last thing: the pages tear out! They're perforated for easy removal.

His book tends to focus heavily on the British troops, but he still delivers an exciting overview of the war with surprising gems of information that other, more exhaustive texts left out. It is this human element - as well as a thrilling tone and delivery - that makes Hastings' book more than another history text. It delivers all the energy and immediacy of real men and women who endured this conflict while honoring the broader picture with relevant and detailed material. Rely on Hastings for a broad overview told in a thrilling style with that all-important human element. David R. Bannon, Ph.D.; author \\"Race Against Evil.\\""},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"Fewer books probably have been written about the Korean War than any other war in American history (whether or not officially declared by Congress). That certainly is so if the metric is books per number of American deaths. In Korea, over 33,000 Americans were killed (about 60% of the death toll in Vietnam, where war was waged for three times as long). Why is the Korean War so little known? A fascinating question, and one which surely sticks in the craw of the thousands of still living veterans of the War.As I was among those inexcusably ignorant about the Korean War, I decided to embark on a modest self-education program, beginning with THE KOREAN WAR by Max Hastings. I am pleased to report that the book, even after twenty-five years, is an excellent general introduction to the War.Hastings is British, and his book certainly highlights British participation more than an American writer's probably would. But Hastings recognizes, and his book reflects, the vastly greater role of the United States in the prosecution of the War. (In contrast, Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries lost 1,263 killed. Of course, it also should be mentioned that the South Korean Army lost 415,000 killed and around two million non-combatant Koreans lost their lives.) The book covers well both the political and the military aspects of the war, although if a reader wants to focus on only one of those aspects, Hastings's book is not the one to get. In addition, Hastings's THE KOREAN WAR, interwoven as it is with many eyewitness accounts, is written in an easily readable almost journalistic fashion. Even so, it strikes me as responsible, balanced history.Here are some of the matters covered in Hastings's book:* North Korea, under its tyrannical strongman Kim Il Sun, was the aggressor. Neither the Soviet Union nor Russia was \\"behind\\" North Korea's invasion of the South, which ignited the War on June 25, 1950.* While the amphibious landing at Inchon was General MacArthur's masterstroke, one that may well have saved South Korea from Communist domination, overall MacArthur's performance in Korea was a sad and sorry final chapter of his public life. In his dealings with Truman and the Joint Chiefs of Staff he was guilty of gross insubordination. Among his irresponsible proposals was \\"to create an impassable boundary between the forces of communism and those of freedom by sowing a no-man's-land with radioactive waste.\\"* But it was not just MacArthur who considered waging nuclear war. There are many indications that the Administration and/or the Joint Chiefs of Staff seriously (or more seriously than we now would like to think) entertained the notion of employing nuclear weapons both against North Korea and against China.* In matters of diplomacy, intelligence, and military tactics and courage, the performance of the U.S. in Korea left much to be desired and might even be characterized as embarrassing. Individual instances are far too numerous to recite here, so I will limit myself to one. The failure of the U.S. to realize that the Chinese were prepared to respond in massive force to the drive to the Yalu River and North Korea's border with China in the fall of 1950 \\"reflected a contempt for intelligence [and] for the cardinal principles of military prudence seldom matched in twentieth-century warfare.\\" Indeed, it probably ranks close in arrant foolhardiness to Stalin's blinding himself to the imminence of Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941.* Syngman Rhee, our man in Seoul, was responsible for vast corruption and brutal atrocities. With the shameful backing of the U.S., he rendered the process of law virtually non-existent in Seoul. The only thing that can be said in his favor was that he was less ruthless than Kim Il Sung, his counterpart in Pyongyang. [Addendum (1 Nov. 2012): I have now read \\"The Korean War: A History\\" by Bruce Cumings, and among the points on which he differs from Max Hastings is this one in particular. With the benefit of information made public in the twenty-five years since Hastings wrote his book, including information released in South Korea after true democracy was introduced there in the 1990s, it seems clear that between 1945 and 1955 the South had even less regard for human life, including the lives of women and children, than did the North.]* The American sponsorship of an anti-democratic strongman is just one of many similarities that might be drawn between Korea and Vietnam. Again, I don't have room to list them. Suffice it to say that the experience in Korea should have provided many lessons applicable to Vietnam that, unfortunately, the U.S. either did not recognize or did not heed.* There were countless atrocities perpetrated by the armies on both sides during the Korean War. No doubt those committed by the Communists (and the South Koreans) were worse and more numerous than those committed by the U.S. Still, Americans tended to treat Koreans and Chinese as if they were near-animals. For example, \\"the evidence is overwhelming that conditions among the [POW camps run by Americans] would have been considered barbaric by, say, the inmates of a POW camp in Germany in 1943.\\"In this review, I have listed more negative aspects of the Korean War (from the Western/American perspective) than positive ones. One should not conclude from that, however, that Max Hastings, overall, has a condemnatory attitude towards the war. Indeed, he ends the book with this sentence: \\"If the Korean War was a frustrating, profoundly unsatisfactory experience, more than thirty-five years later it still seems a struggle that the West was utterly right to fight.\\""},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"Hastings's \\"The Korean War\\" is a fairly well written comprehensive book on the Korean War that while a decent book isn't without its shortfalls. The biggest complaint I have is what I feel is unfair criticism of the American fighting man based on a lazy, stereotypical, and simply inaccurate premise which is inexcusable in an academic of Hastings's stature. While not his central argument Hastings argues that the poor performance of the U.S. Army and specifically the infantry component can more or less be chalked up to the fact that the U.S. recruited the majority of its infantry from the lower rungs of American society. Though the overall performance of the U.S. Army prior to the arrival of General Ridgway can't be described as anything but sketchy at best, their later performance was certainly more the adequate. For example SLA Marshall mentions in his book \\"Pork Chop Hill\\" that during that battle of the 73 enlisted men he recommended for decoration for valor, ranging from a Bronze Star to a Medal of Honor, not one came from a family that could afford to send him to college. Additionally there is a high order of probability that the socioeconomic makeup of a typical Commonwealth battalion, units that he has nothing but praise for I might add, at that time were not all that different from that of an American battalion. Later in the book Hastings's contradicts his hypothesis again by praising the performance of the Chinese fighting man, who no doubt deserved praise, but who were by and large an army of uneducated illiterate peasants. That all being said I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a broad general history of the Korean War, though I must say that if possible I'd give this book 3 and half stars rather than the 4 I have it rated at."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"Some American reviewers of Max Hastings history of the war, titled _The Korean War_, complain of an evident bias towards British servicemen's experience in the Korean War. Well, he clearly states that this is the case in the book's foreword where Hastings writes: \\"Because I am an Englishman, I have devoted more space to the experience of British servicemen in Korea than their proportionate contribution to the struggle justifies. But it seems reasonable to suggest that a British officer's or private soldier's recollection of the experience of fighting the Chinese is no less valid, as a contribution to understanding what the war was like, than that of an American, a Canadian, an Australian, a Frenchman.\\" So if the book was thoroughly read, the reader was explicitly forewarned of what to expect. This is a book written by an Englishman on the Korean War which stresses the experience of British servicemen in that war and that's fair enough. I can't see why this should be a cause of criticism. Hastings deals fairly with all the belligerent parties to the war and is clear in his description of the war's course. If one wants to read a history of the American involvement in the Korean War in good detail and which stresses the American experience in that war, Clay Blair's _The Forgotten War: America in Korea 1950-1953_ is an excellent history and a great read."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"Not much has been written about the Korean War and this was very informative and explained in detail what occured.What wasn't included was the horrid treatment that the North Koreans perpetrated upon the South Korean peoples and American POW&#34;S."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"There's a reason why the Korean War has been mistakenly and tragically called a \\"forgotten war:\\" until Max Hastings book came out there was a dearth of literature on the war (though Roy Appleman's impressive collection still ranks as one of the better \\"immediate\\" accounts of the war). Hastings does a superb job of covering the conflict; however, I would agree with some of the reviewers that Hastings' book falls short in some areas--especially how UN and ROK forces turned the tide of the war in early 1951. I would have liked to have seen more about that, especially what happened in Hoengseong in February of 1951.

One could wish for greater clarity and a more organized structure, but those can be overlooked."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"This book was purchased for a Korean war veteran who is interested in researching his participation in this war. The book was in great condition and delivered in great time. Thanks!"},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"This book treats the war as military history, from the power struggle on the penninsula following the end of WWII to the final Armistice. The Korean War is a complicated conflict (you wouldn't know it from watching MASH though) which saw both sides surge north and south, with new belligerents getting involved in the war at different points and with a mix of WWII technology on the ground and Cold War technology in the skies. Max Hastings does an excellent job of putting the conflict together not just in terms of the \\"big picture\\" but also in the eyes of those who fought it."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"A good solid one volume account of the Korean war that gives the general reader a good insight into the war although I would prefer a work from an American perspective. Well worth the pricing on Amazon."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"An excellent one-volume treatment of the 'forgotten war'. Hastings tells the story of the bitter battles at close range on impossible terrain in brutal weather. Some 42,000 US soldiers died in just three years' fighting. The US attack into North Korea brought the Chinese into the war and caused serious consideration to be given to the use of The Bomb. Hastings' use of interviews with some two hundred veterans, from both sides, including Chinese, gives his work its veracity. He also covers the political battles at home, including the big one between Truman and the deluded megalomaniac MacArthur.An excellent addition to your history bookshelf."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"THE KOREAN WAR is the kind of introduction one wants. It recounts the history, but it also incites. The author, although supporting the aims of this first of &quot;limited&quot; wars, also never fails to give his own opinion about the US Armed Forces' conduct in the war. The account has several strong points.First, he uses interviews and personal memoirs, to make the account personable.Second, his narrative is fluid and exciting, even when he leaps between battlefield and briefing rooms.Third, he includes an excellent account of the post-WWII situation in Korea and Japan.Fourth, his discussion of MacArthur does not stoop to iconography.Hastings also refers to incidents and policies repeated in Vietnam which help to put the &quot;forgotten war&quot; in its proper context. He does not hesitate to criticize actions, such as the incidents on Goje Island, and is very fair in his portraits of commanders.This book is both a good introduction for students of Korean history and of military history."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"There are far too few single volume accounts of the Korean War and fewer still that are as engaging to read as this one. Max Hastings' writing style keeps the book interesting and the accounts of the earliest days of the conflict as American troops retreated to Pusan are some the most compelling in the book. Most of us (those with a desire to know) are familiar with Inchon, the drive to the Yalu, and Chosin, but not much has been written about the intial North Korean drive and the bruatlity of the conflict at that time. Hastings gives good attention to the plight of American Infantry regiments struggling to maintain unit cohesiveness as they are battered into the Pusan Perimeter. Many readers will find paralells to the experiences of American infantry during the first days of the Battle of the Bulge. Reading these accounts will make you proud of American servicemen and women. No doubt about it.Hastings at the end pays the United States quite a compliment in simply stating that American involvement in Korea was and continues to be the right thing to do. Nice to hear from a European writer."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"The Korean War has been termed, \\"the forgotten war\\" even though many books have been written about it. The war has not been \\"forgotten\\" by historians. Its only been forgotten by the general public mostly due to the fact that Hollywood hasn't made any blockbuster films on the War and it did not occur during a period of social ferment like Vietnam. Also, and not to be minimized, it happened a long time ago and did not come to a conclusive end. Because of that, for America anyhow, unprecedented outcome, it seemed not too many contemporaries wanted to talk about it. Because of its implications for future wars, in Vietnam, in Iraq and in Afghanistan, it should be the focus of considerable attention, but its not. Because of what happened to General MacArthur, echoed to some extent by the dismissal of General McChrystal, parallels should be drawn: they haven't. Because of the misapprehensions that lead to American support for the despotic and unpopular Rhee regime against a marginally more unpalatable North Korean alternative, implications for American support for the Diem regime (Vietnam), the Kharzai regime (Afghanistan) and maybe the Iraqi government (still being formed nearly a year after elections)should all be considered; they aren't. So, how does this book help? It anticipates the future by exposing the errors of the past like good histories are supposed to do but rarely deliver.Hastings delivers a lucid and compelling account of the events leading to the partition of the country along the 38th parallel (the current armistice line). He notes, without sarcasm, that the Russians actually fulfilled a promise to evacuate the country in accord with a diplomatic understanding. Hastings exposes the ideologically driven assumptions that inexorably lead the US to \\"intervene\\" in support of the Rhee regime, even though similar bad judgment resulted in the debacle for the Nationalist Government in China only a few short years beforehand. In phrases I can only term shocking in their lucidity, he expounds the catalogue of errors made with regard to the probability of Chinese intervention. The greater-than-trivial dalliance with the thought of using theater nuclear weapons is well worth noting even though it has been largely overlooked outside the ambit of academia. The genuinely larger-than-life MacArthur is given due scrutiny and General Ridgeway's role in \\"saving the bacon\\" is emphasized.No war history is complete without tales of sacrifice and depictions of bloody combat. Hastings, as always, excels in these areas and his ability to explain strategy and tactics is pretty close to unparalleled. Hastings also, as always, took the trouble to seek out and interview participants of all ranks (though access to the paranoid and reclusive North Koreans was, of course, highly restricted) and nicely interweaves their stories with the larger picture. He does not do this to the sometimes distracting extent of Martin Gilbert (his history of WW-II being an example) or Stephan Ambrose (many examples in his work); Hastings strikes the right balance.While this book is not the \\"definitive\\" history of the Korean War (Clay Blair's, \\"The Forgotten War\\" probably holds that title), it is the most readable and interesting account I have encountered. Even so, the insights pertaining to involvement in overseas conflicts Hastings draws are a compelling attraction of this book. The catalogue of frustrated ambitions; those of MacArthur (further establishing his legacy); those of Truman (\\"containing Communism\\"); those of Mao and Kim il-sung (establishing Communist hegemony on the Korean peninsula and dealing the capitalist \\"dogs\\" a death blow); those of the UN (being the \\"world's policemen\\") all foundered in Korea. Remembering how perilously close to the abyss we came is, however, the best reason for reading about the War and this book is the best introduction to that still unresolved event."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"Both World War II and the Vietnam War have a significant hold on the American psyche, but, for most people, the Korean War really is the \\"Forgotten War\\".In his examination of the war in this volume, Max Hastings looks at the causes of the conflict--1950 was only one year after China fell to communism, and East Asia was viewed by the West as a strategic location where freedom had to be preserved. Hastings takes the reader through the major events of the war, including the initial retreat, the landing at Inchon and subsequent drive to the Yalu, the entry of the Chinese into the war, and the bloody stalemate that led to the armistice and a permanently divided Korea.Hastings asserts that the war resulted in crippling costs for China, but also examines the effect of the war on the West, and demonstrates that aspects of the Vietnam War such as war weariness at home and breakdown of authority in military ranks were seen in the Korean War 15 years earlier. The author tells why some at the time thought that the possibility of a decisive outcome in the war was not possible.There is also a chapter on prisoners of war that examines the differences in how British and American soldiers responded to being POWs. This solid one-volume history of the Korean conflict closes with a chapter called \\"Hindsight\\", in which the author concludes that the West was right to fight in Korea."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"Hastings does an excellent job presenting the story of the Korean War in a readable manner. He tells many of the personal stories while keeping a big picture view. He also briefly describes Korea's place in the Cold War. Overall it was an interesting and entertaining historical work."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"This is the only book I have read on the Korean War. Another reviewer has suggested that this book is best viewed as a supplement to other, larger works. However, from the point of view of a novice, I found this book to be illuminating and interesting in its own right.To me, this was an even-handed account of the war, trying to give at least some rationale to the actions of all the countries involved , including the Chinese (I was naturally disappointed, being Canadian, about the lack of information on our troops, but it was a relatively small complement).All in all, I would call this an interesting analysis on this &quot;forgotten&quot; war. Recommended."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"I bought this book because I was researching some of the aspects of the Korean War and I needed more detail and because I had read some of Mr. hasting's other books and liked them. This effort was a mixed bag for me: on one hand, he has some excellent perspectives on the personalities and situations central to this war and he does a fine job of putting the reader into the story with first-person accounts from all sides of the conflict. On the other hand, Mr. Hastings treats some other portions with his prejudices fully in view and loses any pretense of objectivity in the process.There is also a large dollop of pomposity within these pages, some of which is Mr. Hastings' apparent disdain for Americans - or at least, some Americans. While there were some less-than-noteworthy performances by American forces in Korea, there were many more heroic and inspirational events by US soldiers that could have been included to give a more balanced and respectful tone. I do know from other reading and from discussing the war with Korean War veterans that the great majority of American troops fought nobly and selflessly, as they always have.Now - I have to also admit that Mr. Hastings' very first paragraph got my anger up. For some reason known only to him, he throws in an aside that the Vietnam War as an \\"ugly, sordid affair\\" or words to that effect. Well, isn't that a nice gratuitous slap from a bystander! So much for objectivity. I am a combat veteran of that war and I know that the young men I served with back then were some of the finest Americans I ever knew. Those who survived are still my best friends because I learned that they were men who would risk their lives for me and the other guys who fought alongside us. We had a vicious enemy to fight and nice people to protect and you really can't ask for more than that. We went to fight there because our country asked us to and we served very honorably, thank you, Mr. Hastings.Given that paragraph and the somewhat pedestrian content of this account, I'll invest my buying power in other historians from here on."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"Max Hastings' military history of the Korean war is based on over 200 interviews from soldiers, officials and civilians who lived the conflict first-hand. It is not only one of the finest English-language books on Korea, it rates as classic military history. The text rotates seamlessly from a strategic view of the war and its commanders to a company desperately trying to save South Korea from a brutally efficient offensive which nearly captured the whole peninsula.The author views the conflict as a necessary war, but this does nothing to color the multitude of tactical mistakes which cost the UN dearly. While most of the soldiers were American and Korean, there were also thirteen other nations represented (e.g. Britain, Canada, Turkey, Belgium, Australian). Of course, the North Koreans were aided by the Chinese and Soviets. Hastings could have included more from the political side of things in both UN headquarters and Washington. For anyone with even the slightest interest in the 'forgotten war,' reading Hastings gripping account of the hermit kingdom between 1950-1953 is a must."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed reading a British version of the political and military events leading to the UN mission in Korea. Understandably long on detail regarding the British brigade and the Commonwealth division, this twenty-year-old history provides useful insights into the motivations and concerns of a \\"junior partner\\" in coalition warfare (a la Operation Iraqi Freedom). Organized chronologically, this history explores general themes in each chapter (command structure, readiness, prisoners of war, etc.). This tends to make it an occasionally repetitious but still worthwhile read."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"Author Max Hastings does an excellent job of providing an overall military and political history of the Korean War.

This book is highly recommended for anyone trying to understand this \\"Forgotten War.\\""},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"They call Korea the \\"forgotten war\\", even though over 33,000 U.S. soldiers were killed in this horrifically short three year span. The conflict for the Korean peninsula is most likely forgotten because it is the most misunderstood of all U.S. conflicts. It arose from the still smoldering ashes of World War II, at a time when many Americans were just nicely adjusting to a life free of strife and death. The people were not ready to make another commitment to bloodshed and most, simply looked away.Max Hastings provides an excellent work discussing the complex history of the Korean War. He not only gives excellent detail and historical insight into battles and other facets of military history, but he also discusses the global ramifications of the war. For example, Hastings discusses the global political instability following World War II, and how this lead to the U.S. policy of containment.Through out the book, Hastings provided equal parts political history and military history.

Hastings gives us a good overview of all of the different aspects of the war from a fairly unbiased view. Not too little info or to much. Solid Overview."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"I thought it was a pretty good book. Hastings describes some of the American shortcomings as illuminated by declassified British military memos describing poor discipline during the early part of the war. He also describes the air war, including what was like to be stationed out in the Pacific servicing and arming B-29's.As a draftee I spent some time in South Korea in 1971 and 1972. It's good to have some more background on what went on there during the war."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"I bought this book because I wanted an unbiased view of the conflict. I did not want to read about only the positive aspects of the war from an American perspective. The American military, as well as the Truman Administration, made some pretty big blunders during this war and should be rightfully criticized. That said, I was surprised (and a little annoyed) to read how Mr. Hastings portrayed the American role. If one did not have much prior knowledge of the Korean War, they would walk away with the impression that the Americans were a bunch of blundering fools after reading this book. The British and Commonwealth troops are held high on a pedestal, marvelling at how incompetent their American conterparts are. The Commonwealth and other U.N. troops should be praised for their contribution to the war effort. The British & Belgian stand at the Imjim is of legend. Unfortunately, Mr. Hastings does this at the expense of the American contribution. I was hoping for an unbiased version of the war but did not receive it in this book."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"I'll start first with the positive parts of this work. First although the author is British and is biased towards them he does bring to light a lot about the British part of the Korean war. I enjoyed reading about it and learnd lots of knew bits of info from these sections. There are several sections where obscured bits of I never heard of (I read a lot on the Korean war) came to my attention. Tracking them down I found wonderful new avenues of history that I had not known before.Now the Salt,First, if one was to ever quote the author's opinion to any U.S. Marine to his/her face it would only be advisable if you want to go on an all liquid diet for the next six months. Not only is the analysis lacking in evidence, the conclusions are vague and there is a complete lack of respect for those that were there. The Cherry being that he critizes Lt. General Chusty Puller without ever citing any evedence. Don't dissrespect the man that all U.S. Marines pray to in boot camp if you have no evidence.Second, He holds all blame for the disasters of the first year on the enlisted, lower level officers, and U.S. This is just atroucious. Lack of material, training, experience, knowledge, and logistics are not the fault of enlisted or officers of the rank of rank of major or lower. Also the U.S. paid for virtualy all of the war, if you don't like what you got why did your government not pitch in? Mr. Hastings fails to acknowledge this except to provide excuses that Britain didn't have the money and then blame the U.S. for forcing them into the war. Leaving the question of how the U.S. did this unanswered.Finally the complete exoneration of the higher U.S. military command, (i.e. McCarthur, and Almond) and critisim of Truman and the democratically elected government made me as I read the book feel like I was reading a propaganda pamphlet from some totalitarian government. I know that future works such as \\"The Coldest War\\" remove the myth that Mr. Hastings promoted, that the highest command was unaware of what was occuring on the ground, (they ignored their intel). I acknowledge that this is an older work, but it is not an excuse, especially since the extreme historical quality of the rest of the work is so high. It leaves me a bit shaken in the author's analysis."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"Having read this book after several others on the subject I found it a little disappointing. It's obvious that the author is British because a larger portion of the book is devoted to the British units than is probably justified considering they comprised only a small fraction of the UN forces. For a more insightful and comprehensive rendition of the events of the Korean War, I recommend &quot;Korea: The Untold Story of the War&quot; by Joseph C Goulden."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"The Korean WarMax HastingsThe title of this book is quite self-explanatory as it describes the topic of the book. This historical recount is of the Korean War and the issues faced by all the sides in the fighting. Hastings conveys the topic of this book and his thesis through constant repetition of the fact that there were a large amount of issues with the American and Allied military forces as they tried to crush Communist intervention in South Korea. The thesis of this book is along the lines of the fact that the United States and their allies were so unprepared for this war that during the course of the fighting it always seemed as though the North Koreans and the Russians would doubtlessly come out victorious. The morale of the soldiers was crushed as more and more waves of aggressors came through to knock back the front until the Americans were nearly cornered at the Southern tip of South Korea. This book was a brilliant recount of the actions that took place during the Korean War and there was definitely a need for this book. Personally, I learned more from this book than I did from any other reading that I have done on the Korean War.Max Hasting held to a very strict factual interpretation of the war throughout the entirety of this novel. He is constantly using quotes from majors and commanders about how the U.S. reacted to certain actions and how the Allied forces along with the United States decided how to make the next move. The bulk of this book is quotations and factual evidence while the reader is left to work through it and provide their own commentary on every statistic and every quotation. Hasting spoke mainly from the side of the United States and their allies against the North Koreans and Communism. He never exhibited the vast view of the United States for the Communist nations that were fighting alongside Korea. He often spoke of South Korea and how citizens acted when they were first attacked but he rarely includes a quote from a North Korea unless it was a major leader of the battle. This one-sidedness creates an obvious bias involving this novel and the situation that the North Koreans were in during the period. Hastings spends most of his time on the South Koreans and their allies while very often speaking in detail of the feelings of the Communist North Korean soldiers and citizens. He uses very few tables and maps but when they are inserted they are very helpful in an understanding of the text. For example, when he was describing how the North Koreans were destroying the Pusan Perimeter he included a map of Korea and all the cities and landmarks that were included in his description of the battling taking part during the section. In the middle of the book Hastings includes a section roughly ten or fifteen pages long that is completely filled with pictures and captions. This layout is slightly confusing because you must refer to the middle of the book whenever you need to look up a picture in order to try and understand the situation more thoroughly. On the other hand, when you reach this section is serves as a nice break to the heavy, historical reading. The reader can now look through the pictures at a leisurely pace as he/she prepares to continue to read the second half of the novel. To an untrained reader, this can be a very challenging book to understand. There is very little commentary and reading this is very comparable to reading a textbook. It is packed with information and at times it is quite hard to work your way through the mass of information. Hastings is by no means padding or confusing the text, he is simply giving the reader a raw representation of the data rather than an easily understandable version with many explanations. The reader of this book is forced to learn as they read in order to keep up with all the action taking place.In my eyes, I found this book to be very successful in describing the confusing the Korean War. Due to the quick start to this fighting, the allies had to create an armed forces as quickly as possible and it gave them a huge disadvantage when they were trying to fight off the relentless Communist attacks. With a rag-tag group of soldiers who had little to no time in training before going out to battle, the anti-Communist nations had to exhibit unending willpower to keep the Communists from breaking down the barriers and unremittingly pouring into helpless South Korea. This is a very difficult book to understand simply because of all the information that needed to be conveyed to the reader. Hastings conveyed this important information brilliantly and thoroughly persuaded me into believing that the United States and their Allies were totally right to defend South Korea from the relentless Communists. I suggest that you do not read this book if you are not willing to spend time searching through the text to find out what is happening. With all the information that Hastings includes it is nearly impossible to read every page only once and still get a firm grasp of the subject. Despite the difficulty of this book, I believe that it was very powerful and that it really gave me a view into what the Korean War was like. I would have never guessed how confusing and uncontrolled all the fighting was and how close the United States was to defeat on so many occasions. I suggest that the reader of this book look into the topic of the Korean War prior to reading the actual book so that they can already have a background of the topic before the heavy reading begins. I did not do this and I definitely regret making that bad decision as it doubtlessly hindered my ability to smoothly comprehend the novel as it was being unfolded in front of me."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"A smoothly readable, nicely paced overview of the Korean war. Hastings is one of the best at narrative history."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"Let me first say that I recommend this book as a good one volume overview of the Korean War. Hastings does a fine job of weaving together the political, strategic and tactical elements of the war. The writing is of high quality, not overly bogged down in military minutia, but enough detail to provide a general education of the conflict. And, it is presented in an entertaining way that will keep the readers' interest.Having said this, I found myself becomming more and more irritated by one thing: Hastings' apparent British bias. Some would say that this is expected from a British author, but I don't think that should matter. I don't doubt the accuracy of the information he chose to present in his book, but an author must be selective in what information to include and what not to include when fitting the history of a war into 300 odd pages. It seemed to me that the author was looking for aspects of the war where he could compare the British in a favorable light specifically against the Americans. It comes across as a kind of petty competition bourn out of some kind of apparent inferiority complex.Maybe this is just my own American bias seeping into things, but I tend to be pretty fair in accepting the American shortfalls and mistakes when reading about history involving my country. I don't dismiss the American failures and blunders in the war, and I think the author was right to describe them. It was just the method by which he would describe American shortcommings in a way that would compare them to the \\"enlightened\\" perspective of the British. This seemed little \\"fishy\\" to me.If you can deal with the above, you should find the book to be well-written general overview of the Korean War.

New research into masacres and other gashtly incidents shows us both sides were equally nasty.Another weakness with the book is that it doesn't get into why communism in north korea was so succesfull. This would be a very interesting chapter, particularly if he made a bigger effort to see things from the side of ordinary people.Not a bad book, and I'm glad I have it, but I will have to pick up another to get a more balanced view of events."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"The US provided Chiang with many weapons to fight both Japanese and Communists.

They seem to have lost about eight times as many people as the US did in this war! Yet Hastings is slightly too admiring of their performance in the Korean War. To me they just got lucky they got their hands on US weapons formerly owned by Chiang Kai-shek."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"The interpretations of the Korean War are varied and numberalmost as many as the pages that have been devoted to the conflict'shistory. The Korean War is an attempt by the British author MaxHastings to paint a portrait of the war, focusing upon some human and military aspects less familiar to readers on both sides of the Atlantic. From the outset, Hastings does not purport to give a comprehensive account of the war and cites the works of David Rees (Korea: The Limited War, New York, 1964) and Bruce Cumings (Origins of the Korean War, New Jersey, 1981) as the best in these categories. The author also professes his belief in the rightness of the American commitment to Korea in 1950. One of the more interesting passages in the Korean War is the author's coverage of the Inchon operation. Hastings defends the decision of General MacArthur to maintain X Corps as a separate tactical unit from Eighth Army: ... there was an entirely legitimate case for placing the conduct of the Inchon landing in hands other than those of General Walton Walker. MacArthur well knew the low morale that existed in Eighth Army headquarters.... [Although] Walker had conducted a stubborn defense of Pusan.... there was grave reason to doubt his ability now to lead the sort of imaginative and dynamic operation MacArthur planned. MacArthur considered, and rejected, the possibility of relieving him [Walker] of his command.... MacArthur's compromise was to entrust the amphibious operation to Almond. The author's argument is plausible, but he fails to cite his references. One of the strong points of the Korean War is the author's analysis ofthe Chinese and their intervention in the war. Hastings visited Peking while researching this book and incorporates the oral histories gained from interviewing veterans of the People's Liberation Army. He succeeds in using this material (although his journalistic, vice scholarly use of oral history gives the book a spurious creditability) in supporting his main thrust regarding the Chinese; that patriotism, not Communism, drove their intervention. The Chinese viewed the naval blockade of Formosa as a threat to their sovereignty; the Chinese sought the liberation of Taiwan and now equated the attainment of this goal with the defeat of the United States. Additionally, the Chinese refused to remain idle with the approach of foreign troops towards their border: Throughout the Korean War, Washington persistently sought the communist ideological logic behind Chinese actions. It might have been more profitable to consider instead historic Chinese nationalistic logic. Korea had provided the springboard for the Japanese invasion of Manchuria only a generation before. As the Americans drove north after smashing Kim Il Sung's armies in September 1950, Peking was appalled by the imminent prospect of an American imperialist army on the Yalu. (p. 134) Hastings also refutes the belief by the United States that the Chinese were acting in concert with the Soviet Union. The Russians regretted the North Korean's invasion and wished to distance themselves from Korea; thus, the Chinese acted unilaterally Hastings, to his credit, also gives ample analysis of the misjudgments of the Communists. The Chinese, after their initial success in late 1950, were led into the same trap as the United States after Inchon: they allowed their military success to change their original political goals. However limited the war aims of the Chinese in November 1950, there is no doubt that their early triumphs opened up, in the eyes of Peking, illusory visions of absolute military victory in Korea, of an all-embracing Communist success. Hastings argues correctly that the Chinese would have greatly boosted their own prestige had they sought a negotiated end to the struggle after the winter of 1950. Nevertheless, his argument that China lost a prime opportunity to gain a seat in the United Nations by not negotiating a truce after 1950 is a weak one. Although the United States wished to downplay their support of Chiang and Nationalist China, they were far from formally recognizing the Communists. Another area receiving little attention elsewhere is the intelligence-gathering operations in Korea. Hastings boldly asserts that \\"the Korean War put the CIA on the map\\". The United States already possessed a growing hunger for information on their chief enemies; the Communists. They were prepared to seize upon any means in which to gain more knowledge and Korea provided an ideal opportunity. The author chronicles the buildup of the Central Intelligence Agency, beginning with the appointment of Bedell Smith as its first director. The CIA launched numerous operations in attempt to learn more of the Communists and their intentions in Korea. Hastings concludes, \\"it is difficult to judge that its [the CIA's] operations remotely justified the scale of resources it eventually deployed or the lives that were squandered in its name.\\" Hastings does add that the initial errors made by the CIA in Korea resulted in a better intelligence gathering effort in Vietnam. The author makes sparing use of maps, but does provide a sufficient number to keep the reader oriented. Hastings also includes a helpful chronology of the war and a listing of the military assistance provided by each member of the United Nations in the appendix. Although Hastings may draw criticism for devoting an inordinate amount of attention to Britain's involvement in Korea, his argument that a \\"British officer's or private soldier's recollection of the experience of fighting the Chinese in Korea is no less valid ... than that of an American\\" is legitimate. To his credit, Hastings gives fair treatment to all parties by incorporating interviews with Americans, Chinese, South Koreans, and soldiers from other participating UN armies. Overall Hastings presents some valid arguments and his writing style is good. As the editor of the Daily Telegraph in London, Hastings writes with a more journalistic than scholarly style and sometimes lacks the in-depth analysis to carry some of his arguments to completion. Nevertheless, his work still has value among the sociopolitical literature on the war. I would recommend this book as supplemental reading to those already possessing a solid understanding of the war."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"British Historian Max Hasting's gives the &quot;forgotten war&quot; the kind of good overall one volume treatment that it deserves. For some reason, Korea has just never registered with Americans the way World War Two or Vietnam has. But the stakes were high as America rushed its untrained Pacific army from Japan to the Korean peninsula in a desperate attempt to forestall a communist takeover of the South in 1950. The heroism of those first soldiers cannot be understated. Hastings captures the whole saga of the war as a horrible tragedy and as the first test of the West's determination to literally fight the spread of communism. Ultimately, as Hastings points out, the sacrifice of the allied troops was not in vain. That democracy exists today in South Korea is a testement to those who fought and died to preserve the country's freedom."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"First, let me clear a reader's confusions. The Chinese Army fights with not only American Army but also UN Troops. If you can include the casualty of ROK, British, Turkish and some other country's armies, I am quite sure you can draw a different conclusion. Second, the Chinese Army didn't get too many US weapons formerly owned by Chiang Kai-shek. Most of them used .31-caliber rifle, which was used by Japanese in 1930's and totally out of date. You can find this information from a lot of photographs on both sides.Korean War is a forgotten war in USA and some kind of forgotten by younger generation in China. There are a lot of books and photographs introducing this war on both sides. So far, this book is the best book I have seen about Korean War from the West. The writer is objective, unbiased to describe the cause of the war, the battle in the war and the prisoner on both sides. He incorporates American soldiers, Chinese soldiers and British Soldiers into his book, which gives readers a vivid image of War. His clear writing, objective and informative narrative of the war make his work the best book of Korean War for almost twenty years. This is a classic book deserve to read and keep, if you are big fan of Korean War. If you just want to browse the history, I strongly recommend a website: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_war, which can give you objective, unbiased information."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"It has always been a bit surprising to me that of the war's America has been involved in over the last century, it seems that the Korean War has always gotten so little attention. After all, two superpowers met in battle, it was the communists against us in a very hot war. Nuclear war was a very real possibility and the violence of the conflict was far higher then any other conflict except World War Two. We were responding to an invasion of a free and democratic country. Yet it gets little to no mention in our history books and public discourse.There are a lot of very interesting and one would say dramatic military events that took place in this war. The brutal winter losses at Chosin, the Inchon landing, the drive to Yalu, all of which are recounted in the book in a very engaging way. Not only does the author give you the facts and overview of the battles, but he also does a good job at retelling the stories of the common soldier. He seemed to have talked to people on all sides of the conflict in order to gain a unique view into what it was like for them as well as us. Overall I enjoyed the book. It gave me a very easy to read overview of the war. He covered big picture items well and really got into the battle details to make the book exciting at times."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"This is a top rate book. The interviews with actual participants in the Korean War make the conflict personal and real. Most interesting are the conversations with the Chinese. Max Hasting's coverage of the 3rd People's Liberation Army involvement in the war is very well done. Between the depth of the coverage of the 1950-51 winter campaign and the intensity of the personal interviews, it's possible to really connect with the people who were there. The book is very well researched. It is presented fairly and the issues all sides bring to the conflict are brough to light. This is not easy reading though and the reality of some of the subject matter (executions of civilians, etc.) is troublesome."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"Max Hastings has achieved one of the most difficult feats in writing a good survey history about a particular event. That is, Hastings was able to cover the Korean War well from the political, diplomatic, social, and military aspects.In addition to this, Hastings was able to bring in a very personal feel to the drama by including touching accounts of the war from a wide range of people including American, British, Korean, and Chinese soldiers; and the people of Korea who suffered very dearly.I found especially gripping and well constructed, the epic U.S. retreat to the Pusan Perimeter and the stunning counterstroke at Inchon. As an American, I found the heroic British battle with the Chinese at Imjin welcome to my limited knowledge of English military contributions.Hastings also illustrates quite well how the U.S. and China were both and at varying times close to total victory, and how the failure to achieve total victory put themselves in a worse postion diplomatically. (i.e. the U.N. push to the Yalu that failed in the fall of 1950, and the Chinese advance to the 38th Parallel in the winter of 1950-51.)Hastings also shows just how different General MacArthur's strategic thinking on the war was from both Washington and London. Also interesting is the author's exploration into the typical poor moral within the U.N. ranks resulting from the frustration of having to fight a limited war in a cold-inhospitable place.Anyone looking for a good one volume compact history of the Korean War should buy this book."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"I read this book when it was first published in hardback and I found it to be well written and easy to read. It offers a complete overview of the war including the contributions of all nations involved. An enjoyable book from this British historian which covers all aspects of this forgotten war. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"British Author Max Hastings, author of Armageddon and the Falklands War, has written another solid historical treatise on the oft forgotten Korean War. His past work as a newspaper writer allows him to reach the reader in a clear, comprehensive manner that is easy to read. Hastings does not bog you down in excrutiating detail as some historians are wont to do.Hastings has done a knock up job incorporating the experience of not only the Americans, but the UN soldiers from Great Britain and Canada and the Chinese Communist soldiers as well. This is a side of the war that is rarely told, and brings new insight into the battle strategy and tenacious fighting that accompanied the Chinese entry over the Yalu.Also covered are the naval and air campaigns and a solid analysis of the overall strategy of both sides. This is a great book for those looking to learn more about the Korean War, or to history buffs who wish to learn more about the war from a perspective other than the American one."},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"This is an excellent starting point for a study of the Korean War (but certainly not a &quot;sole source.&quot;) I grew up during the Viet Nam era and remember questioning how our government and military could have been so incompetent -- how so many lives could have been wasted for no apparent gain.I purchased Max Hastings' book after realizing that I knew very little about the Korean Was (except what I had read in William Manchester's &quot;American Caesar&quot; or in the biograpies of Harry S Truman by David McCullough and Alonzo Hamby). After reading this work, I now find it difficult to understand how the US government could NOT have looked back on this first attempt at a &quot;limited war&quot; and their total misunderstanding of Asian cultures and avoided Viet Nam altogether.Why did I find this book heartbreaking? The descriptions of the humiliating collapse and retreats of the US Army -- only five years after victory in WWII.Why disturbing? Why has this war been &quot;forgotten&quot;? How could the lessons learned here not be applied to Viet Nam? Why has it taken so long for veterans of this conflict to receive (belated) recognition? And just how close did the US come to using nuclear weapons?"},{"Title":"THE KOREAN WAR","review":"The Korean War took the world by surprise when, in the morning of June 25 1950, thousands of North Korean troops came crashing across the 38th parallel separating the two Koreas. The ensuing war would come to pit the American -led United Nations against North Korea and communist China . In this well researched work, Max Hastings looks not only at the conflict itself but also its origins and its often forgotten lessons. Hastings writes of a United States that was thoroughly unprepared for a war of this type, with near disasterous results. In the end, the consequences of the mistakes on both sides would prolong the conflict , cost millions of lives and left the Korean peninsula devastated. However the conclusion drawn from the book is one that the American effort in Korea, though flawed, was indeed very necessary and ultimately not in vain."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"In Sense and Sensible the storyline dwells on the two elder sisters of the Dashwood family, Elinor and Mariane. Elinor is always in control of her emotions and is governed primarily by prudence (sense). Her younger sister, Marianne, is an emotional whirlwind whose sensibilities dictate that those who do not evidence wholly encompassing emotions are without them entirely. As in Pride &amp; Prejudice, the family home of the Dashwoods has been willed to another member of the family not in the immediate nuclear family. In Pride &amp; Prejudice, the home was entailed to Mr. Collins, a distant cousin. Where there was only an overshadowing of the loss of the estate in that book, in Sense &amp; Sensibility, the house is actually lost to the half brother whose wife, a Ferrar, not only talks her husband out of the generous support to his half sisters that he promised (albeit vaguely) his dying father but makes life in general unpleasant for the Dashwood ladies until they find a situation with a cousin, John Middleton. Part of the unpleasantness surrounds an apparent but unprofessed affection of her brother, Edward Ferrars, for the eldest Dashwood, Elinor.It would seem that the move has quashed the supposed attraction, leaving Elinor attempting to contain her disappointment. Marianne meanwhile strikes up an intense relationship with equally extroverted Willoughby. When Willoughby suddenly disappears, the two girls come together to support each other emotionally through a storm of discoveries, pleasant and unpleasant.Sense and Sensibility develops into its own independent storyline after many similarities with Pride &amp; Prejudice. Although this novel holds its own and is an enjoyable book, I still feel that Pride &amp; Prejudice is its superior in pace, story line and general feel. Sense came out well before Pride and it almost feels that the same idea is being worked out in both - an idea that got clearer and was better communicated in Pride. Pride had a much more natural (believable) feeling to the events where Sense does require a little suspension of disbelief in some of the contrivances to get to a happy ending (specifically referring to the actions of Robert Ferrar). If you liked Pride and want more Austen, this is your book. If you are choosing between the two, choose Pride ... than come back for this one."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Since enough people have reviewed the novel's plot itself, I'm writing instead about the formatting of this particular (Kindle) version of the book. I liked the illustrations, though they came only at the beginning of each chapter. There definitely could have been more. As to this version's formatting, it was pretty bad. Line's were frequently unintentionally cut off, making the dialogue difficult to read. Also, as a stickler for grammar, I was frustrated with the mistakes in the book, which I believe are due to the publisher's mistakes (I've read other versions and have never noticed it). For example, words are misspelled and punctuation is missing - very annoying. I realize this version only cost me 99 cents, but I was still aggravated while reading."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Although SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is not Jane Austen's best novel, it is nonetheless a major novel, with the author's then-young talent in full display. Its publication in 1811 marked Austen as a huge literary talent, and its significance reverberates even today as contemporary readers re-discover the works of this author so adept at uncovering the foibles of nineteenth century aristocracy.The title refers to the two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, one of whom (Elinor) embraces practicality and restraint while the other (Marianne) gives her whole heart to every endeavor. When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother's wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Their characters, albeit wildly different in their approaches to life, are impeccably honest and intelligent - and their suitors take notice. Elinor falls in love with the shy, awkward Edward, while Marianne's affections are lavished on the dashing hunter Willoughby. As in all Austen's books, love and marriage don't come easily, as affections aren't always returned and social jockeying sometimes takes precedence to true love. In an interestingly twist, the end of this novel brings into question which sister represents which part of the title.SENSE AND SENSIBILITY only hints at the social skewering Austen would use to such great effect in her later novels, and the humor here is only occasional and slight, as this novel adopts a generally serious tone. Parody is largely limited to the gossipy Mrs. Jenkins, who jumps to wild conclusions about situations she knows nothing about. Though arranged marriage and true love figure prominently in all of Austen's novels, this novel focuses almost exclusivity on the prospects of the two main characters, making it less complex than the novels that followed. Reserved Elinor and exuberant Marianne are expertly drawn, with Edward, Willoughby, and Colonel Brandon (whose lovesick hopes for Marianne are dashed again and again) also engaging creations. Except for the first page or two where the circumstances of the Dashwoods are set up through a series of deaths and relations, possibly causing some confusion, this novel is exceedingly easy to follow for contemporary readers.This novel is an excellent introduction to Jane Austen's works because of its relative simplicity (though readers should not dismiss it as simple) and the use of typical themes and social situations. Book clubs and students might want to explore the influence of money on nineteenth century British society as well as the meaning of the title as it applies to both the sisters and the other characters. It is also interesting to note both the helplessness and the extraordinary power of women in different circumstances.Even though this is not Austen's best novel, I could not take away a single star because it is such a delightful book. I highly recommend this novel for all readers. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This is my second Kindle purchase of S&S.

I have a nice collection going and prefer her above all others. She gives clear distinction to each character and her dramatizations are perfectly pitched. I highly recommend listening to the unabridged versions as so much of Jane's stories end up on the cutting room floor otherwise.

I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY chronicles the young lives of two sisters, spirited Marianne and the more stable Elinor. After being driven away from home by their step-brother and his wife, the Dashwood family (Mrs. Dashwood, Marianne, Elinor, and younger sister Margaret) settles down in a small cottage in the countryside.Each sister proceeds to fall in love in her unique way: Elinor quietly and seriously loves somewhat-awkward Edward, while Marianne impetuously and passionately gives her heart to the dashing Willoughby. As with most of Austen's works, disparity in social class and inconsistencies in personality cause the lovers turmoil.Austen uses some of the satirical techniques that are so prevalent of her other works. While not as funny as her other satires, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY presents some characters' absurdities quite well.When I read this at the age of 14 or so, I did not enjoy it nearly as much. Older readers will like the subtle humor that Austen invariably includes in her work.Overall, a good introduction to the classic work of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Austen's S&S follows the same line of experience that all of her other books seem to follow, down to the family of sisters and the problems of proper behavior and good connections. But like a truly masterful artist, she can write, essentially, the same story over and over again and still have it be exciting and interesting for all readers. This is a book that can be appreciated by anyone over the 6th grade, and possibly younger. It is a classic that should be a part of any avid reader's repetoire."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"&quot;Sense and Sensibility,&quot; Jane Austen's first published novel (1811), tells the intertwined stories of two contrasting sisters, the lively, passionate, impulsive Marianne and the reserved, self-disciplined, dutiful Elinor. Both experience love, heartache, and eventual happiness in marriage, and both have their beliefs and value systems tested. A host of memorable, comic minor characters combine with the principal heroines and heroes to develop a tale that is both lively and thought provoking, humorous and psychologically astute. Anyone who has ever struggled with conflicts between spontaneity and caution, heart and head, can identify with the central characters of this novel.This edition of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; includes a number of helpful supplementary materials that enhance the reader's understanding and appreciation of the novel. Excerpts from contemporary texts clarify the historical context of the terms \\"sense\\" and \\"sensibility.\\" Among the works included are selections from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther,&quot; a classic example of the novel of sensibility, and Maria Edgeworth's &quot;Letters of Julia and Caroline,&quot; an earlier novel of contrasting female characters, in this case two friends, one of whom is sensible and the other romantic and impractical. The edition also includes the whole of Jane Austen's &quot;Love and Freindship&quot; (sic), a hilarious parody of sentimental fiction written when Austen was fourteen. Besides background materials, the volume includes four essays from recent critics that represent a range of different interpretations of the novel.Finally, the introduction provides useful biographical and historical information and outlines a variety of critical approaches to the novel: some critics believe Elinor is clearly the favored sister and the sense she embodies the preferred value system; some critics by contrast believe the novel either consciously or unconsciously betrays sympathy for Marianne and the sensibility she represents; and other critics believe the novel advocates a middle ground between sense and sensibility, according to which both sisters need to abandon aspects of their initial beliefs and adopt attitudes and behaviors associated with the other sibling. &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; has sometimes been criticized for being too didactic and formulaic, but those who read the novel along with the various background, critical, and introductory essays in this volume should discover a work that is richly complex, ambiguous, and many-sided in its exploration of the competing values of emotion and reason, spontaneity and restraint, and personal fulfillment versus duty to others."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was the first Jane Austen novel to achieve publication. Its reception was just sufficient to open the way for the publication of more of her novels, and the next to be published was \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". It has been a matter of speculation ever since whether, if nothing other than \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" had been published, Jane Austen would be remembered today.Those who believe this novel would not have sustained her reputation offer several reasons. They cite a lack of comic characters, a lack of male characters who excite interest or stimulate the imagination, an overabundance of unmemorable minor characters, and prose that is sometimes too heavily overworked.Those who believe this novel could alone preserve Jane Austen's fame produce different arguments. They cite the depiction of the two sisters Elinor and Marianne and their approximation to the concepts of sense and sensibility, the famous passage near the beginning in which the wife of John Dashwood, the sisters' half brother, pares down the deathbed promise her husband made to his father to provide financial support to John's half-sisters, and to Jane Austen's detached but involved, good-humored but stern narrative stance.Having re-read the novel recently for the umpteenth time, I could see the merit in all these arguments. Nevertheless the reading experience held me enthralled. Accounting for this is difficult. I read hundreds of pages in which women talk about men. I read of a world where every quality, every characteristic, every manner is put in little boxes, clearly labeled, and arranged in order from desirable to base. These things do not usually appeal to me. Ultimately, I believe it is Jane Austen the storyteller that casts the spell. My sense and sensibility are alike spellbound.Readers who like to refer to film or television adaptations to help their reading of the classics, will benefit from seeing a 1995 version of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" adapted, scripted and starring the English actress Emma Thompson."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Several well-spaced readings of this novel during a long life have not yet enabled me to tell what happens in it. There is a superb early chapter in which Elinor and Marianne's sister-in-law pares away the direction expressed by her dying father-in-law that his son share his inheritance with his half-sisters and their mother. Jane Austen manages this almost as well as Shakespeare has Goneril and Regan stripping King Lear of his \\"retinue of an hundred knights\\". Then towards the end of the novel, when Elinor keeps vigil at her gravely ill sister's bedside, a horseman arrives who turns out to be the very last person she expected. Between these memorable events, try as I might, I cannot distinguish between most of the numerous female and the few aloof, mysterious and unpredictable male characters, neither can I sort out how they are interacting.What delights me, however, on every page is Jane Austen's prose. Every sentence is carefully fitted into its place, every word connotes its precise meaning, every adjective such as \\"affable\\" and \\"agreeable\\" carrying a specific ranking in a scale of values.In today's parlance, I suppose I would say that the plot and the characters lack the edge that is so sharp and memorable in other of Jane Austen's novels."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility was published in 1811 when Jane Austen was just 36 years old, and only 2 years before the publication of Pride and Prejudice. In the span of such a short time, and almost 200 years ago from today, Jane Austen produced two timeless classics. I find it bitterly ironic that in almost every case, a classic is known by the whole world over - celebrated, written about, studied, discussed in painstaking details in a classroom, read aloud in packed lecture halls and admired by masses - yet the creator of it all is spared this knowledge of success.Sense and Sensibility's characters add richness and color to the story, where the central theme revolves around two sisters, opposite in character and ideals, both in mild struggle with the life choices afforded to them because of their situation, their connections, and their small fortune. The Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marrianne, live with Mrs. Dashwood, their mother and younger sister, Margaret. When Mr. Dashwood dies, he leaves the decision of their care in the hands of his son, John. John has never played the role of a compassionate step-brother to his father's other family but he is not vindictive or evil. His wife Fanny is. The Dashwoods are politely and slowly forced out of their beloved home in Norwood, as John is persuaded out of any kindness that Fanny found appropriate for their living situation. The compassionate cousin of Mrs. Dashwood, Sir John Middleton, offers the family to live in a small cottage, Barton Park, for as long as they shall like.The sense of duty and responsibility from Elinor is unparalleled. When she learns that Lucy is secretly engaged to the love of her life, Edward, she is stunned and saddened when the terrible news is confirmed as true. We do not see a single outburst of anger, frustration, disappointment from Elinor's lips or thoughts. She continues to care for Marianne's deep wounds over Willoughby and does not mention a word of her own loss. For four months, she is resilient and silent to even Marianne, for she has promised Lucy to keep the secret for her. How she endures it all is a testament to her character. She exerts herself to be strong, and act with dignity even at the expense of her own happiness.Perhaps it is ironic that Elinor who is the sensible one with such measured approach to her desires is in the end united with the true love of her life, Edward - while Marianne, who is the sensitive, emotional, passionate, idealistic one, is rejected by Willoughby, suffers greatly in love, and is at last united with Colonel Brandon, whom she neither liked nor respected earlier in the story. Is Austen telling us that it is better to be sensitive or sensible, or that both will do as they may, and life will happen all around us, and we shall never choose our destiny - rather, it chooses us?Whatever the answer may be, Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors of all time and I can't get enough of her!

Her brutally sarcastic observations of the British upper class reduce her antagonists to sniveling school children who cry and grovel and simper their way through life behind a thin veil of dignity, a veil gleefully ripped open by Austen.From her opinions of parents:\\"...a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow anything...\\"to the value of children:\\"On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party, by way of provision for discourse. In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for of course every body differed, and every body was astonished at the opinion of others.\\"Austen constructs a tantalising slaughterhouse of a book, inside which she adorns her hooks with a dazzling array of conceited, deceitful and shameless characters, few of whom escape her witty blade. All this however is not to say the novel is bereft of heart. As the title suggests, the central theme is the conflict and reconciliation between heart and mind, exemplified respectively in Marianne and Elinor, both of whom are endearing characters in their own ways, despite their flaws. It is this respect, no matter how faint, that Austen shows her characters that elevates the story above a satirical denunciation of her society and allows the reader to lose themselves in her narrative and become attached to her players.The overall flaw for me, were the happy endings handed out like charity flyers, though the fact that everybody gets one - from her most hated of villains to the most saintly of maidens, somewhat tempers the sacchariferousness. Sense and Sensibility was an utter pleasure to read - and surprisingly enjoyable when read side by side with Game of Thrones Book 3 - A Storm of Swords. When the clumsy fantasy writing made me cringe too much I could switch back to the succulent eloquence of Austen, and when sitting around in parlours reading the subtext behind eyebrow lifts became a little tedious, I could flip back to sex and bloodshed. Unfortunately due to the size differences in the books, I was only 44% of the way into Game of Thrones when I finished Sense and Sensibility and was forced to endure another six hundred pages of undiluted lumbering nerd prose."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"had not read this book since school days , its a joy to read , and one gets a real feel for the times when women were dependent on their men folk , not allowed to own property in their own right , and a good marriage was the aim"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Love Jane Austin.

That's not a criticism, merely an opinion. And wherever one thinks this falls in the Austen cannon, everyone should read S&S.; Because even when Austen is not at her best, she's is much better than most 19th century authors. There is the humor and romance one comes to expect in a JA yarn, however here it is not so finely honed. Also, there are no minor characters of the caliber of Lady Catherine de Bourgh or Mr. Collins. However, most novels don't have minor characters as compelling, so again chalk this up as observation.The one rub I do have with the plot is Elinor's love for Edward Ferrars. Frankly, Edward is more than a bit of a drip, and it is hard to imagine him inspiring love much less devotion. A bit more believable but still odd is Marianne's transformation (after recovering from death's door because of a broken heart). Once truly, madly, deeply in love with Willoughby, after a period of convalescence and introspection she transfers her affections to the not-it-the-least alike Col. Brandon. It's rather pat, and though plausible, it is just barely so.It is a vast improvement over Northanger Abbey, JA's earliest work; showing the writer to be well on her way to the style and substance of her later masterpieces."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Jane Austen has a way of writing that pulls you in, or at least for me.Sense and Sensibility is about two sister struggling through the trials of relationships, and doing their best to keep their senses.

I saw many copies of this book, but this one caught my eye."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Since I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice so much, I thought I would follow up with Austen's first book Sense and Sensibility. Sadly disappointing. Although Austen's excellent writing style is evident here in her first attempt, the plot is maudlin and predictable. Two sisters, one beautiful, sweet, and trusting and the other more prosaic in appearance, but wise beyond her 19 years (if this sounds a lot like P & P it is because it is) alternate their time between the rural English countryside and cosmopolitan London. The more comely of the two is enamored with a dashing chap who turns out to be a cad. Dumped unceremoniously by said cad, she proceeds to mope and weep through 150 pages. A good smack to the chops would do her a world of good, but sadly never happens. In the end every thing works out, more or less, in a contrived and unbelievable manner and every one lives happily ever after.Most interesting aspect of the book is the description of British customs, class distinctions and the courting ritual. Also, it is remarkable how little has changed in the English language in the 200 years since this book was written. Austen is a superb stylist, but beyond the fascinating historical descriptions of the British upper classes, circa 1790, there is little there here(to paraphrase Gertrude Stein's description of Oakland, California)."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I used to wonder why so many people preferred Pride and Prejudice over Sense and Sensibility. What differences were dynamic enough to make so many people sway? I read the novel and was intrigued, yet not as much as I was when reading Pride and Prejudice.Sense and Sensibility is a delightful story with characters easy to fall in love with. You automatically root for Elinor at the drop of a hat, and though we prefer to think of Marianne as someone completely different from ourselves, we resist reproaching her and root for her instead. Though I wouldn't call it Austen's best, this book is a great way to pass time, especially on a shaded porch swing in a drizzle."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"In SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, Jane Austen begins in her first novel what for her was to be her life long concern: what is the proper role that society should take in the relationship between men and women? In this novel at least, her response is that potential lovers must strike a balance between accepting the limitations upon romance imposed by a society that was ruled by a complex web of social, political, and legal restrictions and rejecting or at least tactfully ignoring those restrictions and thus incurring the wrath of an outraged society that does not easily suffer its laws flouted. In her later novels, Austen implies that wit may be a leavening agent (as in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE) that may succeed where pure sense comes up short or raw emotion may be used (as in PERSUASION) for the same purpose.Unlike in her later novels, Austen divides her heroine into two psychologically different young women. There is Elinor Dashwood, who possesses sense in abundance, and then there is her sister Marianne, who cultivates sensibility. In the context of 18th century English genteel society \\"sense\\" refers not to what we would call today as common sense but the unspoken assumption that single women realize that they do not live in a cultural vacuum. The rules concerning the legal distribution of inherited property, the social rules concerning who may dance with whom at approved balls, and the need to marry \\"upward\\" all interlocked to place a velvet-gloved bear hug on women who had some very real and serious decisions to make concerning marriage if they did not want to end up as the next generation's spinster aunt. There is Marianne Dashwood, who is more than willing to make such daunting choices not based on the sense that guides her sister but on the trashy and sensational pulp romance novels of the day. Where Elinor falls in love with Edward Ferrars, a man of honor, if not of the hidden type, she makes her choice based on premises of which society could approve. Where Marianne has an infatuation with the roguish John Willoughby, a man with clear character flaws, she makes her choice based on her own artificially heightened sensibility of dime-store romance books. The basic thrust of the novel is that both sisters slowly and painfully grow to accept that a life based solely on the one or the other philosophy is unworkable. Austen implies that there is a golden middle, albeit one which probably is more closely allied to sense than to sensibility.In SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, Jane Austen limits her view of the often convoluted knots of human relationships into a deceptively smooth and flattened perspective in a manner that would slowly change in her later books to include a more realistic, if not more necessarily complex vision that would allow women and men to interact in a forthright way of which even an entrenched society might approve. Though SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is not Austen's most popular book, it clearly shows in a restricted way the limits that her culture placed on the rights of women to call their own shots."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is a book that describes the adventures of falling in love in the 19th century. Love back then wasn't as simple a thing as falling in love today is. Women and men had to abide by the rules their society presented- marrying based on money and status- as the main characters of this book had to do.The book follows sisters Elinor Dashwood, a sensible young woman who does not let her emotions rule her behavior, and Marianne Dashwood, a person who exaggerates and acts on her many emotions constantly. Their journey starts off when their father dies and they are forced to move out to the country to live on a very small allowance. At their new home, they meet a numerous amount of people who turn their life into a whirlwind. Willoughby, a suave and prominent young man, steals the attention of Marianne and an old love of Elinor's returns. Both of these relationships turn out differently than anyone can expect, through many twists and turns.This is a wonderful book that holds your attention through the end. The beginning pages that describe different relations, deaths, and monetary concerns were difficult to follow, as well as some of the different situations throughout the book. But Jane Austins ability to portray the hardships, and results, that both of these sisters had to endure, through different situations of love in the unruly 19th century, was without compare."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"If you are not interested in 19th century society and the roles of women, this story is not for you. The plot is excellent, with many unexpected twists and turns, but the way in which Austen goes about presenting this dramatic story is occasionally hard to follow. Although her descriptions of society in the 19th century are very interesting, they are different than society today, so they are sometimes difficult to understand.Austen presents the roles of women in 19th century society in a new and interesting way. In her book, women were expected to stay at home with the children, and they were not even offered the option of working out of the home. The women in the novel longed only to fall in love, get married, and have children. If they did not get married, they employed themselves in matching younger women with eligible men.The love stories are very intriguing as well. Elinor loves Edward, but hardly shows it, while Marianne falls in love with Willoughby and, through her actions, announces it to the town. Both eventually reach a happy medium where Elinor learns that, in order to win Edward, she has to show her emotions more. Marianne, on the other hand, realizes that she needs to be a little more reserved with her emotions.Overall this is a very interesting book though the language is sometimes hard to follow."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Perhaps the negatives of Jane Austen is the dated quality of the words she used. But, when one accompanies reading with a dictionary, she becomes a thoroughly charming author. I read Jane Austen first in the 8th grade, and found it difficult to follow, and difficult to understand the humor. After the 10th grade, a student gave a lecture on Irony and Seven Common Uses as Seen in Jane Austen's Three Most Famous Novels. After hearing this, I came to a new appreciation. Not light reading, it is the type of book that can be read over and over, and enjoyed more as the years go by. I finished it for the fourth time three days ago, and still find myself dreaming, writing, and even speaking in the cautious and conscious turn of phrase that Jane Austen can so well suspend. While not a book for a younger generation, it is definitely the kind of book that should and will be read. Not, however, as sintilating as her future novels, and not as humorous as Emma or Pride and Prejudice. A good starting point to get into reading British Literature."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"The truth is...I cannot esteem it as well as I should like. It can't be explained in entirety, but I find the novel noticeably lack-luster after reading Austen's other outstanding novels. A plethora of secondary characters and sub-plots choke out a lot of the brilliance of its main characters. This is a rather surprising realization for me, being an avid Austen fan - but it is spoken with all honesty. Nevertheless, even though it is not Austen's best written work, it is still a very amiable novel and a nice light read for any classics buff."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I was pretty dissapointed when I read Sense and Sensibility because I had already read Pride and Prejudice and loved it so much that when I read S&amp;S I found it rather long and un-eventful. All the scenes were dragged out and a lot the characters were boring and vain. Pride and Prejudice would have to be the best book I've ever read, it's witty, smart and enjoyable and it's heroin Elizabeth is someone that everyone can releate to whereas Ellinor is quite pompous and boring. I wish S&amp;S had more of a storyline like the other Jane Austen books because I truly love her books but having said that S&amp;S is still a very good book and I'd recomend it for all Jane Austen fans. I thought the movie was very well made but a bit too long like the book but I enjoyed Kate Winslet's performance as Marianne, I think she played the role very well."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I thought that after all these years I might as well pitch in and give my two cents worth in regard to one of my favorite authors. The plot has been well covered with these reviews and others, and even if they had not, you would have had to almost spent your life living under a rock not to be aware, so I certainly will not beat it to death here.Briefly though, this is the story of two sisters of the Dashwood family, who find themselves in a state of reduced circumstances upon the death of their father; a plight not uncommon during that era we know as Regency England. This is the story of Emma Dashwood and her sister Marianne, the relationship between the two sisters, their family, friends, neighbors, and most importantly, possible suitors. The story is told mostly through the eyes of Emma (sense?...I wonder), but through her eyes we get a wonderful picture of some very unforgettable characters. Note: If you watch very closely, you will see these same characters amongst us even to this day! More about this later.Now, for one of my pet peeves; most of the members of the reading Western World will tell you that this is Austen's first novel and it is not her best work, or one reason or another. Now being something of a semi-cultural barbarian, I have a problem with this statement. While I will admit that Austen's later works are some of the best turned out in the English language, I do strongly feel that it is quite unfair to compare and contrast this work, Sense and Sensibility, with her later works. Had this been the only novel Ms Austen had ever written, she still would have been listed with the literary greats on this work along. It has all of the elements that her later works include; the insight to human nature, the subtle humor, the fantastic dialog, the complicated relationships, the unfortunate conditions many young ladies of that class suffered during this period of time and the raw emotions that are so understated in each and every line of her work. I hate to beat dead horses, but the dialog in this work is along with the read!I take my peevishness further in noting that many refer to the situations, manners, mannerisms, attitudes and situations as being typically of those of only this period on English history. As far as I can tell, most, if not all, of the situations encountered by the Dashwood sisters are with us even to this day and are merely cloaked in different clothing. Emotions are emotions are timeless and what was true then, is true now, the truth just manifests itself a bit differently now than it did then. We all want love, security, understanding and companionship; have since time began and I suspect we will until time ends. Not all that much has changed. I also strongly feel that if you feel that there is not a definite class system in existence today, as there was at the time this novel was written, then you well may be missing something. It may no be a blatant now as then, but it certainly is alive and well even to this day.Now all that being said, the bottom line is that this one fine bit of writing; a timeless bit of writing and the reader will certainly be much richer for having read it, and as a matter of fact, it does not hurt to give this one, along with Austen's other works, multiple readings over the years. There is much we can learn here. I've often told people that they should read at least one of Jane Austen's books each year just to keep in the front of their minds what writing is all about. And for goodness sakes, I agree fully that there have been some very fine film adaptations of this work over the years and I certainly do recommend that you see them (I personally love several of them), but READ the book also! You are missing out on a real treat if you do not.This review was of the Penquin Classic edition, one of quite a number of editions I have laying around the house. Between my wife and myself, the get quite a workout...I do not know what I would do with out good old Penquin. I will review other editions, as there are some that are excellent, while other not so great and it does make a difference you know.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Austen's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" concentrates upon life in the Dashwood family and the relationship of two sisters, particularly in reference to the amorous events in their lives transpiring over the course of a year or so. The younger sister, Marianne, represents \\"sense,\\" as she views and lives life in a romantic, sensual, and dramatic manner, while Elinor, representing \\"sensibility,\\" is more reserved in her expressions of feeling, and her pragmatic, moral way of making decisions. While treating one other, at times, with brutal honesty, attacking the other for who they are not, each eventually learns that there is a deep love between them. Additionally, the sisters learn that there is something of value in the dominant characteristics of the other's personality, and this works to positive effect for the love lives of both as time passes.Austen paints a picture of early nineteenth century England, especially with a focus on the position of women, who were largely dependent on marriage for their survival. Yet, in spite of this, Austen's characters hunger for their dreams, for love that does not compromise their existence merely to pragmatic ends. In narrative terms, Austen's genius never fails to come through with unseen twists in plot and beautiful, moving dialogue that has been kept at bay to be delivered to the anxiously-waiting reader at just the right moment."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"i didnt like this one as much as i have like some of austens other works. there just seems to be some element of fun missing from it."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.While I initially picked this book up due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), I found Sense & Sensibility to be an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"For a long time, this was one of my least favorite of all Jane Austen's novels. But having re-read it recently (it was the first selection for our Jane Austen Book Group on The Book Club Forum), I found myself falling in love with the story for the first time. Elinor is a heroine that one can easily love and respect, especially in the way she controls, and yet deeply feels her emotions. Marianne, however, did grate on my nerves some, but I respect her allowing herself to give herself completely to Willoughby. Elinor and Marianne really do seem like opposite sides of the same coin: one hold everything in, one lets everything out.This book also has some of the best comic characters, especially Mrs. Jennings, the jolly matchmaker. One has to admit how uninteresting her life has to be if her ambition is to marry off every eligible young woman she meets! I also think that Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood, the sisters' half brother and sister-in-law are hilarious in their coldness and selfishness. You can tell that John likes to think of himself as charitable toward his sisters, but in reality he is completely self-centered. His wife, Fanny, is a wonderful villain for the book; she makes her husband seem positively warm."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This is a wonderful clasic and I was so happy to find it and it is in great condition!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"One of the best things you can do for yourself is to read or reread one of Jane Austen's books.

In any event, I find her sense of humor and grasp of the English language makes this book a must in any collection of Austen's works. It is well worth purchasing. Too, the Everyman's Library cover is finely done. This book will last on your shelf for years."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This is the second Jane Austen book that I have listened to this year. I earlier enjoyed Pride and Prejudice and just finished Sense and Sensibility. It is clear to my why this is a classic. It is a fine romance and a great study in character. It highlights how outward appearances and popularity are not necessarily the most important characteristics. The heroes and heroines in this book have their flaws, but are easy to like and root for. The bad guys are not all bad, and do have some redeeming qualities. This is classic 19th century literature of which I am a fan.The reader for this audio book is Susannah Harker. She does an excellent job with the different characters and makes it easy to tell who is speaking. Her accent seems fitted to a book of this period also.I highly recommend this audio book as a wonderful way to pass your commute or a long trip."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"The dual natures of these sisters is what truly makes this novel special. Their natural differences and their abilities in the end to overcome their inborn instincts demonstrate Austen's talent in creating interesting and dynamic characters.

I decided I wanted to read the book to get the real version. I was not disappointed. I enjoy all of Jane Austen's books. I wish she had lived longer so she could have written more. She was an amazing author."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Two sisters have come of marrying age. One loves rashly and deeply, the other cautiously and with no little reserve - the sense and the sensibility. The contrast set up, Jane Austen takes the two young women through nearly the same set of events. Through love's introduction, intervening conflict and ultimate disappointment, we observe the impacts and the results of these two disparate manners of dealing with the opposite sex. This being a Jane Austen comedy, don't be surprised if things work out for someone in the end.While obviously very well written and full of interesting characters and insights, this, like most of Jane Austen's work, simply \\"doesn't do it for me.\\" Certainly Ms. Austen is not without her modern relevance, but many of the important ideas running through her novels, including this one, are foreign and even offensive. For example, her casual indifference toward the unmoneyed, her obvious belief in the natural limitations of the female sex and the importance she sets on formality set my teeth a-grinding. She writes, as they say, of a different time. Similarly, her writing style is often, including in this book, tedious and opaque. Economy of words and clarity are not so important as obeisance to formality and avoidance of perceived impropriety. As I said, writing of a different time. As one can likely see, my complaints about Jane Austen are more due to my own predilections than any shortcomings of the famed authoress.That said, I do believe that reading this book is good for a person - it will make you more informed and provide material worth thinking on. Several of the characters will stick with you. Ms. Austen has a way of making her characters very distinct despite the smallness of her authorial world. The characters are not Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy, but the Dashwood girls are worth remembering. Furthermore, the major themes, while not \\"big ideas\\" are relevant to most everyone and persuasively resolved. Sense and sensibility was for me, however, less enjoyable reading than I would prefer. The plot line moved slowly, the ideas seemed dated and the language obscured rather than revealed."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Haven't had a chance to read the book yet.

But it's a very good book, promising much better to come, a promise which was abundantly fulfilled in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Marianne's histrionics drove me up the wall. It took a while for me to realize that Marianne is meant as a caricature; that Austen thinks her as ridiculous as she appears to the reader. Witness Marianne's rhapsodizing about the fallen leaves at Norwood and Elinor cutting her short with her observation that &quot;not everybody shares your passion for dead leaves.&quot; Elinor is the more sympathetic and likeable of the two sisters and Austen clearly identifies with her; Elinor's calm, rational sense and balance promises much better for happiness than Marianne's overblown romanticism. We can see in this first book the emergence of an awesomely talented writer."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"In recent weeks my wife in rapid succesion read this book and Pride and Prejudice and then ran out to the store on a Sunday evening to pick up Mansfield Park.

I haven't had this much trouble with a book in a long time. Since this is a minority view, I would only ask: Is this book the best introduction to Jane Austen?

Some may disagree, as is their right, but I will NEVER agree with them. I love her. LOVE, isn't a strong enough word. And, this book is on my TOP FIVE favs. of all time. The story of these sisters is timeless and the struggle for independance while still searching for love, could have been written today. Jane Austin was SO ahead of her time. Elinor and Maryann's relationship is so endearing and the heartbreak you feel for them is all consumming. You won't be able to put down this novel until you are satisfied that this wonderful and amazing women will be content in their respective lives.

For those of you who were disappointed that it did not match up to Pride and Prejudice, I assure you, it did, and then rose far above it. My English teacher in 6th grade always talked about Sense and Sensibility and how much she loved it. After I read Pride and Prejudice, my first Austen experience, I knew that I had to read that novel. As a warning for you as well, do NOT watch the movie with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet before you read the book. I did that and then I was totally thrown off by the book. Now, it is a great adaptation of the novel, but they mix up the scenes and so I found myself constantly confused because I did not meet Lucy Steele until much later than I thought I would. The movie introduces her much sooner. Another recommendation: if you want to see Jane Austen at her best, read Emma.

The language, the style of writing was not in contrast with her other works, but the characters and plot did not interest me. Marianne was decidedly a young woman whom I had no interest in. She was too wrapped up in her own little world to be a girl who deserved the compassion which Austen tried to ilicit. Besides this, Marianne and Elinor's prejudices made them seem as ill-bred as the company they ridiculed for being such. Although I liked Elinor for her honesty and compassion and hated Willoughby and Lucy Steele because of who they were, I was so disappointed with the conclusion that these three did little to save this book. My recommendation: read Pride and Prejudice or Emma instead."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"If given the opportunity to travel through history, one of my first stops would be the Regency Period of England and the world of Jane Austen. I have been a fan of Austen's since I read the first page of Pride and Prejudice. I currently own all of her published works, some having been replaced a couple of times due to wear. Since my latest copy of Sense and Sensibility bit the dust a month or so ago, I was thrilled to get Bethany House's copy in the mail this week.In terms of the actual novel, no changes have been made to Austen's original work. The novel is printed in all its glory with my favorite characters and places still in tact. What has been added by several of Bethany House's writers are notes and annotations about the life and times of Austen.The book comes complete with a key, which indicates the type of note/annotation being applied in each instance. The notes fall into the following categories: \\"historical and cultural details [...] from England in the early 1800's,\\" \\"fact and tidbits from Austen's life,\\" \\"references to S&S; in today's culture, particularly in film,\\" \\"unscientific ranking of the novel's most frustrating characters,\\" \\"themes of faith drawn from the novel or Austen's life,\\" \\"comments and asides on the book's characters or plot,\\" and \\"the parts of the novel that just make us smile.\\"I LOVE the additional comments, quips, and bits added to Austen's work. They serve to add the insight intended into a world of ladies and gentlemen. The authors who have offered their take on Austen's work compliment the novel by adding interesting references and inserting a little comedy into one of the best loved novels of all time.On the minus side (if you can really call it that), the novel did take more time to read. I found myself reading a page, seeing the notations, and reading the page again to see if the added information changed the image I create in my head of Austen's world. In most instances, it certainly did! It did make the reading more cumbersome at some points, but overall I really enjoyed this take on one of the best loved works of literature. I plan to order the Insight Edition of Pride and Prejudice and look forward to many more such editions.This book was provided free of charge by the publisher as a review copy.

The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness.

Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This fantabulous classic was part of my read for the Everything Austen Challenge. My love for anything and everything Victorian has helped me embrace this novel set in the Regency Period, and so, naturally I fell in love with this timeless piece. This story of the very different Dashwood sisters and their clashing tastes in their choices of men to love, was endearing as well as very frustrating at times. Just when I thought the obvious about Colonel Brandon, Edward or Willoughby- the story took a different turn just to add to the intrigue of it all; classic Austen at its best.The story revolves around love-sickness, love-triangles, a marriage of convenience, age and love, differences of choices and opinions, wealth and social status, influence, family conflict, secret-filled pasts and ultimately...and appropriately so: sense and sensibility. I'm still not sure which of the sisters I concurred with the most; Elinor or Marianne... Austen brilliantly shifts us from one perception to the other while embracing both depending on the situation. Ultimately the girls' reconciliation and love for eachother blends the disparities of state helping them come to terms with their own serenity. Love can then be found and accepted under a new light.Sense and Sensibility is a light read embedded with deeper meaning that brings comfort, peaks interest and offers a colourful variety of figures (the comical busy-body Miss Jennings is indeed very special!) On the whole, this read meshed excitement, passion, drama as well as \`sagesse' in the lives of two otherwise very ordinary ladies of the times. The book doesn't skip a beat with essential meanings and turn of events within every paragraph- With this one, you won't want to blink:)One can never get enough of elegantly written suspense-filled love twists and pangs. At least I can't- Loved it!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Being a Patrick O'Brian fan and knowing he was an admirer of Jane Austen, I gave her a try a few years ago with Pride and Prejudice and found it stunningly good and unforgettable. Sense and Sensibility is my second Austen novel and I hoped for an equally good performance. I would not have had the patience to get very far with Jane Austen earlier in my life. Austen can be stilted, wordy (to say the least), obtuse and just plain difficult to read and understand. She also leaves a lot to the imagination which although frustrating, actually adds depth and emotion. There is also a keen, many-layered understanding of people at their best, worst, and various shades of in- between, along with the associated foibles. Sense and Sensibility is a great story that, at times, had me rushing through many chapters to see the end result. For example, Marianne's encounter with Willoughby in London would make my top ten of dramatic literary scenes (if I were to ever compile such a list). As Sense and Sensibility neared its end, I hoped for and expected the sort of satisfying, happy, and witty ending I enjoyed in Pride and Prejudice, but found an unsatisfying, matter of fact (but perhaps realistic) anti-climax instead. I feel like I am defacing something sacred, but I have to give Sense and Sensibility only 4 stars. It is well worth the time, but if one is to pick their first Jane Austen book, based on my limited experience, let it be Pride and Prejudice. Next on my list is Emma."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This is the first full-length novel that Austen wrote, and - although it's easy to find proof for something you know is true - it shows. This book just wasn't as well-designed as Pride and Prejudice, where it feels like every character and scene has its purpose. But the characters and charming and the story is light and fun, and it's definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This book arrived very quickly and is just what I am looking for. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.While I initially picked this book up due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), I found Sense & Sensibility to be an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"After finally getting round to reading the books that launched my top three period film loves (P&P;Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996), S&S;Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition), and best of all PersuasionPersuasion), it was fascinating to note what Emma Thompson did and did not use in her screenplay of S&S.;As to the novel itself-most surprising and gratifying was the biting satire, wit and sarcasm in Miss Austen's writing. Her carefully veiled views on \\"society\\" good and bad will stand as a historical and societal timeline into the era. A woman's place, or lack thereof, is keenly felt, as is the feeling of helplessness of women with the unfortunate prospect of being born without means. As well as what some women gave up to secure \\"a good match\\". Knowing Miss Austen's own background, the reader doesn't have to wonder how much of her own life was catalyst for her social commentary dished up in the beguiling text of romance.4 stars-recommended."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"A wonderful Jane Austen book.

I would say it's average at best. I read both Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice in the last week. If you have time for only one of them, read Pride and Prejudice, it's much better. In Sense and Sensibility it doesn't seem like you get to know the characters as well as in Pride. The novel seems to drag along for way to long before anything happens in the last few pages. I know the novel has a lot to do with people trying to marry rich, but the focus on money seems to be more prevalent in Sense than in Pride.

Bethany House Publishers recently released the \\"Insight Edition\\" which includes footnotes of trivia, notes, and inspiration to help readers understand more background to this story. It is important to note that the story has not been changed in any way. Some of these notes are historical, that expand on life in England in the 1800s; others are facts about Jane Austen that coincide with the story; still others are themes of faith, or comments on the characters or plot.This was my second reading of Sense and Sensibility and I definitely enjoyed reading the extra tidbits included in this version. The culture of the 1800s is very different from current culture and there were many times that the notes gave me a greater understanding of various situations.I recommend this version to all Jane Austen fans, you will probably have new insights after reading this book. And to those of you who have not yet become Jane Austen fan, give this book a try, it's a timeless story."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I love Jane Austen. A couple summers ago, I set out to read all of her books in one summer - even those I had read before (Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility). Even after realizing that many of her characters and stories are similar, I still loved her. I love the way she writes with wit and intelligence. And I really enjoy how everyone who deserves to be happy in the end does indeed end up happy.Sense and Sensibility, for those of you who haven't ever read it or seen one of the many film versions, is the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne who are both alike in passion, except that Marianne is all passion and impulsivity on the outside (sensibility) and Elinor is all composure and caution on the outside (sense). The story tells of secret love, not so secret love, lost fortunes and selfishness, and deep sisterly love. This story, even more than Pride and Prejudice, makes me wish I had a sister or two.This insight edition is different from other more \\"academic\\" versions of classic works, because rather than pages and pages of footnotes instructing the reader as to the socio-historical background of the book.... Well, it's like the editors are reading the book with you. Occasionally there are informative footnotes which tell you what a \\"Barouche\\" is (a four-wheeled carriage pulled by 2 horses that seated four people), or tells you about \\"Harley Street\\" (a street in London populated chiefly by medical professionals). But there are also 6 other types of footnotes that occur throughout the book - usually as an \\"aside\\" on the edge of the page - including notes about Jane Austen's life and how a part of the story relates to it, references to S&S; in film and television, themes related to faith, and notes on characters that the editors dislike throughout the story.While at first, I thought that this tongue-in-cheek note system was a little distracting, as I went onward, I began to enjoy the voices of these women. It was kind of like I was reading the book with a friend or with a book club. So that as I read about something really horrible that Fanny said to John or Lucy said to Elinor and thought, \\"UGH! I think Fanny is such a jerk!\\" there was the comment by my \\"friends\\" in the margin saying the same thing.This version of Sense and Sensibility does not add anything new to the text that Jane Austen wrote, and thus the story of course is great. The Insight Edition does add some contemporary fun to the novel however, and it is likely you would also enjoy taking these friends with you on the journey through 19th century England.Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen? 4.5 out of 5The Insight Edition? 3.5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" by Jane Austen focuses on sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood and their search for love.

This enduring classic is full of insight from several different authors. It includes interesting details from Jane Austen's own life to the historical and cultural details from the early 1800's. The faith in the book is brought out and given Scripture references throughout the book.

Sure enough, there was an end cap in the fiction section covered with retellings and sequels to Austen's beloved novels. Austen's influence can even be found in the popular paranormal genre; Mr. Darcy (Pride and Prejudice) and Jane Austen both appear as vampires in two such books. The Insight Edition offers a newly packaged look at the original story of Sense and Sensibility, with a few fun surprises in store.I'll be honest with you. Up until this week, Sense and Sensibility was the only Jane Austen novel I had not yet read. Without this new edition of the beloved classic, it's more than likely I never would have made it through. A few months ago, I attempted to read it from beginning to end, but gave up less than a third of the way into the story. I was baffled. If I can read Pride and Prejudice in two days flat, then why was I having so much trouble with Sense and Sensibility? Like in other novels, Austen writes about marrying for love and/or money, first impressions, and differences in class.Sense and Sensibility is the story of the Marianne and Elinor Dashwood. They are the late Mr. Dashwood's children from his second marriage. At the time of his death, he asks his son Henry to care for youngest three daughters and his new widow. However, Henry's wife has his ear and persuades him to give them less income annually than the promise he made to his father. Marianne and Elinor can only hope to preserve their future by making smart matches. Bold and romantic Marianne has her sights set on the charming Mr. Willoughby, and sensible and logical Elinor has fallen for Edward Ferrars. Neither gentleman is what he seems, and both girls soon suffer from a broken heart. The loss of Mr. Willoughby prolongs Marianne's sickness, and Elinor silently suffers through Edward's upcoming nuptials with Lucy Steele. Just as it seems all hope is lost for a happy ending, Marianne opens her heart to a new love, and Elinor learns that things are not exactly as they seem.This annotated edition of Sense and Sensibility enhanced a story I already knew through the 1995 Kate Winslet/Emma Thompson feature film. The editors provided trivia about the movie, ranked their favorite characters and least favorite characters, offered facts about Jane Austen and the Regency period, and provided definitions of difficult words. Whether Sense and Sensibility is an old favorite or a new-to-you text, this is the edition you should read. Lovingly put together by some of Austen's biggest fans, the Insight Edition will earn a slot on your bookshelf.*A copy of this book was provided to me by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"How do you take a book that is almost 200 years old and make it interesting and new to the modern reader? That's a trick question, I can't imagine not enjoying Jane Austen's writing no matter how antiquated the society and its ideals are. Of course I took as many literature classes in college as time allowed so I may be an exception to the rule.The story itself? The cast of characters is impressive; you've got the calm introvert, the passionate young thing, the rake, the snob, the neighbors you roll your eyes at whenever they show up, the man of integrity, etc. And the plotlines are almost as thick as the characters! Frivolity and fun, true love, desperate, gut-wrenching heartbreak, intrigue and secrets, scandal, mix-ups, horrible nasty people you want to punch in the nose (I know I'm not the only one who thought that.)I've made it a personal project to read all of Austen and this was my third foray and probably my favorite to read - which surprised me because as absolutely wonderful as Edward and Col. Brandon are, I don't swoon over them like Mr. Darcy or Mr. Knightley. Not to sound smarmy about it but I think it did have to do with the \\"insights\\" in my margin.The book has a pictographic key so the notes in your margin are categorized by things like historical and cultural details, film references, themes of faith, Austen facts and tidbits, and comments and asides as well as frowny face and smiley face comments. As much as I LOVE tidbits and asides in all categories what I really enjoyed were the smiley and frowney faces - it was like reading the book with a friend who hated the same parts you hated and loved, laughed and smiled at all your favorite places.(I got quite the laugh out of the film reference which stated: In the 2008 miniseries, Edward's bad mood leads him to chop wood in the pouring rain. The film was written by the same person who had Darcy jump in a lake. We approve of both.And yes I did run out and rent the 2008 miniseries after reading that. Kidding. Sortof.)If you were one of those women (or girls - I knew lots of teens who did this) who ran out and bought Pride and Prejudice the book after watching the 2005 film and found the book hard to read - I'd recommend trying it again with the \\"insight edition\\" which will inevitably lead you to Sense & Sensibility. These editions really do a brilliant job of bridging a 200 year generation gap.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I have always enjoyed Jane Austen's books and film adaptations of Jane Austen, and I have always been troubled by the fact that more younger people are not exposed to the classics rigorously enough in high school English literature classes.For schools or parents who feel like Jane Austen's books may be a bit cumbersome for their students or children, then this book provides an alternative. Instead of tampering with the language or feeling of the original manuscript, it provides fun asides.The margins of the book are dotted with factoids. Some of the details focus on Austen's life, others on English life in general during the time period. Historical details are discussed in some, while slight religious themes addressed in the book are presented in others.

I'm not sure why, I just never had until I was given the opportunity to review this Insight Edition published by Bethany House. I have to admit that I am not going to be a Jane Austen fan. I struggled with Sense and Sensibility. I actually felt like Tom Hanks in \`You've Got Mail'. It just was not my cup of tea, which is strange because I love books that take place in Regency England and I love Jane Austen themed books.But, I'm not really reviewing Jane Austen here. I'm reviewing the Insight Edition. This annotated edition is filled with trivia, themes of faith, and other nuggets meant to enhance the reader's experience. I have to say that I like this concept with classic literature. I enjoyed taking a break from the story and reading the side notes. The notes are written clearly on the pages, but they do not get in the way of the story.One devoted Austen fan told me that reading a book like this is like watching a movie with the commentary on. That can be a good thing or a bad thing. Sometimes a reader just wants the story and nothing else. Other readers, who may have read Sense and Sensibility several times, may appreciate having that little extra. If that is the case, I highly recommend the Insight Edition of Sense and Sensibility for those who want to add to their Jane Austen experience."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is the first published novel of Jane Austen. Originally published in 1811, the novel went through several versions perhaps starting with \\"Elinor and Marianne\\" in 1795, though it is not certain. I suspect that \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is the second best known work of Austen after \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", and I would say that it is not as easy to read as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". One of the reasons for this is due to the importance of what was considered proper behavior at the time, and without an understanding of that standard of behavior, the motivation of the characters is hidden from the reader. Nevertheless, it is still worth the effort to read and overall it is worthwhile. At the same time, it is well worth reading an edition like the Penguin Classics version, which helps the reader understand the period and societal standards which play an important role in this novel.The main characters of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" are the sisters Elinor and Marianne, who are the daughters of Mr. Dashwood and his second wife. There is a third daughter, Margaret and of course his second wife Mrs. Dashwood. When Mr. Dashwood passes away, his estate passes to his son by his first wife, leaving the Dashwood women into lives of reduced means. The two elder sisters experience nearly the same situations. Both find love, then the shock of learning that those they love are pre-engaged.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is written in three volumes. The first deals with the transition of the Dashwood women to their new lives where they leave their Norland home move to stay with distant relations (the Middletons) at Barton Park. Elinor cares for Edward Ferras, the brother-in-law of her half-brother, and Marianne meets and is courted by John Willoughby. Willoughby leaves suddenly for London, causing Marianne distress. This volume also introduce Anne and Lucy Steele, two relations of the Middleton's who arrive as guests, but their arrival causes problems for Elinor who learns that Lucy is secretly engaged to her Edward. In Volume II, it is Marianne who learns that Willoughby has become engaged to another, due to his wasting his fortune and need for wealth. In Volume III the situations with the two sisters and those who they thought they loved is resolved, though in different ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\", in my opinion, is more difficult for a modern reader to digest, but that does not mean that it doesn't have anything to offer. There are some wonderful moments and when presented in a scholarly format with detailed notes it can still be enjoyed the same way it was when first published. I don't personally rate \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" as high as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", but it is still a very good novel and an important piece of literature."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Short and Sweet Review, by Michelle:Sense and Sensibility is one of my favorite books by Jane Austen, who happens to be my favorite author. I don't think I need to incredible detail here since if you're thinking about reading it, you more than likely familiar with Ms. Austen's writing.

Even though I love period dramas, somehow the S&S; movie didn\\"t manage to grab me. It was one of those movies, that I wasn't enthusiastic to rewatch, even though I love Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet and Hugh Grant, and think that they did a great job and the whole movie looks great, but it is the story that I was not fond of.So you can imagine that I wasn't enthusiastic to read the novel either. Actually, when it was voted as the next book in my reading group, I decided I would skip it. And then my cousin just gave it to me and when I started reading it, I couldn't stop. I loved it! Somehow it is completely different from the movie. Here Elinor isn't an Ice Queen, just a private and mature girl, and Marianne didn't annoy me with her liveliness and passionate views as in the movie. I think the only character I liked better in the movie than in the book was Edward Ferrars.I'm sorry to say that S&S; is quite an understated Austen novel: Pride and Prejudice, Presuasion and Emma usually get all the praise and are the favourites of readers, but this Austen novel is excellent in its subdued pastel coloured way too.If you love the movie or the miniseries, you ahve to read it, and if the screen adaptations didn't really engage you, I'd still encourage you to give S&S; a chance, the novel is well worth the read, I'm sure you will love it!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I've been a fan of Austen for 20 years and this is one of my favorites. It can appear to be a little stilted due to the time period it was written in, but the story is timeless and that's why movies keep getting made with it as a base story. I do have to admit that I think Marienne is a spoiled brat who doesn't know a good man when she sees him. Always go for substance over lipstick!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"The type was readable, illustrations interesting.

Austen takes the story of two sisters, one quick to emotion and the other reasonable nearly to a fault and puts them in a similar situation of unreturned fancy. In the right hands this could be an interesting story and you would think Austen would make it so. Unfortunately not, her story is dull and I kept waiting for something to happen. There was no biting irony or under the surface commentary. This being Jane Austen's first novel explains some of it. You see a few glimpses of her use of language and irony but not enough to carry this book. I give this a C-."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"There are two schools of Austen. The first, her ardent admirers, adore everything she does; the second find the snobby world her characters inhabit a perpetual turnoff. Belonging to neither category myself, this book strikes me as somewhat tentative, in regards to Austen's development as a writer. This opinion I'm sure won't endear me to the legions of Austen fans who treasure every word she wrote. But though the story itself is a fine one, the novel as a whole lacks the attention to detail, character, and metaphor that Austen would perfect in her later novels (particularly \\"Mansfield Park,\\" which never seems to get the accolades this novel and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" do). Though Austen compensates for this with various literary techniques (creating an opposite foil for all of her characters, constructing parallels for various scenes, etc.), when it comes right down to it, this is the work of a beginner, a writer just beginning to get her bearings. I know \\"S&S\\" has its passionate proponents, mostly on the basis of its romantic plot, and heartfelt depiction of the love lives of two very different sisters. But on the whole, this book derives its strength mostly from straightforward storytelling, rather than imaginative and poetic writing. Not a bad beginning, but Austen definitely improved her game with her future novels. (...)"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I read Sense and Sensibility for my English IV Course. This novel was written by Jane Austen. This book is for a romantic person, adult or young adult. If you are someone who is interested in 19th Century society and the roles of women, this story is for you. Sense and Sensibility is a classic novel. The author is well known and the quality of literature is world class, because it is so well known.Sense and Sensibility describes the adventures of two young ladies (Marianne and Elinor) falling in love. Elinor is always in control of her emotions and senses. Marianne is an emotional whirlwind whose sensibilities dictate that those who have no evidence of wholly encompassing emotions or are without them entirely. She ultimately marries her long standing admirer, Colonel Brandon. Also Elinor is the heroin of the story. The mother, Mrs. Dashwood, is weird; she is always after her daughters minding their business. She is the opposite of Mrs. Burton from Pride and Prejudice. She has inherited no fortune of her own but wants the best for her daughters and shares Marianne's romantic sensibilities. The love stories are very intriguing as well. Elinor loves Edward and Marianne falls in love with Willoughby.The conflict of the ideas about marriage between parents and daughters is the main theme of this book. If the girls were not yet married, their mothers employed themselves in matching the younger women with eligible men.I recommend Jane Austen's work to all readers who are fascinated with love. This is an excellent book for those who enjoy 19th Century Literature. Even though I missed some details because of the language, I identified with one the girls in the story."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I love all of Jane Austin's works. She captures real life in her day, and it still applies to my day."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Perhaps one of my favorite Jane Austen books. It's perfect in every way!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Jane Austen's first novel Sense and Sensibility was published in 1811. It wasn't written under her name because she was a female; only men were allowed to publish novels and articles. Only her immediate family knew that Jane Austen wrote the novel. Austen is a romantic writer. In Sense and Sensibility there are two different views of love that you will explore throughout the novel.In Sense and Sensibility, there are three volumes that make up the novel. In volume I, Mr. Dashwood dies leaving money to his first wife's son John Dashwood. Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret have to sell their house and move in with John and his wife Lucy. While in the new town of Barton College Elinor, Marianne, and the men explore the town. Elinor becomes quite fond of Edward Ferrars, Lucy's brother. Lucy does not approve of this relationship because she thinks that the Dashwood women are poor, non-elegant ladies. Marianne is loved by Colonel Brandon, but she doesn't realize it until the end when Willoughby betrays her. The focus of this novel is would you love for sense or sensibility.The two main characters symbolize sense or sensibility. Elinor represents sense, because she thinks with her head and loves with her heart. Marianne represents sensibility. She acts like a Damsel in distress with her love interest. Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne are very similar in the ways that they deal with everyday life. This novel is not based on the success of sense over sensibility, but rather a combination of the two together.In this novel, two women fall in love in opposite ways. Everybody has a little of both Marianne and Elinor in them. We tend to want to date the men that every girl dreams of, but we marry for love and long lasting friendships. People in today's society still act the same way about love as Marianne and Elinor do in the novel. Marianne acts like a typical adolescent. She wants to marry the gorgeous young stud, but eventually she realizes that he is a jerk.The novel shows you two different views on how women, in general, fall in love. Some think with their heads while others think with their hearts. Jane Austen wrote during the romantic period. She wasn't respected as a writer until after her death. Austen was one of the best romantic authors of her time."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I was hoping for another masterpiece when I ordered Sense and Sensibility but, other than the eloquent language, it contains none of the charm of Pride and Prejudice. Not a single character in S&S is likeable, and that I find to be a real travesty. In P&P you have the bold and clever Elizabeth and the mysterious Darcy to adore, and even Jane and Bingley have their charms.... but S&S is a dull read, or at least, as dull and the wonderful Jane Austen could muster. I don't recommend it to a Pride and Prejudice lover."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"As SENSE &amp; SENSIBILITY (S&amp;S) was Austen's first published novel, it is perhaps a forgivable sin that this work is almost wholly without that inimitable touch of greatness that makes her later works so wonderful. To be sure, S&amp;S is not completely without charm; as usual, her characters are described along the same uber ironic and caustic lines familiar to fans of her later work, and the soap operish quality of the narrative is, as always, tempered by her wry wit. When Austen sets her baleful eye on the often ridiculous mores of her society, deftly skewing her demographic representing characters with the graceful, devastating wit she made her stock and trade, there is no one better. Yet, in S&amp;S, the other part of what makes Austen so great - the biting, social commentary which is always indistinguishably entwined with plot and that sterling character development we've come to expect - is absent. And though Austen sets her novel up as a didactic tale centering around an overmeasure of both sensibility and emotional excessivity, in the end she fails to create any application, to make sense of the lessons she so clearly intended to teach. The two main characters seem to have suffered trial after trial for nothing, and the rest of the characters, those that MADE them suffer, get off scot-free. That sense of Austen Justice so unavoidable in her later efforts is conspicuously absent here, leaving the narrative in want of purpose and the reader ultimately dissatisfied.A lesser effort from one just setting her foot on the Alpine Path to greatness."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I read Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen. I thought the book was very good. Austen portrays Elinor and Marianne very well. She shows the love and friendship and the jealously of two sisters. She shows how one sister can be in love and the other is trying to find the bad in that person.In the beginning, Elinor finds someone she really likes and Marianne trys to find the bad in him, like he doesn't like drawing and Elinor does. Marianne is just jealous that her sister has found someone and she hasn't found anyone yet. Marianne wants Edward, Elinor's boyfriend. Elinor and Edward don't last that long anyway because they move to Barton Park.The Miss Dashwood's cousin, Sir John Middleton, writes them a letter and invites them to move to Barton Park and live in a cottage. They gladly accept. They tell their brother and his wife and send their belongings in advance and leave. They agree to try the cottage out for a year. Sir John and his wife are very hospitable to the Miss Dashwood's. They always invite them to their house to meet the people of the neighborhood. The Miss Dashwood's rarely accepted.There was on certain time they accepted and met Colonel Brandon, who is a friend of Sir John. Colonel Brandon sets his sights on Marianne. Colonel Brandon likes Marianne's singing and piano playing. Elinor does not like that idea. She would rather him be interested in her instead. Elinor is now jealous of Marianne. She doesn't even care that Edward is supposed to be coming to see her. Their good-bye was like that of a brother and sister. They didn't even kiss good-bye.The Middleton's are always having someone stay the night at their house. The Dashwood's would rather keep to themselves. When Sir John's wife invites them to come to the house the Dashwood's are always busy. The Dashwood's are the type that would rather do for themselves. They are not really the social type. Mr. John Dashwood and his wife live in Norland. They moved there after his father died. Mr. Dashwood made his son promise to provide for his mother and sisters. Which meant that he was to give them money. His wife did not like that idea. She thought that they could find their own money and that the money was the only reason they were still living in Norland. Which in fact was not true. They were still living there because they had no where else to go. Miss John Dashwood thought that they didn't deserve any money from them whether they were family or not. She thought only of herself and her son not of her husband's family.John Dashwood wanted to give them three thousand pounds apiece. His wife wouldn't hear of it. She thought that they would never pay it back because they had no source of income. She managed to talk her husband down to about five hundred pounds. They managed to get out of paying the women any money because they decided to move Barton Park. In the end they both marry and are happy. They don't live too far away from one another, so they can still fight as they please. They can stay in touch with one another because family means so much to them. In reading this book, I had a little trouble understanding and following the context in some places, but I enjoyed the book. I would recommend it to young women who like to read romances. It is very much so a romance, yet it is also a book about the love that two sisters have for one another. Sense and Sensibility is rather difficult to follow in some spots. I highly recommend this to young women who enjoy reading romances."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Classic story of life and love. A bit difficult to read in the old English but having seen the movie made it more understandable."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Published in 1811 but still a book that can be enjoyed and related to today's generations. A widowed mother taking care of three daughters. Being evicted from their home and moves into a relative's home. The daughters all taught that they don't have to marry into money or their social class. They're also encouraged to be well educated in all subjects.Now in the early 1800's, women were not allowed to own property. They didn't have civil rights that we do now. So when Henry Dashwood dies, the successor of all of Henry's property is John Dashwood (son by Henry's first marriage). Henry's second wife, Mrs. Dashwood (40 y.o.), is forced to find another place for herself and her 3 daughters. John Dashwood is a man who allows his wife to manipulate him. He wants to do right and follow his father's dying wish, but the spoiled wife convinces him otherwise.The title \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was not Austen's original decision. None the less, the title is an example way English teachers want for comparison and contrast essays. The usage of the two terms are also fitting. In this case, sense refers to Elinor Dashwood. She is the eldest daughter and 19 years old. Elinor is reasonable and reserved toward her feelings. Romanticism is apart of the definition of sensibility. Marianne (the 16 y.o. middle daughter) and Mrs. Dashwood both where their hearts on their sleeves. They rely on their emotions for all the decisions they makes. The youngest daughter, Margaret Dashwood (13), is also romantic but is still young.Mrs. Ferrars, Fanny Dasholwood, and Robert Ferrars believe in social class and high status of wealth. None of them have job or money income. They live off their inheritance and marriage dowries.

I believe that this can relate to a lot of girls in today's culture. All of the girls in today's culture are always looking for love. They are always seeking for a boyfriend. This book is about two older women who are searching for the love of someone. This book can also relate to the lives of people today because it is about broken hearts and finding the right person. A lot of people today think that the first boy that they date, they are going to marry. That is not true in a lot of cases and that is a lesson that can be learned from this book.This book is about two sisters. Marianne and Elinor are both looking for someone to marry. They are at the age when it is time for them to be married and that is what they want. In the beginning of the book, Elinor has fallen for a man named Edward Ferrars. He is a respectable gentlemen who Elinor falls on love with at first site. When Elinor and her family move away, he promises to come and see them soon. He never comes and only sends a letter. This makes Elinor very upset. While all of this is happening, Marianne meets a man. His name is John Willoughby. He is also very respectable and helps Marianne when she falls down. He carries her home because she cannot walk. This is when it happens. When John meets her family, they instantly like him. He hangs around and is then called out of town. Then, before they know it, Willoughby is called out of town.When the two sisters go into town for a few months, they hear some devastating news. They hear that Willoughby is marrying another woman and so is Edward. This devastates both of the girls and they are in a wreck. In the end, They both ended up getting married. You will have to read the book to see how the end turns out because I don't want to give away the ending for those of you who have not read it yet.In the end, The book was good and I would recommend it to some people. I would not recommend it to all people because as I would put it: \\"The book is a chick flick\\". I would recommend this book to people who like romance and fiction. This book I think would best fit teenage girls.

Content includes table of contents with chapter titles and a somewhat antiquated preface (not by Austen, of course) from the out-of-copyright text.With respect to the content itself, Austen's story and story-telling is amusing and witty, her language is ornate and sometimes a bit tedious, and most (though not all) of the characters are sketched vividly. This was the first Austen book I've read (and the first she published), but I rather doubt it would have remained so popular without the success of her other books; I would recommend Pride and Prejudice or another of her books as a first read.

I caught on pretty fast. The beginning is confusing but afterwards, it makes more sense. Things such as He is very agreeable or five and twenty (25) come up a lot.

At first, I thought all the little sidebars were a little annoying, but as I got further and further into the book, I found myself actually looking forward to them.This book is a classic written in the beautiful prose of the 18th Century writer, Miss Jane Austen. I can't remember the last time I had read one of her books, but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this book. It even inspired me to rent the 1995 movie with Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant in it. I love the contrasts between the two sisters, the overly dramatic, romance-seeking Marianne, and the calm, steady, level-headed, Elinor.I look forward to seeing more books like this from Bethany House. This is a great way to get re-acquainted with the classics.This book was provided to me free of charge as part of Bethany House Book Reviewers."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"My favorite Austen because I can identify with Elinor Dashwood.

Yet I found myself caught up in the story of two sisters, one levelheaded(sometimes hiding her emotions) and the other very dramatic. This is a tale of sisters who struggle to learn what love is truly about and of their unending loyalty to each other.What made the book interesting to me were the notes added by the editors. They included Historical and cultural details, information on Jane Austen's life, references to Sense & Sensibility in films, an unscientific ranking of the novel's most frustrating characters and themes of faith drawn from the novel and Jane Austen's life. I actually caught myself laughing out loud as I read some of the side notes. The comments helped lighten the tone of the book and made it painless and even fun to read.

The love and loyalty between the sisters is astounding, but they do not understand each other. Elinor is a quiet, sensible and sensitive young lady cheerful and putting others first. Marianne is just the opposite. She has a quick temper, speaks before thinking, is often rude and is full of herself. Her wishes and desires come first regardless of who is hurt.The family lives in late 18 century England where a person is judged by breeding and wealth, looking down on the working class. Circumstances change in the sisters lives and they are forced to move from the family homer to the country. Their half-brother has good intentions as to their welfare, but is overruled by his wife. Through the goodness of a distant cousins and friends, the sisters remain in polite society. Both have feelings for two gentlemen of the upper class, but whose feelings do not appear to be in their favor or any chance of marriage. What transpires in the lives of Elinor and Marianne along with their friends leads to some interesting conclusions.Jane Austen has always been a favorite author of many. However, this is a reprint of the original book first published around 1811. The trivia and notes that highlight this \\"Insight Edition\\" in the right margin is very distracting, and at times I found the story rambling without anything worthwhile being said.Jane Austen fans who want to reread the book will, no doubt, purchase the reprint for the interesting trivia, but I found it very hard to follow, due to the inserts in the margin, and to only hold my attention for short periods of time.This book was provided by the publisher for review."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"If you love Jane Austen, you will love this edition of Sense and Sensibility.I admit I was at first a little skeptical of reading an \\"insight edition\\" as often I have found, in the past, insights to be annoying and often detract from the story. That is not the case in this edition of Sense and Sensibility. I found most of the insights to be very helpful and often amusing.This timeless classic is brought to life in even greater detail through the insights included in this version. It includes many fascinating details from Jane Austen's own life which help explain her perspective on many different situations. Many of the insights have to do with bringing the rich cultural details out to a generation who may not immediately relate to life and places in the early 1800's.For those who have loved (or even hated) the many movies and mini-series' based on this book, you will find frequent comparisons, applause, and criticisms of the film versions.The faith that is evident, though not always clearly, is brought out and given Scriptures references for throughout the book. I found these very interesting as I had never thought of Sense and Sensibility as a Christian book before.This is definitely a book all Jane Austen aficionados will love.

I've read all her books several times and never seem to tire of them. Reading Jane's writings is a bit like curling up with a cup of tea while visiting with a very dear friend. Some things are just meant to be cherished and savored.While I have taken the time to do a little research on Austen's life and works, I was curious about the new Insight Edition of Sense & Sensibility by Bethany House Publishers. The Insight Edition seeks to provide readers with a deeper level of understanding of Austen's world and that of her famous characters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. No \\"Googling\\" required.This recently published version provides clever trivia and tidbits which are sprinkled throughout the margins of the book. Also included is a helpful Quick Guide that acts as a key for deciphering the note's symbols, and a Questions for Conversation section that can be used for book club discussions.While I admit to feeling almost giddy with anticipation over this book, I found myself feeling a bit disappointed by some of the commentary. I was very interested in both the historical and cultural notations, but I really didn't care to read what felt like an overabundance of \\"opinion\\". For example, \\"Mrs. Dashwood would've loved HGTV.\\" {page 33} To me, that felt completely unnecessary. Also the flash of \\"today's society/vernacular\\" while reading a novel set during the early 1800's felt a bit jarring at times.However, the Insight Edition does hold many interesting bits of information that most, if not all, Jane-ites will readily appreciate. I also enjoyed the fresh new cover art, which added a lovely ambiance to this most delicious diversion. :)"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I was excited to receive a free copy of the Sense and Sensibility Insight Edition by Jane Austen($11 .99) from Bethany House!

Much, I believe.Austen wrote a book that is very instructive in how people face life and love. Set in a time when many seemed to thrive on that which was deemed genteel and appropriate, but were very superficial, Sense And Sensibility shows the manner in which two (There were several others, but the Dashwood sisters are the two main characters.) sisters dealt with love. Elinor was prudent, careful, and thoughtful (She used sense). Marianne was passionate (Sensibile is the way Austen described her.). They both fell in love, and both were hurt in different ways. In the end, both learned the value of having a balance between careful, well-thought out approaches to love, and a passionate approach to love.The ins and outs of their loves are not too different from our times. Neither are the people. The great difference is in the setting. Human nature remains the same. We can learn much about life from this book.Bethany House Publishers has done the reader a service by providing appropriate historical details, references to various movies based upon the book, and humorous comments along the way.Who would have ever thought that reading a classic could be so much joy!?!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible.

Elinor and Marianne fall in love with two men, who end up breaking up with then off and on throughout the book until the end when one of them actually marries one of the men. And it is the most boring piece of garbage ever to be written. I'm going to burn my copy after I'm done with it, which should be soon. This book is for women. Not for a man such as myself. I do not recommend this book to anyone not trying to fall asleep fast. It goes well with My Antonia as being good fuel for a fire. Never read this, this is crap.

It has changed the way I look at some things.The author is not overly wordy and keeps the book moving along at a pace well enough to hold the readers' interest."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Still a great book. Has lasted not because of its silly plot turns in romance, but because of its one-dimensional characatures of English society in her time, with the perfect heroine, Elinor, at its core. Everyone else falls into a niche, is a type, but as the satire is at times very pointed, the story is forgiven. What is not so obvious, because Austen was probably not aware of it, is the utter dependence of all these peoples' lives on the servants who support them. These people do nothing. They walk, eat, dress, visit, read, play games and music, and do needlework or write letters. That's it, with an occasional shopping trip thrown in. It is this underlying life, the life of the servants, that is never mentioned. Only one, Thomas, has any lines at all. It beats me how they filled their days. They simply lived to amuse themselves."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Sence and Sensibility has neither the clever mystery of Emma or the endearing heroine of Pride and Prejudice. But we all must learn to except that she couldn't top those two novels.That said Sence and sensibility is worth the read for any Austen fan.The Dashwood sisters various dilemas in love make a good story. We don't care for them as much as our beloved Elisabeth and Jane Bennet, but we wish them the very best all the same.Marianne's self-sensure near the end of the novel for the indulgence of her self-pitty and the lack of obsevance of common civility (in contrast to her sister)is not quite as satisfying as Emma's repentance.And sweet sensible Eleanor is just not as witty or charming as Elisabeth. Neither of the girls tempt us with Fanny Prices sweetness or modesty. And none of the love tangles are as interesting, mysterious or hard to figure out as in Emma.And the villians of the piece just don't match up to Mrs. Norris of Mansfield Park, Miss.Bingley of P+P irritates us more than Lucy Steele.Mr.Dashwoods fraternal neglect doesn't spark the indignation of the Bertrams insensitivity and self involvment.We find more dissapointment in Henry Crawfords disgrace than in Willoughbys.It's a great novel in it's own right but just not Austen's finest work. Which considering how good a book it is, should be a great compliment to the author."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Jane Austen's first novel Sense and Sensibility was published in 1811. It wasn't written under her name because she was a female; only men were allowed to publish novels and articles. Only her immediate family knew that Jane Austen wrote the novel. Austen is a romantic writer. In Sense and Sensibility there are two different views of love that you will explore throughout the novel.In Sense and Sensibility, there are three volumes that make up the novel. In volume I, Mr. Dashwood dies leaving money to his first wife's son John Dashwood. Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret have to sell their house and move in with John and his wife Lucy. While in the new town of Barton College Elinor, Marianne, and the men explore the town. Elinor becomes quite fond of Edward Ferrars, Lucy's brother. Lucy does not approve of this relationship because she thinks that the Dashwood women are poor, non-elegant ladies. Marianne is loved by Colonel Brandon, but she doesn't realize it until the end when Willoughby betrays her. The focus of this novel is would you love for sense or sensibility.The two main characters symbolize sense or sensibility. Elinor represents sense, because she thinks with her head and loves with her heart. Marianne represents sensibility. She acts like a Damsel in distress with her love interest. Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne are very similar in the ways that they deal with everyday life. This novel is not based on the success of sense over sensibility, but rather a combination of the two together.In this novel, two women fall in love in opposite ways. Everybody has a little of both Marianne and Elinor in them. We tend to want to date the men that every girl dreams of, but we marry for love and long lasting friendships. People in today's society still act the same way about love as Marianne and Elinor do in the novel. Marianne acts like a typical adolescent. She wants to marry the gorgeous young stud, but eventually she realizes that he is a jerk.The novel shows you two different views on how women, in general, fall in love. Some think with their heads while others think with their hearts. Jane Austen wrote during the romantic period. She wasn't respected as a writer until after her death. Austen was one of the best romantic authors of her time."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This book is an excellent way to see how English society ran hundreds of years ago.

I liked this book a lot and swooned as Marianne did over Willoughby! A wonderful classic and most definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This is a story about a family, of a mother and three daughters, as well as their extended family of cousins, step brothers and sisters-in-law and their current love interests. There is selfishness and greed; there are parties and laughter; there is music and books and love; there is heartbreak and deceit. It seems a formula for success.The eldest daughter, Elinor, is the only rational one. Her next sister, Marianne, is a silly, selfish flighty girl who cares nothing of anyone else's problems and wants everyone to focus on her own. The third sister barely gets mentioned, as she is not old enough to fall madly in love with the wrong guy and then make a scene about it when he doesn't love her back.The brother and sister-in-law are greedy and care only about money, even though they have plenty and don't share it with the rest of the family. The cousins are only focused on parties and gaiety and fun.My impression of this book was that they spend the whole time having parties and looking for a husband. They fall in love with men who are unfaithful and they act quite silly about it upon realizing the man doesn\`t love them. The men are all fickle and quite rude about it, pretty much ignoring the girls once they have had enough of them and never communicating with anyone. I almost didn't like them until I recollected that this book was written roughly 200 years ago and times WERE different then. However, I find it hard to relate and also to distance these girls from our modern times. If they were here right now, they would be completely out of place. I would tell them to shut up or to stand up for themselves for God's sakes!This is an era where men and women still marry for money and class. An era where your mother can arrange your marriage to a \\"suitable\\" beau. An era where the women didn't work and then men were landlords as an occupation. It is an era that I do like to read about and would like to understand, but that I have a hard time relating to. Maybe it's Austen's style of writing. Maybe it's just the era.However, for such an old book, it is sometimes amazing how much things really haven't changed. I think this quote still holds true today. \\"Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful, I should not be shy\\".This one just cracks me up. \\"Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition\\". So she didn't argue with him. She was snubbing him by not giving him the satisfaction of an argument. I love it. What an insult!But the best quote is this one at the end, which redeems Marianne. She finally turns around and realizes that she is not the only person in the world and the learns to respect and care about other people. She realizes that the man she loved when young was worthless and the one who has stood by and loved her for years is priceless.\\"Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate. She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her conduct, her most favourite maxims. She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give her hand to another!\\"I cannot say I really liked this book as much as I thought I would. From hearing what other people have said, I thought it would be absolutely great. It was just okay. I have found that there are several classics that I feel about this way. Maybe the hype is just too much. My expectations are too high. Or maybe I am just not into this style of book. I will keep trying however.I give it a 3 out of 5.

(Emma first, then Pride and Predjudice.) But Sense and Sensibility is very good on its own if not compared to those two:)Well to begin with Marianne is not as bad as some of the other reviewers have made her out to be. They should take into mind that she spends more than half of the book with her heart most cruelly broken by a man that I fell for just as hard as she did. (Willoughby.... Willoughby!)On a happier note though, there is one man whom I can still love at the end of the book, Edward Ferrars. He is not the wildly romantic man that Willoughby was, but what he lacks in that area he makes up for in others, such as his strength of charachter, his sweetness, and, as another reviewer mentioned, his loyalty. Yes, he is so loyal he almost left my heart broken twice. Luckily, Lucy did one thing right and saved us all from having to see that unhappy arrangement:(Well I really think I've said enough to give you the picture that this story is filled with drama and romance.(For all you that like that sort of thing, I know I do!) Also the romance in this book is completely clean! I definetely appreciate that, and if Jane Austen were here I would thank her for making all of her novels clean, so that girls like me who don't read books filled with trash can enjoy a good love story every once in a while!! :)"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This was my first Jane Austen experience, and it turned out to be mostly what I expected. Flowery writing, wandering storyline, and mostly emotional drama, this is not at all like my typical reading fare. That being said, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was an enjoyable read, with undeniably beautiful prose and often biting social commentary of old British society. While Elinor and Marianne didn't face any life-threatening scenarios or experience any true danger, their experiences trying to attract mates while navigating the social maze of British aristocracy was nonetheless interesting and amusing. The ridiculousness of that society when compared with our norms of today is spectacular. When an entire class is judged by nothing more than the family coffers, and labor seems unthinkable, marriage is of the utmost importance, especially for those unlucky 2nd and 3rd born children who are unlikely to inherit the estate. It seems totally bizarre today, but this kind of thing was apparently the norm a couple of hundred years ago, and is actually quite fascinating to think about (and learn about) while reading this book. And while we still have some elites today, it is hard to imagine the massive social divisions, bigotry, and unequal opportunity of the past. Jane Austen succeeds in her goal of highlighting the wrongs and inconsistencies of old British society. This book is worth the read if you have the time, even if mostly for the stark comparisons it provides with current times."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This was my first Jane Austen book and initially I was unmoved - even bored - by the torturous romantic entanglements of two well-bred Regency young ladies. But the elegant prose, twisting plot and amusing characters won me round. Austen, I belatedly discover, is one clever writer."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Jane Austen's works are always engaging, entertaining, heart-warming, and funny. So well written and so much more true romance than any dime store novel ever could attain to be. The only downside is that this copy seems to have some glitch where it will double a sentence and place that 2nd sentence a few paragraphs later but it's in a way that it's obvious it doesn't belong there. The only thing I could figure was that in the hard copy there is some book print style picture with a quote from the book under it as would be typical in many books of this type and that in the kindle version it just doesn't show the picture."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Love Jane Austen!

I am working on collecting them all!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen's first published novel, is the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Marianne is young and flirtatious and has very set ideas about what sort of person her true love, her knight in shining armour will be. Elinor, much more restrained, mature and sensible, has quite a different attitude to life and love. Both meet the man they believe is for them, but for neither does the course of true love run smooth. This charming novel has some very likeable characters, as well as a few to despise or disdain, and plenty of muddles, misunderstandings and wrong assumptions. Altogether a delight to read: easy to understand why this is a classic."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This review is my personal commentary on &quot;Sense and Sensibilty&quot; and, as such, explains and analyzes the novel. Eleanor Dashwood, the main character, is an example of a young woman's position in eighteenth century England. Her dependent situation in a typical Pre-Victorian setting introduces the reader to a common stereotype of the times. Miss Dashwood, a prospective bride at the tender age of nineteen, possesses adequate beauty and genteel manners making her attractive to select suitors. Chestnut hair, rosy cheeks, and plump figure serve her well, in accordance with the latest standard of femininity. However, she is a victim of circumstances. Her father's recent death has left the meager dowry of one thousand pounds, which presents the illusion of an unfavorable marriage As there exists minimal monetary gain, any match would be for the companionship of Eleanor alone. The equilibrium of both attractiveness and virtue offers an amiable personality. Although she is reserved almost to the point of appearing indifferent, the case is quite contrary. She sacrifices personal feeling to uphold and protect the reputations of any worthy acquaintance amid slanderous social gossip. These qualities of self-control, prudence, and nobility are exemplified in daily life. Perhaps they are best noted in her treatment of Lucy Steele, an undermining ninny who neither desired nor expected Eleanor's kindness. Eleanor's selflessness is her most outstanding characteristic, as seen in constant care and consideration for those around her. When her own heart is aching under the strain of Edward Ferrars' impending marital rejection, she suppresses it to help her younger sister Marianne heal from Willoughby's own recent announcement to wed another. Even against the incogitant avarice of the former fianc&eacute;s she bears no lasting grudge. The unprejudiced man who seeks Eleanor Dashwood would have to be satisfied on these terms, as they are more precious than fortune, though rarely esteemed in a material world. The conflict of this book that will intrigue most readers is recognized in the title. Sense, comprised of the model attributes of Eleanor, opposes sensibility, a glamorous self-indulgence. It is sensibility that governs the outrageous conduct of Eleanor's and Marianne's former fianc&eacute;s. Lucy Steele, ignorant of Eleanor's affiance to Edward, confides in her of their own secret engagement four years previously. Lucy is beneath the Ferrars family in class and fortune, therefore making their future marriage a disgrace. Willoughby's guise is still worse. He has fathered an illegitimate child with a scoury maid, unconcernedly teasing the affections of many an earnest young woman. Unbeknownst to Marianne, he is currently betrothed to Miss Gray, daughter of a gentleman and recipient of a forty thousand pound dowry. These hindrances, intended for personal amusement, have now blinded them both to true love. The ceaseless appetite of sensibility has devoured their past and is eyeing the present. Will it be allowed to overtake weakened wills? The climax, predictably tragic, is inevitable for such foolish young men. A third party reveals the secret arrangement between Edward and Lucy, thus Mrs. Ferrars' anger resolves her to transfer the inheritance of eldest son to the other brother, Robert. Eleanor is resigned to believe he will wed the luxurious Miss Morton as arranged by his mother. Marianne receives a formal letter from Willougby informing her that any such engagement must be entirely a figment of her clever imagination, a sort of wishful thinking for a girl of her social position. This throws her into a desperate melancholy, which leads to potentially fatal illness. Everyone is at this point unhappy or unfulfilled in his or her expectation of the future. A complicated code of social formality coupled with personal confusion checks the true desires of each.The resolution to all these issues, however, swiftly materializes. Upon learning that Edward would no longer be the endowed heir Lucy desired to marry, her affections quickly change to Robert. Edward then realizes that he never really loved the fickle Lucy, and relies on sense to direct him back to forgiving Eleanor. Willoughby is not so lucky in his domestic outcome. He forgoes personal happiness to marry Miss Gray, as his own fortune has diminished. Ironically, a breach from sensibility occurs after he has taken a pint of liquor, and he confesses his true feelings about Marianne. He acknowledges all that has been lost for the gain of cold, inanimate money. Marianne recovers from her lovesick illness, and marries a family friend who deserves her. All is well in the marrying off of the Dashwood sisters; their fianc&eacute;s attain whatever it is that they desired and deserved in the first place. Despite mishaps and malignancies along the way, sense triumphs over sensibility. I would higly recommend this book to anyone interested in the gentry of the times, or is a fan of Jane Austen. It is truly one of her finest works, set in flowing language and adequate print. The paperback edition is fine for study, but I would select another for one's family library."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility follows the lives of two sisters, Eleanor Dashwood (Sense) and Marianne Dashwood (Sensibility). The story begins when the Henry Dashwood passes away, leaving his estate to his son, who is only half related to the Dashwood sisters. The girls, their younger sister, Margaret, and their mother are obliged to leave and seek residence elsewhere since they are no longer the rightful owners of the Dashwood Estate. Without much money to themselves, and a conniving sister-in-law who keeps their brother from providing them with any income, the family is forced to move miles and miles away near to their obnoxious cousins who have offered to allow a low rent. As if it weren't bad enough having to leave their home, the move brought with it some other negative outcomes. For one, Eleanor had to leave her love, Edward Ferrars (who happens to be the brother of their snobby sister-in-law), and Marianne ends up falling for a man who is not quite what he appears to be. The story follows the lives of the two girls and their tumultuous relationships, as well as their loyalty to one another. Full of twists and turns, broken hearts, reputation-ruining secret, and surprising turns of events, this novel is sure to hold you until the end!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"It's been years since I first read Sense and Sensibility. I was nineteen, and while I loved it back then I've had the feeling that I'd probably appreciate it more as an adult reader. Or who knows, I'll probably end up hating it the second time around. Lucky for me, that wasn't the case. This is definitely not Austen's best work (I'll explain why later), but its simple tale of two sisters who are as different as night and day and how they deal with financial destitution, heartbreak and feelings in general is still wonderful to me after all this time. Those who have read S&S; know that this is the story of the Dashwood women -- a mother and her three daughters -- and how they have to adjust to a new situation after the girls' half-brother inherits their large country estate. The aforementioned readers would also know that the two elder sisters, Elinor and Marianne, fall in love for the first time. Elinor is the oldest and with the most sense, preferring to suffer in silence in order to honor promises and not bring her family unnecessary pain. Marianne, on the other hand, believes in total emotional and passionate abandon. Transparent to a fault, she often ends up hurting and alienating people in her whims and heartbreak. Throw in meddling neighbors, a womanizing cad, a gentleman colonel, a jealous little interloper and you get a story full of intrigue and twists.As said earlier, I love Sense and Sensibility now more than I did thirteen years ago. Austen is one of those writers that draw you in with her sharp wit and satirical look into the society around her. I couldn't put this book down and it proved to be the perfect antidote for my cold and flu. I still think Edward Ferrars is awkward and gutless, Willoughby is a total player (and I so don't feel sorry for him when he explains himself to Elinor. He made his bed, after all. Elinor is far more forgiving than I am), Marianne is whiny and rude and Lucy Steele is probably the nastiest character in the whole book. Mrs. Jennings is still hilarious and I laughed at Austen's ironic narrative. However, this novel is not perfect. There are way too many twists that Austen pulls out at the last pages that strike me as bizarre and like a copout. I won't go into detail in case someone who hasn't read the book is reading this, but those who have read it probably know what I'm talking about. But flaws and all, Sense and Sensibility is still my third favorite Austen (Pride & Prejudice and Persuasion are my two first faves, in that order) and rereading this book was like reuniting with old friends. What a wonderful treat!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"At first I was disgusted with this book; the characters seemed to be mere shadows of characters of P & P and Emma. However, as I continued reading I was pleasantly intrigued by the plot and the characters were more fully developed (although the still are quite similar to P & P and Emma characters). Although I really like P &P and Emma, I would say that their plots and endings were quite predictable. S & S leaves you in suspense and doubt until the last few chapters. A really great read--if you stick with it."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I picked up this book largely due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right. I don't know why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry but the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and only get better as it goes along.The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading. The Enriched Classic edition also has excellent notes to help you understand references or words that may be hard to decipher more than 200 years after the book was written and I found this very helpful."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"What happened to me when I first began reading this novel was that at first try I put it back on the shelf because I thought it was dreadfully dull. Little did I know that I just was not ready to read such a classic, much less a Jane Austen piece. But when I decided to give it another chance I realized that I almost passed such a great opportunity to expose myself to how a novel should be. Sense and Sensibility's twisted plot was a treat, and although the movie was somewhat truthful to the text, I still enjoyed the novel much more. I recommend this novel to people who are ready to face Austen's sometimes frusttrating vocabulary, but trust me, you'll be reaping benefits and will love to read this novel again and again!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is a remarkable novel. Ostensibly a social comedy centered on romance, this book is really an unusually acute description and analysis of the collision of Enlightenment rationalism (Sense) with the Romantic ideas of the early 19th century (Sensibility). Austen uses the romantic entanglements of 2 sisters to present these contrasting views of life. This is a remarkable way of showing how ideas permeate and influence the life of society as a whole. The plotting, laden with clever irony, is brilliant, and the characters are drawn with Austen's usual insight."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is a story about two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who are as different as night and day. Elinor represents &quot;sense&quot; - thoughtful, considerate and calm, while Marianne is &quot;sensibility&quot;: wild, emotional, and talented. The story opens with the death of Old Mr. Dashwood, who leaves his estate to his nephew Mr. Dashwood (the father of Elinor and Marianne). Mr. Dashwood is about to die as well; he passes the estate to his son by his first wife, John Dashwood. Unfortunately, he has nothing of value to leave his second wife and their three daughters (Elinor, 19-years-old; Marianne, 17; and Margaret, 13), though he does manage to get John Dashwood to promise to look after them. But John Dashwood's selfish wife, Fanny, convinces him to give very little. And so, Mrs. Dashwood moves them to Barton, where they live humbly in a cottage on her distant cousin, Sir John Middleton's, land.Before their move, Elinor had met and fallen in love with Fanny's younger brother Edward Ferrars. But Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars are much too snobby to let their relationship prevail. When they moved to the countryside, the two are further separated. Meanwhile, Marianne's romances are just blossoming in Barton. She gains the admiration of Colonel Brandon, but she prefers young, dashing Willoughby, who helps her home one day when she fell and twisted her ankle. This however proves disastrous, as Willoughby abandons Marianne for wealthy Miss Sophia Grey after a long, intimate friendship. Elinor is also suffering from love-loss. She discovers that Edward had been engaged for four years to Miss Lucy Steele, a distant relative of Mrs. Jennings (Sir John Middleton's mother-in-law). At this point, &quot;sense&quot; and &quot;sensibility&quot; seem to coincide and we learn that we must have both &quot;sense&quot; and &quot;sensibility&quot; in a balanced, corroborated manner to have a truly blissful life.The story is very interesting and entertaining, though Austen tended to drone a lot between events. In my opinion, she spent too much time trying to convey Elinor's judgement during parties and other social gatherings (which was wayyyy too often). On the whole, this was a wonderful book, full of fun and surprises (especially at the end!). I highly recommend this book to people at or above the age of 14 (which is how old I am, and I'm telling you it was a bit of a stretch for me - or maybe it was just that I was a little impatient to get my AR reading points). My only advice is have patience, prepare for a lot of rereading (things can get kinda confusing - there were a little too many characters for my comfort), and to watch the movie (fabulous!) afterward. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I have read all of Jane Austen's novels at least once, and&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is, at the moment, my favorite,because it was the last one I read. Jane Austen is - and always willbe - my absolute favorite writer. I love the way she can take just an average person and reveal the hero or heroine inside.This is just what she does with Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. The central theme of this novel is not the love between a boy and a girl; it is about the love between two sisters and how they come to a better understanding of each other when they are forced to endure similar situations and handle them in completely different manners.When each sister, through dissimilar circumstances, discovers that the happiness she had believed she would find in marriage is not to be, it at first appears that Elinor is rather cold and heartless - more worried about propriety than feelings - and that Marianne is more in touch with her emotions and would rather express her grief than take into account how her display will affect those who love her...As for the relationship between the sisters, at the beginning, Marianne seems to pity Elinor for her lack of esteem for art and poetry, and she believes that Edward is not worthy of her. Elinor, while seeing the youthful faults of her sister, always keeps a sense of humour and does everything out of love for her and the rest of the family. In the middle, Marianne believes that no one has ever suffered as she, and continues to pity Elinor for her inadequacies...This is a wonderful and deeply moving novel that should be read more than once to be thoroughly understood and appreciated."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Sense and Sessanbility is one of the greatest novels I have had the pleasure to read.

Its publication in 1811 marked Austen as a huge literary talent, and its significance reverberates even today as contemporary readers re-discover the works of this author so adept at uncovering the foibles of nineteenth century aristocracy.The title refers to the two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, one of whom (Elinor) embraces practicality and restraint while the other (Marianne) gives her whole heart to every endeavor. When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother's wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Their characters, albeit wildly different in their approaches to life, are impeccably honest and intelligent - and their suitors take notice. Elinor falls in love with the shy, awkward Edward, while Marianne's affections are lavished on the dashing hunter Willoughby. As in all Austen's books, love and marriage don't come easily, as affections aren't always returned and social jockeying sometimes takes precedence to true love. In an interestingly twist, the end of this novel brings into question which sister represents which part of the title.SENSE AND SENSIBILITY only hints at the social skewering Austen would use to such great effect in her later novels, and the humor here is only occasional and slight, as this novel adopts a generally serious tone. Parody is largely limited to the gossipy Mrs. Jenkins, who jumps to wild conclusions about situations she knows nothing about. Though arranged marriage and true love figure prominently in all of Austen's novels, this novel focuses almost exclusivity on the prospects of the two main characters, making it less complex than the novels that followed. Reserved Elinor and exuberant Marianne are expertly drawn, with Edward, Willoughby, and Colonel Brandon (whose lovesick hopes for Marianne are dashed again and again) also engaging creations. Except for the first page or two where the circumstances of the Dashwoods are set up through a series of deaths and relations, possibly causing some confusion, this novel is exceedingly easy to follow for contemporary readers.This novel is an excellent introduction to Jane Austen's works because of its relative simplicity (though readers should not dismiss it as simple) and the use of typical themes and social situations. Book clubs and students might want to explore the influence of money on nineteenth century British society as well as the meaning of the title as it applies to both the sisters and the other characters. It is also interesting to note both the helplessness and the extraordinary power of women in different circumstances.Just because this is not Austen's best novel, I could not take away a single star because it is such a delightful book. I highly recommend this novel for all readers."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Sense & Sensibility has been reviewed ad infinitum, but I wanted to say that this is one of the most beautiful books I own.I was looking for a series of classics that I could purchase in hardcover to spruce up my personal library. I stumbled upon these special editions from Penguin Classics, with covers designed by Coralie Bickford-Smith. I love books, but these books still make me giddy with delight when I pick them up. The covers have so much character and they're sturdy. The fonts are classic and easy to read, and the paper is substantial. The ribbon bookmarks, that match the cover, are a really nice touch. The only bad thing I can say, and it's so minor, is that the binding is a little stiff when the book is new.

Though \`sense' referred to intelligence and the ability to judge situations well, \`sensibility' had connotations to having appropriate sensitivity toward moral and artistic issues, linked with the superiority of a person's aesthetical \`senses'. As such, there is room for debate over which sister represents which trait, something seemingly obvious from the outset of the book, but which dramatically changes by its conclusion (which amusingly mirrors the ongoing debate over which traits Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy embody in the title of their story \\"Pride and Prejudice\\").\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was Austen's first novel, and as such is considered her weakest by the critics, though this also means it is also the most accessible and easy-to-read novel. First novels are almost always the most amateurish, and as such it is a much simpler work, from the storyline to the sentence structure, which leads to an easier reading experience than her more complex novels (\\"Emma\\" and the aforementioned \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"). Anyone new to the world of Austen is best to start here as the easiest book with which to ease into her range of novels.The sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood are extreme opposites; oldest sibling Elinor uses her head, whilst the younger Marianne follows her heart; but for all of this, the two are very close. After the death of their father, Elinor and Marianne - along with their mother and younger sister - are forced to give up their comfortable estate to their stepbrother (the product of their father's first marriage) and sister-in-law due to the inheritance law. But before relocating to Barton Cottage, Elinor forms an attachment with Fanny Dashwood's brother Edward Ferrars, a shy and awkward, but good-hearted man. Hoping that her feelings are returned, but unable to make any advances, Elinor travels to Barton Cottage in the hopes that he will return to her there in the near future.At Barton Cottage, the girls make many new acquaintances, in particular the loud and bustling matriarch Mrs Jennings who is determined to marry the girls off as quickly as can be, and the quiet and gentlemanly Colonel Brandon. As for the romantic and dreamy Marianne, she's fallen hopelessly in love with the dashing John Willoughby after he rescues her from a rainy day and a twisted ankle whilst out walking in the countryside - much to the dismay of the smitten Colonel Brandon. Already concerned at Marianne's overly romantic disillusions, Elinor is concerned at her rather wanton behaviour in the presence of her new beau, but is then has her attention drastically diverted on being introduced to a Miss Lucy Steele who has a secret to share about Edward Ferrars...The story winds its way through the girls' negotiations with the society they live in, the restrictions held upon them and the individuals which hold power over them - not with the same deftness that Austen displays in later novels, but still with much thought-provoking commentary. The family's plight in being reduced to guests in their own home at Norland, at the mercy of their somewhat dim-witted brother is particularly revealing as to the social injustices of the time, and though the frustrations of the girls' status is never explicitly stated, it is readily evident for anyone willing to read between the lines. At the end of the day, all they have is each other and the fervent hope that they will find both happiness and security in marriage. Their trials in love are perhaps the most heart-rending experiences of any other Austen heroines, (where romances are either touched by irony or poignancy) in the fact that a happy ending is not guaranteed for the sisters and that their future happiness depends on a good match - it particular it is hard not to feel your heart break for Marianne, whose unswerving belief in her own feelings and the raptures of her heart are so cruelly put to the test.The characters of Elinor and Marianne are utterly irresistible. Elinor is the sort of person you would desperately wish for in your life in order to benefit from her good sense and protective nature, whilst Marianne is utterly charming in her romantic flights of fancy (in fact she's so winsome and dreamy that it's almost a shame when she gains some \`sense' at the novel's end - one would have been contented to have her indulge in her dreaming forever). Though the novel is told almost solely through Elinor's eyes, in several ways Marianne is the main protagonist, who goes through the most trials and changes. Whatever your own opinions, the two provide an excellent foil for each other, and at all times the sisterly bond between them is apparent.There have been so many adaptations of Jane Austen novels throughout the years, though to my mind none is better than Ang Lee's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" starring Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. As I was reading the novel, I often found myself switching on the DVD in order to compare the two. It is a beautiful film, loyal to the themes, storyline and characters of the novel and in some cases improve upon it, and so comes very highly recommended as a companion piece to Austen's first novel."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"The audio is great if you can play it.

Here we follow the adventures of the Dashwood sisters as they find love in an class-conscious Regency England.The Dashwoods, impoverished when their father dies, are forced to live in a small house in the coutry on 500 pounds a year. With such unfortunate pospects as those, it will be difficult for the elder two, Elinor and Marianne, to find good marriage prospects. Marianne finds herself falling in love with the dashing Willoughby, who ends up being not all that he appears. Elinor, the more sensible of the two, falls for Edward Ferras, a match that seems much more suitable. But again, things are not what they seem, in this delicious tale of love. The young women must use their sense to see what is really there, and their sensibility to see what will be (unfortunately, Marianne uses neither, much to the detriment of the family). Colonel Brandon is the unassuming, unlikely hero who falls in love with Marianne and saves her from death.Having read this book several times, I can safely say that it gets better and better with every reading. I also recommend the 1995 film starring Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant, and others."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I don't know which book of Jane Austen, I love more. Sense and Sensibility is just so romantic. Pride and Prejudice is awesome and Emma is just fabulous. To think that Jane Austen wrote those books so long ago just goes to show that women have felt pretty much the same about love for always."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"The present novel is about two young women, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. They are part of a family living in Sussex. The family is of average financial means or a bit higher than average but the family loses its home when the father dies; and, the mother and sisters move to a smaller cottage in Devonshire. The novel follows the romances and complications of the two girls. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read.Based on the three novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.Based on what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a young Jane Austen and honed for over a decade before being published. By way of comparison, it is an interesting read but less complicated than \\"Mansfield Park.\\" It not as interesting nor as witty as \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" Still, it is a delightful and a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I had the pleasure of reading two of Jane Austen's books, Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, and loved both of them. Austen writes in such a romatic way that you wish you could be there in person to experience every word. Anyone who found the book to be boring, needs to re-read it again. It speaks of honesty, integrity and love that is lacking in todays books. Elinor in, Sense and Sensability, was a strong and smart woman while on the other hand, the younger sister, Marianne, was weaker but became a stronger individual because of the strong bond between herself and Elinor. Every young girl should read Austen's work because it protrays love as good and bad and shows that no matter how much someone can love you, there maybe a hidden agenda behind that affection."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"The funny thing about Austen's work is that, although not much happens in her books, they are always interesting.

Again, as in \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the underlying theme is marriage. There is a lot of misunderstanding due to partial, or erroneous, information. The sense and sensibility is shown in how the sisters handle the different predicaments.The cast includes, among others, the sisters, Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and John and Fanny Dashwood.This edition has the complete text and not much else. The introduction has some historical information about the author and about the publishing of the book. There are only two pages of this.

At every moment of the book vanity is criticized, from its opening to its ending. Many of the characters, even if not actively participating in the story, are vain as they can be.In the very opening of the book, as Mr. Dashwood passes, there is the interference of Mrs John Dashwood , who, in the fear of losing part of her wealth ans status, has her husband, a weak character, reduce the pension that he had promised his dying father that he would provide to his half-sisters.When Edward Ferrars declines to wed Miss Morton, Mrs John Dashwood quickly sets a fit and expells his future sister-in-law from her house due to her disapproval to that engagement that is, in their views, less than favourable. Edward also falls victim to the rest of his family , who disconsiders him as a member of the family due to his choices.Willoughby is another example. In love with Marianne, he chooses to marry a rich woman who will provide him of his extravagances (as he himself later admits) than to open his heart to true love. He is also an example of cruelty, for he leaves a young girl he had earlier seduced to her own luck.A last exaple will be Lucy Steele. Fearful of what might happen to her, she is secretly engaged to Edward Ferrars, but leaves him for his own brother who can provide her comfort in a better way.Although vanty is not exactly the theme of Sense and Sensibility , it is at every moment of the book criticized, and vanity in its own way supports the plot."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"It takes little time for the reader to become completely engrossed.

Both are just as refreshing, but I must say, I did not enjoy this one as much as P&amp;P. For instance, not as much humour was injected into the story. And, now that I think of it, the story is not very much fast-moving. The story lacks of excitement and it drags in every scene. As in, there seems to be a lot of time spent in reading about a particular scene where nothing much actually happened. All in all, this book did not make me read it for a second time.

The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash.

There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love.

Postage was fast. A great transaction. Thank you."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Though not as dazzling in wit as Pride and Prejudice or as passionate a love story as Persuasion, Sense and Sensibility gives the modern reader a true feeling of what it would be like to be a woman of limited means falling in love at a time when Romance was a matter of public discourse. In Regency England, many Britons hailed Samuel Johnson, Isaac Newton, and philosophers of the Enlightenment as voices of reason and logic who relied on empirical data rather than religion or emotion to support their assertions. Perhaps as a reaction to this matter-of-fact and somewhat dry philosophy, there arose a movement called Romanticism which hailed instinct, spontaneity, and feelings over careful analysis. While ostensibly a novel about two sisters' journey to love, Sense and Sensibility is also an extended metaphor comparing the competing intellectual philosophies of Reason and Romance.The title Sense and Sensibility is confusing to many modern readers due to the words' virtually identical meanings in today's vernacular; however, in Regency England, \`sense' was synonymous with 'logic' while \`sensibility' meant something more along the lines of \`sympathy.' In the case of the novel, Elinor Dashwood is a woman of sense whose attitudes toward love are so rational that they leave the reader (and her sister Marianne) wondering if she is capable of falling in love at all. Marianne, by contrast, is so in love with the idea of love (as sensationally depicted in literature and the arts) that she is quite literally swept off her feet without understanding the character of the object of her affection. As the story progresses, Elinor and Marianne must deal with the not always pleasant consequences of their very different approaches to love.Although the novel focuses on the two sisters, Austen supplies the reader with plenty of entertaining supporting characters. While Fanny's calculating manipulation of her husband John Dashwood results in the impoverishment of the Dashwood girls, it also provides the reader with an entertaining twist on the classic stereotypes of the evil sister-in-law and the henpecked husband. Likewise, Mrs. Jenkins' always uncomfortable references to husband hunting make the reader squirm in her chair, even as Sir John Middleton's endless commenting on hounds elicits eye-rolling.The men of the novel do not disappoint, either. Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and Colonel Brandon all portray characteristics that make them worthy of the heroines' attentions, though they are quite the diverse crowd. The reader may even find her own attitudes towards love deepen and evolve as she reacts to the dashing Willoughby, steadfast Brandon, and thoughtful Edward.In sum, this novel is beautifully written and well worth reading at least once, if not several times."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"A story of two sisters who search for marriage partners. What is nice about Jane Austen is the quality and quantity of conversation, so that the reader imbues a sense of the 1800s among the countrified gentry. The memorable characters run the gamut from respectable, cultured Colonel Brandon to his opposite John Willoughby, who is out for a good-time with the ladies. The lady between them is Marianne Dashwood--inexperienced, beautiful, artistic, and idealistic. She is lovingly censured for her candor and romanticism by her older sister, Elinor Dashwood--rational, proper, loyal, and stoic. Before they marry an appropriate partner, a whirlwind of misjudgments, gossip, and surprises threatens to upset their chances at happiness."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is about a family of women: Mrs. Dashwood, the mother, and Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, the three daughters, who are made to relocate as a result of their father's death. Their home is given to their gullible half-brother who means well and their manipulative sister-in-law who does not mean well at all. Settling in a cottage given to them by a generous distant relative in Devonshire, the girls experience romance and heartbreak.I've heard of Jane Austen's work before, and I read this as a prelude before I read Pride and Prejudice. I have to say, even though it was engaging towards the end, in the beginning I had trouble plowing through the introduction. There was nothing there to grasp my interest, only long, insipid descriptions of the surrounding countryside, and a long build-up to the main plot. About halfway through, when Marianne begins her romance with Willoughby, I actually found myself wanting to read the book and thinking with excitement and a feeling of suspense about what would happen next.The characters weren't perfect, with both flaws and redeeming qualities, such as Elinor, who is very intellectual and polite, but may be missing out on life because she's very reserved, and Marianne, who likes to live life to the fullest emotionally, but is completely devastated when bad things happen to her.I liked that it gave me a feel of what life was like for people in the moderate and upper end class in the early 1800's, as I'm used to stories such as Oliver Twist, where the main subject is life in the low slums, so it was nice to see the other end for a change. In regard to the storyline, it was very interesting in the latter part of the book, when its it is full of romantic betrayal and unseen engagements, and people turning up unexpectedly.This was a good introduction to Jane Austen's books, but based upon to the admiration she has received, I don't believe this is her best, and I'm ready to see what she can do in Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Not as good as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" of the same author, although some chapters are brilliant.

Sense and Sensibility describes the trials and tribulations of the young Dashwoods who strive to keep their senses about them despite the dramatic flurry of relationships. There are a number of wonderfully entertaining characters, including Ms. Jennings with her loud squawking and gossiping, as well as the Steeles. And, of course, she neatly wraps up the ending as always.Jane Austen is simply brilliant in conveying the idea that indeed, sense and sensibility may not always guarantee happiness and certainly, neither can money and matches of material gain. More was gained than was lost- both knowledge and true happiness were the result of simply answering to the heart and not to the powers that be who called for marriage on the basis of dowry. The Dashwoods, for all their gentleness, sincerity, and society, certainly deserve all of the contentment and satisfaction which can be afforded to them.Anyone who is looking for a cozy book and craving some entertainment and emotional support from a relationship- this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"...It is a suggestion in the way that you read this book.

The pages literally fell out as she was reading, no matter how careful she was. There are also numerous typographical errors throughout. This is a shame, because the format is quite attractive and the print size is very good. I wrote a letter of complaint to the publisher, but received no reply."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was first published in 1811, although it appears that Jane Austen had worked on various versions of the novel since the 1790's. It is less polished than the later, classic \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", but it contains all the familiar elements we expect and enjoy in an Jane Austen novel.The novel is built around the two Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, whose contrasting styles are the \\"sense and sensibility\\" of the title. Elinor is the elder sister, patient, considerate and practical. Marianne, on the other hand, knows no halfway love of anything in life.As the story opens, their father has just died, leaving the family estate to his son by a first marriage and his second wife and three daughters in near destitution. The widow and three daughters move to a small cottage on the estate of a distant kinsman in Devonshire. Elinor leaves behind the cherished Mr. Edward Ferres, a shy but loyal and seemingly compatible friend, who has however strangely not offered marriage to Elinor. The beautiful Marianne attracts two suitors soon after their arrival in Devonshire, the older, sober and respectable Colonel Brandon, and the young, handsome, and charming Mr. Willoughby. Willoughby wins Marianne's heart, and an engagement is expected momentarily.To Marianne's immense disappointment, Willoughby unexpectedly departs for London without proposing. The two sisters are persuaded to travel with an aunt to London to take part in the social scene. In London, the sisters will learn shocking news about their respect suitors, and each will learn to cope with the help of the other. The journey back to Devonshire will set the stage for dramatic developments for Elinor and Marianne.Austen's sense of dialogue and ability to set up scenes staging are less acute in \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" than in later novels, but she makes up for it by a more emotional approach to the characters and some savage if indirect commentary on the social customs of the day. Those readers whose introduction to the story is the excellent 1995 movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" will find a longer, more subtle, and complex story in Austen's novel. This novel is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is about the Dashwood girls Elinor and Marianne.The time is the Napoleonic years of the nineteenth century though nothing so sordid as the little Corporal's baleful visage will appear in this novel of domestic romance. The girls are forced to leave their home following the death of their father. The estate they live at is invaded by their dullard half brother John and his insufferable wife. The two girls, their mother and younger sister Margaret are off to the West of England to live at Barton Cottage being supported by John the brother.In this novel Miss Jane Austen tells two convoluted love stories. Elinor who is the oldest and most sensible of the girls is in love with Edward Farrars. Farrars is an Oxford man who eventually goes into the ministry. He has been involved in a longterm engagement to the odious but ambitious Lucy Steele. Elinor is heartbroken at this lost love but keeps her stiff upper lip in order to minister to the needs of her younger and more emotional sister Marianne.Marianne is in love with the rake Willoughby who has had a torrid affair with Eliza Williams. He jilts Marianne but lives to rue his rejection of her.As in all Austen novels all is resolved with a wedding. Elinor will eventually wed Edward Farrars and live in a parsonage. Her sister Marianne will become Mrs. Brandon as she weds an older and wiser manColonel Brandon.Along the way we meet the lovable Mrs. Jennings, the fautous Steele sisters and Robert Ferrars the stupid brother of Edward Ferrars. Mr. and Mrs. Palmer are also satirically viewed as a dull married couple living in luxury.It amazes me that no one in a Jane Austen novel really works! As Emma Thompson who directed the film \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" quipped one wonders why these women don't go out and get a job! In an Austen novel there are the inevitable long walks and conversations, mixed romantic signals with mixups aplenty and the occasional dance across the ballroom floor.Austen can be tedious and it can be a challenge to keep up with the characters and conversations. She is a great artist with a very narrow focus; a few middle class families living in the country with a love story to be told. Within this baliwick she is peerless, witty and wise. She brings a few hours of quiet where the only sound heard is a bird singing or a carriage rumbling up to the house.Sense and Sensibility published in 1811 is a classic of English literature. Jane Austen is unsurpassed in the realm of Regency romance!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I have recently read the novel Sense and Sensibility for an English class project. It was a great love story but it was a very difficult book to read. I wasn't used to reading books that were written many years ago in that type of writing so it took me some time to understand some things.I love to read love stories and dream about how my life will turn out. Jane Austen did a good job of writing this love story. I think it was so sweet how Colonel Brandon loved Marianne since the moment he met her and in the end, they were together. I was also very happy about Edward and Elinor that they loved each other and another engagement was about to keep them from ever being together but thankfully things worked out.I would recommend this book to anyone who is a great reader or used to Jane Austen's writing. Otherwise, I suggest you just go out and rent the movie becuase it pretty much follows right along with the book and it was very good."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I just finished reading this book and I have fallen in love with it.

The characters of the story will tug at your heart strings as you laugh out loud. Absolutley stunning!!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"\\"Sense and Sensiblity\\" is a masterpiece. It's greatness and universality, besides it's pure entertainment value, can be extolled all day long. So its very easy, when you are dealing with a masterpiece, to lean on clich&eacute;s to describe a work.But I don't want to do that. I will, however, tell you that for young romantics who believe in Mr. Right and long walks on the beach, this novel takes you through the breathtaking ride of falling, captively, into love and falling, quite willfully, out. Also, you vicariously experience the emotional stupor of coming out on the other side of such a relationship exhausted...and wiser. Also, if you're like me, you can wrestle with the tale of a woman who believes in the security of decisiveness. Her conflict is how to be sensible in an insensible world, and then, finally, how to reconcile the whimsicleness in herself. Where does the mind retreat and the heart take over? \\"Sense and Sensiblity\\" lastly is a tale for sisters. A truly unique relationship, Jane Austen captures the complexity of sisters--persons, peers even, that are equipped with the same tools in life but that often are very different. And despite these differences, share an eternal bond that can only be severed by themselves. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is worth the time and money any day."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Unfortunately, this is one of those novels that depend on style to carry its weight, so after seeing the movie and discovering beforehand what was to happen, the book was a bit bland (though through no fault of the author's).

For me, Sense and Sensibility is another classic and classy example of this master at work. While not as complex to read as something like Shakespeare, the formal language and speech of the nineteenth century is more subtle and difficult for many modern readers, it's not a fluffy beach book. I think it does the modern-day reader good to read a story that requires one to slow down and savor the words and the subtleties of interactions as well written by a great author. This is your chance.Read the book and then watch a movie version- such as the one with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. You could do the same for Pride and Prejudice, but for that movie version I highly recommend the A&E; version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.

It was about a widow lady wanting her two marriageable age daughters find a suitable husband. All the players in the story seem to have this same pastime and providing tmes and events where it can take place. The verbage was in old English, sometimes with different meanings than today and the narrater didn't always make voice changes to distinguise who was talking. It became more interesting toward the end and I'm sure in the day it was written it was a good story."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Even though it has been two hundred years since the world was first introduced to sisters Marianne and Elinor Dashwood's financial, social and romantic trials, their story remains for me, as fresh and vibrant as any contemporary story you might read of, experience yourself, or hear tell tale of today. I give full credit, of course, to Jane Austen. Her understanding of human nature and how to craft emotions and characters into an engaging story remains unparalleled. Add to that a delightful twelve hour and forty-three minute reading by the accomplished British actress Juliet Stevenson's polished interpretation of memorable personalities and you are primed for unsurpassed entertainment. Here is a brief description from the publisher:\\"When Mrs. Dashwood is forced by an avaricious daughter-in-law to leave the family home in Sussex, she takes her three daughters to live in a modest cottage in Devon. For Elinor, the eldest daughter, the move means a painful separation from the man she loves, but her sister Marianne finds in Devon the romance and excitement which she longs for. The contrasting fortunes and temperaments of the two girls as they struggle to cope in their different ways with the cruel events which fate has in store for them are portrayed by Jane Austen with her usual irony, humor and profound sensibility.\\"It is amazing to think that SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was Jane Austen's first published novel. As a debut author she showed incredible understanding of characterization and plot development. Many of the personalities contained in this novel remain the most memorable for me of her entire canon. The affability of Sir John Middleton, the persistent meddling of Mrs. Jennings, the droll indifference of Mr. Palmer and the malleable weakness of Mr. John Dashwood are played against the narrow greed of the unscrupulous Fanny Dashwood and her officious, spiteful mother Mrs. Ferrars. These secondary characters really make our heroes and villains shine, and withstanding the two heroines Elinor and Marianne, it is amusing to see how Austen plays with our emotions in guessing who the heroes will be and how the morality will play out. SENSE AND SENSIBILITY does have a few plot wholes and loose coincidences that readers will be raising eyebrows over, but it remains a novel wholly entrenched in the passionate joys of youthful love and emotional loss, cruel social snobbery and biting social reproof as relevant today as it was in 1811.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Ultimately, I enjoyed this book, but it took quite a long time to get into it. I found myself rereading many paragraphs, as I really needed full concentration for this one. I will say that the book did keep me guessing throughout. Though I knew that things would turn out well for the heroines, I truly did not know what was going to happen until the very end."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility was Austen's first published novel and the third of hers I read. I must admit, I did not like it very much at first. I found it too somber compared to some of her other works. I liked Elinor well enough, but Marianne annoyed me to no end. The men weren't that great either. Willoughby was doubtless a scoundrel, Colonel Brandon was boring, and Edward was a spineless wimp. That's not to say I did not like the book, far from it. Just in comparison to other Austen novels it didn't hold up.All that changed on my last rereading this year. It was such a surprise to see all the humor in the book! How did I not notice before? Yes, it does deal with some dark subjects but there are more than enough funny moments to go around. Mrs. Jennings stands out in particular, especially the scene where she overhears bits of Colonel Brandon and Elinor's conversation. Brandon is of course, telling Elinor he intends to give Edward the living at Delaford. But Mrs. Jennings, not wishing to \\"eavesdrop\\", can't hear everything and jumps to other conclusions. Another funny scene is a man taking forever to pick out a particular toothpick case in a shop, who turns out to be none other than Robert Ferrars. And I must not forget to mention Elinor! Anyone who imagines her as all prim and proper from the movies should take a closer look at the book- she is full of snark! It made me love her even more.My opinions on the men changed as well. Not Willoughby, of course. But on closer reading one notices that Colonel Brandon, while he may seem \\"stuffy\\" is actually quite the romantic. And Edward really is an honorable man. Yes, you all want him to just dump Lucy for Elinor but he felt he was actually doing the right thing by Lucy in keeping his promise to her. And there was the fact that she could have sued him for breaking the engagement...And he's not really so dull either. I noticed he even teased Marianne about Willoughby at one point. He did have some personality after all!So, all in all, the male characters are not my favorite of Austen's heroes, but I do appreciate them a great deal more. Marianne does still annoy me at the beginning but I feel for her more now, and admire how she realizes the error of her ways in letting her sensibilities take over all the time. The relationship between Elinor and Marianne is really well-written, more the focus than either of the romances. Austen's writing skills were not quite to the level of sophistication that she would achieve with her later works like Persuasion, but still pretty darn good! So, if you already love the book, good for you. If you don't, I recommend rereading and keeping in mind the things I noted in this review. I hope you'll learn to love it as I have."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"SPOILERS FOLLOWJane Austen\\"s \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" tells the story of the Dashwood Sisters, Marianne and Elinor, imbuing the siblings with respective liberal and conservative worldviews. The book is at its absolute strongest delivering illuminating commentary that, in some ways, validates the viewpoints of each sister.The sisters are introduced into society, receiving visits from chiefly the courtly but shy Edward Ferrars, the mysterious Willoughby, and the wise Colonel Brandon. Each of these men reflect on the emotional lives of the sisters, mirroring hopes, potential loves, foolish anticipation and vanity. In the two sisters, Ms. Austen creates a fantastic representation of competing and supportive sisterly, as well as sibling, complexity.A major complaint is that the book feels very creatively stifled, stifled in the lives of the women as well as in the events of true import in the story. In some ways, it begins and ends in the drawing room, and never ventures much to other topics which would be more all-encompassing. It's possible that Ms. Austen is making a sweeping societal statement about the proscribed lives of Englishwomen in her time. However, the storytelling features cast a general slowness over the plotline that precludes much forward momentum."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Believe it or not I had never read this book.

Sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, left with little income following the death of their father, go to live with some distant relations and meet men they wish to engage. However, there are complications, as both seem to be quite unsuitable.I was continually struck by the eloquence with which this book is written and the gracious manner in which the primary characters endeavored to conduct themselves. Did people really speak to each other that way in that era? How interesting that even one described as \`illiterate' can issue such a statement as \\"I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in sucha way, but perhaps there may be reasons--I wish I might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to beimpertinent.\\" The articulacy of the text was almost confusing at first because the poor standards by which most modern authors express themselves is what I am used to reading and speaking. However, that difficulty was soon overcome, and I found _myself_ both speaking and writing with greater vocabulary and altered cadence.I was also surprised that I could find a tale consisting mostly of the conversations between the idle members of British society so suspenseful. I found myself invested in the characters and their eventual happiness so much that I was quite eager to turn the page.Highly recommended.

They each have met the man they want to marry, and are both convinced that the young men feel the same. Everything seems to be going along smoothly...or does it? Both of their romances collapse, and they are left to deal with them sensibly. However, both stories end surprisingly, giving each girl her happy, although not necessarily expected, ending.The copy of Sense and Sensibility I read was the Insight Edition by Bethany House Publishers...in addition to the original classic story, they have added footnotes throughout the book, explaining details about the culture and history, the films based on the book, Jane Austen herself, etc. I found them to make the book even more interesting, even though I already enjoyed the story for itself. Also, in the back of the book, they have added several \\"questions for conversations,\\" which seem like they would especially help younger readers analyze the story better.If you're looking for a classic romance, this would be a good read for a lazy summer afternoon.(Bethany House Publishers provided me with a copy of Sense and Sensibility - Insight Edition in exchange for this review)"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is the classic tale of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, two sisters who share a remarkable bond of love despite their differences. Marianne is given to emotionalism; Elinor is refined and self-controlled. Both women indulge in unhealthy extremes of these mindsets throughout the story and yet they find that they are in many ways alike as they walk through life and search for love.Jane Austen is one of my favorite historical authors. Her characters are real and I found that I could identify with Marianne especially. The only thing I found to be questionable was the presence of Margaret. She was rarely present and did not seem to contribute much to the story.The version of this book that I read was very insightful. Throughout the story there were notes in the side margin that explained certain words that may have been unfamiliar to some readers. The notes also mentioned parallels between Jane's life and the lives of her characters. Having seen the 1995 version of the movie, I had some expectations as to what the book would be like. As with most films that are based on books, I found that I enjoyed the book more than the movie simply because the book gives so much more depth to the characters and their situations."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"From BethanyHouse, I received a copy of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility Insight Edition. The Insight Edition has \\"trivia, notes, and inspiration to amplify this beloved classic.\\"This book has \\"helps\\" which include, but are not limited to, historical and cultural details and definitions, facts and tidbits from Austen's life that parallel or illuminate the novel, themes of faith, and my favorite: parts of the novel that just make us smile.I have tried *unsuccessfully* to read this entire book. Every time I begin, I get so sleepy I have to take a nap. I loved the movie (with Hugh Grant), so I'm just not sure what's up with me. At any rate,Sense and Sensibility is about three sisters and their mother. The main focus is on two of the sisters: Elinor & Marianne Dashwood. Both young ladies experience love and heartbreak. Of course there are characters you can't help but dislike and the wording that is used to get their point across in a polite yet \\"no-reply-is-allowed\\" is humorous. The notes added into the margins of the book are great helps. This book also includes questions at the end for discussion."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"On the 27th January, 1817 Jane Austen began work on a novel that is now known as SANDITON. It was never completed. Her declining health robbed her of what she dearly loved most, writing, and on the 18th of March 1817 after penning 22,000 words she wrote the last lines of chapter twelve and put down her pen. Four months later at age 41 she would succumb to what is generally believed to have been Addison's disease.Set in the emerging seaside village of Sanditon on the Sussex coast we are introduced to a large cast of characters dominated by the two minions of the community: Mr. Parker a local landowner with grand designs of turning a fishing village into a fashionable watering place offering the therapeutic or curative benefits of sea-bathing and his partner Lady Denham, the local great lady who has \\"a shrewd eye & self satisfying air\\" and cares little about the community and only her pocketbook.The story unfolds from the perspective of Charlotte Heywood, a young lady experiencing her first trip away from her family as a guest of Mr. and Mrs. Parker. Sanditon is populated by a comical ensemble of residents and visitors who upon Charlotte's first acquaintance are altogether different than they later appear. Lady Denham's nephew Sir Edward Denham is handsome, amiable and titled but is prone to long inflated speeches in the most pompous and affected style in an attempt to reinforce his own notion that he is a romantic character born to seduce women \\"quite in the line of Lovelaces.\\" (Lovelace refers to the villain Robert Lovelace in Samuel Richardson's 1748 novel CLARISSA who rapes and ruins the young heroine.) He has designs upon Lady Denham's companion Clara Brereton who he shall either woo with affection or carry off. Clara is a poor relation of Lady Denham's who is maneuvering to be her heir and in direct competition with Sir Edward for her favor.Also sharing the spotlight is Mr. Parker and his four siblings, three of whom Charlotte is told are sad invalids, but after their arrival talk a great deal about their maladies but exhibit little consequence of their afflictions. Here we see Austen at her comedic height characterizing the foibles of those who attach illness as an identity and hypochondria as their religion. The one bright light of hope in the novel is Mr. Parker's brother Sidney who we know of only through letters and others descriptions. He may be the only character besides Charlotte who has the potential to set things in balance with his sense of humor and honest opinions. Sadly he is destined to remain the mystery hero of Austen's oeuvre. Add to that a lineup a nest of plot ironies to raise an eyebrow at business speculation and hypochondria, and a sharp jab at the effluvia of novels and poetry and you have a narrative that whizzes along until an abrupt halt just when we are hooked.The uncompleted novel is a great loss to literature but also to the characters who after a bright and comical beginning are left with uncertain futures. What does remain is more than a novelty of Austenalia. SANDITON'S levity despite the author's failing health when it was written is quite remarkable. On first reading I thought it quite energetic and satirical, similar to the burlesque humor of Austen's NORTHANGER ABBEY. I then put it aside and did not reflect on it further. My second reading after several years brought an entirely new reaction. Austen has taken a new and fresh direction from her usual three or four families in a country village and sets her novel not about an individuals struggle but an entire community. Money is still the fuel that powers the plot, but her physical descriptions of the landscape and town are entirely new in her cannon foreshadowing what may have been an evolution in her style. SANDITON is a gem that no Austen enthusiast should miss.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Jane Austen's first published novel, Sense and Sensibility, tells a timeless tale of two sisters search for true love and the heartbreaking circumstances they endure along the way. Bethany House's new annotated version of this classic offers readers historical and cultural details about England in the early 1800s, facts about Austen's life, references about films based on the novel, themes of faith, and comments about the novel's characters and plot.Unlike many editions of this novel, Bethany House's version contains a foreword of only two pages and does not give readers a detailed, scholarly analysis of the novel and Austen's life. Instead, this book provides facts and tidbits of information on the pages' margins. I found this edition simple to navigate and many of the notes offered interesting and helpful information to better understand the story. Another unique feature of this version are the scriptural and moral reflections sprinkled throughout the book. The editors often quote verses from Proverbs.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Jane Austen classics and does not need a detailed introduction about the story and the author's life.Note: I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of reviewing it."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I had the book within 5 minutes of ordering.

Being an avid reader, I thought I'd LOVE to read the books too since books are so much better than anything put to the screen. Boy was I wrong. I just couldn't get through it. It's written in such a form that it's hard to follow and understand what she is talking about. I've truly had to read and re-read sentences and paragraphs to get what in the world she is talking about. Here's an example: \\"She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present. The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible.\\" OR: \\"The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first recommendation.\\" HUH??? See what I mean? I had to work too hard at understanding much of the book and it was no longer relaxing or fun to read so I gave up.

The series is undoubtedly the best one to own by anyone who is more than casually interested in the great author and her work. The introductions are flawlessly helpful to whatever detail of background the reader wants. The notes explain references and changed or obsolete word usage and are easily skipped by anyone who doesn't want them. The texts of the novels are the most accurate scholarship can now produce. They are mostly the same as in the OUP edition of the novels, but much easier to read because of the typeface chosen. The series also has juvenilia and the unfinished text of \\"Sanditon,\\" omitted from the OUP edition. In the end, I cannot praise the Cambridge series too highly."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"One of Austen's first books to be published, Sense and Sensibility tells the story of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Having lost their father, they had to start life anew, since their half-brother and his wife were not willing to take care of them. So Elinor, Marianne, their mother and younger sister move to Barton Cottage. In their new home, they experience heartache and pain as they mature and grow.Elinor, the elder sister is extremely sensible, even in matters of the heart. When she learns that Edward Ferrars, the man whom she loved, was going to marry Lucy Steele, she takes it in stride. She is sad, but that does not slow her down. Marianne, on-the-other-hand, is very dramatic and emotional. When Mr. Willoughby breaks her heart, she decides she is never going to recover. She starts getting sick often and being melancholy. The story ends well, but both sisters learn to become less rigid in their respective personalities. Elinor realizes that showing emotions is alright and Marianne decides that living life in the past is not useful. Hence, Elinor gains some sensibility and Marianne some sense.Once again, Austen has outdone herself in this novel. Her characters are well-developed. Like in her other novels, Austen's writing paints a charming picture of the life and times of the 19th Century English. The story line is very captivating and Austen goes into great detail describing every aspect. However, it seems that towards the end she wraps everything up very quickly. She mentions Lucy Steele and Willoughby's whereabouts and feelings; she mentions Elinor's and Marianne's respective marriages. She does this without using her usual descriptive language. But other than her ending, this is an excellent novel.Armchair Interviews says: If you have not read Austen before, Sense and Sensibility is the novel to start with!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I picked up this book largely due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I have listened to all of Jane Austen's novels in the unabridged audiobook form. Sense and Sensibility (narrated by Sarah Badel) is my personal favorite. Every character has a wonderfully distinct voice. The narration is lively and captivating. You will love it! Pay particular attention to the voice Miss Badel gave to &quot;Robert Ferrars&quot;....it's hilarious!!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This was a great novel telling of the secretive and not so secretive anguish of two sisters. Love and broken hearts play a large role in the plot, and, at times, it is a little much. You really feel your heart going out to the two sisters, feeling their pain. This is an extraordinary story. However, after reading Pride and Prejudice before this one I was a little dissapointed. None the less, this is a must read for anyone who enjoys stories of english society, stories of love, and other Jane Austin novels."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Kate Winslet who also starred in Sense and Sensiblity lent her beautiful voice for this great story.

Both Elinor and Marianne love each other and try to understand one another. Elinor tries to protect Marianne by attempting to counsel her to curb her sensibility while Marianne advocates her own romantic outlook to her older sister. What each of them fails to realize, until the novel's end, is that without the presence of the other in times of trouble, they would not have a leg to stand on.Both Elinor and Marianne take each other for granted and it is to the reader's gratification that Elinor and Marianne do find satisfactory, and happy, endings when they each adopt a little of the other's philosophical outlook."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Although it's still witty, the tone of this novel is not as light-hearted compared to &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; or &quot;Northanger Abbey.&quot; This gives the story a darker and more realistic feel, certainly more depth. The two Dashwood sisters' situation could not be worse indeed. (without money and rank and lost their father &amp; estate) They had a more difficult life than other Jane Austen heroines. We feel sympathetic when reading this story. In general, this book is witty, ironic, yet serious, warm, and very human. It's an irresistible and rewarding reading experience. Also, don't forget to see the movie (screenplay by Emma Thompson) and enjoy the audiobook (narrated by Kate Winslet) as well."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"The book tells about the remarkable family of Dashwood whose family home was located in Sussex. The book is about two sisters who are as diametrically opposite as two can be. Marianne is the younger sister, and she is eager, imprudent and excitable. Elinor is much more sensible than her young sister, and her voice is always the voice of reason. But it's the world that Ms. Austen always brings to her pages that is so captivating. She more than many others can create a little piece of the world that the reader has the privilege of discovering and then learns to love, just like Ms. Austen's characters do. This is what puts Ms Austen's books so much above the norm in this particular genre."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is a witty, diverting book that was a pleasure to read. I was eager to read another novel by Jane Austen after so thoroughly enjoying &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, and was far from disappointed. Austen creates wonderful stories full of depth, elegance and an endless supply of witticisms. There are so many terrific quotes in her novels that it gets hard to pick a favorite. Don't be hesitant to pick this book up - a year ago I would have laughed if someone had told me that I would be a Jane Austen fan. I'll never regret giving it a chance, so I hope that you will too."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I picked up this book largely due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right.

In classic Jane Austen style, this was a story that followed two sisters through love, heartbreak, and confusion. The story as a whole is very relatable for women everywhere: the classic paths of love that was meant to be, love that could never be, or unrequited love are all followed by the main characters, Elinor and Marianne. Another great aspect of this book was all of the twists and turns; you never knew who was telling the truth or what would happen next, which made it a very fun read.

When I started it I really did not know what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. I will say though that this book is hard to get through at times, due to the old language used. But if you stay with the book, it will be worth it. The characters are wonderful, and you will find yourself wanting them to be happy. The Dashwood family gives a &quot;girl power&quot; message that makes it even easier to enjoy. Also, this book is easy to relate to, for everyone has known a Maryanne or Elinor before, maybe you are like one of them. I could identify with Maryanne, because I am involved in everything (and love it all) and I know I share my feelings too much. Although this book will be enjoyed more by young females, anyone would like it, for it also has a lot of humor in it used to display the dramatic situations the Dashwood sisters keep finding themselves in.

I actually listened to this novel on audio, and the narrator was so good it was difficult to stop listening to get anything else done. Austen draws us into the world of Regency England, where women are looking for husbands, preferably rich ones, and men are looking for beauty, preferably accompanied by fortune. But there's more to this story than that. I found myself occasionally laughing aloud as the narrator read; some things that were amusing in 1811 actually still are. Jane Austen pokes fun at her characters, and many of their foibles are recognizable as things we would mock today. One example is the description of conceited young gentleman (many of the ladies refer to him as a \\"cockscomb\\") who is seen in a jewelry story arguing with a clerk over the kind of jewel-encrusted toothpick holder he needs to purchase.

The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I finished my first Jane Austen novel, Pride and Prejudice, 2 days ago and was quickly hooked.

Honestly, my eyes did not get tired at all."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I've read four Jane Austen novels in rapid succession, having been rapidly ensnared byEmma (Modern Library Classics), and avidly seeking more of this fabulous writer whose greatness I was amazed to have only just discovered. (The others werePride And Prejudice, andPersuasionAs with all the great classics found on Amazon, many readers have already offered excellent reviews. In these cases, I have felt little need to add my own, unless I feel I have something new to offer. In the case of Sense and Sensibility, I do indeed believe the need to offer my view, to do this book what I believe is better justice! Here's why:Many reviewers profess what is apparently the party line on Austen's works-- that while they \\"love this book and give it 5 stars\\", they (feel obliged to) then damn it with faint praise by adding \\"EVEN if it is one of her a. earliest, b. \\"not as poslished\\", c. \\"not as complex\\", or d. \\"not as funny, well-written,... etc. etc.\\"I must take issue!1. Even if any or all of the above are so, (which I could waste many lines on disputing, to no useful purpose), why would any of these attributes of supposed inferiority be relevant to enjoying this book for itself? They themselves belie such relevance by noting their own great pleasure in reading THIS Jane Austen book. If indeed JA is a brilliant master novelist (no contest here), any and all her books is worth reading for its own sake, as each of them, and as no doubt JA herself would hope. The only reason to compare the finer distinctions among them would be to recommend which of her books one should read IF one could only read one or two. Indeed, not a one reviewer would I dare say recommend any such thing! Sense and Sensibility, as does each of the other 3 JAs I've read, has its own unique treasures to yield to the reader, and it is for these that each must be appreciated and each and all read.2. Sense and Sensibility is a great analysis and example of the power of FILIAL love to transform a person for the better, and thereby to enable her to gain happiness. In my view, the interest in placing the two \\"opposing\\" virtues of Sense and Sensibility in each of the two sisters, Elinor and Marianne, is not simply to showcase the benefits and pitfalls the key virtue confers to the holder, but, much more illuminatingly, the value of the love between the two to cause the other to grow into a woman who can have BOTH in proper degree. Indeed, the book's ending will prove this!3. In Sense and Sensibility, there are many themes developed extensively which are not a focus of the three others I read, aside from #2. One is demonstrated in the character and actions of Lucy, initially presented as an almost deceptively minor character. (I wont say more, but this alone is a real gem worth reading the book for.) Another is the evolution of the sisters' regard for a number of important characters in the book. Each of these is developed and explained beautifully--the regard for Willoughby, for Mrs. Jennings, for Captain Brandon, Edward. These changes are effected not only by and within each sister, but by and within several other characters...with most edifying effects for the education not only the protagonists, but for me!4. Finally, Sense and Sensibility features key themes also showcased in the other three books, e.g., the power of real love to change one's character--one's pride and or prejudices for example (in that named book!), or the well-known to all (but beautifully illustrated examples of) wisdom, that how one reacts to love and the obstacles it creates or are created in its way, depends on character, and luck...but the love itself rarely is under one's control! And yet, of course, since each book's treatment of this theme is unique and reveals a host of unique vicissitudes it can involve, S and S and each of the others is well-worth the reward of the unique discoveries it offers the reader.I need say no more, and direct the reader to start \\"clicking\\" all four of the above into your carts!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"It's hard to know what to say about an unfinished draft of a novel... Was it interesting? Yes, in a way... Do I want to know how it ends? Yes, I think... Do I think the part that exists is good? Well, no not really. It's not Jane's best work. Or maybe it's just not like her other work. It seemed uneven--too rushed in some parts and too slow in others. Overall, there was not much character development - that is, we didn't learn who the characters are based on their dialogue and actions. Instead, we were mostly told what to think of them, either by the narrator or by Charlotte, the heroine. Charlotte has been sent, on only a very short acquaintance, to stay with the Parkers in an up-and-coming, soon-to-be fashionable seaside town called Sanditon for a fortnight or so. We are introduced to a varied, but not particularly interesting or memorable (yet) cast of characters over the first 12 chapters, which are all that exist of this last novel Austen was working on before her untimely death.As for this Hesperus Classics edition, it is very nice. Printed on good paper in a easily readable font, it is better quality than I would have expected for a small, relatively unknown, unfinished novel. Bravo to them, as I have no idea when I would have gotten around to reading this without the incentive of a nice new, pure copy (as opposed to the one I have which another author completed). While I don't understand why there is a rooster on the (presumably final) cover, it is just fine by me and I like the cover flaps very much. You don't often see them on paperbacks, but they are very useful for holding notes, marking ones place, or just generally making the book stronger and more luxurious-looking than a regular old paperback. The Introduction was illuminating and the endnotes were few (only 5) but quite helpful. The intended audience is clearly those who are familiar with Austen and are \\"completists\\" of her work.[...]"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This beloved classic, Sense and Sensibility, never fails to please. This recent printing, however, takes the beloved classic a step further. Interlaced onto the pages are facts, trivia, and inspiration, enhancing the reading of the classic. The \\"insight\\" brings humor and knowledge to the page - giving historical facts to help the reader understand the context, showing humor in an otherwise vague passage, and giving movie references (from the many cinematic versions of the story). A Jane Austen fan will definitely enjoy this \\"insight edition\\" of one of her classics."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Dear Jane Austen Fans,We all know the story of Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen. The Dashwood children loose their father and the prominent estate goes to the half-older brother, John. The sisters must move on to a lower standard of living together, a new little cottage. While living in Barton Cottage, the girls search to find love. This very beloved story is a true classic.Excitingly, a new version of the book has just been released. This edition has everything a true fan could want in this book. There are several side notes throughout the book with very insightful trivia. Who knew that \\"furniture from this time period was far from comfortable since springs weren't used until 1828 (p. 119)?\\" Or that the \\"average life expectancy was only 40, but if you made it past 20 and were wealthy, you could hope to live nearly as long as we do today (p.41).\\"At the end of the story, the reader will find a list of 12 questions for conversation. Although I wish it had questions instead at the end of each chapter, this book with it's side-notes and extras still make it a great addition to any fan's library. It would be great to use in a book club as well.So my advice to you is to get this copy to add to your memorabilia wall of Austen books today!

I have read many of Austen's stories and have seen the characters portrayed in movies as well.Plus I enjoy reading books set during this time period.I enjoyed the many variations of notes not typically in study / Amplified editions. I was pleased at the easy to read format they used to include the notes as well.(that the comments were labelled with symbols and in the margins near the text being commented on. The information did change how I viewed some of the scenes that I had previously read or seen which was surprising to me.I didnt enjoy the comments that were listed of a personal nature or that were there to be funny! Ranking of the novels characters which was marked by a frowny face or the smiley faced comments were highly distracting to me. But I know that is a personal preference so I didnt take it too highly into account when giving it a rating. (they are two out of seven of the notes listed!) Many readers may enjoy these comments and would in fact find them entertaining and engaging. I could easily see this text being used in a classroom situation with young readers as well as being read by reading groups / Book clubs. The Group discussion questions were what I thought to be well written and thought provoking.So, if you have met the characters of Pride and Predjudice before or are reading this story for the first time this addition would be one I would reccomend.Note: A copy of this book was provided by the publisher for review purposes.

When I receivedPride and Prejudice (Insight Edition)as a review copy, I was worried that the text would actually have been changed or modernized, but the words of Austen remain the same, to my great relief. Instead, this version intersperses personal observations, movie trivia, historical background, spiritual insights, and other tidbits of information throughout the text in side boxes.I would also recommend this for younger readers or any other readers who are not familiar with Austen's time period, since it explains some terms and customs of the era that they might not otherwise understand. Any Austen trivia fan will also enjoy it.Some of the comments were rather too obvious and didn't add too much, others were really quite funny. The added info/commentary was really a good mix of just plain good fun and informational. The conversation questions at the end would make this very suitable for book club use, as well.I prefer the side box format to the usual footnote or margin format for \\"amplified\\" versions. It added the information without taking over the book.This is my third version of Sense and Sensibility, and I have to say it might be my favorite.

I couldn't help but wonder how the classic might have been improved.Historical and cultural details and definitions from England's early 1800s, facts about Austen's life that enhance the storyline, as well as many other notations, conveniently interspersed along the side margins make this an easy-to-use tutorial.I suggest that Homeschoolers, students of all ages and stages would benefit by the read or rereading. As a retired high school English teacher, I would chose this edition to teach."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is more than 200 years old. The world was a dramatically different place in the early 1800s. The culture was different, the language was different, the governments were different. The entire state of mankind was completely different.So the question is, does a 200 year old book still pack a punch in 2005? Or has it become an archaic, dusty tome that alienates any reader with its unintelligable prose and mindless story? The answer, I believe, is a little bit of both.Clearly, the pre-Victorian writing style varies greatly from the Hemingway-esque brevity that is encountered so often in modern times. Often, Austen's writing is confused and cluttered. It can seem overly pedantic, trivial, and circumlocutious. There are entire paragraphs that can, and should have been, omitted because they are utterly flippant and redundant. The writing style was, for me, a barrier.The society in which the story unfolds; that is, the cultural background, is also quite distant from our own. If anything, Sense and Sensibility is a study in history. We see what life was like back then. We hear it from a primary source. And, for the most part, the petty pursuits of the luxurious upper-class, the countless balls and parties, and the mindless squabblings of money grubbing lords are fine. The reader accepts it as part of the history.The story itself is where the true beauty of the book is revealed. The story is timeless. It proves, refreshingly, that one does not need a massive war or wrenching poverty to create a good yarn. Yes, Elinor and Marianne live ridiculously priveleged lives (and often complain about their \\"misfortune\\"), but we all can identify with the romantic aspects of the tale. We can identify with the characters, the people, who inhabit Austen's world. And the characters are, quite simply, incredibly colorful and richly created. The characterization is where Austen shines.So the main drawback to this story is its age. If you can get past the age of the book or even enjoy it intellectually, you will uncover a gem of a novel. Austen's subject (unlike her prose) does not alienate us at all. Instead, it reacquaints us with the yearnings and struggles of love and friendship. If you can slog through some of the more clunky passages, there is a lot of insight and beauty in this book, as well as a fairly good story."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility is a classic novel. It's a very entertaining book. A few pages into this book, I already had taken sides for and against the characters. They are wonderfully believable. Some I disliked; some I liked. The ones I didn't like were money grubbing types who must have been pretty common in that period. The one I most liked was Elinor Dashwood, the eldest Miss Dashwood. She was very pretty and had good sense. Throughout the book, I found surprises. These were unexpected events that twisted the plot. Jane Austen uses the English language very well. This book is almost contemporary in language and is eminently readable. In fact, Sense and Sensibility is a classic worth owning.I recommend Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility to all readers who want a fascinating cast of characters and a good read."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This is a story of two sisters, marrian and elinor, which, though very similar in some aspects, and share a very similar unfortunate love affair, are total different in their behavior and approach toward matters of the heart. Tough both emotional in both seeking love and addressing it, one lets her emotions take over just about everything else, and the other have better balance between love and logic.I'm not much of a period novel fan, and didn't like the emma tompson movie so much - so i wasn't too keen on reading this book at first, but as i got into the pace of the story, i enjoyed reading it. what i mostly liked about this book is the fact that though it was written a few centuries ago, the emotions describe in it, and the moral this story tells are still very true till today. the way we all need to balance our inner world with consideration and respect for the outer world.I've been helping two friends through a pretty messy break up while i was reading this book, and i kept quoting parts of it for them, trying to explain how the choice between &quot;being a marrianne&quot; and &quot;being an elinor&quot; is their's and how dealing with grief and lose might be effected by their own approach to love and life in general.I recommend this book to anyone who ever suffered from a broken heart and had to deal with a break up. It's inspiring and interesting"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"While a quick review of any NYT book review will make clear the many ways to evaluate the worth of a book, I've found that, with novels, 80% of my assessment can be delivered by answering two simple questions: 1) did I consistently desire to turn the page; i.e., did the narrative flow unremittingly retain my interest and curiosity, and 2) did the ending leave me with both the ethereal wish for the story to continue in perpetuity and lacking that, the more prosaic desire to immediately read it again.I recently read Pride and Prejudice and, having answered both questions with a resounding \\"yes,\\" expected more of the same with Sense and Sensibility. Unfortunately and very unexpectedly, I was disappointed. The book was successful in holding my interest but in a far from fervent way. Rather than caring deeply for the characters and anxiously awaiting the unfolding of their fates, my curiosity was clinical in nature, wondering at the outcome without particularly strong partisanship. Compared to the convincingly developed, full-bodied relationships between Elizabeth and Darcy and Jane and Wickham in P&amp;P, those of Elinor and Edward and Marianne and Colonel Brandon come off as shallow, cold and flimsy. To be fair, the ill-fated love of Marianne and Willoughby is carefully developed and generates sympathy. However, the lack of substance behind the Elinor/Edward connection and the lack of credibility supporting the Marianne/Colonel Brandon match left the book's ending with a flatness that far from inspired the desire for a continuance.The other missing factor that really set P&amp;P apart was the wry humor of Mr. Bennett. While S&amp;S is not without similar elements, they are primarily limited to comments of the narrator and lose the effect of being embedded within the dialogue of the primary characters.Is summary, this is not a book that you will put down with disinterest before finishing but is also not a work that will leave you exhilarated by the experience.

She was a clever lady whose shrewd insight into human nature and English society allowed her to make effective use of satire, and her plots have enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested in what is going to happen next. The dull, dirty world Austen inhabited has limited appeal to me so I can't say the book was highly attractive (which is part of the reason I ranked it with a 6.)

I expected wonderful stories like Louisa May Alcott's books, but then maybe I am listening with the wrong \\"ear\\". Maybe I was suppose to listen to the sound of the words like a James Joyce novel. I've read a lot of period novels written in that time and place, so it's not a lack of familiarity with the era or the language.I will say that it shows a very real contrast between the use of emotion controlled by intellect vs. total emotional immersion in the subject of romance."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Jane Austen is remembered fondly for her warmly written romantic comedies. The comedy is subtle and difficult to spot for the untrained reader; in contrast the romance is thickly spready throughout her books, often too easily spotted.Sense and Sensibility was Austen's first published work. It is not her most successful novel. By the time Emma was written, Austen was a more successful author. Emma is funnier than Sense and Sensibility; it also posesses a more realistic romance. However, there are positive traits of her style present in Sense and Sensibility.Sensibility, easily slots into the genre of Romance. It concerns two sisters, unfortunately deprived of their family inheritance, and their search for love. One sister, Elinor, is sensible, while her younger sister, Marianne, is a passionate and silly romantic. Austen, in fact admires both her leading ladies contrasting traits, but it is easier to sympathise with Elinor. She puts up with a lot of torment in the novel but never allows herself to break down, unlike Marianne who almost lets a lost love end her life.Happily, there is a trace of comedy running through the book. As usual, the principal humour comes from the characters (the delightfully droll Mr Palmer), but Austen herself has fun with her narrative and enjoys creating set-ups to confuse both the reader and the characters. There is always an element of mystery in her novels. Who will end up with who? And this heightens the enjoyment of the novel.Sense and Sensibility has a lot to offer it. It is a primitive work from a great writer. It has hampered by the ridiculously happy ending. Marianne and the Colonel should never have matched. There is a gloss of reality (often lacking in the book), however when we find out that Willoughby (the bad guy) actually ends up living a happy life. It is a rarity in Jane Austen's novels that the villian (if you can call it a villian) of the piece finishes the novel in a merry vein.I wish I could tell you it was fantastic or indeed awful but I share Elinor's traits, in that I'm not one for exaggerated emotion. It's good but not great."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Personally, I think that Sense and Senibility was a good book, but lacks the wit that was constantly present in Pride and Predjudice.While there was conflict in Sense and Sensibility (both in the sister's jealousy and the the scorn from their lovers later), Austen didn't allow her characters to really address the conflict directly. (For example, why didn't Willoughby explain himself to Marianne, as opposed to using Elinor as a go-between?)While this may be the subtle temper which reflects Austen's style, it also makes it more difficult for the reader to discern any true sense of feeling.The plot is &quot;okay&quot; - boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy scorns girl. In Sense and Sensibility, it's done twice, in parallel. The only difference between one and the other is how each girl copes with it. But, from reading several of Austen's books, I've found that plot development wasn't the author's strong suit.Jane Austen's real strength lies in character development. Her major characters are well developed and dynamic. An interesting aspect of Sense and Sensibility is how Elinor, the logical and practical sister became more emotional, while the ever-feeling Marianne developed a more practical view of her situation by the end of the book.This isn't one I would recommend for folks that have never read Jane Austen before (read Pride and Predjudice first), but it is a book I would recommend it to anybody who likes Jane Austen's style."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I had to read this book for my college novel course. It hooked me on Jane Austen. I am currently reading Persuasions, which is the last book I have to read to have finished all her books! And then I can go around showing off how cultured and well-read I am. Blah blah blah.Anyway, this book has a really great heroine, Elinor, who is perhaps my favorite heroine because she's so much like me, introspective and cautious, and carefully controlled. Her sister Marianne, who is said to be the \`life of the novel' and \`more likeable', is actually a silly, foolishly romantic girl who is passionate and loving. Sure, you love her, but you don't really like her (at least I didn't) and you certainly don't respect her. Elinor however, earns your respect and admiration for her steady character and sense. If you don't know, \`sensibility' is the opposite of sense, it means emotionality and imprudence etc. (I learned that in college!!!) It isn't a common word nowadays, so I thought I'd let you in on the plot. Elinor is sense, Marianne sensibility, and you should be more like Elinor etc. It's a story with a moral, you see, like Pride and Prejudice (Elizabeth is prejudice and Mr. Darcy pride).The mother, Mrs. Dashwood, is really weird; she isn't always after her daughters to marry well. She is looking for romance as much as her girls are, as opposed to Mrs. Burton from Pride and Prejudice, who rejoices even when her daughter marries a good for nothing, simply because she's married. It was a good book, with surprising and unexpected plot twists that are pretty complicated, plus loveable characters and a good romance. It almost had me in tears at the end which is a miracle because I never cry, and almost never am moved to tears by a book or movie. Great book, try it out!!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Anyone who gives this book a bad review has no class. Jane Austen is one of the most celebrated writers in history. You just have to get past the fancy words. Beneath that is a classic and romantic story. Sense and Sensibility is the best romance novel I have ever read. I would recommend watching the movie first, though, if your Old English vocabulary isn't very strong."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I am only 13 and I loved the book.

However considering the era it's to be expected."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Jane Austen's books do not thrill me. The illustrations in this edition are nice, but the story is long and tedious reading."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"When Mr. Dashwood dies, the family estate passes to his son, John. The widowed Mrs. Dashwood and her three daughters are left homeless and with little money. A kind relative offers to rent them a small cottage on his property.The two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, find both romance and heartbreak in their new home. Elinor is sensible and restrained, so that even when she falls in love with Edward, she keeps her feelings to herself because she knows that marriage is not a possibility. She has no money for a dowry.Marianne, on the other hand, wears her heart on her sleeve. When she falls in love with handsome playboy Mr. Willoughby, she doesn't care who knows about it.Both sisters experience heartbreak before they find love and happiness."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Taking place in Norland, England, in 1811, Jane Austen astounds her wide audience with yet another uplifting and eye-opening novel. Sense and Sensibility explores the life of the Dashwood family, consisting of the new widow Mrs. Dashwood and her two daughters, the composed and affectionate Elinor along with the sensible and spontaneous Marianne. Inheriting all of his father's money, John Dashwood visits his sister Mrs. Dashwood and gives the three devastated ladies a good share of his inherited money. During the visit, John Dashwood's wife, fanny, brings along her sensible older brother, Edward Ferrars, who develops a very close relationship with Elinor Dashwood. Although they are given a hard time by Fanny, Mrs. Dashwood, and the later promiscuous old friend Lucy Steele, Elinor and Edward establish and progress their love throughout the entire novel. As their love grows, Austen compares and contrasts the trait of sensibility, possessed by Marianne, and the trait of sense, possessed by Elinor. She does this through the two sisters' interactions with their significant others.Just like almost all of Jane Austen's preceding novels, Sense and Sensibility dives into the themes of love and judgment. The reader learns how the characters in the novel become blind when they are in love, and the effect this has on their judgment.Although it is a great read, I do not recommend it to just anybody. Readers must stay attentive to the multiple characters that are introduced throughout the novel; readers must also have strong patience because the novel is written with the old English dialect of the early 1800's. This is one of Jane Austen's best novels, in my opinion. In her novel Mansfield Park, she merely spends the whole novel demonstrating the progression of love in a New England town. In Sense and Sensibility, however, not only is the reader able to explore the development of love in a relationship between two people, but also the progression of individual character qualities, such as those of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. In totality, this novel is one of Jane Austen's best works."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Once criticised as being \\"least interesting\\" of Auten's works, I entirely disagree. Sense & Sensibility is one of my favourites, if not favourite Austen novel. Perhaps not as \\"light, and bright, and sparkling\\" as Pride & Prejudice, it is still a wonderful and enjoyable read, and definitely not as dense as Mansfield Park. Personally, I could not put this book down, when usually with Austen I read a chapter or two a day.The dual heroines is one of the most interesting literary techniques here, interlaced with the usual infuriating members of society (John and Fanny, Lucy Steele), silly women (Charlotte Palmer) and men (Robert Ferrars).My only criticism of the plot would be the somewhat rushed ending, but the story goes through regular \\"ups and downs\\" and enough changes of scenery to keep interest.I often prefer the Penguin Classics versions of the Austen novels. They are easy to carry around and have comprehensive footnotes as well as interesting and thought-provoking introductions and appendices. In this version I prefer the original introduction by Tony Tanner, but the introduction by Ros Ballaster is interesting in its discussion of the opposing themes of the novel i.e. first and second attachments, scream and screen, and of course, sense and sensibility.My only criticism of the Penguin Classics version is the cover art, which I don't feel encompasses the true characters of Elinor and Marianne. While I appreciate the use of 19th century art on the Penguin Classics covers, I never feel that they truly embody the character (except for maybe sickly Fanny Price). As a side note, I do like the cover art of theSense and Sensibility (Oxford World's Classics)edition.In ending, if you are an Austen fan, and haven't read this, you must. Furthermore, if you are considering Austen I would recommend either Sense & Sensibility or Pride & Prejudice as first reads. In any case, the Penguin Classics version will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, guided respectively by rational sense and passionate sensibility, navigate love and heartbreak together in their own inimitable styles. The plot is simple and straightforward, with only a couple of surprising twists. This is good, though, serving only to clear the stage of contrivances and to give plenty of room for the entertaining and memorable characters to play out their schemes, hopes, follies, and humanity. It's this latter quality that breathes life and interest into characters who could in less capable hands have been reduced to paper-thin archetypes. In Jane's hands, her characters feel like someone you might still meet in a corner of England that time forgot."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I love the narrator, I love her accent. It took me a little longer to figure out the whole story since I didn't catch her for the most part. But I think it is not uncommon for a foreigner to find some difficulties in getting used to her accent.I like British accent although sometimes I cannot understand them."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Okay, I wrote a review on this novel about 4 days ago, and I don't think it's going to show up on here, so I'll give it another try.I can't help but love Jane Austen. She is my guilty pleasure read, like a Jackie Collins of the early 19th century because her novels are just drenched in drama and scandal. They are not really a thinking man's novel, just fun stories to read. I also enjoy the romance aspects of her novels because they are classy, not like the trash smut you read in today's modern \\"romance\\" stories. I feel almost uncomfortable and embarrassed when I read a modern romance story. Well anyhow, when it comes to drama and scandal, Sense and Sensibility does not disappoint. When you commit to the story, it really takes you in. I really enjoyed the protagonist, Elinor, but I was unhappy with Austen's Marianne character. It seems as if Austen could truly identify with Elinor because she did a great job developing her character as level-headed, proud, and classy. Perhaps she took a little Elinor from herself? Now, in the beginning of the novel you get drawn in by Marianne. She commands a good third of the book with her story and her character starts off well developed. You get a true feeling for her impetuousness. She is emotional, passionate, wears her heart on her sleeve. The novel is so interesting until the end. The end completely disappoints. Now I don't know if Austen became uninspired at the end of the novel or just didn't know how to end it better, but it falls completely flat. Like I mentioned before, you get interested in this Marianne character and you know how she is, but then at the end she decides one day to become like Elinor?! Just like that?! An impetuous person like Marianne would not and could not do a 180 with their mannerisms. Then, Austen does no justice to Marianne by having her marry at the end of the novel. It is just so dubious it doesn't make sense. Austen also wraps up all the scandal and drama in almost 3 pages. How convenient! That was just bogus to me. But the rest of the story is so good I would still recommend this, especially to Austen fans. If I were to make a recommendation to a new Austen reader, I would recommend Pride and Prejudice over Sense and Sensibility. It is more concise and it is a shorter novel."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This book, like her other books transports me back to that time and place so it feels as though I am a part of that moment in time."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"For the ladies can you imagine a world in which you have no career options except that of being a wife, a world in which everything depends upon how much money you have, and if you're at a loss for lucre, then you'd better marry into some moolah! You don't do anything except go to dances, mooch off richer relatives, and hope you marry somebody before you become a spinster! If you're a man, it's pretty much the same thing, except your career path is more open. You can do a lot if you have money, but like most of the male characters in Sense and Sensibility, why bother?! You got a rich relative to pay your way through life! Just spend your time hunting, whether it be game or a woman, especially a rich woman, if you're a debauched ex-noble who's lost his fortune in disreputable consumerism. All these examples pretty much sum up the world of Jane Austen as portrayed in Sense and Sensibility.Three sisters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret...Well, let's forget about Margaret, since she's basically a non-character in the book....Well, 2 sisters, Elinor and Marianne are on the prowl for a husband, a well-off husband, since their father has died and left control of his estate to their half-brother, who happens to be married to an uppity and greedy wench of a woman who cuts them out of most of their dead father's money and land. So the sisters and their mother are \\"banished\\" to a charming cottage in the English countryside. Oh, the horror of it, while a lot of England working class and poor were just lucky to find something to eat for dinner in that time period. Elinor is the common sense sister and hopes that Edward loves her, but she can never figure out what his feelings for her are. But she's not going to do anything rash to find out. Just keep a cool head Elinor. Marianne is the exact opposite, youthful, idealistic, passionate, and brash, and falls for the first guy that satisfies her sense of the dashing Byronic hero, even if he might be a cad!I don't know, something about this book rubbed me wrong, even though I thought it was pretty good. All of the characters just seem like parasitic bums, even if they are psuedo-aristocrats. They're lazy, judgemental, and obssessed with appearances, even though they hardly ever have the courage to look under those appearances to see the truth. They really have no activity in their brains. Like animals they are only seeking comfort and security, nothing beyond the most basic of human needs. There is no aspiration to anything. Well, except aquiring money. At some points in the book you wish all of these people had been in France during the Reign of Terror. Then they would have found out their real priorities. I guess, while I could understand the problems of the girls, I didn't sympathize with them. While the spoon they were born with was not silver, at least they had A spoon. It was left to Dickens and Balzac to see how the other half lived. To me, the book's only redeeming value besides Austen's excellent and entertaining style, was to show just how far women have come in the past 200 years, and how lucky they are for being born in the 21st century instead of the 18th!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is a pretty slow book. I felt as if I had to wait and wait for something interesting to happen. When something did happen, I found it to be pretty predictable. I think that some parts of this old book have been used in other films. I know I am not all the sudden good at predicting what happens in stories. I think it was just this book. I was confused in the beginning of this book because I spent most of the time trying to get all the Dashwood people straight. After I became familiar with the characters, I started working on the plot. I have to say that the plot was a bit uninteresting at times. When it was interesting, and not predictable for me, I really enjoyed it a lot. There were several surprises in the book. I enjoyed how tricky the plot was. Toward the end of the story I began wondering how the plot was going to wrap itself up. The ending of the book was quite unexpected for me.One of the things that I liked best about this book was that it was so tricky. Once I thought the movie was going to end a certain way, but I was immediately proven wrong. I think this happened at least five times. The bulk of the story may have been a little dry, but with all of the twists in the plot of Sense and Sensibility, I have to say I was entertained. One of the lower parts of this book would have to be the ending. It seemed as if in the space of about three minutes everyone went from melancholy, to perfectly content with their lives.Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed this book. Most Austen fans do not praise this as her best book. Most of them overlook disliking the book because it was Austen's first book. I cant be to sure because I have never read any other Austen books. However, after reading Sense and Sensibility, I am definitely going to dig in to another Austen book really soon."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Austen's &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, I read every page with sheer delight. Although one of Austen's earlier works,her wit and evocative story telling nevertheless shone through. Concerning her characters, each one, from the caricature to the heroine, kept me amused, entralled and enraptured. Although not everyone would share my excitement for this book, I don't care, because I can fully relate to both Marrianne and Elinor's plight, feeling poignancy for Elinor's hidden love and jealousy for Marrianne's passionate relationship with Willoughby.Definitely one of favourites."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I confess I own many editions of Jane Austen's works [individual and collected sets]. These Barnes and Noble editions are true value for money - in this instance, Sense and Sensibility is beautifully bound, with a cloth spine, and has a lovely portrait on the cover. The text is not too small unlike some other editions, it makes for comfortable reading. The book itself is sturdy, as it is in hardback, but not unwieldy - it fits nicely into my hands. Besides the main text of Austen's novel itself, it has added features - a brief chronology of the world of Jane Austen & Sense and Sensibility, an introduction, the main text, as well as useful endnotes, a list of adaptations of the novel [in both film and book format],comments, as well as a list of resources for further reading [biographies and letters of Austen] and criticisms. In all, a value buy."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I went into this without expecting much but was soon surprised by how engrossed I became in this classic! This is essentially the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne, who are different in temperamentbut experience similar disappointments in romance. It's interesting to see the contrast in their personalities in deealing with their heartbreaks. Prudent Elinor puts up a strong front, confiding in no one and worrying no one while Marianne becomes the very picture of wretchedness.It started off slowly but once you get into the main plot it's hard to put this one down! You hope for each of the sisters to achieve happiness in love, you smile at Austen's wit in observing the upper social strata, you condemn those who are against the sisters and their family and you eagerly read on for each new development. And, of course, there's the lovable supporting cast of characters who at first are viewed as obnoxious but become dear friends in light of true folly from others. And let me just leave off by saying that I loved Mrs. Jennings from the start ;)."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Can you imagine a world where there was nothing to do but walk and talk? In the historical fiction novel Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen it proves that a story can be more interesting than what it appears to be. One character represents sense (Elinor) and the other represents sensibility (Marianne). The story which takes place in the early 1800's when two teenage girls who move to the country with their mother and sister to live on their cousin's estate. While there, the two girls enter into several relationships. Some will last and others will not. Marianne meets the \\"dashing\\" Willoughby and they soon fall in love, but when Willoughby goes to London things take a turn for the worst. \\"Old\\" Colonel Brandon soon expresses his love for Marianne which complicates things even more. Elinor becomes close with Edward Ferrars (their sister-in law's brother) and eventually makes it clear she has fallen for him, but when Lucy Steel tells Elinor a big secret her feelings are forced to change.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a romantic, comical novel. This book is suitable for anyone about 12 and up. Overall, I really enjoyed Sense and Sensibility. I thought that it was a story that was fairly easy to grasp and it taught me a few things about life back in that day. Very few really learn what these people went through. For us, playing piano, playing cards, writing, taking walks, and visiting may not sound that ideal. This is because we are exposed to so many more interesting things, but you learn a lot from seeing the way the girls coped with having a much simpler life. My only complaint about this book was that since it was written so long ago, some of the language is difficult to comprehend. I would rate these book 4 stars out of 5.

It is called the Insight Edition. It was with great anticipation that I opened the pages of this book for I had never read it before. I had only watched the movies which lent me great enjoyment. I knew, having read other Austin classics that the novel would be much better than the movies, and Jane (and her story) proved to be a most amiable companion.What sets this edition apart from any other, except Pride and Prejudice, is the wealth of added information from a Regency historical aspect, tidbits of opinion which evidenced delightful humor, and movie trivia. I even learned there was a S&S; under the sea movie which I had heretofore never heard.Astoundingly, I was somewhat surprised at myself because I truly enjoyed someone else's pain and agony for a change of pace. For fully 30 chapters, Marianne was just as full of passion and sensibility at Willoughby's disgraceful treatment of her as any movie depicted. Elinor was just as full of suppressed passion and sense as the movies depicted her, and of course Mrs. Dashwood was so much more sensible than Mrs. Benton of P&P; fame, which made for quite satisfying reading without the frustration of stupidity.If you do not have a copy of Sense and Sensibility for your library, I suggest you pick up this copy.

Several of the comments made me laugh out loud! (Though I wonder if Jane Austen would appreciate the humor in it!) For example, about halfway through the book, there's a conversation with \\"proper, flowery\\" English verbage between Elinor and Marianne, talking about a love interest. Then, in the side note it says: [7] As Beyonce says: Put a ring on it!

Austen's greatness lies in her backing out of the box of 19th-century literary moralism and seeing the areas of gray in human relationships and within the individual. Over and over again in this \\"early\\" work (Austen was only 41 when she died) we see characters acting in unexpected ways, even while social strictures are so much in evidence. The most outstanding characters are those who go against the social grain, and Austen unfailingly creates classic foils against whom these interesting individuals can stand out. Entertaining, existing in a stable social world, clever, and funny, this novel is like \\"comfort food.\\" If you're in the mood for a diverting stroll into another century, let this book be your guide. I also highly recommend the Penguin Classic that has an introductory section by Tony Tanner (if you can find it). Tony Tanner's brilliant insights into Austen and this work deeply enriched it for me. But this section must be read after you read the book."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"So you want to read SENSE AND SENSIBILITY. Great choice! Jane Austen's first published novel (1811) can get lost in the limelight of her other \`darling child', PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, but is well worth the effort. There are many editions available in print today, and the text can stand on its own, but for those seeking a \`friendlier' version with notes and appendixes, the question arises of how much supplemental material do you need, and is it helpful?One option is the Oxford World's Classics new revised edition of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY that presents an interesting array of additional material that comfortably falls somewhere between just the text, and supplemental overload. This volume offers what I feel a good edition should be, an expansive introduction and detailed notes supporting the text in a clear, concise and friendly manner that the average reader can understand and enjoy.The material opens with a one paragraph biography of the life of Jane Austen which seemed rather slim to this Austen enthusiast's sensibility, and most certainly too short for a neophyte. The introduction quickly made up for it in both size and content at a whopping 33 pages! Wow, author Margaret Anne Doody does not disappoint, and it is easy to understand why after eighteen years publishers continue to use her excellent essay in subsequent editions.Amazingly, the introduction is not at all dated. The material covered is accessible to any era of reader, touching upon the novels publishing history, plot line, character analysis, and historical context. Doody thoughtfully presents the reader with an analysis of the major themes in the novel such as; the dichotomy of sense and sensibility as it relates to the two heroines Elinor and Marianne, the portrayal of negligent mothers, men represented as the ultimate hunter, secrecy, deceit and concealment, and the crippling impact of the inheritance laws and primogeniture on women during the Regency era. Interlaced with Doody's interpretations are her astute observations of Austen's writing style with references to pages in the novel and outside sources. The entire essay is well researched, populated with footnotes, and an enjoyable complement to the text.The notes on the text explain the editorial trail since the novel's first publication in 1811, whose subtle changes and their significance might baffle the nonscholars! Moody. The select bibliography is indeed select, and includes many editions that deserve recognition as the best of what is available in print on Jane Austen's life, works and critical analysis. One of my favorites listed is JANE AUSTEN: A FAMILY RECORD (1913) by William Austen-Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh, revised and enlarged by Deirdre Le Faye (1989). I was also pleasantly surprised to see a category including film versions and commentaries which is often overlooked by other publishers.The chronology of Jane Austen's life lists both significant events and what transpired historically in matching columns. The choices are relevant and interesting with the exception of two events that this writer found humorous; - 1795 Jane Austen flirts with Tom Lefroy, and in 1815 Humphry Davy invents miner's safety lamp. I have yet to be convinced that Austen's flirtation with Tom Lefroy had a significant impact on her life, nor am I clear how a clergyman's daughter living in southern England would be directly affected by the invention of a miner's safety lamp. Just thinking out loud here!The two appendixes on rank and social status, and the intricacies of country dance touched upon both subjects clearly, but briefly, using stories from Jane Austen's life to put the era in context. I appreciated the humorous example of how young women attending balls and assemblies were accompanied by chaperones, usually a mother or an older woman, who were expected to pass the time with cards or socializing rather than dancing themselves. In a letter to her sister Cassandra, thirty-seven year-old Austen recognizes the transition from dancer to on-looker when she writes \\"Bye the bye, I must leave off being young, I find many Douceurs in being a sort of Chaperon for I am put on the Sofa near the Fire & can drink as much wine as I like.\\" Too funny! Even though each of these appendixes is short, they do offer a list of books to explore further reading, which I was inspired to investigate.Since contemporary novels do cease to be contemporary the day that they are published, growing even more distant with each generation, notes can become indispensible to the enjoyment of the modern reader. Prof. Claire Lamont has supplied excellent and insightful explanatory notes, allowing for instant gratification with detailed descriptions of language usage, social and historical context, and character and plot insights. I found this the most interesting aspect of this edition, and reading the explanatory notes alone was like reading a condensed dictionary to Jane Austen, her times, and the plot and characters in SENSE AND SENSIBILTY.In short, Oxford World's Classics has pulled together just the right amount of supplemental material from reputable and readable sources for their revised edition of SENSE AND SENSIBILTY. I found very little wanting in this edition, and recommend it to first time readers, or veterans seeking new insights.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I ordered this version of P & P as I wanted a hard back to add to my few other hard back Jane A.'s novels.

I love S&amp;S anyway, but Ms. Badel's reading has enriched my understanding of it enormously, especially Jane Austen's sparkling dialogue. I don't know how often I laughed out loud (at Mrs. Jennings), or exclaimed with worry about poor Elinor and her carrying of everyone else's burdens. No, I'm not crazy, it's just that Jane Austen read aloud by an expert, articulate, dramatic reader does that to a person. I highly recommend this for those who listen to books on tape; you will cherish every word. Ms. Badel and Maureen O'Brien are the best readers I've encountered yet."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This is a superb reading by Sarah Badel. I can find nothing to carp about; she scans the language with such assurance and close attention to the meaning that she shows up the deficiencies in almost every other Austen reading known to me. In most cases these readers brush over and miss the point of Austen's remarks but Badel is so clearcut and precise she consistently illuminates the writing rather than obscuring it as so many others do.It may however be a little understated for some listeners. She is rarely overtly dramatic but then neither is Austen. I think Sarah Badel tracks the author's lightly satirical voice almost perfectly but if you prefer a more animated reading you might try some alternative versions."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"In these days of rampant incivility, when we know far too much about each other, I find it relaxing to escape to the early 19th century and immerse myself in Jane Austen's world. Okay, I'll ignore the lack of plumbing and the whole layered economic system that allows some people to do nothing while others are ground down with toil. Instead, I'll celebrate the courteous manners and the formality of even close relationships.The Dashwood sisters are in a difficult position: their father had two families, the first of which produced a son who inherits all his property, and the second of which produced three daughters who are not entitled to any specific amount -- only what the half-brother (and his greedy wife) thinks is fair. So the girls must find husbands who can support them. Austen's skill is that she can deal with these economic uncertainties and class expectations in many of her novels without being repetitious. Everyone knows the rules of the game, and when impulsive, emotional Marianne goes off the deep end, we are all caught up in the fallout of her disappointment. Elinor has a different disposition and an equally complex set of problems that she must face, albeit alone.The great thing about this audio book, and others in the Naxos series, is that it is read by Juliette Stevenson, who does a wonderful job. Her voices are consistent and her trained (and natural) accent is perfect for Jane Austen. Whether I'm in the car or hunched over a sewing project, an audio book is a perfect companion."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. I'm not a romance novel kind of guy, but decided to check it out on my Kindle (free). I found the old English a little hard to read comfortably, but that passed. With all the hoopla about Jane Austin and her novels, I cought a movie during a plane ride entitled \\"The Jane Austin Book Club\\" and enjoyed it too. Don't be afraid guys, it wont hurt and you might even like it."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Though not considered to be her best work, Austen's Sense and Sensibility is definitely my favorite. The novel tells the tale of two sisters: Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Having been left nearly penniless after the death of their father, the Dashwood family moves to a small cottage in the country. Elinor, the more sensible of the two sisters, is concerned with keeping up appearances and not letting her feelings for the object of her affections, Edwards Ferrars, be known. Marianne on the other hand, is the more flighty of the two. She wears her heart on her sleeve, a heart that beats for the charming and alluring Mr. Willoughby. The two sisters struggle with their own love affairs and their social standing in what I would call Austen's finest work.I know I go against the majority when I say I prefer this novel to Pride and Prejudice, but I do. Elinor and Marianne are much softer, more endearing characters than the Elizabeth and Jane Bennett. While the plots are similar, I would say that Sense and Sensibility reveals more about the main characters - their emotions, thoughts, etc. - than Pride and Prejudice does with its main characters.Either way, I adore this novel. If you have never read Austen, I definitely recommend starting with Sense and Sensibility."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Most people who have read Jane Austen will have read Pride and Prejudice. With a title like Sense and Sensibility, most readers will assume that the two books can be interpreted and enjoyed in the same way. Other than having three word titles that employ alliteration in the first and third words, the two novels are more different than similar.While Pride and Prejudice is primarily about miscommunication, Sense and Sensibility is about the maturation of two sisters as they find themselves confronted by adversity. The former topic allows Ms. Austen more room to roam, but within the later topic she has plenty of opportunities to display her story telling and comic talents. While maturation is an important sub theme in Pride and Prejudice, you see maturation better developed in Sense and Sensibility.When their father dies, Elinor, Marianne and Margaret find themselves in exile from their family home with their mother. The family estate had been left to their half brother whom their father exhorted to take care of them. But that promise is soon diluted into doing almost nothing through the selfishness of his wife and his vacillation. A relative kindly offers them a country cottage near his home and takes obvious pleasure in their company.At this modest new home, Elinor found herself entertaining the welcome attentions of Edward Ferrars. Elinor's younger sister, Marianne, is all aflutter over John Willoughby who seems to be committed to her. In fact, everyone assumes that there will soon be wedding bells for Marianne and Willoughby.All of these pleasant connections are, however, soon disrupted. Willoughby leaves and ignores Marianne. Elinor finds out an unexpected secret about Ferrars that puts her on her caution in pursuing their relationship. As these complications develop, Marianne soon finds herself distraught despite having attracted another suitor, the reliable, but older, Colonel Brandon. Elinor steps into the breach to try to help her sister regain her equilibrium. Both learn what a broken heart can feel like and adjust in their own separate ways.In vintage Jane Austen style, all bets are off near the end of the book as characters take unexpected steps that open up new possibilities. There's no one quite like Jane Austen for pulling great twists in her romantic comedies. These twists will cause your jaw to drop.Try not to compare this book to Pride and Prejudice. It's clearly a lesser work, but one that can certainly be enjoyed in its own right."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Jane Austen's 1811 novel, her first published, \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" receives a grand treatment in this Broadview Literary Texts edition, edited by Kathleen James-Cavan. Anyone who knows me knows how I doat on Jane Austen, and for the first time reading her in a Broadview edition, I find myself doating excessively. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was the first public exposure of Austen's masterful characterization, plotting, and satire to reach the reading public of the Romantic Era. Austen thrives on what I like to call 'the middle of the book,' writing the situations that complicate the lives of her characters, better than almost anyone - almost, it seems, preferring getting her characters and readers in a position to learn from their mistakes, than actually getting them out.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" begins with the illogic of early 19th century British inheritance law. The hereditary owner of Norland Park is on his deathbed, and invites the heirs of his estate, the Dashwood family, to reside at Norland. The Dashwood's and their three daughters come to live there, but are put into jeopardy soon after by the demise of both Mr. Dashwoods - bringing the next male heir (and the girls' half-brother), John Dashwood and his manipulative wife, Fanny to Norland. Greedy as they are, John and his wife soon drive their half-sisters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, along with their mother, out of Norland, Sussex, to the Devonshire countryside. Here in Devonshire, in a small cottage, and at a considerably reduced income, the Dashwood sisters and their mother struggle to rebuild their life, while the two eldest daughters, Elinor, 19, and Marianne, 17, try to deal with life and love in the English countryside.Like the well-known \\"Pride (Darcy) and Prejudice (Bennet),\\" \\"Sense and Sensibility\\"s title can be seen to refer to the character traits that mark its two principle characters - Sense on the side of the Enlightenment-influenced, almost certainly emotionally-repressed Elinor, and the overfine Sensibility of Marianne, a great admirer of dead leaves and the dirty ground. As opposed to the former novel, Austen does not really disparage either, except when carried to excess, as each young woman does, instead seeking, as was popular during the period, to reconcile, or strike a balance between rational logic and emotional response. In their love affairs, Elinor's with a distant cousin, the diffident and somewhat mysterious 24-year old Edward Ferrars, and Marianne's with a younger, and very handsome rogue John Willoughby, the young ladies' moral, social, and aesthetic principles are put to the test. While Elinor and Marianne are two of the most cultured, educated, and refined characters in the novel, and while Austen certainly privileges the country over the London metropolis, she makes clear that the ladies' limited interaction with society at large leaves them in a kind of sheltered ignorance which they must come to terms with, both for their sakes and for the sake of their lovers.Austen always does a great job with her minor characters, especially those who serve in comic relief roles - or as the butts of her satire, and \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is no different. In their avarice and greed, John and Fanny Dashwood are the epitome of wholly uncultured social climbers and mindless landowners. In her less than refined, but wholly maternal attitudes toward the Miss Dashwoods, Mrs. Jennings (mother of the neglected, but ever cheerful wife Charlotte Palmer and the reticent to a fault Lady Middleton) is as amusing a character, and as warm a mother as one will find in Austen. Colonel Brandon is a fit counterpart to Mrs. Jennings, in his reserved melancholy, while caring just as much about those around him as Mrs. Jennings. The comic pairings of Mr. Palmer and Sir John Middleton with their wives is absolute genius, both being the mirror opposite in style and attitude to their wives - and in particular the relationship between the Palmers, including the continual laughing of Charlotte at the fact that Mr. Palmer \\"never listens to me\\" and \\"never tells me anything,\\" is both highly entertaining, and at the same time, one of the most troubling relationships in the novel.I've praised James-Cavan's handling of this Broadview edition, and now may be a good time to say some more on that head. Broadview and its editors, like the people who put together the Norton Critical Editions, concern themselves with really presenting literary texts in a solid foundation of cultural, theoretical, and critical contexts. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" contains a real treasure trove of such material - the two contemporary reviews of Austen's novel from 1812, generous selections of essays from the late 1700's and early 1800's on contemporary debates on the meanings of the words \\"sense\\" and \\"sensibility,\\" and on the cult of sensibility and the picturesque. Also included are exerpts from poems referenced by Marianne throughout the novel, illustrations of the vehicles they travel in, and a map of the character's London residences. James-Cavan's excellent introduction also lays out the novel's issues in their contemporary, cultural, critical, and theoretical contexts, none more obtrusive than any other, and all quite helpful. Altogether, the Broadview \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a tremendous edition for Austen scholars and casual Janeites alike."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Jane Austin is one of my favorite authors. I think that \\"Persuasion\\" is her best novel, with both \\"Sense And Sensibility\\" and \\"Pride And Prejudice\\" tied for second place. \\"Sense And Sensibility\\" is an absolutely wonderful book, capturing beautifully the English Regency period's mores, manners, and lifestyles. The central theme deals with the extreme differences in temperaments between two sisters, and the eventual reconciliation and moderation of both their characters and temperaments.Marianne Dashwood is a passionate young woman, with a definite inclination toward the humanities: art, music and literature. Her heart rules her head, more often than not, and she has a very spontaneous nature. Elinor Dashwood, the older of the two sisters, is much more practical and sensible. While Elinor appreciates the music and literature that her sibling so passionately loves, she definitely thinks things through before making decisions, or taking action, and keeps her personal feelings to herself. She feels tremendous responsibility for her family's well-being. Elinor does have a wonderful, dry sense of humor, and her witty comments enhance the novel. Throughout most of the narrative, Marianne believes that Elinor, whom she dearly loves, is too cold, and restrained - more concerned with propriety than with feelings. She is obviously judgmental concerning Elinor's reticence to freely express her emotions, and she also pities Elinor, for her perceived inadequacies. Elinor, on the other hand, is concerned about Marianne's open and guileless behavior. She fears her sister will be hurt by indulging in her strong emotions, and that conventional society will condemn her for this attribute.The story opens with the death of Elinor and Marianne's father. He, unavoidably, has left them, along with their mother, (his second wife), and younger sister with little money. They are forced to leave their home, the Norland estate, and move to Barton Cottage, close to a distant relative's estate. Norland and all its treasures have been left to Dashwood's son, by his first wife. The four women have been left on their own, to pursue life, love, and loss in their different manners.Both Elinor and Marianne fall deeply in love, while at Barton, and each, in turn, are disappointed by their choices. These devastating losses, plus their adjustments to an entirely different lifestyle, serve to modify their temperaments and change their lives.\\"Sense And Sensibility\\" is a deeply moving novel, with biting satire, especially demonstrated in the characters of Fanny and John Dashwood, and Lucy Steele; and of course Elinor's fine wit adds much to make the reader smile. Ms. Austin's writing is pure elegance. Her female characters are well developed, including those in minor roles. The men, particularly John Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and Colonel Brandon are very different in nature, and not at all stereotypical. I loved the scenes at Barton Cottage with Marianne and Willoughby, and with Willoughby and the Dashwood family. I also really enjoyed the visit to London and the tragic ball scene.I found myself laughing and crying while reading this book. So with all the discussion about moderation and passion, Jane Austin, once again, brought out the gamut of emotions in me. I cannot recommend this delightful novel highly enough!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I have read some works by Jane Austen, however, I have never read Sense and Sensibility until now. It is a story about two sisters, one is prudent and the other is outright passionate. You get to see Elinor and her sister Marianne go through a changing process by the end of the book.What is really neat about this book is that there are notes typed in the side margin to help you understand the story and to give you other entertainment facts of the story. This is helpful for those who want to understand the works of famous authors.I received a review copy via Bethany House."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"At last I overcame my inner resistance and read past page 1, which had previously turned me off with its dry accountant prose. Very soon, already in chapter 2, I realized what good use Ms. Austen was able to make of her special style: the chapter narrates how the rich young man, who had made a rash emotional promise of monetary generosity to his 3 half sisters, is talked down by his rational wife, from 1000 Pounds for each of the 3, to precisely nothing for anybody, all step by step. Brilliant.The main theme of the story, the contrast between the two sisters representing sense and sensibility, which might have been called reason and emotion to be clearer, makes me suffer somewhat due to the impossibly complicated communications between the two girls. None of the two can figure out how to shed the stilts that they are constantly walking on. The dialogues are not easily bearable, and then, frankly speaking, both girls are silly chickens in their different ways. Their mother is a silly hen in her manic optimism. The fact that the main personnel of the story is not entirely admirable fades away in the course of the tale. We find ourselves exposed to the horrors of English gentry of the period, and one begins to realize that the silly girls are rather admirably nice people compared to most other people in this story. We meet more monsters than I would have thought possible in the setting.The mother hen has to pick up her nubile 3 daughters and move with them to a cottage in Devon after her husband dies and the house in Sussex, which had been his father's, is going to the girls' older half brother. In reduced circumstances, they all make the best of it. Marriage prospects and related hopes and disappointments are the most prominent subject of thoughts and conversations.Compared to her later colleagues like Dickens and Trollope, Austen, in this book, has the advantage of superior plot design. The later professionals, in the Victorian age, lived by their writing and their constant output for publication in periodicals. S&S;, by comparison, is not driven by piecemeal design, not by the need to package publishable installments, not by ramblings from one subplot to another and back to the main story line. That is an advantage that one can appreciate, though it does normally not diminish my pleasure with the later writers.Austen's station in society is clearly reflected in her novel's world: the lower gentry, people who don't work for a living, but who are not wealthy. Her access to other levels of society must have been restricted by circumstances, hence she was wise to stick to what she knew. Her stories are sometimes called 'romantic', but hers was not the romanticism of the romantic school, which was essentially irrational. She was very rational and had a sharp eye for all kinds of falsities and pretensions. The novel's main effect on me, in the end, was a sense of despair about the lack of sensible life choices for women (and probably men too) in the suffocating closedness of the 'society'."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I am a die hard fan of Coralie Bickford-Smith's clothbound series. They are more then just a book, they are so beautiful they could decorate any bookshelf or be a present for someone special. Not to mention the fantastic stories she designs for! Puts a new, yet old-fashioned face to the classics! Brilliant!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"One reading is sufficient for most novels, but not Jane Austen's. Her style, wit and engrossing storytelling grow more delicious with every re-reading. I know in general what's going to happen, but there are so many wonderful details and so much rich characterization to rediscover.I loved Sense and Sensibility more than ever this time around.As the introduction points out, Austen's novel was part of an ongoing obsession in the 1790s and Regency period with defining and assessing \\"sensibility.\\" Too little sensibility was repellant; too much, dangerous. Whereas a perfect balance of intelligence, good manners and deep feeling should result in true happiness!The two elegant Dashwood sisters illustrate the point. Nineteen-year-old Elinor is amazingly sensible. When she suffers reversals, she takes rational steps to heal her wounds. Whereas Marianne at seventeen is awash in romantic opinions and sensations, and rather wallows in her misfortunes. Both have to deal with lovers who cause them misery. The plot revolves around how the sisters cope.But Sense and Sensibility is much more than a lesson in proper behavior. It's a feast of social satire full of delectably flawed characters. Nobody but nobody delivers a barbed criticism or witticism more beautifully than Jane Austen. And the Dashwood sisters are captivating young ladies who totally engage our sympathies.Broadview editions are my favorites, with their scholarly introductions and appendices. I particularly enjoyed the detailed drawings of a curricle, post-chaise and town chariot. Now I can picture the vehicles that carry Austen's characters to dinners and balls and on journeys to town and country.Jane Austen began writing Sense and Sensibility when she was twenty-two and published it in 1811, when she was thirty-six. Why she chose to publish it before Pride and Prejudice is one of many interesting questions explored in the introduction."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"I'm reviewing the Penguin Classics edition rather than the content of the novel itself (which is wonderful). The cover is beautifully decorated, nicely textured, and sturdy, the introduction and notes are interesting but not obtrusive, the paper is high quality, the print is very readable (the font is not too small like some other editions of classic literature), and the colored ribbon adds a touch of refinement as well as utility. I've bought the other Austen novels in this Penguin series. They're among the most handsome books on my library shelf. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Love the novel. Happy to have it on my Kindle. I purchased this, however, for the illustrations...where are the illustrations?"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Recently I read Austen's 'juvenalia', and when I started reading this book, I could see a lot of similarities. The beginning of S&S; has a tone of satire. The reader can tell Jane is a young writer, mocking many of society's views which were common at the time.However, as the story progresses, I began to see Jane getting more serious about her subject and caring about her characters. That was when I began to love this book. And it just got better and better toward the end.On a personal note, I found some similarities to my own life in this book. When I was young and in love for the first time, I acted a bit like Marianne, wearing my heart on my sleeve. I think many of us probably did. I loved this book and gave it 4 stars - but you can see how I might be a biased reader.Some of Austen's other books are definitely a little better, but this is also a good book. It's amazing to me that hundreds of years can pass, and a modern reader like me can still identify with these characters."},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"This is going to be a totally different type of review from me. In fact, it really isn't a review at all. It is more of an \\"ode to Jane Austen\\". I truly do think she ruined my dating life but I totally forgive her for it :)First question you are going to have is why do I have a picture of Jane (played by Susannah Harker) from Pride and Prejudice on a post about Sense and Sensibility?Answer: I listened to the audiobook version of Sense and Sensibility read by her and it was possibly the best audiobook I have ever heard! Yes better than Jim Dale reading Harry Potter (which I also really enjoyed)! If I am going to review anything in this post that is it. If you get a chance to pick up this audiobook version, you should. She is very good at making each character unique and keeping you engaged the whole book. It is unabridged so 14 hours long but well worth it.Disclaimer: Yes, I have read Sense and Sensibility a few different times before listening to it on audio. It is my 2nd favorite Jane Austen novel behind Pride and Prejudice. So the story is very comforting and familiar. I have the characters I love, the ones who annoy me, and the ones I would like to throw to the wolves. However, as with all great books, it always leaves me with the the hope that in the end the nice guy does in fact finish with the girl of his dreams. Austen is one of the best at taking flawed characters that come from a place of good and making them find each other.This book particularly appeals to me because out of all of Jane Austen's characters I am probably the most like Elinor. I am a little more open about my opinions but otherwise she is the closest to me personality wise. I would also like to think that out there is an E. Farris for me, as he is exactly the type of guy that I go for. Smart, Off-Beat humor, Loyal, Kind, and good to his word. So reading their rather understated romance always warms my heart. Plus, I love Brandon and his steadfast beautifully portrayed personality. He is the Bingley of this novel but Marianne takes awhile to realize that.So my rating: 5+My Recommendation: Get thee to the bookstore and read it!"},{"Title":"Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library)","review":"Purchased for my daughter and her school needs (she is home shcooled) and she was very happy with the book, not to mention that the business end was a pleasure and easy to do as well.

As such I've been somewhat (stupidly) hesitant to read other Austen novels - for surely nothing could live up to that book!I finally have read Sense and Sensibility and I am sorry that I did not read it earlier. I must say that S&S; was a very easy and accessible book to read. The plot wasn't overly complex and it did not feel bogged down and dense like some old classic novels can. I think this would be a great book for someone who wants to read classics but who is worried or scared to.The two main characters are easy to love and I was wondering what would happen the whole way through.
