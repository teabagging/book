I'd say only 60% of the book is about real estate and even those parts are in broad strokes giving you concepts. Legrand even admits that its foolhardy to jump into real estate armed with the knowledge from only that book on pages 61-62.....the only things he'll go into detail is finding sellers, screening prospects, and how to sell your house effectively.If you want to spend your money efficiently and getting the most information for your hard-earned dollar, don't spend money on this book. But if you are someone who's clueless about real estate and want a general concept of no money down properties, then this book will help you and point you in the right direction, and this direction will point you to his website hawking is seminars and courses.Here's a tip I learned in reading real estate books: Before you buy a real estate book, go to the author's website and check if his/her products he/she sells are only his/her books....if it is, then the book contains everything he/she knows about that topic (hopefully), but if his/her other products includes high priced seminars, CDs, or DVDs, or courses...like Ron Legrand's website, then that book isn't giving you everything you need to know.."},{"Title":"How to Be a Quick Turn Real Estate Millionaire: Make Fast Cash with No Money, Credit, or Previous Experience","review":"This is like those \\"tutorials\\" you find for computer programs: after the satisfied customer stumbles through it, they know nothing.If you read books like a goat eats dead grass, leaves, old paper and discarded rubbers, you'll read this, too, probably.If you want to rip people off, go out and find a certified con man.

This book is a good foundation for more education on creative real estate by Ron and others.Quick Turn Real Estate is not a Get Rich Quick Scheme like some of the others, but it is a Get Rich Business. You can do this!!! with no money or credit!! I have done deals on properties of over $350,000 with only $250 of my own money in the deal.This book takes over where Robert Kiyosaki left off. It is the meat of the entree. I didn't know how to do real estate investing after the Rich Dad's Series, but it got me interested just like it was suppose to do.

He gives you examples of ways he has made tons of money in real estate and you shouldn't expect everything to work as planned or for there to be everything you need in this book. You still have to work your market... test stuff out... gain experience... learn the ropes... etc etc. For all the naysayers... I would say read it again and again... buy a few other books too... join some real estate forums... if you really want to succeed in real estate.

I would like to do just the opposite. I understand that I will be in the minority here, but then again, I am retired at 43, so I suppose I am already in the minority.I have nothing but praise for Ron and this book which 5 years ago started me on the road to retirement. It armed me with just enough knowledge to do my first wholesale deal. I found a house that I was able to put under contract according to Ron's advice and then flipped the contract (not even the house but the paper) to another investor. I made just over $5000 for a few hours of work!I was absolutely hooked. I used that 5k to attend one of his boot camps and about 1 year later I quit working as an engineer and within another year I was able to basically quit working altogether. I still buy houses, in fact I closed on one earlier this week, basically quit working altogether. I still buy houses, in fact I closed on one earlier this week, but I do not get up at the crack of dawn to sit in traffic like most of you reading this review. I have continued to attend his seminars, as well as other seminars related to real estate and Online Marketing. Since I am no longer part of the rat race I don't feel like university classes can teach me much, and seminars are a more viable approach for a person like me who has not used an alarm clock in several years.Is the book incomplete? Yes. Will it give you enough information to get started? Yes. Is it a plug for his courses? Yes. Will his courses change your life YES! If you are SERIOUS about getting yourself free from corporate slavery then I absolutely recommend it; however, if you are going to be one of the whiners who is disappointed because they read a book and magic fairies did not come and make them rich, then I suspect that any book like this will not be enough for you.

To look at it this from a spiritual angle, the soul, whose physical manifestation is the body, is the all-knowing intelligent manager and healer, and if we stop interfering with it through our thoughts, habits, and mal-nutrition, it will preserve the balance that is a pre-requisite to healthy living and the main healing factor for existing complications.There is ample information relating to concentration and energy balancing techniques, physical exercises, and health boosting nutrition."},{"Title":"The Art of Sufi Healing","review":"If only all authors had such a delightful way of presenting spiritual teachings and healing methods. Keep it coming!"},{"Title":"The Art of Sufi Healing","review":"This book should have been titled 'Being Healthy Through Islamic Sufism'. There is almost nothing on Sufi methods of healing. Since this book is titled 'The Art of Sufi Healing' if you are looking for the actual *methods* or *art* of Sufi Healing, you will be very disappointed with this book.Very little of the book talks about the nature of the body and the causes of disease and methods of healing. The author does not display any detailed knowledge of Sufi healing methods. Certainly nothing that would allow someone interested in being a healer to be able to apply. Most of the first part of this book is common information in alternative healing circles and available on the Internet. No reason to buy this book for that information.The majority of the book is a collection of practices, meditation, whirling, stretching, etc. aimed at keeping someone healthy. Again, this information is not about healing. It seems the author had not achieved enough experience in specific Sufi healing methods to arrive at a meaningful synthesis in this book. The information that is presented is cursory, based on an Islamic Sufism order. There are other Sufi orders, including the Sufi Healing order, which possess much more meaning knowledge of 'The Art of Sufi Healing' than is presented here."},{"Title":"Michelin Gulf Coast Regional Atlas & Travel Guide (Michelin Regional Atlas & Travel Guide Gulf Coast)","review":"The maps are great as expected from Michelin, but note that this book covers the Gulf Coast only.

While it is meant for a serious lay-reader and undeniably non-mathematical in its presentation, this is definitely not light reading. People who aren't afraid of becoming a little lost while navigating the figurative \`forest through the trees' can have courage this book will guide them if they're patient and willing to be led. To be sure, the dedicated reader will aquire a nodding acquaintance with concepts of conservation laws, symmetries, gauge theory, and U(1) X SU(2) & SU(3) group theories (which ultimately account for and lie at the root of the most fundamental physical laws) and last, but not least, a good conceptual grip of QCD. A willingness to do some re-reading will bode you well. The trip can be somewhat heavy going with its deep, abstract and technical description of a fundamentally mathematical subject - but it is well worth the wear & tear on the intellectual soles of your mind. Ultimately, this is an account of humanity's pinnacle intellectual achievement.OK, so what have we got here?TABLE OF CONTENTS1 Introduction 12 Symmetry 93 The quantum world 194 Toward QCD 1105 The one number of QCD 2696 The gregarious gluon 2887 Quarks and hadrons 3058 Quarks under the microscope 3289 Much ado about nothing 37010 Checkerboard QCD 391Appendix 1 A QCD chronology 413Appendix 2 Greek alphabet & SI prefixes 426The introduction does its job setting the scope of subjects: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the Electro-Weak force, and last, but principally, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) a.k.a. the theory of the Strong Force. It brushes on experiments in high-energy physics that bring the constituents of the Standard Model to light.After the introduction, we're treated to a little history of the mathematicians and physicists who brought us Group Theory and a sketch of the properties of groups (i.e. identity element, closure, associativity & the inverse element). Descriptions and brief examples are given for O(2) orthogonal and SO(2) special orthogonal (abelian) transformations plus mention of associated dimensional 2x2 matrices; non-abelian SO(3) groups are discussed and the U(1)XSU(2) and SU(3) groups are revealed to be the fundamental abstract spaces of particle physics in a nutshell. Lie groups are briefly mentioned as well.The next major section, \\"The Quantum World\\", is my favorite material in this book. It starts with the fact that the measured magnetic moment anomaly of QED demonstrates its superior standing as the crown achievement of theoretical & experimental physics. Basic quantum mechanics topics are effectively covered:Energy quanta (Planck's constant h), wave phase & interference, Uncertainty Principle, Schrodinger, the principle of least action and Feynman's sum over paths.The elements quickly evolve in relative complexity and abstraction - ultimately leading towards a clearly developed connection between QED to QCD. The progression takes us through:mass-energy relations in Relativity, matter-antimatter pair production, Fermion and Boson spin & statistics and Pauli's Exclusion principle, quantum fields, the four-momentum, virtual particles, vacuum polarization, Green's functions, Feynman diagrams, vertex interactions, self-energy, infinite divergences, perturbation and renormalization program (dimensional regularization), effective low-energy field theory, Fermi's theory of weak interactions to Weinberg/Glashow/Salam and Veltman/t'Hooft Nobel prize winning contributions in the electroweak realm, and finally the all important gauge principle including the example of changes in potentials and changes in global vs. local phase.I'm now going to do the author a grave disservice by reviewing the remainder of the book in an all too brief summarization. The majority of the book plumbs the depths of QCD. Andrew brings us by the experimental facilities for a thorough inspection of the accelerators & detectors (BNL RHIC, Fermilab CDF, CERN-LEP, DESY, KEK-BELLE & SLAC). He gives complete coverage of the physicists responsible for its development and associated milestones. To name just a few of the many discussed in great detail: Yukawa - Isospin, mesons; Yang-Mills - CP violation, Gell-Man - the Eightfold Way; \`the particle zoo', families, Quark-Gluon, flavordynamics, inelastic scattering, color charges; Nambu - spontaneous symmetry breaking; the Higgs mechanism & weak neutral currents; Gross, Wilczek & Politzer - Asymptotic Freedom.Watson judiciously included countless diagrams to illustrate important concepts and fundamental interactions plus many photographic pictures of physicists, experimental devices and facilities. The back of the book includes a good glossary and a nice annotated \\"Further reading\\" section that breaks suggested titles in easy reading, not-so-easy reading, and \`hard core' sections.That's it. Altogether a serious undertaking - I hope you are challenged by it and thoroughly enjoy it as much as I have!p.s. I recommend these complementary books: \\"Deep Down Things\\" by Schumm; \\"The Force of Symmetry\\" by Icke; \\"Fearful Symmetry\\" by Zee; \\"Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe\\" by Lederman; and \\"Out of This World\\" by Webb. N.B. check out the reviews on these books, also browse the \\"So You'd Like To...\\" and \\"Listmania!\\" lists below to help decide which ones you might want to consider."},{"Title":"The Quantum Quark","review":"The Quantum Quark is a close look at quantum chromodynamics that does not require an extensive mathematics or physics background of the reader. Freelance science journalist and regular contributor to \\"Science\\" magazine Andrew Watson explores such topics as the quantum world, \\"the gregarious gluon\\", quarks and hadrons, the true significance of the vacuum state, and much more.

Just to say, if you're into quark physics, or just plain ol' particle physics, you need to get this book. Every page is packed with fascinating stuff you can't get anywhere else in the popular press.This book gets real technical in many places. If you're a complete physics newbie, I might suggest you improve your general knowledge of quantum physics first. Also, a good place to start with quark physics isQuarks: The Stuff of Matterby Harald Fritzsch. This book is now nearly thirty years old, but he lays out the fundamentals so cleanly that you will be better equipped to take on Dr. Watson's volume.Lastly, I must say that Watson's assertion that \\"The QCD Casimir force is real\\" is something I've not seen published anywhere else. I have suspected this to be true for a long time, but it is gratifying to see it asserted in print by someone else. I mean, if all four fundamental forces are really different manifestations of one overarching grand-unified field, and if there is an electromagnetic Casimir force, then necessarily the Casimir effect should also be present in the other three forces. Makes sense to me, at least.'Nuff said. Get the book."},{"Title":"WHEN DO FISH SLEEP AND OTHER IMPONDERABLES OF EVERYDAY LIFE","review":"One of my best friends has assembled a rather amazing library of some 200 books: quote books, trivia books, fact books, you name it. The most interesting facet of his collection is the place where it resides--in his bathroom!!! Furthermore, David Feldman's wonderful series of Imponderables books has a place of honor in his library--right next to the toilet paper! (Needless to say, he is a bachelor as of this writing!) When Do Fish Sleep? is Feldman's third book in the series, and one of the best, in that more time is spent pondering questions that people really do care about, such as: &quot;Why do gas gauges take an eternity to go from registering full to half full, and then drop to empty in the speed of light?&quot; (I think we've all been there!) Feldman receives most of his imponderables from readers of the previous volumes, seeks out experts in the relevent fields to answer them (In the above example, that person is Anthony H Siegel of Ametek's US Gauge Division), and prints their response. If no one expert knows the definitive answer, Feldman will print the most prevalent theories instead. There are also many charming and funny illustrations to keep the material from getting too dry. There is also a section in the back called Frustables, which deals with Imponderables that are not easily solved, and their corresponding theories. Finally, the most important feature of this and any other Imponderables book: The articles are just the right length to read when seated &quot;upon the throne.&quot; (Well, most of them are, anyway!) So, get When Do Fish Sleep and other Imponderables books right away. Feldman's ready wit will keep you entertained and keep you from having to make that sometimes painful search for reading matter the next time nature calls!"},{"Title":"WHEN DO FISH SLEEP AND OTHER IMPONDERABLES OF EVERYDAY LIFE","review":"\\"When do Fish Sleep\\" is a book of \\"Imponderables\\" (a term invented by the author meaning a question that cannot be answered by conventional means of reference books, calculations, or tangible means such as measuring). An example of an imponderable is \\"Why don't birds tip over when they sleep on a telephone wire?\\" or the like the title, \\"When do fish sleep?\\"As with any book that covers a myriad of information, there are fascinating parts and there are parts that seem to drag on. I felt some of the imponderables in the book seemed a little elementary, such as \\"Why is one side of a halibut dark and the other side light?\\" (the dark side is for camouflage and the light side is down so it does not need to be camouflaged), \\"What is the purpose of corn silk?\\" (for pollination), and \\"Why are bowling shoes ugly?\\" (so people don't steal them). Other questions were fascinating such as \\"Why do roaches always die on their backs?\\" (this is not always true, but it has a lot to do with the shape of the roach) and \\"Why do recipes warn us not to use fresh kiwi or pineapple in gelatin?\\" (the fruits contain an enzyme that break protein down). The book even has a section of \\"Frustables\\", questions where readers have mailed in theories or questions that do not yet have an answer. The author even provides a way to contact them to answer frustables or to propose new imponderables.As a geek that likes to learn, even useless information, I enjoyed the book. However, the book had no format. I felt the book could have benefited from a table of contents or have the questions divided into related sections instead of aimlessly wander from topic to topic in the book.If you have a friend who sits and reads the cards from a \\"Trivial Pursuit\\" game, this is definitely a book for them. I'd recommend the book for people whose joy in life is the pursuit of knowledge or a teenager/young adult that is curious about the world around them. The book is not really a thrilling read, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to a person who is looking for an interesting read.While I think the content of the book was worth a solid 4 stars, I found the lack of structure in the book distracting enough to deduct a star."},{"Title":"WHEN DO FISH SLEEP AND OTHER IMPONDERABLES OF EVERYDAY LIFE","review":"Provides interesting information on a number of topics that you never realized you needed to know - like \\"Why do horses in an open field always seem to stand head to tail?\\" Then there's \\"Why do roaches always die on their backs?\\" And \\"Why do women in the U.S. shave their armpits?\\""},{"Title":"WHEN DO FISH SLEEP AND OTHER IMPONDERABLES OF EVERYDAY LIFE","review":"my daugther is very curious. she reads the book and tells me all the little bits of knowledge she has gained.

Bro. Wigglesworth believed that the Christian's Divine Right, as purchased by the Christ of Calvary for His people, was to live on a &quot;higher plane.&quot; He truly lived a life of holiness, which produced a faith that could stare down the enemy; this is said not to honor or worship the man, but to give us faith that &quot;all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.&quot;Greater Works is one of those &quot;unknown&quot; Christian Classics that belongs on the bookshelf of every believer, along with Charles Finney and F.F. Bosworth."},{"Title":"Greater Works","review":"I enjoyed this book. Its a huge compilation on several aspects of spiritual growth (faith, healing, spiritual gifts, etc).The accounts of Smith being used by God to raise the dead, heal the sick, drive out evil spirits was so phenomenal, it almost makes you feel convicted that you are not living on a higher spiritual plateau.

The improbable spiritual experiences which Richard accounts in a variety of ways in this collection of his earlier short stories have been repeatedly fulfilled in my life in ways I would not believe had I not lived them. Sharing the story, \\"Aviation or flying.......\\", with my wife brought me to tears, resulting in her immediate response of, \\"I think you'd better get your a__ to the airport\\", and she didn't have to ask me twice. The end result was life changing in that I knew within 24 hours what I wanted to do with my life. I set my sights on a livelihood of flying, pursued that goal vigorously and totally for the next ten years, and ended with 7000 hours of pure joy as an Alaska bush pilot. I could write my own book of the wonderful, and spiritual, experiences I have enjoyed over the past quarter century as a direct result of reading one little book. Thank you, Richard Bach, for sharing."},{"Title":"A GIFT OF WINGS","review":"Many years ago a writer created tremendous excitement with a bestselling book. The book was \\"Jonathon Livingston Seagull\\" and the writer was Richard Bach.The \\"Bird Book\\" was followed by several others, including \\"Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah\\". Bach was THE aviation writer of his time, although his themes were universal and concerned with life as much as flying. He took his place in a line of great aviation writers including Earnest Gann, Antoine d'St Exupery and, my favorite, Neville Shute. Shamefully, there are now many young pilots who have never heard of Richard Bach or any of those others.During his peak years of popularity, Bach published a book that didn't get the acclaim of his others. It was called \\"A Gift of Wings\\" and was a collection of short stories that he had written for aviation magazines. Among those stories were \\"Found at Pharisee\\" and \\"School for Perfection\\". They were fantasies featuring a dashing bandit pilot named Drake and his henchmen. The outlaws operated out of a hidden cave/hangar complex and ran a school which taught flying from its most basic and elemental parts. \\"Found at Pharisee\\" was delightfully told in the first person by a pilot who exemplified minimum standards training, who thought safety lay in blind obedience to the regs (wow, do I meet a lot of THOSE) and through whose outraged eyes we met the band of outlaw pilots. The outlaws scoffed at any regulation. They preferred common sense and the mastery of flying skills. They would have nothing to do with the minimum standards of flight instruction or mechanics' licensing.\\"School for Perfection\\" featured the school seen through the eyes of a dispirited flight instructor who had just lost a student. Drake's school rejuvenated him. These stories had a huge influence on my career and particularly my approach to flight instruction.The outlaws may have attained perfection in the art of flying, but none of us will ever reach it in the pilot operations we practice. However, it seems to me that as long as we seek that perfection, we will continue to improve our flying skills and achieve a level of competence far beyond minimum standards.Satisfaction with minimum standards will always be the subject of my primary \\"rant\\" and it may just be Richard Bach's fault.You can order \\"A Gift of Wings\\" from Amazon.com and The Tailwheeler's Journal.

Heroes are of such import that \\"Universal History.... is at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here.\\" He refers to them variously as \\"leaders of men, these great ones, the modelers, patterns, and in a wide sense creators of whatsoever the general mass of men contrived to do or to attain.\\" Carlyle's Great Men, in addition to their palpable leadership traits, further possess an innate quality that acts like universal lightning rods, attracting the admiration of their lessers. This quality is \\"the light which enlightens,\\" one that has a direct connection to God: \\"He is the living light-fountain, which is good and pleasant to be near...a natural luminary shining by the gift of Heaven.\\" The Divine Hero is but one of six heroes in history, the other five being the Hero as Prophet, as Poet, as Priest, as Man of Letters, and as King. Simply to walk freely in their presence is a boon of incalculable worth: \\"Could we but see them well, we should get some glimpse into the very marrow of the world's history.\\"Religion is the key to understanding a man's character. Carlyle does not limit religion to the conventional sense of adherence to any one creed. Instead, he labels religion as a marker of the connection of one's \\"vital relations to this mysterious Universe.\\" These relations are a function of his duty and destiny therein. When Carlyle asks a man concerning his religion, certain questions arise: Is that religion Heathenism? Is it Christianity? Or perhaps it is a mixture of Paganism and Skepticism? These are not nitpicking queries since their answers give the questioner the soul of the man or of the nation.Carlyle turns his attention to Odin as the first example of a hero. Carlyle has difficulty understanding why his contemporaries misused the term Paganism when referring to Odin. He does suggest that these contemporaries may have confused traditional Paganism with quackery, priest craft, and dupery, all three of which do not permit one to acknowledge that Paganism in its purest form was no more or less than a tried and true means for a primitive culture to realistically account for the complexities of the world around it.A second way for moderns to view Odin in the context of his times is to perceive him through the prism of allegory. Carlyle notes that allegory has traditionally been the province of poets and folklorists and as such finds it unlikely that any man in any age could have seriously entertained the belief that the centrality of a culture-organizing mythos might be a mere sporting convention. Further, Carlyle objects to allegory as an explanation for the ongoing vitality of Paganism on the ground that allegory must follow a pre-existing faith. Thus, the pagan belief in Odin must have preceded any attempt to explain it as overt allegory.Carlyle mentions the allegory of the cave from Plato to explain how one who has been brought up in the ignorant darkness of a cave might react to the sudden appearance of a hitherto unknown sun. Such an emerging cave dweller might view the sun or nature itself as the magical province of the gods. We, suggests Carlyle, are much like that cave dweller--there is simply too much for anyone to absorb without resort to magic as a ready explanation. We manage to grasp part of the Mysteries of the Universe not by virtue of our superior insight but by avoiding the use of that insight in the first place. It is only when we resort to insight that we assign words as abstract symbols that purport to explain the origin and nature of objects but truly do little more than cloud the indecipherable essence of those objects with words that pretend to explain them. The result is that we congratulate ourselves on our godlike wisdom when we are in fact appallingly ignorant. By \\"words\\" Carlyle means science itself, which \\"has done much for us; but it is a poor science that would hide from us the great deep sacred infinitude of Nescience, whither we can never penetrate on which all science swims as a mere superficial film.\\"As an example of an inexplicable and unknowable aspect of nature is Time, which Carlyle apostrophizes as having the ability to engage in \\"rolling, rushing on, swift, silent, like an all-embracing ocean-tide on which we and all the Universe swim like exhalations.\\" Carlyle sees Time as a miracle, one which will forever be beyond the ken of man. As if the macro-world of nature as exemplified by Time were not sufficiently daunting to us, Carlyle uses the micro-world image of the humble leaf to act as a similar roadblock to human understanding. What is it then, in both Time and the leaf, that suffuses them with the life force sufficient for animation, he asks rhetorically. The answer is quite simply, God. When we can acknowledge that God is the source of all things material and immaterial, then we can readily admit that there are those selected individuals who can see this divine source more easily than can others. And it is precisely here that Carlyle links his theory of the Divine Spark to the Great Leader who can sense it. Even in pagan days, there were gifted individuals who were finely attuned to this spark which connected mortal man to immortal gods: \\"To these primeval men, all things and everything they saw exist beside them were an emblem of the Godlike of some God.\\" As man perceives the wonders of nature, he realizes that he is an integral part of that nature and as such: \\"We are the miracle of miracles--the great inscrutable mystery of God.\\" From this, Carlyle reasons that to worship nature in this manner is but a precedent step in worshipping the human hero who moves in that nature: \\"I consider Hero-worship to be the grand modifying element in that ancient system of thought.\\"The admiration that Carlyle sees as the obligation for all to have for the Hero he soon qualifies into the necessity for \\"heartfelt prostrate admiration, submission, burning, boundless.\\" Such traits are kin to loyalty which Carlyle insists is the unquestioned right of all Great Leaders to expect from their followers. Carlyle uses the financial metaphor of bank notes to suggest that true Great Heroes are like bank notes, fully backed by gold bullion. It is the fake, the fraud, the interloper who introduces counterfeit notes into circulation. Such false heroes can emerge only in cultures wherein true heroes are unlikely to emerge--as in democracies. Where civilizations of past eras have crumbled into dust it is because they lacked heroes as a buttress against the debilitating influences that drove Diogenes Teufelsdrockh to wander endlessly. Great men can arise in any age in any culture but there is no assurance that they will infinitely do so. Thus, when these Great Men do arise in moments of crisis, all men must honor, respect, and obey them. To worship them is, of course, the next logical step.In Carlyle's books preceding Of Heroes, he introduces various strands of thought that culminate in his vision of an all-powerful Great Leader who leads by virtue of a divine spark that is immediately sensed by his subordinates. These qualities include one who recognizes the value and need to work, has the ability to defer immediate gratification of basic needs like happiness, can remorselessly dispense with the rudiments of civilized discourse, and has an abiding loathing for democracy and the common man.The images and tropes that Carlyle uses reinforce his notion of the semi-divinity of his Great Leader Heroes. When he discusses them, his choice of diction tends toward the glowing and the positive. \\"A Great Leader,\\" he asserts, \\"is the living light fountain...a natural luminary shining by the gift of Heaven.\\" His choice of Odin as an exemplar of the Pagan Hero is telling in that Odin was the king of the Norse pantheon. The Hero is such because of the Divine Spark that inheres within. Carlyle can scarce mention this Hero without adding an immediate list of qualifiers that redound to his glory: noble, admirable, godlike, sacred, all the while eliciting a concomitant list for his followers: submissive, obedient, loyal, and dutiful. When it comes to mentioning non-Heroes, Carlyle uses contrary terms: quackery, priest-craft, dupery, and the like.Carlyle makes no pretense at objectivity. For his theory of the interaction between Great Leaders and historical continuity to work, he must relentlessly image these heroes as subcategories of that history. If history truly is the biography of Great Men, then it follows that it is they who make the times rather than the other way around. To Carlyle, each culture worthy of the name had a Great Hero at the base, organizing, rallying, plotting, or otherwise ensuring the survival of that culture: \\"In all epochs of the world's history, we shall find the Great Man to have been the indispensable savior of his epoch.\\" Even in his day, there were many who objected to elevating to near godhood those whose primary claim to fame was an ability to project the right image at the right time and in the right place. Carlyle called all such Great Leaders or Heroes. A century later, we have quite different names for them."},{"Title":"On heroes and hero-worship and the heroic in history (The World's classics)","review":"I am on an intellectual quest to understand what makes a man a hero and a woman a heroine.Thomas Carlyle did an amazing amount of research and is the first book in a long seriesthat I will read on mythological heroes/heroines and actual heroes/heroines in history.I am interested in how mythological heroes/heroines carried on through the ages and how they influencedactual heroes/heroines throughout history.I was lucky enough to come across this book on archive.org and was able to downloadit and read it for free.The prose of this century is sometimes convoluted which causes you to spend more timetrying to understand and then reflect on the author's words.The book was, as I said, the first read of many to come on an intellectual quest tounderstand the whole 'hero/heroine' concept.I am glad I came across this book.

A unique and suspenseful twist on the traditional murder mystery, this novel is based on the real-life character of Lord Lucan, who in 1974 killed his children's nanny by mistake instead of killing his wife. Though he vanished and has never been found, many have suspected that he has been housed and hidden over the years by a series of aristocratic friends.In this satiric approach to the true-crime genre, Spark gives us wacky, off-the-wall characters--including two men who claim to be the \\"real\\" Lord Lucan. Adding to the dramatic mix are variety of aristocratic \\"aiders and abettors\\" who have protected and financially supported Lucan for twenty-five years, a psychiatrist who was once a phony stigmatic but who is now treating both \\"Lord Lucans,\\" and several former acquaintances who now want Lucan caught, not because they believe that murder is wrong, but because times have changed--\\"Lucky Lucan failed to show up [for questioning], which was really lowering our standards....he was a very great bore.\\"Satiric and mordantly critical of aristocratic pretension, this is vintage Spark. Her plotting is tight, with no loose ends and no digressions, and her selection of details is exquisitely careful and controlled. Her themes and motifs, especially those of blood as it relates to both crime and breeding, are so intricately connected to all the characters and the plot, that it is difficult to discuss them without giving away the clever plot twists. And Spark does all this in less than two hundred pages. It is impossible not to read this at a gallop to find out what happens--while smiling the whole time at Spark's wry wit. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"&quot;Aiding and Abetting&quot; has Muriel Spark's trademark lightness and deftness of style. It isn't one of her deepest books, and it lacks the poignancy of her best work; but she still sparkles. As we Muriel Spark Groupies know, she has had a lifelong fascination with the theme of the wrong person (from the murderer's point of view - from the victim's point of view, of course, it's always the wrong person) being murdered by mistake, because that's what almost happened to her when she was a young woman. I wonder if this is the reason this true-crime story appealed to her. I also see echoes of Evelyn Waugh in this book; this is meant as praise, not criticism. I miss the undercurrent of the supernatural, especially the sinister characters who may or may not be demons, that characterizes her best work. For those reading Muriel Spark for the first time, I recommend my favorite of all her books, &quot;A Far Cry From Kensington.&quot; You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"The high-brow farce of \\"Aiding and Abetting\\" revolves around two drawn-from-real-life criminals who both have \\"blood on their hands.\\" The first, Lord \\"Lucky\\" Lucan, who intended to murder his wife but mistakenly killed his children's nanny, disappeared in 1974 and hasn't been seen since. The second is Beate Pappenheim/Hildegard Wolf, a fraudulent stigmatic and faith healer who bamboozled her followers before escaping with a fortune.But, to complicate matters even further, Spark adds a third impostor: a former butler who looks so much like Lucan (\\"They were not indistinquishable, but they might have been brothers.\\") that the two work in league to thwart either's capture. The comedy results when Spark brings together her three characters: a fraud who reenters the \\"real\\" world by assuming a new identity, a murderer who flees to the underworld by assuming a fake identity, and a butler who straddles both worlds by assuming the identity of a killer pretending not to be a killer. Each of the three becomes dependent on the other two for survival, and an uneasy detente results because the exposure of any of them would likely result in the exposure of all three.Since authorities suspected that Lucan's escape was enabled by his aristocratic peers, the author adds further irony depicting an upper class who protects a murderer because it's the \\"proper\\" thing to do: \\"They seemed to have been faithful in the class-conscious sense.\\" No doubt it's hard for modern (especially young) readers to imagine that, only thirty years ago, upper-class snobbishness extended even to assisting a homicidal maniac. British aristocrats \\"are not the same people as [they] were a quarter of a century ago . . . Since Lucan's day, snobs have been greatly emarginated.\\" Spark is ridiculing both British aristocracy and their hankering for the \\"good old days\\"; it is this theme in particular that recalls the early satires of Evelyn Waugh.The novel's hasty ending likewise reminds the reader of Waugh's \\"A Handful of Dust\\"; it is somewhat unsatisfying, not the least because the perspective shifts unexpectedly during the final pages. Still, although a slim, brisk read (barely a novella, in fact), \\"Aiding and Abetting\\" hits many of its upper-crust targets while simultaneously mocking the meaning of identity."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"Twenty-five years after the murder of nanny Sandra Rivett, two Lord Lucans consult Parisian psychiatrist Dr. Hildegard Wolf. The anniversary is also the catalyst for a new investigation into Lucan's disappearance, conducted by the daughter of one of Lucan's former friends. Hildegard is initially shocked by having to treat two Lucans, but then takes it in her stride. One of the Lucans, obviously, has to be fake, but which one? However, both Lucans know about Hildegard's subversive past, and have got a hold on her, forcing her to flee. If it's one thing Lucan knows well, it's how to run...Resumes of this novel can't help but sound fantastic and more than a little distasteful. After all, those who suffered from Lucan's crime are still living. However, the disappearance of Lucan remains as enigmatic today as it ever was. The rumours of what happened to him, and what actually happened on the night he killed Sandra Rivett are numerous. All these are discussed in Spark's novel, although the common belief amongst Lucan's former friends that he must have killed himself is arbitrarily dismissed. The question is how could such a dull man ever have evaded capture for so long? One of the most improbable stories about Lucan, printed in the Guardian at the time of the murder, was that he was once considered for the film role of James Bond.It seems that Muriel Spark has borrowed the name of Robert Walker (the alias of one of the Lucans), from Hitchcock's film 'Strangers on a Train'. This fits her story since both Lucans are presumed to be in collusion with one another for some reason. In Hitchcock's film, Robert Walker kills Farley Granger's wife, and then blackmails Granger to murder his business tycoon father. Both Lucans blackmail Hildegard about her shady past. I couldn't find any reference to the fake stigmatic Spark based this part of her story upon, but there is another stigmatic of Bavaria in history, who was called Teresa Neumann. All in all, the magic of Spark's prose and characterisation draws you in. The only moment that you may have trouble trying to believe is when the young Lacey and the aged Joseph Murray fall in love when searching for Lucan. Maybe this will draw the attentions of Hollywood to this novel! This intriguing story is composed in a tasteful, elegant way, and there are moments when you can't help but burst into laughter, such is Muriel Spark's great wit. I haven't given this novella full marks though, because it does have quite limited ambitions. I think it could also have gone straight into paperback - it doesn't seem good value at a hardcover price."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"A vividly imagined tale of what might have been had the infamous Lucky Lucan (wanted for murder) come to Paris with his body double, settled in for overpriced psychotherapy with a former fake stigmatic and ultimately ended up sealing his fate in a most unexpected (and unbelievable) way.

I liked her autobiography as well. But this book is a great disappointment. The characters are shallow: in particular, Dr. Wolf is cardboard and scarcely believable.

A very thin book indeed, which would probably have received much less attention if the author did not have such a reputation."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"Everything in *Aiding and Abetting* is doubled--the characters, the plot lines, the language, even the title. And this division runs through the book and gives it a strangely opaque equipoise in the midst of its frenetically jammed incidents and its plethora of characters. All this in 166 pages! The tone is moral, but the perspective from which judgments should emanate is not immediately apparent, though we are presented with villains and rogues aplenty. The result is a breathless and giddy novel, like many of her others. How much pleasure this affords you I suppose is a matter of personal taste, but I loved every balanced sentence of it, and I found its deadpan hilarity so captivating that my immediate reaction on finish it the first time was to start it again. Muriel Spark is inimitable; this is one of her best."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"Muriel Spark's new novel interweaves the story of Lord Lucan, a dissolute English Earl who murdered his children's nanny and tried to kill his wife in 1974, then disappeared, with the story of Hildegard Wolf, a psychiatrist with an unconventional method of treating patients and a secret past of her own.Rumours of Lord Lucan's whereabouts continue to pop up: noone knows if he is still alive or not. In this book, Spark has two separate &quot;Lord Lucan&quot;'s visit Dr. Wolf for treatment. Before long Wolf is wondering how much they know about her, how much they know about each other, and which if either of them is the real Lord Lucan. Several other people are drawn into the search for Lord Lucan, including an old friend of his, and the daughter of another old friend of his, and Hildegard's long-time lover. The resolution is amusing and unexpected.Spark considers the complicity of accomplices in crime, and the morality of the &quot;upper classes&quot;, and the persistence of guilt. Her writing is as always extremely clever -- dare I say it sparkles? -- and the book is slantingly funny and morally insistent and a thoroughgoing joy to read. At 82, Muriel Spark remains a truly brilliant writer. (Like another reviewer, I can't quite bring myself to rate this 5 stars -- but only because the book is so short. It's better than the average 4 star book, at any rate.)"},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"This book by Ms. Muriel Spark, \\"Aiding And Abetting\\", deals with a crime committed in 1974 and a perpetrator that is known, but still unaccounted for. The crime itself is true and the book is a study of what might have or could have happened in the last 27 years. It is entirely possible that the criminal could read this book, as he would be only 66 years old at the time of publication.Having no prior knowledge with the event it was difficult to be absorbed in the actual crime. For those who remember it I would imagine the experience of reading this book would be all the more interesting. I enjoyed it, but had I been acquainted with the event before, I believe I would have enjoyed it more. I imagine that many of the players in the book represented real or referred to persons presumed to be involved, but again not knowing the original players and their involvement this aspect was not readily apparent. The Author also chose to run a parallel story about another criminal, which seemed to make the events even more improbable. This is a very brief book and the number of characters was a bit overwhelming.What is very clear is the condemnation the Author continually points out about the supposed privileged persons of England, and their absurd sense of their self and their place in the world. This is not tabloid nonsense rather a very biting commentary on how this man most likely was able to flee the scene, and how to this day he is seen as something other than a person who should be hung until quite dead. Even the next generation who affects being appalled at their previous generation's behavior really is in search of an interview with the criminal and not an arrest. Ms. Spark takes this to every level of the upper classes and involves the Church as well. These persons who act as though they live in the 18th Century is morbidly demonstrated by their suggesting the lower classes are likely to bleed more than their aristocratic counterparts.The suggested story is brought to an end that is a bit too neat and predictable. It is a sort of, turnabout is fair play, event and was not as satisfying as I wished it were. The book is well written by a woman who is in the 9th decade of her life and is still producing quality work far above most contemporary writers."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"Muriel Sparks' latest novel &quot;Aiding &amp; Abetting&quot; doesn't take up much shelf space but sure proves the adage that less may be more ! This psychological thriller, based on the unsolved Lord Lucan murder mystery, is so cleverly constructed and seamlessly meshed with the subject of another true story - that of the fake stigmatic Beate Pappenheim - I found myself unable to stop until I finished it in one sitting. Sparks' ingenious plotting is once again evident in the way the pulsating narrative takes unexpected twists and turns that keeps you in total suspense with the unyielding promise of a surprise ending. I felt my heart thumping and my mind racing just watching the two Lucans and Hildegarde and their aiders connive and plot to outwit each other. The novel may have taken class as its starting point but it is blood that binds their fate. Nobody writes like Sparks these days. Her dry wit and rare economy with words make for an eloquence that is both unique and unparalleled. It is also a hallmark of great writing. &quot;Aiding &amp; Abetting&quot; may be her best work in recent times. This slim novel sure packs a wallop. It comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"Here's one British reader who is feeling generous this morning so has given 'Aiding and Abetting' two stars instead of one...The seventh Earl of Lucan disappeared on November 7, 1974, having bludgeoned the child-minder to death and failed to dispose of his wife in the same manner. By all accounts, he was a fairly useless individual, so it should come as no surprise that he mistook his intended target. If he is to be remembered (which seems fairly unlikely in the long term) it will be for the fact that, despite having no obvious talents or abilities (other than the consistent ability to lose at gambling), he has managed to evade the law for so long. Suspicion lies with the so-called nobility for having sheltered and financed him for so many years \\"...to protect his good name...\\" can you believe!If Muriel Spark is to be remembered, it will most likely be for 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'. It will most certainly not be for 'Aiding and Abetting' which reads like an unfinished second draft. The sentence structure is impoverished, the characters lack either characterization or motivation, and the story is, frankly, stupid.Save your money... you'd do better buying a Superman comic."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"I am a big Muriel Spark fan and I know her characters can be a bit quirky and the conversation a little surreal. That said, this was TOO much that way. It came off as stilted. The main characters were shallow and (as I saw noted in other reviews) the book was somewhat repetitive. I did stick with it to the end, but only because it was pretty short and didn't take much time. I am a Brit and was a teenager at the time of this crime, so I do remember it and also remember the \\"upper class\\" entitlement thing that was in its last throes in the 70s. Still - just a so-so read and not up to this author's usual standard."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"Muriel Spark's novels have always been fabulous and Aiding and Abetting is certainly no exception. It is a fictional account of an actual murder suspect from Great Britain in the early 70s. Lord Lucan was accused of murdering his children's nanny and the attempted murder of his wife, but escaped capture. Although there are those that suspect he then killed himself, there are others who believe he has been living in some form of exile, with the help of many of his wealthy friends, the aiders and abettors the novel's title refers to. In this novel, we meet two \\"Lord Lucans\\", both seeking treatment in the present day from Dr. Hildegard Wolf, a psychiatrist practicing in France. She too is escaping some deceptions of her past (although they are no where near as heinous as murder). She initally believes they are both frauds, but things begin to change her mind. The novel also follows the paths of two people who believe they are closing in on Lord Lucan. But are they? This is an intriguing novella that tells an interesting story. Spark's writing is fabulous, as usual. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"A mystery filled with wit, and based on the famous Lord Lucan case (a murderer who escaped, and to this day, no one knows if he's alive or dead). Spark has not lost her touch, and this is a short, engaging book that you won't want to put down."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"This book will be a four star effort for most British readers and a two star work for most American ones. I averaged the two to reach my three star rating.The absurdities of the upper classes always amuse the British, and this one is excellent in that regard. Being the 7th Earl of Lucan doesn't mean that you have any sense, have any purpose in your life, or do any good. Regardless of all that, people will rally around to help him . . . because of the old school tie and all that.For Americans, the joke runs a little thin. It could have been carried off in short story. Ms. Spark seems to have imagined her ending, and then simply developed a plot that could connect that back to the real-life murder and attempted murder that form the basis of the book.The second story line is about a fake stigmatic from Bavaria who disappeared after stealing donated funds. Being at least a little imaginative, Beate Pappenheim will appeal to more readers than Lord Lucan will. However, she wasn't really necessary for the joke, but does give Ms. Spark the ability to stretch a short story into a novella.To stir up a little interest, the book has a small mystery to solve. Who is Lord Lucan? In pursuing this idea of identity, the book takes off on modern psychiatry . . . basically pointing out that there's not much there. Ms. Pappenheim pretends to be a psychiatrist, ignores all the rules, and still creates a series of very devoted patients who depend on her.Ms. Spark also explores imagery in many significant ways to develop her story. Blood is the key image. Blood ties the upper classes together. Blood is part of a woman's monthly cycle. A messy murder causes blood to be spilled. Being able to use blood in new ways creates opportunity for Ms. Pappenheim. Being able to describe what it's like to kill in cold blood is a way to identify Lord Lucan. And so on. Ms. Sharp shows her writing brilliance in these ways.Ultimately, I was sorry that she didn't pick a more worthy subject for her humor. Lord Lucan seems like such a useless person that it seems like a waste of one's time to even have to think about him. That could have been overcome by spending more time satirizing those who helped him, but, alas, she did not do that.If you're British (or have a very British outlook), read the book. If you're American (or don't like British humor about the upper classes), skip the book.If you do decide to read the book, think about who would stick by you no matter what you had done. Why would they? How can you develop more close ties who would do the same, not because they will need to do so, but because you will benefit from that kind of close relationship?Support worthy activities!"},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"A wonderful book that can be read in one sitting, which I did. The psychiatrist, with her strange background, is sufficiently weird and fits right in with the rest of the characters.Loved the ending. It could happen. Maybe it has!"},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"25 years after the seventh Earl of Lucan clobbered his wife and killed the nanny, he shows up in Paris at the office of psychiatrist Dr. Hildegard Wolf. But she already has a patient who claims to be Lord Lucan. Will the real one please prove it? And what about Hildegard, who really is Beate Pappenheim, a fugitive fake stigmatic from Bavaria? The author has great fun twisting things around between these three bad people, at times coming close to the Keystone Cops. But blood will tell, with murder, with stigmata and with the British nobility. This book does not make much sense, but it is good fluffy fun.Amusing sideline: Bavaria had a well-known stigmatic - Therese von Konnersreuth - who &quot;practised&quot; there from 1925 until her death in the 1960s. She was never accused of fraud but, to this day, Rome is rather sceptical."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"this comes from someone who knew nothing of the legend of lord lucan.. but still.. from the opening of the story i was intrigued by it. however, the book is constantly repeating the few details that it shares with us on the crime and lord lucan's disappearance over and over again. i felt the book to be very incomplete. the key word here is repetitive. It's just a bore! Pass it! (the last two sentences being the only in need of capitalization)"},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"Muriel Spark hasn't lost her touch. AIDING AND ABETTING isn't one of her very best novels (of her more recent books I prefer REALITY AND DREAMS, although AIDING AND ABETTING is far superior to SYMPOSIUM), but it's still a very good book.As one reviewer below notes, a curious doubling is one of the tropes of this book--mistaken and overlapping identities mask, I suspect, a concern with lack of identity. Spark handles her various themes with her usual grace, wit, and, most importantly, economy. This book is 166 pages, and Spark uses every one of them well (even when she tells us something twice, we can be sure it is for a good reason).One final note: AIDING AND ABETTING and DECLARE make for interesting comparison. I have no idea whether Muriel Spark and Tim Powers have much overlap in audience, but perhaps they should. They write very different books, but these two show an interesting coincidence of subject matter. Powers and Spark investigate the possibilities of infamous British aristocrats, in Powers' case Kim Philby, and in Spark's Lord Lucan. The Burgess and Maclean case comes up in both books, and the idea of the decaying English aristocracy as letting them and Lucan escape in a fit of apathy, disbelief, class loyalty, and moral paralysis is important to both writers' aims. Spark conjures up a future for Lucan while Powers' fantasy of history &quot;explains&quot; Philby and indeed the entire Cold War. Doubling, noted above as key to Spark's book, is equally important to Powers, on a more fantastic level. In the end, they take different approaches: Powers' Philby is fascinating, complex, sad and deservedly damned; Spark's Lucan is a study in the banality and triviality of evil. There is mystery, but Lucan is too small to be of great interest to his own story."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"Summary: Not a thriller, but a social comedy that skewers the English class system while examining the face of evil.On the evening of November 7, 1974, the seventh Earl of Lucan beat his children's young nanny to death in the darkened basement of his London townhouse. He attacked and severely injured his estranged wife. Lucan then walked out into the night and disappeared. A warrant was issued for his arrest, but he was never found. In 1999 Lucan was officially declared dead by the British government.For almost 30 years, the press has speculated that the thuggish aristocrat was aided and abetted in his flight from justice by many of his upper class, old-school cronies. These people apparently couldn't abide the thought of one of their own - familiarly known as \\"Lucky\\" Lucan - standing trial for the death of a mere servant.The Lucan case has inspired a number of true-crime books. Now, in her latest novel, Aiding and Abetting, literary veteran Muriel Spark has taken the facts of the case and \\"spun\\" them into a bizarre social comedy of hidden identities, dark agendas and darker souls.The year is 1999. The location Paris. Dr. Hildegarde Wolfe, renowned psychiatrist to the rich and neurotic, has a dilemma. Not one, but two of her patients claim to be the missing Lord Lucan. She believes they are working together, that one of them is the genuine fugitive and the other is a double hired to throw pursuers off the trail.One - or perhaps both - of the Lucans is blackmailing the doctor, for she herself is an imposter and fugitive. Twenty years earlier, Dr. Wolfe was known as Beate Pappenheim, a false stigmatic and faith healer who embezzled money from her adherents. (Much to her surprise, she'd also managed to miraculously heal a number of them.)Meanwhile, back in London, a couple with past connections to the Lucan case decide to play amateur detective in order to find the missing earl - not to bring him to justice, as in an Agatha Christie mystery, but to interview him for a book they want to write. Lucan is, after all, a celebrity in the O.J. Simpson mold.Although not a thriller, this slender book has enough plot twists, eccentric characters and dry wit to mollify the more sophisticated readers of that genre. The characters are put through the Hitchcockian paces of plot and counter-plot, chase and pursuit - with the plotters, chasers and pursued all changing places throughout the book. Finally, in an off-stage climax worthy of Evelyn Waugh, poetically just desserts are served to the worst offenders.Beneath all this black humor, Spark explores with a deft hand the various faces of evil, as she weaves themes of sin and purification, blood and guilt, flight and punishment into the story.A side note: This reviewer has a personal interest in the Lucan case. On November 7, 1974, I was staying in a bed-and-breakfast just around the block from the scene of the crime. I remember in the following days walking past the earl's townhouse, where a single bobby outside the front door kept an eye on the hordes of photographers and reporters loitering on the sidewalks.None of those representatives of either the police or the press ever cracked \\"The Case of the Missing Murderous Earl,\\" but Ms. Spark offers perhaps the most satisfying solution to the mystery."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"I kept getting the feeling as I read this book that I was supposed to be impressed by its elegance--an elegant, exotic heroine, living in Paris. Not one, but two men claiming to be an internationally-famous criminal. Spare, sophisticated prose and dialogue. But I just couldn't make myself be interested in the characters or the plot.I can't be more specific without revealing more of the plot, but I just couldn't feel that the plot was interesting or believable. The characters were so sparely drawn that I just couldn't care about them.

It seems like everywhere they turned, Lucky appeared as if the story took place in the confines of Bermuda ... not Scotland, London, Paris and Africa.Secondly, Lucky having a double made little sense. I failed to see the upside of Lucky having a double ...can you imagine all the effort and repair that went into building that ruse? Clearly, the double was an unsustainable burden from the start (no wonder Lucky wanted him dead).Yes it's a satire ...but that doesn't allow for utter contrivances. This books only saving grace is its brevity. Given it's blatant shortcomings, I hope the positives the book has garnered here are not token. That's the problem with reviews that lack impartiality... one can never be sure of an accurate review."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"Aiding and Abetting represents my first introduction to Spark's work outside of film, and it will definitely not be the last, at least as long as I can afford to add her titles to my personal library. Dr. Hildegard Wolf is one of the most unique protagonists in modern fiction. Her entanglement with the possible Lord Lucan, based on the real life case, and the possible imposter Walker, though derivative, is actually a study of social pretence, and how the web of our inter-connecting selves can make getting at the truth of the self not only elusive, but nearly impossible, even with skillful back stories offering the reader hints and insinuations. Even when it comes to who we love, as with the supporting character Jean-Pierre, who seems devoted to the Hildegard in her current incarnation, there are some uneasy shadings surrounding the authenticity of that attachment.The novel's end carries a bit of the good fun fantastical that has a long tradition in the history of English letters, but allowing for that little twist, Spark's work is a brilliant study that rivals the like of Waugh or Forster."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"there are some uproarious jokes in this novel, but they are few and far between. the rest is a furious but empty chase, for money and protection which has the merit of speed alone. it begins and then it is over. the main characters are motivated by selfishness and greed. there is nothing likable here. and as a meditation on faith, the aptness of false-healers, idiot lying priests, and medicine-magic, the novel is disgusting and shallow."},{"Title":"Aiding and Abetting: A Novel","review":"I truly enjoyed this novella, with its tropes of double identity adding up to a delicious comedy. I also want to praise the writing (I cannot fathom how the commentator just below me could miss this) which is spare and elegant and makes every word count. You don't need to know anything about the Lacan case -- I had never heard of him prior to reading Aiding & Abetting -- but it helps to be interested at least somewhat in the British aristocracy. That class' bizarre double standards and pure unconsciousness about certain flaws has never been brought out better. In fact, Sparks' illustration of the aristocratic attitude is scary in its amorality.A very entertaining and representative novella and a terrific introduction to Sparks' work."},{"Title":"Alae Supra Canalem: Wings Over the Canal","review":"It seems odd that the major campaigns of World War II which were fought in the Americas should be neglected by historians, but this is certainly the case. Laudably, in recent years somewhat more attention has been paid to the war in Alaska and the Aleutians, but both the defense of the Panama Canal and the intense antisubmarine campaign in the Caribbean are still little-known. Mr. Hagedorn's book goes a long way toward filling this vacuum. Particularly striking is the case he makes for the &quot;useless&quot; Douglas B-18, &quot;the bomber the Air Corps bought when it should have bought the B-17,&quot; to paraphrase popular sentiment. In fact the B-18 met the Air Corps specification for which it was designed, and gave yeoman service in a role for which it wasn't: antisubmarine warfare. Its crews dealt with such physical hazards as the fickle Caribbean and Central American weather (without weather radar) and a tropical climate (without air conditioning), and the keenly felt frustration of a low priority for personnel, equipment and supplies. Mr. Hagedorn's account of how they overcame these obstacles and prevailed makes for an absorbing read. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Alae Supra Canalem: Wings Over the Canal","review":"Historian Dan Hagedorn has spent a great deal of time combing through the multitude of files in various archives. That work shines in &quot;Alae Supra Canalem&quot;. It is a well researched and organized book. After giving a detailed overview of the development of American air power in central america from the birth of aviation, Hagedorn recounts the near-panic rush to protect the strategic Panama Canal from attack and sabotage in the 1940's. He outlines the strength, weaponry and stations of every unit. Fears of an invasion fleet coming over the horizon at the war's beginning are related in directness that gives respect to the missions of those who were there. The crucial impact of this force's fight against German submarines in the Caribbean is recounted in detail that is totally missing in other histories. This book brings a unique angle to the Second World War. And it will be sure to bring back many memories for the men and women who served their country in that theatre of war. It certainly did for my grandfather; he was delighted that his contribution to the war effort had finally been chronicled. Numerous photos of airmen, their planes and where they lived and worked were gleaned from both government files and veterans, which gives an inside look at the subject."},{"Title":"Alae Supra Canalem: Wings Over the Canal","review":"Military historians are notorious for being poor writers; they seem to have a quota on the amount of howevers, moreovers and indeeds they must put into a book.

That might be partly due to the fact that I've always had a hard time focusing my attention on number theory. This book has a lot of basic stuff about numbers, and I found much of that subject rather tedious and (dare I say it?) boring. I know that's an ignorant thing to say - after all, mathematics is a beautiful subject in its own right, and there is some really neat stuff in number theory. But it was still a tough book for me to wade through.The introduction is mostly historical background, and a little truncated. It serves primarily to illustrate a few basic concepts in self-similarity. The author continues this theme with a short description of figurate and m-adic numbers. Gazale tends to use more technical language than many casual readers are likely to recognize. Yet this really isn't a book on formal mathematics, either. It's really somewhere in between.Gazale often draws on themes from Martin Gardner's series of articles in Scientific American, and in some ways, his book reflects Gardner's style. And, while much of this book seems focused on abstract details, there are occasional forays that illustrate amazing connections between what looks like pure mathematics and the real world.Chapter 2, titled \\"Continued Fractions,\\" is foundational. I really enjoyed this section, and think the book is worth having for this chapter alone. Beginning with Euclid's algorithm, Gazale offers a natural introduction to continued fractions. Then, in his characteristic style, he continues to explore every nook and cranny of this fascinating branch of mathematics. Among the most pleasing results of this chapter is his demonstration of the mirrored similarity in the appearance of numbers as they are represented by continued fractions, and as they are represented by our traditional positional number system. For example, he shows that both representations are always convergent and uniquely correspond to a number. However, while infinite periodic representations correspond to rational numbers in the positional system, they correspond to quadratic irrationals in the system of continue fractions. And, while transcendental and irrationals are infinite nonperiodic representations in both systems, there are some beautiful expressions of some transcendental numbers in the system of continued fractions that left me mesmerized.One particularly nice feature is the way the author summarizes the important equations at the back of each chapter. Some of these summaries are several pages long, and they actually do a good job of encapsulating the essential material. In fact, the summaries are so well done that, if you read the book, you probably will be able to go back and use the formulas in the back of the chapters without having to refer back to the text.If you ever wanted to know about the Fibonacci sequence, I can hardly imagine a book that will satisfy you better than this one. The first thing you will learn is that the Fibonacci sequence you met in grade school is just a small subset of a more general form. Then, in a whirlwind of mathematical activity you will see the general recursive formula (which depends, of course, on the seed and gnomonic numbers). This is followed by explicit formulae for the terms of the sequence and even a demonstration of how some of these equations, in the limit, model the behavior of wave propagation in an electronic transducer ladder, and the movement of a ganged series of pulleys.A continuing source of amazement is the way in which the mathematical themes in this book are so interconnected. That's fitting, I suppose, for a book called Gnomon. In the chapter on whorled figures we see many of the other subjects in this book reappearing.The book also has an excellent chapter on the golden number, and another on the silver number. The golden number, as you may know, shows up all over the place, and not just in Gazale's book. Here, he connects it with the Fibonacci sequence, whorled spirals, and golden rectangles. And for every example using the golden number, not surprisingly, there is another using the silver number. It's fascinating to read of all the ways in which these numbers shows up, and try to contemplate the underlying order that makes it happen this way.Things get a little more abstract toward the end of the book (but no less interesting), and a bit harder to read. There are some very interesting developments with spirals and the rotation matrix, along with some interesting construction techniques for making your own spirals with paper and pen.The last chapter, on fractals, exercised my little gray cells more than the rest of the book. This is not your typical discussion about fractals, with pretty pictures and non-technical explanations about self-similarity at any level. While Gazale does not dive in with the sort of mathematical rigor to which a pure mathematician would aspire, he claims to have written an unusual chapter on the subject, derived directly from number-theoretic considerations. This chapter will keep you busy following all the ins and outs of some pretty involve matrix mathematics. If you like the fast-Fourier algorithm, I think you'll love it.This book is definitely not for everyone. But if you really, really like mathematics, and especially number-theoretic mathematics, I think you will like it. It will most definitely exercise your mind, but then again, that's what a good book on mathematics is supposed to do. Isn't it?"},{"Title":"Gnomon","review":"I'm a regular reader of all sorts of books on math, and so Gnomon seemed a natural for me. I have a master's degree in computer science (bachelors, too, but i digress) and this sort of thing is right up my alley. The book doesn't really cover any new ground, but it does gather separate things into one volume, which makes it nice as a reference. The biggest problem with the book is with the actual text. This guy can't write. Yes, the material is technical, yes it's slow going, but that is no excuse for poorly structured arguments and incoherent organization of the material.It's all here, but you'll need to work through it slowly and try to infer what he means because he leaves out a bunch of foundation work."},{"Title":"Gnomon","review":"A very approachable text that appeals to the academic as well as non academic.The simplicity and power of mathematics is demonstrated by this erudite author who promotes this unique and historical approach of the evolution of math.

Very stimulating."},{"Title":"Gnomon","review":"....I found this book to be relatively well written, but tediously boring. This book should probably be considered \\"Recreational Mathematics\\" and is jammed with math; very little prose accompanies it. Indeed, if you do not love math, or do not love math for the sake of math (rather than, say, a physicist who merely loves math for the sake of his primary interest in physics) then you will probably not enjoy this book.The prose that the book contains seems to attempt to relate the various math that Gazale demonstrates to practical problems, especially in electrical engineering. I found these analogies to be difficult to follow and did not create much understanding of the material. For example, he discusses resonant LCR circuits and power transmission lines, and his descriptions pale in comparison to those I found in Feynman's \\"Lectures on Physics.\\"Now,... this book has a number of useful things in it which is why I say it's \\"well written.\\" It does include mathematical summaries in the end of every chapter. In my opinion, this was the best part of the book. By reading only the summaries, the reader \\"takes away\\" most of what the author is trying to say, without having to suffer through the rest of it. If the summary is not self-evident, the reader can always go back to the chapter to divine how one of the entries in the summary was derived.All in all, I would not recommend this book to those interested in anything other than math for math's sake. If your interest lies elsewhere, or even only obliquely in math (such as in learning math for a specific use), then avoid this book. However, if you do enjoy a mathematical romp, then this book could well be the one for you."},{"Title":"Cadillac","review":"This book is strictly for the fan who likes to see big, colorful, modern-day pictures of classic Cadillacs. Tons of 57 Eldorado Brougham pictures (and some great ones at that). Good coverage for the rest of the years with the exception of the seventies. (Great '72 and '76 Eldorado Convert. shots though). Nice shots of '80 Seville (says its an Elegante, but it isn't). Biggest waste of space are the pages dedicated to the Cimmarron. Hello! Anyone who knows Cadillac Fans knows that we don't even consider that a real Cadillac in any way, shape, or form. Should have dedicated those pages to '84 Eldo Convert.

My dad read it in the 40's and it is still a good book for boys."},{"Title":"Lottery Master Guide","review":"First of all, let me just say that it takes A LOT of WORK and PATIENCE to pull off a success, using the techniques in this book. For those of you who think this book is a 1-2-3 gateway to winfall, think again. Great things hardly come easily.With that said, I have been doing HEAVY testing with the techniques in this book for about a year and the results are confirmed. IT WORKS! The numbers I've generated within that year's time have captured over $13,000 in wins, not to mention the highly numerous Take-5 FREE PLAYS I amassed on a REGULAR basis. In one game I managed to capture 44 FOUR-NUMBER COMBOS! That is simply phenomenal!My recommendation for those who are having trouble with the book is this:1. Use Microsoft Excel2. Track the frequency of the number skips - this will tell you which numbers to remove from your final group, reducing your pool to 17 numbers or less! (ex. if a skip of 10 hs been out for five games, check how often a skip of 10 stays out between hits)3. Play BIG. You can't expect to win big with scared money. I've tried diligently without success. It took nearly $400 to net a $10,000 win.4. When using Gail's 5-number wheels, there is a feature designed to refine your numbers. You press F4 to activate it. When F4 takes you to the next screen, press F4 at least 3 to 4 times (this takes you toward the higher spectrum). In either of those windows, you will find winning numbers.5. To hit a jackpot, you will need to use Power Numbers. Sorry, but that was the ONLY way I was capable of capturing a jackpot. I learned this with my experiments that utilized PREVIOUSLY released winning numbers. Even when I had less than 15 numbers in my group, which included all of the winning numbers, the non-Power Number wheels still failed to capture a jackpot.Good luck breaking the lottery![UPDATE] You will want to read the comments."},{"Title":"Lottery Master Guide","review":"Gail Howard's book titled 'Lottery Master Guide' is the 'one and only' book that anyone needs to help win any State or any country's lottery! I have read a number of other authors' books on how to win the lottery, and all others I read were very confusing, and/or didn't give enough good info to help at all!I own several of Gail's books and also her software, and am proud to say I have won a lot of prizes using her number selection methods and wheels over the years. No, I haven't won the elusive jackpot yet,..but I feel it's only a matter of time for me!The 'Lottery Master Guide' explains all her methods and charts in detail to help you reduce the high lotto odds by millions! Once this is explained to you, you'll see how to win multiple prizes in any State or Country's lottery.In this book, there are many unique number selection methods mentioned that I haven't seen anywhere else that will help you trap the winning lottery numbers in your selection process. Yes, the lottery drawing itself is a random type drawing done usually with a 'machine', but, even so, you can clearly still see patterns that develop over and over again and use them to your advantage to win prizes.From using the charts and methods shown in plain to understand language, to look at the numbers in ways that most never even think of, you can finally be a constant winner like myself, and many, many others using her systems and methods.This book will show you how to spot trends and when to take advantage of them.Her other books are wheeling books (Lotto How to Wheel a Fortune, Lotto Wheel Five to Win and her Powerball/Mega Millions book) and they have hundreds of guaranteed wheeling systems that show minimum and maximum amounts you will be guaranteed to win. These wheels are guaranteed 'double your money back' if one fails to produce a win for you, as long as all or some of the winning numbers drawn, are in the particular wheel you use.Gail Howard has spent many years developing lottery systems and information to help people beat the lottery odds, and she has 74 documented lottery Jackpot winners to prove her methods do really work! How many other lottery systems out there can claim that many actual lottery Jackpot winners using her methods?So if you want to play the lottery and win prizes more often, then this book, 'Lottery Master Guide' is the first and last book you'll need to get you on your way to winning the lottery.Good Luck to you all...no...actually...Smart luck!Randall Miller, NY"},{"Title":"Lottery Master Guide","review":"I purchased this book over a year and a half ago, and I have yet to win big. I have studied this book from cover to cover, and use it with Lotto:How to Wheel a Fortune,also by Gail Howard. Anyone who considers purchasing either book should know that the majority of the jackpot winners in her testimonial section are from the late eighties. In theory, Lottery Master Guide appears to offer a variety of proven systems to beat the odds, but sad to say, I do not feel it lives up to its claims. I personally, would advise you to save your money and not purchase either book."},{"Title":"Lottery Master Guide","review":"These principles are clearly laid out and the formulas very easy to use.

There is logic and sense to what she has to say. She is intelligent and well reasoned and it all fits together. You can tell she put some thought into it.The points she makes are logical and clear.

Now that I understand the logic of Howard's approach to this seemingly random game, I am confident that I will be a lottery winner. Howard's writing style is simple, clear, and extremely easy to follow. As a result, the opportunity to apply her approach to playing the lottery makes the game more enjoyable and, I believe, winnable. Anyone interested in understanding how lotteries work and how to become a winner should read all of Gail Howard's books."},{"Title":"Lottery Master Guide","review":"If there were discernable trends in state lotteries that someone could capitalize on... 1.)States could no longer generate revenue from them. 2.)No one would publish the formula. Those are the cold hard facts. All this book does is give you some common sense for picking numbers, and overall enhances the entertainment value derived from playing the lottery. From that standpoint it's worth every penny and an enjoyable read. I haven't quit my day job yet, but I've had a lot of fun with this book."},{"Title":"Lottery Master Guide","review":"It is a so-called \\"how to win\\" guide that has nothing scientific. The book is simplistic and focused on prediction. No mathematical approach.Reading any lottery book with the word \\"win\\" in its title is a waste. For realizing this, you must first get in touch with the essence of lottery. For doing this, get a book on mathematics of lottery.You better use the money to buy more tickets instead of this book."},{"Title":"Lottery Master Guide","review":"This book is the most extensive you will ever read about the lottery and strategies for playing it. That being said, the information within this work is old and outdated. This is why you no longer hear about lottery players using these strategies and winning, even if they belong to a large club.Gail obviously wrote this material many years ago. The state lotteries read her older books and then modified the rules and number selection, making it much harder for players to win through wheeling and other methods. The book often cites a 49-number lotto game, for example. Today's games typically have 54 numbers or even more. The larger pool of numbers exponentially raises the odds in favor of the state lotto commission, making Gail's older methods ineffective and unusable.Unless you are already a millionaire, you will be unable to afford the large quantity of tickets needed for a single drawing just to try to win. And then your next problem will be logistics. One person alone with unlimited free time and funding still cannot buy thousands of tickets generated by a wheeling system for a 54-number game.Is this a bad book? No, the research is quite fascinating. But be aware that it is antiquated due to changes in the lottery system. You might as well keep playing Quick Pick because the statistics in this book are for games in the past, particularly the 1980's when Gail's methods were revolutionary."},{"Title":"Lottery Master Guide","review":"If you are new to playing lottery then this is the book to get. Plenty of charts to get you thinking and analyzing numbers so you can create your OWN systems. I highly recommend this book for all beginning lottery enthusists."},{"Title":"Lottery Master Guide","review":"Gail Howard is the pioneering author on lottery winning systems, having started about twenty years ago. She deserves credit on many points: first, she is completely honest. She doesn't lie about her own modest winnings and all her testimonials are genuine. This deserves applause. The Lotto Black Book, being virtually incomprehensible, has no testimonials of its own and instead uses some of Gail's. Second, she deserves credit for her documentation on the rules of lotteries around the world, and third, she has compiled an extensive database of past lottery drawings which can be downloaded for free from her web site and which can be read with her free Smartluck history editor.On the negative side, Gail believes in, and is teaching to others, incorrect mathematics. This bothers me and I'm sure all those involved in trying to teach correct mathematics. I'll cover only a few points here, but there are many. She says that the combination 1-2-3-4-5-6 or any combination of six consecutive numbers is practically impossible because she has never seen an example in her database of past drawings. She gives only a qualitative opinion, she doesn't say how unlikely. This is what a mathematician might say:A 6/49 lottery has 13,983,818 possible drawing combinations and in all the 6/49 lotteries in the world from their inception only about 2% of these actually have been drawn. The probability that 1-2-3-4-5-6 or any other particular sequence has been drawn therefore is 2%, so Gail is probably right that it has never come up. There are 43 possible sequences in all and the probability that at least one of them will come up at least once is 58%, so we would say that we are 58% sure that some other sequence came up and Gail just missed it. The only thing that sets 1-2-3-4-5-6 apart from most other combinations is that it is more easily noticed. It has no special mathematical properties. Gail is not the only one who makes this error. This is Ken Silver's big \\"secret\\" for which he wants you to pay $35 and which he says makes him a winner in almost every lottery he plays.Gail also says never to play a combination that has won before because it will be 433,245 years before it will come up again for a 6/59 game. That would be 134,459 years for a 6/49 game, however this is just an average. There are two recorded cases of a winning combination being drawn again on the very next draw. One was in the North Carolina Cash-5 Lottery game where the numbers picked were identical on July 9th and 11th, 2007 and another was in the Bulgarian National Lottery draws on September 6 and September 9, 2009.Gail says to make sure that the sum of your chosen numbers falls between 155 and 185 for a 6/49 game because 70% of all winning combinations add up to a sum in this range. This is true, but it is also true of all losing combinations. There is no advantage to being blind in one eye.This is only a sampling of the cases where Gail's intuitive mathematics leads to wrong conclusions. It makes little difference to her because people are constantly winning lottery jackpots whether they are using a system or not, and if they are using one of her systems they will give her the credit. I believe that a proper statistical study, if it were possible to conduct one, would show that Gail's players win no more frequently than any others."},{"Title":"Lottery Master Guide","review":"I have the Lottery Master Guide & her A+ software!

I don't use them all, just several as I don't have as much time as I would like. I made a quick work sheet that helps choose numbers for wheeling. I use the Percentage System, Hot-Cold Tracker, Games Out and Number Groups Tracker.The Medium Term uses Cascade, Double and Triple Bottoms. There are many more here.The Long Term uses Skip and Hit, Companion and Neighboring Pairs. Also many more.Gail has software to help with the Medium and Long Term tests which I do not have as of yet. Still I like to use several of the Short Term Tests to help me choose numbers.The next part of the book has Wheels for Pick five, six and seven lottery games.

This book tells you everything you need to know about the lottery inside and out, while helping you to understand your odds and play smarter instead of playing by pure chance. If you are a true believer of Quick Picks then this book is not for you! If you are not willing to put time and effort into picking your numbers and doing the research of patterns then this book is REALLY NOT for you! I believe that Gail Howard poored her heart and soul into going really in depth with the information in hopes of helping millions change how they play the lotto.

However I didn't want to just throw money away. After browsing around for probability and statistical data (which some of you have suggested) I happen upon Gail Howard's site. I admit at first I was skeptical, but after searching over her claims quite a bit I decided I would give her free tips and free demos a shot. Working on limited knowledge and a half working system I managed to get with in two numbers and one direct hit on every single white ball that was chosen as the winning numbers with my first try. No I do not have a prize to show for using her systems just yet, but I dare any of you to prove your claim that you have done the same with your own random picks and quick picks that the machine dose for you.

Gail does a good job of explaining her processes but doesn't give many clues about how to use the numerous analyses to actually pick numbers. The end result here is that all the science in the world cannot predict the future.The lotto balls that blew up the tube yesterday have no relationship whatsoever to those rolling around in the machine today. Every one of the balls are put back into the machine each time and the odds are always the same. Another book, The Lottery Manual, will put this in plain English.Gail's book also makes ridiculous statements about her Balanced Wheels - IF you pick the right numbers, the wheels guarantee a win. That's a huge and costly IF. Further proof is that she claims people who have used her methods have together won $74 Million. Considering the Billions that have been won in the lottery, these wins are statistically insignificant and no better than chance.Finally, she mostly toots her own horn in this book; promoting her other books and her archaic 1980s DOS software. This is useless and time-consuming information that will win you nothing. Think about it, if she had the secret, why would she share it?

I also use her Advantage Plus software which creates the charts in this book and more, but Lottery Master Guide is the best way to understand what's really going on and how to use the charts to win. Her strategies combine common sense with trends I never would have considered tracking on my own.

Save your money and don't buy this or any other book by Gail Howard. The entire premise of number combinations that are more likely to hit is bogus. It sounds good but its not real.

There is no skill to these types of lottery games-unlike say following the remaining scratch ticket prizes available for a certain game online and seeing what is the best buy.

Otherwise, of course, your game of choice becomes your master, and not your servant. Don't become a Twilight-Zone \\"Franklin\\", (or \\"Francine\\"!)AS a fellow (?) lady gambler, it's really nice for me to see a book written on gambling by another lady! However, the lottery -- at least as it's played in the USA -- has always seemed to have overwhelming odds, especially to someone concentrating on the 35-1 top odds, and other, lesser odds, given in roulette.I wish Ms. Howard well with her books. However, understanding the odds-making on lotteries and horse-racing is well-beyond my meagre abilities. (It's a wise person who knows his or her limits....and that goes about a million times over, when it comes to gambling!)In South American countries, I have read, a different sort of lottery system is used. There, they have about 10 main tickets, each one with many thousands of little tickets. People buy as many of the small tickets, within each of the main tickets, as they want to and can afford.Even to me, this seems a system FAR more likely to produce a winning for the the gambler. OK -- not a HUGE winning, like the Powerball Lottery does...but at least one has a better chance of winning SOMETHING! (And the Powerball Lottery -- which links tickets from many states, come to think of it, DOES bear a distinct and striking resemblance to that WORST of all slot machines to play...the Progressive!)For me, I'll stick to table games: Roulette, mostly, and a little bit of Dice, (\\"craps\\"), Bacarrat, and maybe a game or two of blackjack. These are games I UNDERSTAND, with odds that are not comparable to the astronomical distances encountered in outer space! Gail Howard's books definitely belong on the shelf of anyone who plays the lotteries -- but unless I have enough money to buy at LEAST 1/10 of the prize monies offered, lotteries are just not for me.For those interested in gambling games other than the lottery, I would suggest the works of another lady -- and another Gail -- Gayle Mitchell. Also the works of John Gollehen, R.H. Ellison, and Frank Scoblette. Mr. Scoblette, (a New York City family man), besides writing excellent books, has offered this priceless advice to ANY gambler: 1) Arrive at a casino well-rested. 2) Have a strategy planned 3) Take at least 20 times your average bet with you. 4) Set a win limit 5) Set a loss limit. 6)Stay within these win and loss limits. 7) Rememberthat when you win, it is YOUR money you are playing with,not the casinos.Like most gamblers, I also pray that ONLINE gaming will once agtain become LEGAL in the USA. It doesn't seem to hurt people in other countries where it IS legal. As I often say, \\"I want to pay more taxes, but the government won't let me.\\" If you agree, join with me and others, in The Poker Player's Alliance!Thanks, Ms. Howard, for your efforts. Although they are not for me, they are for many others. I hope they win!And I hope that you continue winning. You definitely deserve it! : )"},{"Title":"Lottery Master Guide","review":"If you're going to start playing the lottery seriously, this is a must buy. LMG is the only concise book I've seen that covers just about everything you need to play and win the lottery. Even if you are just a half-serious and occasional lottery play, you need this book in order to better your chances. Lotteries have enormous odds to overcome, which are nearly impossible. However if you understand odd/evens, high-lows, sums, etc, you can greatly reduces those odds and increase your chances.The only reasons I have given it 4 stars is because she uses the book to frequently market her other products. But on the upside, you don't have to buy those products to use her system, it can all be done with pen and paper. The other reason is because I have not won with it yet, however that may not be the book, it could be that I am not following it correctly.

I feel Gail Howard is more hype than substance. Her latest ploy is to adavance (she has used him for years to diminish me personally) Stig Holmquist to create a web page that was simply designed to decimate my credibility. If you Google Prof. Jones Lotto will now be greeted with \\"Con Man,\\" compliments of Gail and Stig, of course he is selling you everything from Poker Sites to Viagra. I have never believed in this style of business. Buy Gail's book, maybe try my book, but I will not lower myself to attacking her personally.Like \\"Sylvia the Psychic\\" on Montel, Ms. Howard has parleyed her image to connote a knowledge of Lotto, but I would pass on her book. She claims to be a close friend of Ivan Dimitrov, I honestly doubt these claims? She also strongly states, as does Stig, that I \\"stole\\" the Wheeling Systems. A High school student with one-year of Algebra could create unlimited wheeling systems. Let's at least be honest!If you look at Stig's reviews on Amazon or Google, he has become the hit-man for Howard.

They are wonder old thirty-style of mysteries. One of S.S. Van Dine's most famous mysteries in the Philo Vance series is The Kennel Murder Case from which the 1933 movie was made starring William Power as Philo Vance. In the movie, it seems that William Powell is more like his Thin Man character of which he was to star later than the character Philo Vance. Philo Vance is portrayed in all the books by Van Dine as a rather cynical upper-crust sort of fellow, lounging in the era of boot leg liquor and Art Deco.Van Dine tells the story in the book by portraying himself as a character who is a close friend to Vance. Always being asked to help solve crimes by the New York police, Vance watches Van Dine solve complex and interesting murder cases.Van Dine always throws in numerous suspects. In the Kennel Murder Case, Hilda Lake is angry that her uncle, Archer Coe, refuses to loan her any more money. Coe's brother, Brisbane (very Art Deco name) hates his brother for unknown reasons. Then there is Doris Delafield who throws him out of her apartment, and (instead of the butler), there is the Chinese cook who knows and resents that Archer is selling Chinese art treasures.Then Archer Coe is found dead holding a gun in his locked bedroom by the butler. The police first report it as suicide, but then Philo Vance investigates and discovers it was a murder. But who did it, and how did do they in a locked room with no evidence of escape?There are more red herrings thrown in, more dead bodies. But Philo Vance with his advanced wit and knowledge solves the case.If you can get hold of these little gems, they are great reading."},{"Title":"The kennel murder case (Gregg Press mystery fiction series)","review":"I have just finished reading this story, which was the very first Philo Vance mystery for me to encounter. The book was full of dull and rather pointless (at least to the plot of the story) information about Chinese ceramics and dog breeding. Vance's ramblings made it very difficult for me to get into the book, and I found myself sympathizing with Marcum and others when they were fuming over his endless and dull speeches. But I persevered and kept on reading, sure that all this would pay off to a wonderfully clever ending. And I do admit, that trick with the door lock was wonderful! But other than that, the ending was unsatisfactory and disappointing. I do not wish to spoil the story, but what happened to the dead body after it had been initially attacked? Oh, come on! I know that it could actually happen, but please, to bring that unusual an element into the conlusion of a mystery is just plain anticlimactic, though I understand the author's intention of surprising his readers.Overall, the events of the story are not very well arranged, and although the events do come together at the end, it was not in a very satisfactory manner. Other than the ingenius door lock trick, the story was not really worth the time I spent in reading it."},{"Title":"Son of the Stars","review":"_Son of the Stars_ (1952) by Raymond F. Jones was one of 36 juveniles published by Winston in the 1950s. It was common practice for Winston to have their authors write factual forewards or afterwards to their novels. Presumably the notion was that these would help to make them \\"respectable\\" to parents and librarians, though I suspect that most librarians didn't need that kind of trickery.Richard Marsten's _Danger: Dinosaurs!_ (1953) had an essay on an imaginary time-slip and history. Chad Oliver's _Mists of Dawn_ (1952) had a detailed introduction to anthropology. Lester del Rey, in _Marooned on Mars_ (1952), discussed the history of the \\"Martian canals\\" in astronomy and speculated about the possibility of life on Mars. Jack Vance's _Vandals of the Void_ (1953) predicted that we would enter a future age of piracy. Philip Latham explained how he used some out-of-date astronomy as a basis for creating fictional life in _Missing Men of Saturn_ (1953).Raymond F. Jones's essay was a tribute to the \\"back-yard scientists of America\\" (v):A ten-year-old boy in Texas begins the search by producing rotten-egg gas with his Christmas chemistry set. At sixteen, he has a well-equipped basement laboratory. A girl in Oregon is astonished at the wonder of her first glimpse through a microscope in junior high. When she enters college, she takes her laboratory with her-- a box containing her own microscope and a few hundred slides. (v)This topic is one that seems to run through much of Jones's writing. Like Hal Clement, Jones likes to write about scientists-- both professional and amateur-- who engage in the great game of experimentation and observation. At one point, the alien boy Clonar (who knows how to build a transmitter that can communicate over light-years) touches the hero's short-wave radio and says, \\"It must be-- fun, anyway\\" (52). Clonar is being polite, but he is also telling the truth. Science _is_ fun. It's not so much the level of technology that your culture may have that counts. It's how well you play the game. Ultimately, it is decided that Earth must learn to make her own way-- both scientifically and morally.Why morally? Because Clonar is an alien who crash lands on Earth. He is dependent upon the kindness of strangers. He gets it from some people-- the backyard inventer hero, his girlfriend, a crusty country doctor, and an intelligent collie. But often, he does not. The hero's mother is frightened of him. He is arrested by the military. Some of the military (like Colonel Middleton) are unimaginative and paranoid. Others (like General Gillispie) are more intelligent but overly ambitious. The hero's father is tolerant of Clonar, but he has a tendency to believe what those in authority tell him is the truth. Earth people have potential and basic goodness, but they still have a long way to go.If it is at all possible, get the first edition with the original cover by Alex Schomberg. It depicts a fleet of flying saucers gracefully sailing from a planet with a reddish sandy desert and a blue ocean toward Earth hanging prominently in the sky. But I have sometimes wondered... What is the planet in the foreground? Not the Moon. Not with an ocean. But a planet such as Venus or Mars wouldn't show the Earth as prominently in the sky. Mars wouldn't be likely to have an ocean. Given the scientific knowledge of the day, Venus might have an ocean. But it would also have been cloud-shrouded, hiding any view of outer space. Clonar's world is in another galaxy. So what is the world in the forground? Well, never mind. It's still a spectacular cover."},{"Title":"Never Piss Into The Wind","review":"It's a shame that history classes today do not include actual historysuch as the content found in Jules DuBar's Never Piss Into the Wind.While those modern history books spend pages upon pages describinggrandiose events of history that took place far beyond the imaginationof most, DuBar's autobiographical look into the past is a pleasant -and yet shocking - view into an American past that is not so far away,and yet so many of the modern generation are completely oblivious to.Overall, this is a book that is stark in its honesty, holding nothingback and leaving nothing censored. DuBar gladly rips open the drapesfor his audience and lets them peer in the house of his past and thepast of thousands upon thousands of other American youth who grew upall too soon with the Second World War. But DuBar hesitates to simplydwell on the war itself, and while it remains a convenient anchorpoint of the past for the novel, DuBar prefers to fill his novel up tothe top with valuable historical details about how things used to belong before the world got into a big hurry.Not content to be only a historical treasure trove, the book is also avery human novel, coarse and vulgar and strange and wonderful all atonce. DuBar's use of profanity only enhances the realism that youngergenerations miss about the past, supplanted by idiotic grins frompicture-perfect parents. DuBar has none of that and slaps readers backto reality with the swearing and the vivid descriptions of sex throughthe eyes of a young boy and then a man.While those features may seem like a somewhat-burlesque view of thebook, instead DuBar plays to an audience with a deeper, richeroutlook. His tales of his family, of his friendships - especially thatwith Jim Solliday - add a very human element that takes readers off toa place they never expected to go when the first chapter they read wastitled \\"The World's Slowest Train.\\" Other lively characters includehis attention-hungry mother, his world-weary father and his cousinPete, perhaps one of the most loveable drag queens ever to bedescribed in non-fiction literature.Now, while Average Joe will no doubt find this book to be pleasant,enjoyable and beyond, scientists, academics and people of all kindscan latch on to and develop a true connection with this mad geologistwho absolutely refuses to sink into a mold of the snobbish academic.DuBar is certainly unlike the vast majority of scientists as the worldsees them and adds a very human element to the genius inside theskull. He gives people the impression of the truth, that there is abeginning and an end to these scientists, most of which involves lifeoutside the textbooks filled with unpronounceable rock names andfossilized creatures.DuBar's book is certainly a valuable piece of the American historicalpuzzle. The only people that really know about what life in middleAmerica in those days are the people who lived them, and DuBar hasgraciously allowed us to share in that rich past, to let us immerse init and understand how it led us to where we are now. He gives peoplereason to believe that there is, and always has been, another worldout there hiding from us all along, one that contains mystery anddanger and hope and joy and for once we don't have to go to anothercookie-cutter novel to get it.Thanks for sharing with us, Jules."},{"Title":"Never Piss Into The Wind","review":"The book comes at you on multiple levels. On the surface we see a young soldier returning from war with eyes wide open about the hypocrisy of the life and times that he is living in. He takes us on a life journey that spans diverse experiences, university departmental politics, and widely varied episodes involving a whole host of quirky characters; some dangerous, but all strange in their own way.On a different level, this book is a must read for geologists and would-be geoscientists everywhere. It provides a glimpse into the life and struggles of a field geologist/paleontologist, a truly dying breed. In this day when research is being conducted by professionals behind a desk with computers and fancy programs and no clue about the value of truly looking at rocks and fossils, Jules provides the reader with a down-to-earth understanding of the passion of scientific research for the sake of science. The quest for new discoveries is paramount and nothing can stand in its way."},{"Title":"Never Piss Into The Wind","review":"Jules DuBar's \\"NEVER PISS INTO THE WIND\\" is a rollicking series of vignettes from his life. I found the book hard to put down because it is a great read.DuBar is one of America's \\"Greatest Generation.\\" He grew up during the depression in Canton, OH, a harsh blue collar town. His way out was military service during World War II. Using new options open to him, he became a geologist in academe, the petroleum industry and government. While an academician, he studied the coastal plain geology of the Carolinas during the hey-day of adequately-funded field geology. He focuses more on the unusual and interesting characters he meets in the Carolinas and the bonding he established with them. The actual science is left to a minimum and described clearly in lay terms. The people met int he Carolinas are, indeed, a colorful and strange lot.The writing style is outstanding, the language is realistic, wholesome and lively, and his flashback sequences are masterfully done.His accounts of the inner dynamics of academe are truly on the mark, exposing the pettiness and jealousies of faculty colleagues and its effect on the teaching/research program of a publicly-funded institution. Why their administration, board's of trustees or state higher boards of education permit this level of bickering is truly hard to divine.I highly recommend this book for its realistic portrayal of life and the struggles to overcome adversity and being able to enjoy interesting and unusual moments along the way."},{"Title":"Never Piss Into The Wind","review":"ILTy...a geologist, March 7, 2005An early day Hunter S.

He demonstrates the wanton excess associated with college basketbal programs, as well as most football programs. At the same time, he reaffirms the value of most other sports programs at the college level. His voice is a rational warning, unfortunately heard by few university presidents where accountability for this issue really sits. Too many of them, according to Duderstadt, pass the buck for the appalling professionalization of major college sports, placing blame on alumni, the public, state legislatures, faculty or others. Fortunately, he nails down the responsibilities of each group with incriminating detail, and urges massive reform. The cost of the current game plan in Division I schools is rising, he demonstrates, and may end up in defeat for the institutions we consider essential to educating future generations. Read it now -- before March Madness sucks you into the p.r. spin!"},{"Title":"Intercollegiate Athletics and the American University: A University President's Perspective","review":"This book provides an excellent perspective from the President of a major academic and sports university of the challenges of intercollegiate sports. Athletics don't make money at any collegiate level (if costs included fixed plant expenses). They can cause serious scandal for Universities. But still the public demands winning programs. Dr. Duderstadt was perfectly experienced to speak on this issue coming from a great school but also a former athlete. He also brings an interesting perspective of the role of the Provost, which he held prior to being President.But even after listing all of the woes of how athletics affect colleges, he cops out and says they still have a place. I think this shows just how tough the problem is. It was interesting that quite a bit of his reading overlapped mine, and in fact, he agreed with me that Rick Telander, Sports Illustrated writer and former college football player, had a worthwhile solution of making college \\"pro\\" sports optional for colleges.He also had great discussions of the personalities of coaches and athletic directors and how that affects the programs, as well as discussions on how the media can harm college athletics. Sports journalists don't score high on his list.This book doesn't solve any problems but does give a different and insightful analysis of the challenge. I recommend this book to those trying to understand the finances of college athletics and how an athletic department exists inside a major university."},{"Title":"Intercollegiate Athletics and the American University: A University President's Perspective","review":"During a season when there are some excellent books on college sports (Shulman and Bowen's Game of Life, and Murray Sperber's Beer &amp; Circus), Duderstadt comes up with something of a dud (sorry for the pun). He calls for the reform of college sports but this is the guy who, as president of the University of Michigan, tolerated a special academic program, Sports Management, in which his jocks with academic problems were sheltered. It is really hard to take him seriously with a background like that. It's as if he has found religion--reform college sports.Good luck to him, and I suppose that any critic of big-time college sports should be congratulated for taking an unpopular stand but this book is too little and far too late."},{"Title":"Intercollegiate Athletics and the American University: A University President's Perspective","review":"Good Book.

It is a warm humorous love story and a first hand insight into what it was like being part of circus life in a bygone era. Shirley writes about of being a newly wed on a Circus train, learning the ropes and class system of Circus life, living on the road and about the friends the bride made among the performers and side show acts. What better training for a woman who later became one of Hollywood's top Press Agents than sharing your life (and car) with wild and dangerous animals. O'Connor's perspectives and insights into the Circus culture can be appreciated by circus fans or anyone who likes a good autobiographical story. Her idea of a bad day was when she (literally) lost a heard of elephants in downtown Hollywood. I found myself smiling and laughing my way through this book. Buy, borrow, or check this book out of the library, it is a great read."},{"Title":"Life Is a Circus","review":"&quot;Life is a Circus&quot; was one of the most refreshing true stories that I have ever read!

Most of us only dream of running away to join the circus,Ms. O'Connor had the circus practically run away to join her! She shares with us her amusing trials and insights in living side by side with the circus community: the clowns,the side show artists,the aerialists and trapeze performers and,with myriad laughter,the animals. Ms. O'Connor's delightfully true story of herself as a young bride sharing her honeymoon with a leopard nervously roaming the back seat of the bride and groom's jalopy will leave you wondering what other outragous adventures lie ahead for these newlyweds;she doesn't let us down! With her circus experiences Ms. O'Connor gained some of the valuable lessons that brought her to a future as a pioneer in a then untried field of women in commercial public relations. One has to marvel at the approaches she must have used during that neoteric time. Every enjoyable page of &quot;Life is a circus&quot; is filled with a delicious freshness of 'feel good' experiences that will leave you wishing that you,too could run away with the circus,no matter what age you may be.

I do understand that it is a classic publication.

They wrote their book after being given a copy of Museler. In order to settle discussions about dressage riding by referring to Human Anatomy, they found fundamental problems with the Museler account. These problems include Museler's invention of \\"sacral muscles\\" which do not exist. They also shed light on Museler's term, \\"bracing the back,\\" which can lead to problems with the dressage seat. Their critique of Museler is sensitive and detailed, with much clearer diagrams. My copy of Museler has such tiny illustrations that they are hard to make out. On second thought, you may wish to purchase both the Museler book and the Schusdziarra book and make up your own mind.

The reason is understandable: the German U-Boat campaign offers readers an impressive array of engagements, personalities, and technological advances; its geographic scope was substantial, blanketing the Atlantic Ocean from its icy northern reaches to its balmy southern climes, and around Africa's horn into the Indian Ocean; and many of its commanders and crewmen have made themselves available for interviews, commentary, and have written about their experiences.Unfortunately, history's laser-like focus on German U-boats has made it more difficult for studies on other aspects of WWII submarine warfare (including the role American submarines in the Pacific played in defeating imperial Japan) to receive the publicity and readership they deserve. A particularly heavy shroud has covered Soviet submarine operations from 1939-1945, and the fact that this small navy helped Britain and the United States defeat Nazi Germany. Hopefully, Korzh's \\"Red Star under the Baltic\\" will buck this unfortunate and undeserved trend.By training a mechanical engineer, Korzh served as the chief engineer on three different Soviet boats on and under the Baltic Sea. His account graphically details life and death on what many have called \\"a German lake.\\" Indeed, the Baltic was an exceedingly treacherous place for enemy submarines. A quick glance a map of this region will show you why this was so. Navigationally, the long and narrow island-strewn Baltic was a complicated body of water to operate in, and its shallow depth made hiding from hunting warships doubly difficult (and in many cases, fatally impossible). When the Germans captured the Soviet bases in the central sea region early in the war, the Soviet Baltic Fleet retreated northeast to Kronstadt and Leningrad. The Kriegsmarine did its best to bottle these submarines up in the narrow reaches of the Gulf of Finland, and blanketed the narrow entrance with a nearly impenetrable anti-submarine defensive network of tens of thousands of mines, anti-submarine nets, shore-based artillery, surface warships, and air cover.\\"Red Star\\" was written in the early 1960s, when the events portrayed were still reasonably fresh in the author's mind, and originally published in Russian in 1966 under the title \\"Reserve of Strength.\\" Presented in the first person, Korzh's superb record details the abysmal life and death conditions Soviet sailors endured on their primitive but stoutly constructed boats.As readers will quickly discover, Korzh was one lucky sailor. His first patrol in early 1942 was aboard S-7, which returned safely only to be torpedoed by a Finnish submarine on its next patrol. The entire crew was lost except for those fortunate enough to have been on the bridge when disaster struck. Korzh, however, was not aboard because he had been transferred to another boat, S-12. His extensive second patrol sank two freighters and returned safely after suffering heavy depth charging and a very narrow escape. S-12 was lost with its entire crew the following year, but the lucky Korzh had again been posted to third boat, jumping again off the devil's shovel. His third patrol in March 1945 was aboard L-21, a large mine-laying submarine. The patrol was exceedingly successful and accounted for three warships and a tanker.\\"Red Star\\" will interest everyone who enjoys reading about WWII naval matters in general, and U-boats in particular. Authentic Russian accounts of naval service are very rare, and memoirs in a frontline submarine exceedingly so. Everyone familiar with Das Boot and life aboard German U-boats will appreciate and see obvious similarities between that account and Korzh's recollections: hardship, terror, comradeship, and death. German accounts of life aboard a U-boat in 1944 and 1945, when simply going to sea was the equivalent of a death sentence, are rare because so few crewmen from that period managed to survive. It was under similar conditions that Korzh and his comrades operated from 1942 onward in the dangerous waters of the Baltic. Viktor Korzh died in St Petersburg in 1993. \\"Red Star under the Baltic\\" is his legacy. Thankfully, it is now available in English. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Star Under the Baltic: A Soviet Submariner's Personal Account 1941-1945","review":"Although this book was first published in Russia some 40 years ago, this the first English translation. Written by a distinguished former Soviet submariner, it is a moving, vivid and first-hand account of life in the submarine service of the USSR during the bleak years of WW2. The author died in 1993.Greatly feared by the Germans, I found it fascinating to learn how they employed extensive counter-measures to ensure the entire Soviet Fleet was kept bottled up. In this way German U-Boats were then able to strike at allied and even neutral shipping with impunity. Then we learn how, in 1943, all that began to change as the Allies learned how to strike back at their, hitherto unseen, enemy.For those with an interest in the war at sea, it is very easy to become so preoccupied with U-Boats and the North Atlantic campaign that the struggles undergone by our Soviet Allies (as they were at that time) are completely overlooked. The involvement of Finnish Forces on the side of Germany (Finland eventually withdrew from the War in 1944) was an additional threat of which I previously knew very little.Altogether a fascinating, well written and worthwhile book which, for me at least, has opened up a whole new area of interest in the war at sea during 1939-1945.NM"},{"Title":"Red Star Under the Baltic: A Soviet Submariner's Personal Account 1941-1945","review":"When it comes to submarine warfare in World War II, the majority of the books out there deal with the American and German efforts. There are a few British and Japanese ones as well, but very few on the Russian side (I only know of one other besides this one). Thus, it was nice to find this book which details three separate patrols by a Russian submariner against the Germans. One of the best things about this book is the translation--it was originally written in Russian, but the translation was so good it was hard to tell the book wasn't originally written in English.The book gives a vivid description of life about a Russian submarine and its many hazards, not all of them caused by the enemy. Sailing in such an unforgiving area as the Baltic Sea presented many problems for Russian subs, and at times it seemed as if the author experienced them all. The book also provides a glimpse into life in Leningrad during the early parts of the Nazi siege as that's where the author was stationed. One of the more interesting aspects of the book is the role of the Communist Party political officers on the subs. They act as a second captain in some ways and at times I felt as if they're more in charge of the boat than the actual captain.The book could have used some maps to give the reader a better understanding of where the author went on his patrols, so bone up on your Russian and Finnish geography.

The author was a dedicated communist citizen who at least on the surface mirrored all the Soviet propaganda about the joys of Communist life. As an example he notices one day while on patrol that it is the second anniversary of Latvia joining the USSR and an occasion for celebration. In reality, after Joseph Stalin signed a secret treaty with Adolph Hitler, that allowed Germany to attack Poland without fear of any Soviet interference, the USSR then moved into Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia and forcibly incorporated them into the Soviet Union - not much occasion for celebration on the part of the Latvians at all.

Know that I have a long standing antipathy for Descartes for my own personal reasons. In the &quot;Treatise,&quot; Descartes attempts to explain the workings of the human body by drawing an explicit comparison between a hypothetical &quot;machine&quot; which operates, ostensibly, &quot;like we do&quot;. Descartes spends the best part of the &quot;Treatise&quot; outlining the ways that this machine's senses are informed by the singly material operations of the cardiovascular and nervous systems.Working on what basically amounts to as a heat-model, Descartes discusses how blood in the heart, and what he calls animal spirits in the brain cause the human machine to function just &quot;as we do&quot; - without the supposed necessity of the soul. He does not dispense with the idea of the soul, however - after all that would get him excommunicated faster than he could have said &quot;cogito ergo sum&quot; - he merely dances around the issue by saying that the major difference between the human machine and &quot;us&quot; is that we have a soul located in its seat, the brain. His purpose, again, is to show how a soul is not necessary to the bodily functions of man - that our bodies all operate the same, and according to rational physical principles.Descartes can be seen in the &quot;Treatise&quot; as a major contributor to late 17th and early 18th century notions of human passions. To this he contributes the omnipresent image of the filaments with which he says our nervous systems are comprised. Certainly we have all heard phrases like, &quot;tugging on your heartstrings&quot; - this popularly arises out of philosophies like Descartes, who proposes that our physical reactions - to pain, pleasure, etc. - are all the results of these filaments, or cords, within our bodies, which external stimuli act upon, sending messages to our brains. This affects not only reaction, but perception, and even the manifestations of our emotional responses to the external world.Sight and Touch are Descartes' major focuses in the realm of human sensory perception. Noteworthy in the &quot;Treatise&quot; are Descartes' many example illustrations, scattered generously throughout the text and abundantly provided in this Prometheus Press edition of the &quot;Treatise&quot;. From the mundane illustration showing how a person becomes aware of the pain of a fire, to the more unusual visual perception illustrations of a person in profile with one eyeball on top of the other, to the most interesting illustrations of the central &quot;Gland H&quot; in the brain, which becomes erect and points around in response to stimuli - Descartes' illustrations are, for me, the most fascinating part of the &quot;Treatise.&quot;One problem I have with Descartes' &quot;Treatise,&quot; is the absolutely arbitrary way he delineates human perception. In Descartes' machine-logic, our perceptions follow and focus on whatever most immediately presents itself to the mind. In this schema - one could be talking to a friend, and completely forget about the friend if a butterfly crosses our line of vision - the ability to focus on one thing for a sustained period of time is something Descartes does not discuss. It leaves the reader, or at least this one, wondering if sustained focus is the province of the soul, which he does not discuss in this work, or if not - how he managed to write so much with the perpetual threat of distraction."},{"Title":"The baptism with the Holy Spirit","review":"Many today wonder if R.A. Torrey were alive would he identify himself with the charismatic movement or would he avoid the termonology? I believe he would probably not be a charismatic and would probably even be an anti-charismatic from some of his views on the early Pentecostals. However, this book will make you wonder yourself.In this work, Torrey gives his biblical understanding of the second work of grace with the baptism with the Holy Ghost. Torrey believes that every Christian receives the Spirit at salvation (Romans 8:9) but not every Christian is baptized with the Holy Spirit (Luke 24:49). He believes the \\"Promise of the Father\\" (Acts 1:4) is for every Christian who will tarry and pray for the Baptism (Luke 11:13).Ironically, Torrey's book is now widely read by Pentecostals because of his second work teaching. Torrey's understanding came from his revivalist views along with D.L. Moody and other late 19th century revivalist. It set the stage for the early charismatic movement although Torrey distinced himself from the early Pentecostals as did A.B. Simpson.Overall I would highly recommend you reading this book even if you differ with Torrey's baptism language (filled vs. baptized) or his second work of grace view. The book does offer a challenge to us to be used mightily by God (Acts 1:8) and to trust in the power of the Holy Spirit and not the strength or wisdom of men (1 Cor. 2:1-5)."},{"Title":"The baptism with the Holy Spirit","review":"I'll start with my only complaint and that is on the Kindle version of this book.

A. TorreyJust as the company, Baskin-Robbins is known for its 31 flavors of ice cream, so are all the churches known for having their different flavors of doctrine. Baskin-Robbins is famous for the different 31 flavors of ice cream; its variety sets them apart from other companies, which are in the same business. Likewise, all churches set themselves apart from others by their variety of doctrine. However, no one needs to fear doctrine; doctrine is not the enemy of the church, though there are false doctrines outside the church, but doctrine can be true, correct, and proper.The doctrine of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, also known as the Baptism in or with the Holy Spirit, has had many interpretations as to what such doctrine is all about, its importance in the life of the Christian man or woman, and its purpose. In spite of the many interpretations this doctrine may have had, or still has, this doctrine is important because it is in the Bible and because Jesus spoke of it. One must surely understand this doctrine and how it relates to the Christian lifestyle because the \\"Bible speaks about the baptism in the Spirit as an aspect of the work of the Spirit in the lives of believers.\\"The greater issue with the baptism of/in/with the Holy Spirit is the physical evidence of manifestation of such great a promise that Jesus made to His followers. While one camp advocates for speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of such baptism, other camp advocates for powerful witnessing as the true evidence of the Holy Spirit's baptism. While these two camps continue to argue, the heathen around them continue their path to eternal damnation.Chapter 1In this chapter, Torrey numbered a few phrases connected with the baptism of the Holy Spirit.1. Designations connected with the same experiencea. \\"baptized with the Holy Ghost\\"b. \\"filled with the Holy Ghost\\"c. \\"promise of the Father\\"d. \\"promise of my Father\\"e. \\"endued with power\\"f. \\"Holy Spirit fell on them\\"g. \\"gift of the Holy Ghost\\"h. \\"received the Holy Ghost\\"I believe that it is safe to say that Torrey is correct in his analysis that all of these phrases designate the experience of the Holy Spirit's baptism.2. The Baptism of the Holy Spirit as portrait by Luke in the Book of Acts is an experience that a person can determine whether he/she has received it or not.a. When Jesus told His disciples to tarry or wait until the endowment of power from heave, they had to know when to continue or when to cease waiting for such promise, so something had to happen as an indication that they had received the power.b. Aside from speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of the baptism of the Holy Spirit, something external has to happen in order for a person to testify that he/she has received the Holy Spirit's baptism. The answer to the issue whether a person has received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is a simple \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\".3. It is safe to believe that the Baptism of the Holy Spirit that Luke addresses in the Book of Acts is a separate work from salvation. I believe that the Spirit's baptism that Paul speaks of in his epistles is the baptism of a person into the Body of Christ, His Church, and not the empowerment that comes from the baptism that Luke describes. Note: Let me be clear that I do not believe that a person that has not being baptized with the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is less a Christian who has received the empowerment to serve. The reason for this statement is simple; many Pentecostal brothers tend to imply that they are somehow superior because they speak in tongues and these tongues serve, according to their view, as the IPE (Initial Physical Evidence) of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.4. The Baptism with the Holy Spirit is not for showing off or to give the impression how holy the recipient is, but the Baptism with the Holy Spirit is \\"connected with testimony and service.\\" It does not make a person sinless but empowers the recipient to live a holy life by the power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus said (Acts 1:8, NIV), \\"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.\\" The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is the power to witness for Jesus to unbelievers. In addition, the moral life of the recipient should be greater in comparison with those who have not received the Spirit's Baptism.5. I agree with Torrey that the Baptism with the Holy Spirit imparts the power for service, especially service to the Church of Jesus Christ. That service manifests itself through the gifts of the Spirit Paul mentions in Romans and 1st Corinthians, and which Peter mentions in his epistles.No matter how one receives the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, one thing is certain: God will manifest His supernatural power in and through the recipient. For my fellow Charismatic Christians, quit making the Baptism of the Holy Spirit a spectacle and serve the Lord Jesus with a life full of the power of God.Chapter 2The Necessity and Possibility of the Baptism with the Holy SpiritThough Jesus Christ taught His disciples very well, yet there were missing the empowerment of the Holy Spirit in order to do the work Jesus left the to accomplish. If it was true then, it is true now: we cannot do the job God left us to do unless we receive the power of God, the Holy Spirit. If God, the Father, anointed His Son with the Holy Spirit to accomplish His redemptive work, we can rest assured that we will do better and greater things for God because of His power. Do not leave home without Him.A person can accomplish so much on his/her own abilities. However, a person that is skillful and has the power of the Holy Spirit of Christ in his/her life will do greater things, influence more people, and will impact the world at a greater scale. Paul is a good example. Before the revelation of Jesus Christ, he knew the Law like no one else did. However, he lacked the revelation from the Scriptures; he lacked the revelation of the One to whom the Scriptures pointed. Once he surrendered to the Lord, we see clearly that all that he accomplished was done through and in the power of the Holy Spirit and not because of his knowledge of talents alone. More than ever before, we need that power in our teaching, preaching, and our outreaching.Even Jesus stated His ministry \\"in the power of the Spirit\\". The Holy Spirit anointed Jesus in order \\"to proclaim good news to the poor, to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, and to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.\\" He did all of these things because of the power of the Holy Spirit in Him.Torrey states correctly the following statement on page 24: \\"The Baptism with the Holy Spirit is an absolutely necessary preparation for effective service for Christ along every line of service.\\" All Christians can do service for Christ along every line of service. However, only those who Jesus baptizes with His Holy Spirit will effectively serve Christ enough for others to notice.Torrey emphasizes something that I have always believed since I became a born-again individual. He states that the \\"promise then of this verse (Acts 2:39) is the promise of the gift or Baptism with the Holy Ghost.\\" The gift of the Holy Spirit to the Church of Jesus Christ is not the gift of speaking in tongues but the Holy Spirit Himself. It is not something a Christian receives; it is someone who comes in to dwell in the recipient. Then, the believer is empowered because the Holy Spirit is the power of God to serve not to make it a show of power.The Baptism with the Holy Spirit is not for the elite or for \\"members only\\" club in some charismatic circles. This empowerment is for everyone who is willing to receive it. \\"The result of the Baptism with the Holy Spirit that was most noticeable and essential was convincing, convicting, and converting power.\\" When I compare this statement against the Book of Acts, it becomes clear that it is true. However, when I compare speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of this baptism with the \\"convincing, convicting, and converting power\\" that comes with such baptism, I see speaking in tongues lacking all these three essential elements. Please, do not misunderstand me; I believe speaking in tongues comes from God but I totally disagree that speaking in tongues is the initial physical evidence of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit because of the place and importance the Apostle Paul gives to the gift of speaking in tongues in 1st Corinthians. I see that those who adhere to speaking in tongues as the IPE of the Holy Spirit's Baptism, they lack the power to witness to Christ. If speaking in tongues could be exchanged for souls, we could have experienced the greatest harvest today more than ever before. In many Pentecostal or Charismatic churches, speaking in tongues is a show of the flesh. As long as someone speaks in tongues, in many churches it becomes a sign that God has not departed from that church no matter whether they are winning souls or not. The gift of speaking in tongues becomes the center of the church service. Though I am making a general statement, some people can testify of this reality. The center of any Christian Church must be Christ. The power source must be the Holy Spirit and the One we must worship is God, the giver of life, power, and gifts. When Christians exalt the gifts of the Holy Spirit over the Giver it becomes idolatry.Chapter 3How the Baptism with the Holy Spirit can be obtainedThe issue that usually accompanies the theme of the Baptism with/in/of the Holy Spirit is how an individual can receive it. Some Christians, in their sincere desire for others to receive such baptism, lay hands on people and ask them just to receive it, sometimes they tell them to just open their mouths and let the Spirit flow, or just to start praising the Lord and thanking Him, in faith, for such gift.I have been a \\"victim\\" of such experiences to the point that I wanted to speak in Spanish so people believe that \\"I got it\\", if you know what I mean. Because many Christians believe a person must speak in tongues as the IPE (Initial Physical Evidence) of the Spirit's Baptism, then the whole practice of asking people to come forward and be baptized becomes a spectacle, a fiasco, if you will. People, instead of living strengthened and encouraged, lived confused and disappointed because they did not get it. Do you get what I mean? In essence, the baptism becomes the center of the seeker instead of the giver of the Spirit's Baptism.In this chapter, the author states that there are seven steps to receive the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. The issue I have with the \\"follow-these-steps\\" mentality is that God is not our servant while we are the masters. We can give our tithes and offerings until the cows come home or until we turn blue, however, God also looks at the attitudes or reasons of our giving and they can be an obstacle for God's blessing. My blood pressure goes up when I see the 7 steps for victorious living, the 7 principles of the Kingdom, the 40 days for a deeper walk and/or the three-step on how to know God's will. What we try to do is to place God in a situation where we somehow make God work for us instead of the other way around.I am not going to list the seven steps the author mentions. However, we must know and understand that though God does not withhold any good thing from His children, the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is an act of grace. Even though the Apostle Peter told his audience they must repent in order to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, not all the instances of the Spirit's Baptism occurrences, in the Book of Acts, involved repentance. The first time the Holy Spirit came down from heaven in the upper room, they were just waiting as Jesus told them. Those who only knew John the Baptist's baptism received the Holy Spirit when Paul prayed for them.It is a bad habit to seek ways to figure God out or to try to figure a way to get something from God by ways of doing \\"X\\" in order to get \\"Z\\". The principle of sowing and reaping applies to all people. However, we must think of God's grace when He blesses us because He wants to and God's mercy when He interferes in our lives when our sowing is going to cause a harvest of negative consequences. Let us move on to the next chapter.Chapter 4\\"Fresh Baptisms with the Holy Spirit\\" or \\"The Refilling with the Holy Spirit\\"Just as I believe salvation is both an event and a process, I also believe that the reception of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is a continual baptism or refilling; it is not a one-time deal. Just as we do not fill our cars with gas once, the Spirit's Baptism is not a one-time filling. When we fill our cars up with gas, we can go as far as the rate of consumption takes us. With the Holy Spirit's Baptism, there is no difference for we must continue to allow the Spirit of Christ to fill us up in order to continue to live the abundant life, the empowered life of Christ.Chapter 2 and chapter 4 give us an insight or an illustration that a one-time Spirit's Baptism is not enough to be a witness to Christ in Jerusalem, in Judea, in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the world.Chapter 5How Spiritual Power is LostI agree with Torrey when he states the following reasons why men and women of God lose the power of the Holy Spirit.1. First, God Withdraws His Power from Men when they go back upon their Separation to Him - God does not bless or condone unfaithfulness, spiritual laziness, and/or rebellion. When Christians turn their back to God, they become God's enemies. As they turn to the world, they become filthy temples in which the Holy Spirit will definitely not dwell. Today, many churches and their pastors are running on empty. It is my opinion that many mega churches are guilty of running on fumes since, once a pastor has a lot of people and a lot of money flowing unrestrained, they do not need the power of the Holy Spirit, much less the Holy Spirit Himself. Many churches today are working without the power of the Holy Spirit; the presence and power of the Lord has long departed. God moved on and they are still eating from a 40-year straw and drinking from broken cisterns.2. Power is lost through the Incoming of Sin - Though we categorize sin, as the sin of omission and commission, there is really one sin: disobedience. It is disobedience to God when we do not do the right thing and when we do the wrong thing. Sin separates humans from God. This is true, whether people sin before or after coming to the knowledge of Jesus as Lord and Savior. Sin makes separation between God and humanity and the only way to come back to God is through repentance, being a heathen or a lukewarm individual. Sin and God do not cohabitate, so why do we think we can have both? Why do we tend to think we can have the power of God in our lives while living (dying) in sin?3. Power is lost again through Self-indulgence - I am not sure whether Satan or \\"self\\" is public enemy number one. Satan is a defeated foe, however, we must guard from the strong-pull force of living for \\"self\\". I believe, as Christians, we confused \\"self denial' with the \\"denial of self.\\" When we use the phrase \\"self denial\\" it is usually in the context of denying ourselves things to have or sacrificing ourselves when on a diet or when making a vow or promise that might cost us an arm and a leg. However, when I look into the life of Christ and when I see the Bible in its totality, I see Christ, the prophets, the apostles, and people of God totally living out the life God intended them to live. I see that they finally accepted God as their Lord, Savior, and King, and therefore they see their lives as belonging to God, not to them. This is a hard concept to grasp and accept in Western Christianity where Christians, as well as the heathen, demand their rights. We tend to forget, consciously or not, that we are not our own; Christ bought us with a great price, His blood and His life.4. Power is lost through greed for money - This is a big issue here in Western Christianity. With the prosperity gospel from hell, preachers entice their hearers to give money in order to receive God's blessings. Sadly, because many Christian do not read the Bible, they are not aware that God's blessings are already theirs in Christ. In the prosperity gospel, God becomes the genie (our slave) and we become God's master. Greed is like hell; it is never satisfied. Greed wants more and more even when there is no more.John the Baptist, Jesus, and the Apostle Paul have something revolutionary for Western Christianity that is worth repeated and heed. In Luke 3:14, John the Baptist told some soldiers, \\"Don't take money from anyone by force or accuse anyone falsely. Be content with your pay.\\" Jesus said (Luke 12:15), \\"Be careful to guard yourselves from every kind of greed. Life is not about having a lot of material possessions.\\" In 1st Timothy 6:6-8, Paul said, \\"A godly life brings huge profits to people who are content with what they have. We did not bring anything into the world, and we cannot take anything out of it. As long as we have food and clothes, we should be satisfied.\\" This is a foreign concept here in the United States. Christians and non-Christians are in competition with each other trying to outdo each other by accumulating more and more. The result is that both groups of people end up dissatisfied with what they have and feeling empty. Sadly, Christians have lost the power they once had in the process of wanting more material things instead of wanting more of God in their lives.5. Power is lost through pride - Pride is one of those public enemies of the people of God. Once God starts to do great things in His people and through His people, then His people start to think they deserve better treatment than other fellow Christians. As the author points out, \\"The more he uses us the lower let us get.\\" John the Baptist said of Jesus, \\"He must become greater and greater, and I must become less and less.\\"6. Power is lost through neglect of prayer - In the Western Church; there is no ministry as neglected as the ministry of prayer. We know the positions of prayer and the purpose of prayer, but we do not purpose in ourselves to prayer. If someone mentions a prayer meeting, many Christians run out of the church as though someone cried out, \\"Fire!\\" A preacher once said that a prayer-less Christian is a powerless Christian, and a powerless Christian is a pathetic Christian. Do I need to say more?7. Power is lost through neglect of the Word - This is the second ministry in the Western Church that is affected by the apathy towards reading and studying the Holy Scriptures. I believe that more than 50 percent of the Christians here in the USA do not read the Bible regularly. The percent is even higher for the numbers of Christian who do not study the written Word of God.ConclusionThe churches in the USA are full. There are full of apathy toward prayer, the reading, studying, and meditation of the Word, and toward the lost. The church has lost its positive and powerful influence in the community in which God placed her. More than ever, we need the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives so our light might shine brighter or shine at all. Preaching without power is as useful as a screen door in a submarine. As Christians, we need to be people of the Word, people of prayer, and people of the Spirit. Anything less, and we are deceiving people and doing them a disservice by not showing forth the mighty power of God which is supposed to flow in us and through us. We need the Baptism of the Holy Spirit more than ever before. The book was well written and simple enough to understand."},{"Title":"The baptism with the Holy Spirit","review":"I thought this book was an excellent book. It cleared up some questions I had.

I have always found Australian feminism to be more eclectic, perhaps pragmatic, certainly less one-side posturing than some others.

There were fundamental policy changes. Now rapidly being undone by a radically conservative govt.

I found that this book offers a lot of useful information, but of which is effectively hidden from the American public. But the book would have been much more effective had it not be so editorialized and had it allowed the reader to \\"decide for themselves\\" what they think about the oil industry.I can somewhat forgive the author for the conclusion that the hydrogen fuel cells offer a lot of potential, given that the book was written in 2004. However, given the sizable barriers that the author cites and the fact that plug-in electric cars were not mentioned at all, I wanted to see some real data to support this case. Such data was nonexistent.All told, I don't think this is the best primer on the industry regardless of your political stance. I found \\"The Rough Guide to the Energy Crisis\\" much more fact-driven, though broader in scope. There are a number of other books on the topic and I encourage you to look elsewhere before reading this book."},{"Title":"Oil: A Concise Guide to the Most Important Product on Earth","review":"I'm specifically writing my first Amazon book review because I just finished this book and it annoyed me so much. I think the topic is incredibly relevant and interesting, but Yeoman basically seems to regurgitate many other books and articles. He says himself that the history chapter is largely pulled from \\"The Prize\\" (Daniel Yergin). I know that Yergin's book is not quite light reading, but it does much more justice to the complex social and political history of oil. John Ghadvizian's (sp?) recent book \\"Untapped\\" is also much better, especially to understand more about Africa.Then, moving from rehashing, Yeoman goes into editorializing for the second half of the book, in a way that seems just as thoughtless, only more cliched. The book is clearly anti-W, and I definitely don't disagree with the effect that administration has had on our global reputation and energy policy (domestic and international), but he beats us over the head with his opinion instead of presenting the data for itself. Last, he preaches hydrogen as a saving promise. I believe that we'll need a diverse set of options to wean our current dependence on oil for transportation, and fuel cells may have a place in that, but he seems to just fall into the hype. [...]Last, for some reason it just annoys me that he re-titled the book a couple years after the first print (it was originally called \\"Oil: Anatomy of an Industry\\"). Yes, this may now be called the \\"concise guide\\", but it does a disservice to anyone who really wants to understand this critical element of our society better."},{"Title":"Oil: A Concise Guide to the Most Important Product on Earth","review":"If you hated the George W. Bush administration and believe that CO2 emissions are rapidly accelerating us towards an apocalyptic fate, then you'll probably like this book. Yeomans takes opportunity to malign the former president and various members of his administration. There is not a single footnote in the entire book, and the chapter on \\"Exploration or Exploitation?\\" is terribly one-sided. The sourcing notes at the end of the book list the Village Voice, the Center for Social and Economic Rights, Rainforest Action Network, and Global Witness as the primary sources of information for describing Texaco's involvement in Ecuador. No lack of objectivity there. While the scientific community does generally accept CO2-based global warming scenarios, the extent of CO2's effect is still subject to debate (water vapor accounts for most of the \\"greenhouse effect\\"). The fact is, the environmental organizations Yeomans is so friendly with have just as much of an agenda as the automotive and petroleum industries do. Without an environmental crisis, they become irrelevant. I give it 2 stars (instead of 1) only because it was relatively well-written and probably could find use as \\"informative literature\\" for dissemination by the environmental rights movement."},{"Title":"Oil: A Concise Guide to the Most Important Product on Earth","review":"The preface to \\"Oil\\" describes the author's thought experiment of what it would be like to go a day without petroleum products. Naturally there would no fuel or lubricants, for cars or any other type of machinery -- but there would also be no plastics (oops, there goes the computer and telephone). There would be no reading glasses or contact lenses. Most of the medicines in his cabinet would be gone. No shampoo, shaving cream or deodorant, and no curtain around his shower. No toothpaste ... or toothbrush. No non-stick cookware, oven-proof glassware or plastic dishes. No waterproof clothing or shoes (unless they have leather soles).There would be no heat in the winter. No harvesting of crops without machinery, fertilizers or pesticides. Credit and debit cards, being plastic of course, are gone. CDs and DVDs disappear, as well anything to play them on, because there are no electronic circuit boards.Very quickly you realize why Yeomans calls oil \\"the most important product on earth\\" -- it has not only fueled the Industrial Revolution, it *IS* the Industrial Revolution. Without oil, the world very quickly plunges into a wood, iron and stone economy not seen since the Middle Ages.In Chapter 1 Yeomans gives \\"a short history of oil,\\" from its discovery as a fuel to the mechanization of its extraction and refinement. How World War I was made more lethal (over 16 million dead!) through tanks and troop carriers. How the Allied powers divided up the oil-producing regions after the war in order to protect their own newfound dependence on the stuff.One of Yeomans' great talents is revealing the hidden oil-related motives in history. Pearl Harbor was Japan's bid to control Indochinese oil fields. Hitler's expansion was to ensure energy resources. Who has oil, and who controls its production, has truly shaped the 20th Century.Chapter 2 describes the automobile culture that arose out of cheap gas, with interstate highways, a mobile workforce, and sprawling suburbs. Detroit and the oil giants encouraged excess, and American consumers love their inefficient chrome land yachts.Chapter 3 describes the machinations that have caused (and are still causing) regime change and political turmoil as oil companies set foreign policy and install businessmen to run the lucrative franchises known as \\"other nations.\\"The 4th chapter introduces the concept of \\"peak oil\\" and discusses the economics of the end of high-grade light crude in easily-drilled areas.Chapter 5, entitled \\"Energy Wars,\\" describes the inevitable results of the major developed and developing nations competing for the rapidly dwindling reserves.The last three chapters are less timeless, written in 2003-4 and describing the now-familiar Bush Administration policies and mistakes. But they're still extremely clear-headed, factual, concise and irrefutable, and together with the rest of the book paint a very solemn portrait of the legacy we're leaving our children.A legacy of unsustainable growth built on an artificially-discounted, temporarily-available, non-renewable resource. When it's gone how much of our civilization will survive -- and at what cost?"},{"Title":"Oil: A Concise Guide to the Most Important Product on Earth","review":"Over the course of my life I've had limited exposure to knowledge about oil - I see gas prices daily, I occasionally pay attention to news stories that feature oil prominently, and I read the protest banners that exclaim \\"no blood for oil\\" (which I always found to be a rather silly slogan). End all be all, I didn't know Jack about oil until I read this book.The book starts with a history of oil discovery (Chapter 1). Usually such histories are incredibly boring in my opinion, but Yeomans does a great job keeping the reader interested (partially by moving pretty quickly, rather than dwelling on arcane and ultimately irrelevant historical analysis). Chapters 2-7 deal with different policy topics that are predominantly oil oriented: cars in America, human rights and environmental issues in oil exploration, oil prices and scarcity, oil wars, President Bush's association with the oil industry, and CAFE (a piece of emissions standards legislation). The book then ends (Chapter 8) with a brief discussion of hydrogen as an emerging alternative and an afterward on the rising importance of China. From what I know of oil discussions in general, these chapters introduce most of the important elements of the general discussion of oil; reading this book made me feel prepared to discuss oil issues to a moderate degree of depth.For readers who are already familiar with these discussions about oil, I don't know that reading this book will tell you much more than you already know. Yeomans clearly has a liberal bias on the issue, but he is not quite a doomsayer. For those who do not know much about the politics and cultural aspects of oil, I highly reccomend this book as a short read that will get you up to speed so whenever the topic comes up in conversation or news you can have an informed opinion."},{"Title":"The Song of Hiawatha","review":"A book for generations.

Sansom (1883-1965), perhaps the last great comprehensive historian of Japan writing in English, his The Western World of Japan: A Study in the Interaction of European and Asiatic Cultures is one of my all-time favorites. Part of the reason is surely because I can think of no other work quite like it on the subject. I cannot describe it any more eloquently or accurately than the flyleaf blurb of my 1965 Fifth Printing edition:.....This masterwork is not only an account of the cultural influence of the West upon Japan; it is also a study of the way in which cultures interact. It reveals the process by which the intrusive civilizations of the West, since even before the Christian era, have affected the Asiatic peoples in general and the Japanese in particular, first only slightly and spasmodically, and then with increasing power......The first part of the book traces the early cultural relations between Europe and Asia. Against this historical background the second part shows how Japan reacted to Western influence from the days of her first contact with Europeans down to the time of her entry into international life in the nineteenth century......Historians will recognize instantly in this method the challenge both to Japan's own mystical and myth-ridden historiography, and to the West's narrow and self-centered preconceptions, which have prevented its historians from seeing that the institutions finally adopted were, if Western in shape, thoroughly Japanese in color and substance......And philosophers will recognize instantly the challenge thrown at Toynbee and Spengler when the author offers evidence of the way in which a society can decay and renew itself without changing its essence. He questions whether any of the chief civilizations of Asia will, even if they voluntarily follow a Western economic pattern, submit to Western precept in political, social, or religious life.*** This is a great book by a great scholar and you will enjoy it.

Their uncaring verdict on the loss of lives from the earthquake in Lisbon coupled with their arrogance and lack of tact in the time of suffering was fuel for Voltaire's fire.The book is fairly short and can be read in one sitting; it is laugh out loud funny in some places as the most absurd things happen to the major characters. I read it mostly because I like satire and not to get any particular message out of it. The story is pretty straightforward and I guess it does raise a few questions in the readers mind about what our purpose in this life is, how to find happiness, contentment etc... but it can also be read for the pleasure of \`listening' to one of the wittiest men that has ever lived (or so they tell me).I have not done justice to this book, and you can read longer reviews about it on this site, but I would advice you to read it yourself and then make up your mind. Get the Penguin edition.Again, read this book! It's short, it's funny and it's by Voltaire, what other encouragement do you need?"},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Ouch! That hurts!(reacting to the sorry metaphor of my subject line)I found Voltaire's famous satire surprisingly tepid. Perhaps I've become jaded in my old age, or perhaps I should have read this in the 18th century when it caused such a sensation because of the scandalous way that Voltaire satirized the church, the clergy, and just about everybody else in any position of power or influence. Reading it now, it seems a bit tame. All the horrors and stupidities Voltaire describes seem almost commonplace considering what we have experienced since he made his attack on optimism in 1759. Today we can look back at two world wars, at the Holocaust and Hiroshima, at the war in Vietnam, at terrorism and the latest stupidity in Iraq. Nothing in Candide can compare to these real historical events that have so sorely tested human optimism. We can even look back to the French Revolution and the revolutions that followed in the 19th century, which in a sense Voltaire predicted with his devastating critique of the corrupt and degenerate European society. Or we can recall the Catholic priests and Ted Haggard from yesterday's headlines. Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.It is difficult to appreciate how deliciously scandalous this was in Voltaire's time since today we are free to criticize the church and our governments, whereas in Voltaire's time such criticisms could land you in the Bastille. Voltaire's legendary reputation for rapier wit and shocking turn of phrase can be found in these pages, but much of it seems diluted because his style has so often been imitated. We have read and reread his imitators, and we have even read some who have improved upon him in some ways, people in America like Mark Twain, Ambrose Bierce and H. L. Mencken. We tend to forget where they got their inspiration at least in part. An example from The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (episodic in structure much like Candide, by the way) is in the rascals that Huck and Jim meet on the river, the Duke of \\"Bilgewater\\" and the \\"King of France,\\" who, like the six \\"kings\\" that Candide sups with in Venice, are out and our frauds and represent the impossible, deluded aspirations of the average person.This is the work in which we have Dr. Pangloss and his \\"best of all possible worlds.\\" And this is the work which ends with Candide summing up all the philosophy he has learned in his travels with the words, \\"'Tis well said, but we must cultivate our gardens.\\""},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"The style of exposition used in this book is reminiscent of The Misfortunes of Virtue by the Marquis de Sade. Voltaire presents a catalog of calamities meant to debunk the belief that our world is perfect, and that everything happens \\"for the best\\" according to some divine plan. While there is no doubt that Candide is persuasive in its comical misadventures, the style gets old just as it did in The Misfortunes of Virtue. The story becomes a trite joke that loses its potency with each subsequent catastrophe, so that half way through the novel the reader no longer cares what befalls Candide and begins to pray that some benevolent deity will put him out of his (and our) misery. If I were not so thoroughly desensitized to tragedy, and had I not already come to the philosophical conclusions that Voltaire is trying to lead his reader, then I might have found the novel to be more profound. Still the novel is well written, reads quickly if you ignore the endnotes*, and is fairly entertaining.* Every time I was compelled to read an endnote just to find out that Voltaire was referencing some long dead frenchman I wanted to fling the book across the room."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"This book is at once both hilarious and horrifying. To have a book possess both these features and still be well done is a noteworthy feat. Well, I guess that Voltaire has accomplished a noteworthy feat. The tale is about a young man named Candide who was brought up under the tutelage of a chap named Pangloss. Pangloss is a caricature of the philosopher Leibniz, who believed that ours' is &quot;the best of all possible worlds&quot; because it was molded and shaped by an omnipotent creator. The name itself is also a pun: Pan (which is Greek for &quot;all&quot;) gloss (which is French for talk): Pangloss = All-talk. At any rate, Voltaire finds out (and continues to find out) that this Pollyanna view of life can be rather troublesome to the senses. He experiences the horrors of war, separation from his beloved, shipwreck, unfortunate misunderstandings, robbery and a plethora of other misfortunes. He also makes it to the mythical utopia of Eldorado, only to find that it's not all it's cracked up to be, either. This is a first rate classic that deals with the meaning of life, the $60,000 question &quot;Is anyone out there really happy?&quot; as well as many delightful lesser questions. Read this book, then tend to your own garden."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"I highly recommend this book.Fantastic and very interesting, indeed.Although there are some hardly possible things to be believed(for example:Pangloss escaped public punishments more than twice unknown),but it clearly described Voltaire's idea that everything is for the best.I have read this book more than three times, and I am sure that once you read the first three pages of this satirical book you won't be able to stop perusing it.If you know the conditions in Europe(especially in France)at that time, you would understand completely everything said in the story.Voltaire has arranged this book so cleverly that that the reader won't be bored,even an 11 year old Indonesian girl like me.The story is lavishly adorned with knowledge, history,politics,and sometimes,funny and foolish things.I vouchsave, once you opened this book, your eyes would be fixed there for hours.Go and buy it!"},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"For those who saw \\"Borat\\" and thought Sacha Baron Cohen was a great satirist, \\"Candide\\" will put everything into perspective. In less than one hundred pages, Voltaire manages to skewer religion, politics, bigotry, love, hatred, optimism, cosmopolitanism, agrarian idealization, and everything else he could get his eighteenth-century hands on. The book is not perfect (I could have done without that slight anti-Semitic barb at the very end), but is scathingly brilliant and often laught-out-loud hilarious. A must-read for anyone who wishes to be worthy of the term \\"cynic\\"."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"To call this book a satire and suggest that it is funny, or well done, or relevant to recent times, may be true but that fails to point out what is obvious. Voltaire was a French Enlightment writer. He used wit to make his points. He made fun of the teachings of the Church but he was pushing for religious freedom. He had strong opinions and the book was a tool to presenting his thoughts. The book is considered to be one of the most significant works of Western Canon due to its portrayal of the human condition.The story is intended to satirize the idea of optimism. The approach was developed in the events of a trip. The events of the trip allow him to interchange the tragedy and the comedy within the various situations that occurred. This is a unique approach but it allowed him to develop a look at good and evil as well as the role of God and Government in men's lives. The satirical approach allowed him cover to focus his criticism.A simple story. Young man leaves his home but really he has to leave having been caught kissing the wrong person. Sill optimistic he joins the army. He is flogged. Later almost burned alive. He sets out to see the world but continues to believe, as he was taught early in his life, that he is indeed living in the \\"best of all possible worlds\\". It seems as though nothing goes well. One tragedy after another. Funny but sad. Then after what seems to be an endless ordeal he returns and settles for life in a garden. Even so, still optimistic perhaps, he says that \\"we must cultivate our garden\\".His book and his story challenge the idea that \\"all is for the best\\" in a world where it is often assumed that things \\"work out for the best\\"."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Everytime Somerset Maugham set out to write a novel etc. he reread Voltaire's Candide.

I couldn't believe how readable and relevant this book was more than two hundred years after it was written. Apparently, it's aged very well."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Voltaire's Candide. Voltaire's use of satire and irony creates timeless humor that can be appreciated by many readers. Candide, Voltaire's protagonist, is not necessarily a character with whom readers would relate. Like most of the characters in the novel, Candide is a caricature, an exaggeration of optimism, ignorance, and nave views. Voltaire proves through his novel that sometimes the best way to make a lasting effect on one's audience is to show something in its most blatant form. Voltaire's sarcasm and ridicule of a particular party or stereotype can seem a bit harsh at times. However, I think that Voltaire felt the combination of humor and tough criticism was the best way to bring to light his own disgust with hypocrisy within the church and government. The situations and conflicts that Voltaire places his characters in produce surprising illustrations of issues of the 1700's, such as war, poverty, and prostitution. Although this novel was written nearly 250 years ago, striking parallels can be drawn between the issues that Voltaire comments on and the issues that authors of our time choose to focus on in their literature."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Being a fan of such authors as Charles Bukowski and Hunter S. Thompson, I admittedly found myself disheartened upon learning that Voltaire's \\"Candide\\" was on my summer reading list. I, as well as many, many other young readers, often find myself trudging through dreary and boring works of \\"literature\\", all of which are hailed by critics and scholars and \\"experts\\" (thus the reasoning for us to read them). It is because of such books that most kids these days hate to read and don't give books that could actually interest them a chance. But in reading \\"Candide\\", I found in Voltaire a thing almost identical to what I found in Orwell and his classic allegory, \\"Animal Farm\\" - it's not necessarily a staggering work of unimaginable genius, but what it is a work of great insight, fantastic adventure, wonderous charm, and upon finishing it, one will hardly feel their time was wasted.Candide is both the title of this book and the name of its main character. In the beginning of his life, Candide is born to the sister of the great Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh (you'll often see foreign and confusing names such as this). In no time, he and the daughter of the Baroness, Cunegonde, fall deeply in love, and the Baron discovers this secret and immediately kicks Candide out of the castle, which is seated in the province of Westpahlia in Germany. During the breadth of his travels, Candide is always in want of his love Cunegonde.From thence forth, Candide is thrust into an adventure surrounded in the blood and bones of the many and the love and friendship of the few. From Portugal to Paris to the fabled city of El Dorado, Candide follows a magnificent road. Plans of passage to find Cunegonde are often devised during his journey, although he is equally as often sidetracked and then swindled out of the unparalleled riches he has amassed by the greedy and unkind citizens of the countries he enters.Along for the journey are a handful of Candide's wise friends, most of which he meets for the very first time, including a valet (somewhat similar to a servant) named Cucumbo, a miserable philsopher named Martin, and an old woman who is the daughter of the Pope and is now a poor and lonely soul. Another one of these friends is a man Candide had once admired - the Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh's former philospher, Pangloss. From Pangloss, Candide takes the expression \\"all is for the best.\\" By the end of the book, it could be said that this outlook on life and Candide's generally \\"rose-tinted\\" view of life are altered.In the end, what we have, as readers, is a magnificent \\"coming-of-age\\" tale, in which the innocent, doe-eyed Candide witnesses, firsthand, the horrors not only of war but of life itself, and if not for the love in his heart, he would surely have chosen to end his misery sooner.And to all those who are reading this book because their school requires it: Do not be afraid of the perfect English and 18th century setting, because what you're about to read is a wonderful roadtrip of a tale about a starry-eyed romantic out to conquer whatever lies before him so that he may one day see again the lover with which he is so infatuated.When you think about the book \\"Candide\\", don't think Shakespeare, think Hunter S. Thompson. Don't think \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", think \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\". Then you will begin to understand the unwholesome fun of which you are soon to discover."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Candide is a very brief, yet wholly amusing satiric thrust at the Christian philosophy of perpetual optimism. Obviously Voltaire couldn't write anything without making a pointed statement of some sort, and in its entirety Candide is no different from his other works. It's a story, of course, but only secondarily; the writer left not a single word devoid of relevance to his point. In fact he tells his tale with very little attention to detail, only concerned with encompassing his main character's lengthy odyssey as quickly as possible. With such an approach, his sole aim was to simply get the message across. In Candide, Voltaire strives to refute the belief that we live in the best of all possible worlds. By documenting his young protagonist's horrendous sufferings and hardships, the philosopher more than implies that misfortune is certainly not part of any divine plan for us. And whether you agree with that or not, I'd still say this book manifests a great deal of provocative insight, not to mention a whole lot of dark, dark humor. I wouldn't call Candide a consistent knock-out -- most of its pages aren't quite laugh-out-loud funny -- but the whole of the story very well tickles the reader with its caustic narrative. So if you're just itching for a short read (most folks could complete this one in a single sitting, I'm sure), look no further. While it may be of very petite proportions, Candide is unarguably a literary classic, as entertaining and surprising and clever as one would hope."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"In Candide, Voltaire opens the door to self-discovery and the search for a true God by closing the door on what we perceive to be reality. With an unmatched wit he sets up an increasingly impossible series of events that force us to see with unlidded eye the ludicrousness of our attempts to reject that which is present and real, for that which is outside of us and fantastical. If his intention was to show the pain that is evident in all of our lives, he has succeeded. If it was to show to what considerable distance we as a people will go to avoid pain, he has again succeeded. The character I most identify with in Candide is the central character in the story, Candide. We can see the effects that his experiences with other people and their philosophies have had on his life. Candide, from the French candida, means \\"white.\\" This may suggest that he begins life as \\"a blank page,\\" a yet undefined form.At one time, we are all born a \\"blank page\\"; our existence is marked with no blemish, no experience that has defined who we are. Our minds are in essence candida. Yet, looking back into my past and opening up the pages of my existence, I can ever more clearly that I am not a self-made man. Personal experiences, past and present contacts with individuals, institutions and society have combined their respective influences and written that combination which is me, on my blank page. It is no longer white, but stained with the indelible ink of experience.As Candide's story progresses, we can see clearly how his pages are being written, step by step. Few of those pages in Candide's life are filled with what we might consider to be positive events. He begins as a young impressionable boy listening to the philosophy of those around him. Unfortunately, he has the estimable Dr. Pangloss, whose name literally means \\"all tongue,\\" as the tutor and former of his mind. He says that all things happen for a reason; therefore, it must be the best reason. In essence, Pangloss teaches Candide that the reason for his and others' suffering is for the greater societal good.How many of those persons who have influenced the person that I am today have been \\"all tongue\\"? Throughout my life, I have heard from every shade tree philosopher, \\"There is a reason for everything.\\" I would be inclined to agree with them if, by that statement, they mean that every cause has an effect. That is however, not the case. Like Pangloss, they are ascribing the \\"cause\\" to an entity, a God, or force outside of themselves as individuals and society. This excuses us from many things. One of those things that it excuses us from is responsibility. If things cannot be other than they are then my part, my action, was preordained and consequently I am not responsible for the effects of those actions. Voltaire saw that these people who spoke so often of a God, who was alive and called each of us to \\"personal responsibility,\\" were at the same time ascribing the \\"cause and effect\\" of their actions to Him. Candide was the vehicle that Voltaire used to show the mutual exclusivity of the belief in Free Will and Absolute Necessity.I can really identify with the questions that Candide asks in the midst of his suffering. After a series of painful experiences that Dr. \\"Paingloss\\" Pangloss covers over with his \\"Indispensable\\" defense, Candide is inclined to ask: \\"If this is the best of all possible worlds, then what can the rest be like?\\" I hear him saying that, if this is the best of all possible worlds, then why would anyone want more? When people tell me that there is a reason for everything, with the purpose of glossing over my pain, and that we will all find out in the \\"by and by,\\" I wonder what prevents them from finding \\"sufficient reason\\" to expedite their own end and thereby to circumvent the pleasure, pain and reality that they are in actuality trying to escape.Voltaire shows us that we all undoubtedly will suffer. Through his farcical style we see the reality of Candide's suffering. We are also made to see that the pain that he is suffering is suffered at the hands of man and nature. We see that Candide is being led through life by the will of others and that a large part of his suffering is brought on by because he is reacting to life rather than acting upon it. Candide does not see himself or others as an initiator of his pain. He still holds to Pangloss' philosophy that everything is for the best.In reality I have never believed that everything was for the best, yet like Candide I have spent a majority of my life in reaction rather than action. As I suspect is true with Pangloss, I have built up a series of impenetrable defenses. At one time in my life they protected me from that which I could not comprehend, and hence had some value. They were a reaction to experiences that I could not explain away. Yet as time passed, the defenses that had served me so well began to become increasing invalid with each experience that broadened my horizons.While Candide was still a resident of the greatest Hall, owned by the greatest Baron, who was married to the greatest Baroness, who had the most seductive daughter, as well as a son who was naturally worthy of his father, who were all taught by the greatest teacher in the town and \\"consequently the greatest in all the world,\\" his defenses served him well, for there were no experiences that could invalidate the theory that Pangloss was teaching. When these things were taken from Candide, Pangloss' theory did not protect him from real physical or emotional pain. But protection was never its intention. I have never needed protection from anything that did not exist. What people are attempting to do is eliminate suffering from existence. If Candide could only repeat Pangloss enough, then his emotional pain would disappear. He could invalidate pain as a feeling.A lot of people in my life have tried to teach me the same thing. It is not enough that they don't have to feel. Their lives can never be safe as long as the world is inhabited by people who do. Our contact with these people threatens their faux peace. When we cry out, they close the doors. When we are angry, they smile. When someone dies, we mourn in their midst as they say that God is going to make something good come out of this. What a hopeless world we are in when life cannot be other than it is. It would lead me to the greatest of desperations if I could not affect my life, for better or worse, by a thoughtful action.We all want the answers to the questions that suffering naturally brings. Why did this happen to me? Why will it not stop? How can I make it go away? I too have asked all of these questions and attempted to find the answers. I think that Voltaire knew that pain was unavoidable. I think he knew that we had not the power to control the world. He showed clearly that our choices are the determiner of our actions, that Free Will and natural disaster are the determiners of cause and effect. Not only will we try to alter reality so that it does not conflict with our opinions, but we punish, condemn, excommunicate and kill those who do not see our \\"reality\\" as being real.Why then do we ask why pain exists? Why do we ask to stop it? We are constantly throwing punches at those who we believe are of a lower social standard, of differing religious beliefs, dress differently than we do, or are of different color, yet still ascribe these actions as being the way things are meant to be. Do we not see that those punches are a source of pain for those at which they are aimed? Voltaire had \\"sufficient reason\\" to question the ludicrousness of this still commonly held belief. Candide's experience, although farcical, is consistent with the pain that we all feel and that we all try to escape. Voltaire asks us to look at the world with a realistic view. If we hold onto beliefs that we ascribe to whatever God we believe in, even though those beliefs are inconsistent with reality and in most cases contrary to the beliefs of our respective creator, we are voiding any real power that He has, and actually increase that pain which we are trying to eliminate."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"As a closet pessimist, I have often come across - and scoffed at - the notion that we live in the \\"best of all possible worlds.\\" The must be so, of course, because the great God almighty is omniscent, omnipotent, omnibenevolent - in short, perfect, and cannot make a mistake. Therefore, all the seemingly needless suffering, trials, and tribulations that are inherent in our world - i.e., airplanes crashing into buildings - are actually for the better, for the greater good, because everything, EVERYTHING - no matter how seemingly cruel and inhumane - is part of the Big Guy's Great Cosmic Plan. Every action has a purpose, and that purpose is (perpetually) benign.All of which is fine, except...Have you looked at the world lately? I have, and, it seems to me that there are, to put it delicately, Several Flaws In This Plan. I watched two airplanes crash into two major American buildings, needlessly killing thousands, and I find it somewhat hard to believe, to put it lightly, that this is the \\"best of all possible worlds.\\" I'm sure most you do as well... or else you probably wouldn't be reading this, now would you?And yet, in the 18th Century time period when this book was written, just such a philosophy was popular (perhaps \\"rampant\\" is a more accurate term) among the heavy, high-brow philosophers of the day. Candide (subtitled \\"Optimism\\") is Voltaire's refutation of the notion. The writing is heavily sarcastic and burlesque - not to mention dark - as any good satire must be. It contains much delicate gallows humor. It reminds me of nothing (and I realize this is an obvious case of putting the carriage years before the horse) so much as our dearly beloved 20th century Doomsday Prophet Laurete, Kurt Vonnegut. Certainly, as this was in essence an ephermal political satire of the time in which it was written, Candide is not, perhaps as technically valid to our present \\"modern-day\\" society as the work of a, say, Vonnegut. As the book is primarily a reaction to the notion in question (that of all-pervading and naive optimism), and not an explanation of it picking its faults specifically (which is to say, it does not explain the nature of what it is refuting, assuming the reader already knows), much of the sarcasm has been lost through the years. One would need a general knowledge of 18th century philosophy to appreciate all the points that the book tries to make. However, Voltaire's main messages are certainly clear enough, and just as valid today as they ever were - and always will be. Read Candide - it's a dark, funny, irrevently hilarous and enlightening satire on man and his naive, optimistic folly and fallacious outlook. Even if you don't like the book - unlikely, if you have already waded through my review this far - I guarantee that you will respect it, and that it will make you think - and, perhaps, get you to question certain notions that you may have held unquestioningly throughout your life. Essential 18th century literature."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Candide is another one of those books I wish I'd been forced to read at some point in my education, whether in my comparative literature classes in high school (which as previously mentioned, wasn't very comparative if the teacher didn't care for the author) or in one of my several philosophy classes in university. Either way, it's been on my list of books to read for ages now, and seeing as David had it on a shelf, unread and lonely, I decided to pick it up and give it a go.Candide is a fast read, something that I was three-quarters of the way through after my commute on Monday (thirty-five minutes each way) and finished after another half-hour of light reading this afternoon after returning from the doctor's surgery. The only real way to describe it is to imagine what would happen if Camus travelled back in time and decided to write a book with Swift. Candide is funny, sarcastic, satirical, and incredibly entertaining, which is surprising considering I didn't exactly have the best translation in the world at my disposal. It's the story of a young and nave servant to a nobleman and how his journey in life, most of which is taken up with seeking after his unrequited love, is filled with sadness and joy, and how his outlook determines the course of his action.Like most satirists, Voltaire did not stop to consider friends or enemies: he took shots at everyone from the Catholic clergy to Protestants and even his own philosophers who continue to espouse beliefs even after they no longer believe in them because \\"it is the proper thing to do.\\" Brilliant, witty, and clever, this is probably one of my new favourite satirical works, right up there with \\"A Modest Proposal.\\" It's definitely not something that would be enjoyed in a required university class, but anyone who's studied comparative religion or philosophy, or is at least familiar with the absurdities in all philosophical systems, should enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"According to Woody Allen the world is made up of two types of people: the horrible and the miserable. The horrible consist of the crippled, the maimed, and the chronically disabled; the miserable are everyone else. Candide, who believes in the thinking of his tutor, the philosopher Dr. Pangloss, travels throughout the then known world in search of someone who is truly happy. Dr. Pangloss is of the belief that everything that happens to one--whether for good or for bad--is all for the best in \\"this best of all possible worlds.\\" Martin, a philosopher with whom Candide later becomes acquainted, like Woody Allen after him, subscribes to the belief that everyone is unhappy and is doomed to suffer one misfortune after another.Candide himself experiences one tragedy after another. Candide is swindled out of wealth that he accumulates in Eldorado, he suffers beatings, imprisonment, and endless humiliations. He is kicked in the rear end for kissing Cunegonde, his sweetheart for whom he searches the world over. He is even in a shipwreck and is forced to swim ashore. Candide calls out in despair to the absent Dr. Pangloss, for Candide hears only tales of woe from those he meets in his journey._Candide_ should not be taken too seriously. It is meant as a parable and a satire on religious beliefs and on human behavior. That people are greedy, selfish, dishonest, and enjoy inflicting pain on others should be no surprise to anyone who reads _Candide_. It is not unusual for characters in the book to be killed and later to return to life, or for a protagonist who is physically attractive to become aged and ugly, then later on to regain beauty. _Candide_ is an easy read with short chapters. It is rather entertaining, but can be very depressing at times. Its the message at the end--that love and friendship are what makes life meaningful--that is undeniably positive."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"One of the most popular philosophical ideas in Europe during the eighteenth century was that of \\"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds\\". It was the catch-phrase for Leibniz's argument that because god had created the world, everything was made to occur for the best because god's creations couldn't be evil. So even events that seem tragic and pointless are actually part of some larger, cosmically good plan that mere humans can't see. Therefore we should all accept our fate, and know that everything happens for the best, because we live in the best of all possible worlds.Voltaire, a man who had twice been imprisoned in the Bastille and then exiled, thought this was a crock of you-know-what. Candide, subtitled Optimism, is his satirical response to this idea. Clearly humour was one of Voltaire's strong assets; Candide is quite funny. Many critics say that the characters aren't well developed, but I think that they're broadly drawn on purpose. I believe that one of the reasons Candide still works in our time is that we can identify the characters with people we know, and so we can follow their relationships and actions. For example, the old woman (who is never named) has seen what life has to offer, and cannot be surprised by anything anymore. I'm sure we all know at least one person like this. And Pangloss is basically a self-help guru, spouting out feel-good nonsense and getting paid a lot of money for his time. Candide is also somewhat short on dialog versus explication, but I didn't mind it.However, the major drawback is that Candide was written in the eighteenth century, when the idea of the best possible world was so popular. Therefore the book is not an explanation and then rebuttal of it. Candide is only Voltaire's shout of disgust with it, and so the original idea is not addressed in any depth. In order to recover a large amount of the sarcasm, one would have to be fairly proficient in eighteenth-century philosophy.Even with this weakness, I still found Candide a funny, enjoyable short read, and that Voltaire's basic ideas came through in the end."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"In response to the person who complained about the English translation of Candide featured in this book, I wish to point out a few things. Firstly, the French of the original version by Voltaire cannot be considered as 'modern,' even though it is perfectly understandable to the modern reader. There are a few archaic touches here and there, sometimes because the language has evolved, sometimes because Voltaire intended it so (e.g. the title of the first chapter, &quot;et comment il fut chass&eacute; d'icelui&quot; &gt; &quot;and how he was driven thence&quot;, or something like that, was archaic even for Voltaire). I find the English translation fairly accurate in that respect. This is the opinion of a native French speaker, though.Secondly, and consequently, the use of 'thou' in the translation is understandable. This is not the 'clerical' thou as can still be read in the English Bible and other 'flavoured' translations, but the older 'thou', which had become in Late Middle English the familiar, even contemptuous form of the deferential pronoun 'ye' (originally exclusively plural). The 'clerical' thou is a relatively modern device used in certain type of writings to convey an archaic language, but it is really an 'invention.' Therefore, the use of 'thou' in Candide, where the French has the familiar form 'tu,' is acceptable ; but it certainly can be misleading to the modern reader.That is not to say this is the perfect translation -- such a thing does not exist. Where Voltaire uses understatement to great comic effect I find the translator usually too emphatic. Also the French version is much more vulgar in places. I suppose this translation is quite old ; there are others, but I did not read them.To those considering purchasing or reading this book: do so, by all means. Candide is a thought-provoking, entertaining and humorous tale for readers of various tastes. It is a classic."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Candide, is a satire, irony, sarcasm and hyperbole. In this novel he punctuates the naivete of optimism in a cruel, corrupt and bellicose world. In developing this theme Voltaire satirizes the philosophy of Leibniz who contended that earth is the best world possible inasmuch as it was created by a benevolent, omniscient, all-powerful God. Voltaire mercilessly ridicules Leibniz and his philosophy as simple-minded and unrealistic. Voltaire uses wit to mock the practitioners of bigotry, superstition and tyranny. This is a fairly easy read and I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Check for ISBN: 0143039423.I read Candide years ago; however, while looking through the shelves of the local bookstore I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw this new presentation. Check any of the participating book sites and enlarge the image of the new cover to be treated to a whimsical stick figure rendition of the majority of the story (complements of Chris Ware, some of his graphic novels include : The Acme Novelty Library, Quimby the Mouse and Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth). However, read the book, not just the cover, for one of the smartest satires ever written.Candide tells of the outrageous adventures of the nave Candide, who steadfastly believes that \\"all is for the best\\" even when faced with the injustice, suffering, and despair of the world. Following his eviction from his home for a tryst with his stepsister, he sets out to find the \\"best of all possible worlds\\" that his mentor Dr. Pangloss cannot stop extolling. Allthewhile Candide and his friends barely keep from being killed or tortured at every turn. Controversial for its time (the 18th century) and entertaining still today; Candide is a book that is relevant even now in our society, where \\"the mania for insisting that all is well when all is by no means well\\" prevails.I am an avowed classics hater who could never make it through a single volume of anything in any Literature class. Never in a million years would I have picked up this book if not for a recommendation by Kurt Vonnegut in one of his autobiographical works. He highly recommended Candide, and being my favorite author, I could not help but be intrigued. I found it in the bookstore and it was short enough to read in one sitting.The sight of this clever new edition brought a wonderful work of literature back into my mind and I could not help but read it again. Beware, if you do not have a sense of humor about the human condition or do not understand sarcasm, you may not like this.

I wanted to express something of Voltaire in afterthought to this story without having to rate it but while still having many see this. I don't particularly like rating things and I have given it 5 stars based on 5 being my lucky number."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"As a political satire during the \\"enlightenment\\" Voltaire's \\"Candide\\" works quite well. As a comprehensable, logically structured novel it can be at times confusing.The great thing about \\"Candide\\" is Voltaire treats these characters in a way I feel satire works best. You need characters who are complete cliche, sterotypes of those being mocked. Satire I feel only works when you are without limits. Go overbroad, get crazy, but always remain consistant. Don't get serious on your audience when the first 50 pages did not. It breaks your flow. And Voltaire stays true to that form.In some ways \\"Candide\\" reminds me of the work of Homer. It is a grand epic where one absurb event after another takes place, but sometimes it leaves you scrathing your head wondering, \\"how did we come to this\\"? You can argue Voltaire, in an attempt to pass one by the censors of the day had to make the book seems \\"pointless\\" so the government wouldn't be offened, but, we come to ask ourselves, what side is Voltaire really on?He seemed to be for the enlightment, but Pangloss, who is a symbol for the enlightenment, is presented as such a fool, who repeated says everything happens for the best when nothing is working out. Is Voltaire saying the enlightenment has lost its way? If so, he never really provides a way for it to redeem itself.Many of his attacks on society can still be agrued today, especially his opinion of the government which makes the book a worthwhile read, but the structure of the story and much of the character set-up I found poorly done.In short the novel works well as an example of great social and political satire, but can be improved in story development.** 1\\\\2 out of *****Bottom-line: Voltaire's wit reminds me of Oscar Wilde.

Kurt G&ouml;del, humanity's greatest logician, had it exactly right when he bluntly asked, \\"Who ever became more intelligent by reading Voltaire's writings?\\" People too dense or disinterested to follow Leibniz's deliberations regarding the reciprocal entanglements of possibility, freedom (openness), complexity and contingency--which do not of logical necessity (or even logical implication) have anything whatever to do with Voltaire's pedestrian concept of \\"optimism\\"-- won't have a clue as to what Voltaire is attempting to mock. And they won't be alone. If we suppose that Leibniz was Voltaire's true target, then Voltaire apparently had no clue about that which Voltaire was attempting to mock.All of that may be, if only just slightly, too harsh. Voltaire (Franois-Marie Arouet) doesn't actually claim to even know exactly what Leibniz's philosophical treatment of \`possible worlds' was! While he mocks Leibniz by name, his treatise (if we may call this little catalog of misfortunes a treatise) assails a simple-minded caricature of Leibniz's \`possible worlds,' Voltaire merely batters a clownish straw man. Whatever Voltaire's target or motivation, this is no work of serious philosophy, and yet, so long as you don't irrationally expect anything of epistemological or general philosophical weight, this goofy little romp is modestly entertaining, and more memorable than more complex (and more rigorous) works which, unlike Candide, actually require critical thought. Perhaps one person has attempted Leibniz for every 5,000 that have enjoyed Voltaire's fluffy sarcasms. For every 10,000 that have read Candide, perhaps one has grasped Leibniz's \`possible worlds.' That one knows what a strutting clown Voltaire was.

No, I have not found the meaning of life but nor has Voltaire."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Timeliness, being crucial to any piece of social commentary, has stolen the best parts of &quot;Candide&quot; and hidden them away from the average modern reader. Voltaire's humor, already delivered dryly, is lost to the same culprit, as is his sarcasm. Once stripped of those crucial elements &quot;Candide&quot; reads like the outline of a potentially great tale. But it cannot be considered a story, too much is lacking. 1. The tale is 90% exposition. Rather than showing us dear Candide's many wondrous travels, letting us come along, allowing us to feel the events unfolding, we are summarily told. 2. Though the plot takes many turns, some of them clever, there is no art to the writing. We are simply, and again summarily, hurried from place to place, twist to twist. 3. There is no character development. All we ever know of Candide is that he is naive, that he does not learn from his experience, and that he has some truly horrid luck. There is nothing to make us care about him, or any of the characters. At most we say, \`Oh, that's too bad.' But we say it without feeling or concern. 4. Of the final 10%, nine is dialogue. In this we get our only glimpse of Voltaire's intelligence. But as pleasing as that is to see, it cannot make up for the artless way he placed his words. Each character, regardless of upbringing or social standing, speaks in exactly the same manner as every other character, and I suspect that they all speak in a manner that was exactly as Voltaire may have spoken. The remaining 1% is spent, poorly, on some very minimal scenes. He spends so little time on actual scenes, that it seems he must have considered them a great inconvenience. Voltaire gives us no more than is required, which is wonderful in any descriptive passage, including the setting of any scene, but it's all done just as artlessly as the exposition and dialogue. The ending is good. There is a little moralizing, telling us to look to our own lives, but it's done with subtlety. This is the one place Voltaire's simple style pays off. This book is best suited to those of simple and undeveloped literary minds. Those who know anything about writing or good literature can find many better books, under and outside of the &quot;Classic&quot; umbrella."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"aside from it's ugly ass nauseating cover i liked everything about this book"},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"I've read this book three times.

By experiencing murder, beating, torture, censorship, banishment, theft, and slavery this group of loosely tied adventurers inquire about the most intricate details of life's philosophies in the most lighthearted and witty quips centering around God's general plan for the betterment of society as a whole and the individual sacrifices and seemingly absurd happenstances needed to occur for this greater progress to occur.This seems to culminate in discussions around drunken card games held at baron's and other highly-esteemed officials pallaces where there thousands of dust-collecting books seems to be the ultimate symbolic farce of the pointlessness of societal mores and trivial critical establishments. Afterwards, after many unlikely events and quick turnarounds from despair to wealthy gleeming back to gloomy hopelessness, Candide and his journeyman Martin come across other mentors and enemies from his past, as well as his long sought after lover Cunegonde, to find them in the most deplorable conditions and with many regrets, but yet with unflayling blind optimism.The book greatly picks up from their journey into the utopian like village of El Dorado onwards and then gains the respect that has been hyped upon it.

Candide shouldn't be read for it's character development - it should be read for it's message. One thing I must add is the virulent anti-semitism which is found in this book.

I thought that Jonathan Swift was satirically vicious in Gulliver's Travels and \\"A Modest Proposal,\\" but Voltaire makes Dean Swift seem a mere Yahoo. One of the most astonishing features of this short, picaresque novel is the speed of the narrative. Works a few centuries old are usually not notable for being quick reads, but I found myself devouring sentences, paragraphs, and chapters at an alarming rate. Alarming because I'd reached the end with nothing more to read.The tale of Candide, the naive hero, who is separated from his love, the deliciously and vulgarly named Cunegonde, is a vehicle for Voltaire to skewer humanity in every way, shape, and form. No aspect of human endeavor is spared his rapier wit--religion, religious figures, the military, government, rulers, nationalities, philosophers and philosophy, sexuality, class dinstinctions, lawyers, the inhospitable natural world, drunkenness and gluttony, etc., and the humor is produced by the accumulation of detail that is used to describe the misfortunes of the various characters. To compound the irony, the tale begins with the pronouncement of Candide's inept tutor Doctor Pangloss that this is \\"the best of all possible worlds.\\"In the course of their adventures, the characters are kicked, slapped, raped, disemboweled, hanged, burnt at the stake, drowned, stabbed, bayoneted, impaled, blinded, amputated, and my favorite--eaten. The old lady with one buttock, a companion to Cunegonde, at one point says of herself: \\"Imagine the situation of a Pope's daughter aged fifteen, who in three months had undergone poverty and slavery, had been raped nearly every day, had seen her mother cut into four pieces, had undergone hunger and war, and now dying of the plague in Algiers.\\"Well, she survived, was bought and sold several times, and wound up with some Janizaries in a fort under siege by the Russians. \\"The twenty Janizaries had sworn never to surrender us. The extremities of hunger to which they were reduced forced them to eat our two eunuchs for fear of breaking their oath. Some days later they resovled to eat the women.\\" A compassionate Imam intervened, however. \\"'Cut,' said he, 'only one buttock from each of these ladies and you will still have an excellent meal; if you have to return, there will still be as much left in a few days; Heaven will be pleased at so charitable an action and you will be saved.'\\"All of this detail takes place in the space of half a page and is typical of the rest of the text--savage meat for the free-thinking mind."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"...in the convulsions of disquiet or the lethargy of boredom.\\"The subject quote from \\"Candide\\" is another version of the idea expressed in the Chinese aphorism concerning the curse of living in \\"interesting times,\\" that is, times that are \\"exciting\\" to read about if one did not actually live through them. Voltaire, a pseudonym, was one of the intellectual giants of the enlightenment. He was a prolific writer; this book is his most read legacy. A major impetus for writing this book was to refute Leibnitz's philosophy of optimism, best exemplified by Voltaire's character, Dr. Pangloss, whose continued philosophical touchstone is: \\"This is the best of all possible worlds.\\" For anyone who has lived through even a portion of the 20th Century, one would not think such a philosophy needed refuting. But apparently it still does, as witnessed by Barbara Ehrenreich'sBright-Sided: How Positive Thinking Is Undermining America. I first read \\"Candide\\" some forty years ago, and decided to re-read after portions of my own life experience have also helped refute Leibnitz.Candide, at a very youthful age, is kicked out of his own \\"Garden of Eden,\\" which is a German castle in Westphalia, after kissing his first love, and almost only love, Cunegund. Dr. Pangloss was a private tutor at the castle. Candide then commences a wild and extremely improbable romp across much of the known world. He is dragooned into the Bulgarian (Prussian) Army, is beaten, escapes, and meets Dr. Pangloss along the way, who is now a beggar, with syphilis. They join a generous Anabaptist, and take a ship to Lisbon, which had just been destroyed in an earthquake (the background event is historically correct; Lisbon was destroyed by an earthquake in 1755). Candide is only one of three survivors from the shipwreck. Dr. Pangloss is hanged by the forces of the Inquisition. Speaking of which, he again meets his first love, Cunegund, who has become a \\"kept woman,\\" on alternate days of the week (naturally!) by a Jew, and the Grand Inquisitor. Candide kills them both, and flees in her company, and that of an old woman, first to Cadiz, and then on to Buenos Aires. The old woman's story is also bizarre and improbable. She is the illegitimate daughter of Pope Urban X, who, inter alia, had half her buttock's removed by Turkish defenders of Azov, during their wars with Russia, so that they would not starve. Candide visits much of South America, including a kingdom where diamonds and gold are just so many pebbles. He acquires a few, which finances his latter journeys to Venice and Istanbul.Sure, this is satire, but for many a reader, the question would remain: Of what? Clearly it is not the best of all possible worlds, and a partial catalog of the evils of the mid-1700's does not seem necessary to confirm this. Way, way back there in high school, when I first read this, I had been taught that wild and improbable coincidences, such as appeared inThe Mayor of Casterbridge (Enriched Classics (Pocket))weere not good literature. Yet, in \\"Candide,\\" Pangloss did not actually die in the hanging, and Cunegard's brother was not actually killed by the sword that ran him through. Even making allowance for the objectives of satire, it does wear a bit thin.Voltaire was a scathing critic of the rigid dogmatism of the Catholic Church, and I say bravo to that. One of the biggest \\"takeaways\\" on the re-read is a footnote in my Washington Square copy that said that \\"Pope Urban X\\" was a fictitious name, since at the time the Catholic Church had so much power than even a critic like Voltaire did not dare use the name of a real Pope, even a deceased one. The evils of the world are acknowledged; Voltaire's advice to help us get through: cultivate your own private garden. That advice still resonates through the centuries. Well, I have to get ready for the spring planting. 4-stars."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Candide by VoltaireThis is a great classic. \\"Candide\\" treats important philosophical questions in unusual way.

In fact, many of the greatest works of literature are both comedies and tragedies. Candide is probably the greatest example of such a work from a French author. Penned under a pseudonym by the great thinker, Voltaire, this work is superficially an adventure novel about the title character traveling the known world to find his love, while accompanied by Pangloss. In reality, the book is a parody of human society, culture, philosophy, and mentality. The result is a short, witty and insightful examination of the human condition. The textual level is appropriate for anyone at the high school level, but is great reading for anyone at any reading level.All in all, one of the best works in young adult literature."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"I have owned this book for quite awhile but put off reading it, fearing that it would be dull and scholarly.

(Before I get comments about how I'm stupid, I would like to point out that although I sometimes like to read classics for fun, my career and focus has always been in the sciences)Like other satires I've read, Candide seemed heavy-handed and flat. The philosophy of optimism is silly! Absurd things happen! Cue another character who only stands for symbols and has no real personality!This is why I don't read satire very often.I gave this two stars rather than one because I recognize that one may potentially get a chuckle out of the some of the ridiculous situations, and that someone more well acquainted with the particular philosophies may find Voltaire's criticism more entertaining.

It's not a literary masterpiece, but a quick and funny satire. In style, it reads something like Swift's &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot;, but its humor is more pointed and its satire more trenchant.Candide is an illegitimate boy expelled from his adoptive home for kissing the Baron's daughter. A simple and candid man, he resolutely adheres to his tutor's absurd theory that &quot;all is for the best&quot;. In coming years, Candide and everyone he meets suffer tortures, rapes, slavery, and death. Yet Candide remains ever the silly optimist, chasing the Baron's daughter around the world and giving Voltaire space to vent against the happy feel-good philosophers with their buzzwords, tautological reasoning, and empty aphorisms. The tutor, for example, demonstrates the &quot;necessity&quot; of syphillus, as having brought chocolate to Europe though &quot;it is to be observed that this malady is, like religious controversy, peculiar to our continent&quot;.Candide is a quick satire, silly and contrived, but we can read it with pleasure 250 later, long after the targets of Voltaire's wit have faded away."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"i should start by saying that i like voltaire very much but can't understand how this work has come to overshadow his &quot;alphabet of wit&quot;. if u can get a hold of this little book it will be well worth your time. far more amusing and intelligible than candide. voltaire could be a very funny man and there really wasn't a lot of humour in candide. i thought candide was a bit boring at times. also, he did NOT demolish the argument that this is the best of all possible worlds. with matter there are limitaions and the arguments are complex. this book deals with none of them. but i still adore voltaire."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"My personal opinion of the genre of \`fables' is that unless one is intimately familiar with the author's biography and is sufficiently versed in history, books like \`Don Quixote', \`The Alchemist', or \`Candide' should only be read before bedtime and to an audience of no older than 12 years of age.Like any other fable, \`Candide' raises a few of the basic questions of life: wealth, the issues of free will, religion, optimism in the hardest of times, metaphysics of life and of course - love. Expect that a lot is hidden behind the names of the numerous characters introduced by Voltaire. Some of the examples the author uses do not sit well with me - take the one with the raping Bulgarian warriors and their king (by the time the book was written, Bulgaria was into its 400th year of Ottoman slavery without any kings or queens).At times the book drags, especially with Candide's endless voyages, or recounts of seemingly impossible stories.I would've rather reread \`The Stranger' by Camus than read this one in the first place.- by Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"I had to read this book for my world literature class, and was absolutely blown away.

It serves as a satirical introduction the philosophical problem of evil and as an attack on the philosophy of optimism, which is still adhered to today, although perhaps not like in Voltaire's time.Voltaire eviscerates everyone's sacred cows. He satarizes everything. Nothing is not reduced to rubble by his vitriolic writing. In &quot;Candide&quot; Voltaire intelligently satarizes: Christians, Jews, Muslims, war, authority, religious intolerance and bigotry, free will, determinism, the Bible, priests, imams, monks, France, the Papacy, the Inquisition, the Catholic Church, the Protestants, the Jesuits, the Spaniards, the English, Frederick the Great, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz, the so-called morals of religious figures, as well as optimism, and pessimism.There is no work of fiction that has a better grounding in fact than &quot;Candide.&quot; And the final statement of the book, that we must cultivate our garden, is the most universal task put to mankind. It serves as an answer to evil, and as an indictment: Life is a garden, your life is your own garden, YOU must cultivate it in order to reap its benefits. Thus, Voltaire ends his razing of life by endowing it with purpose and meaning.This book is a great adventure in philosophy, satire, religion, and life. It is an easy read, although it can spawn discussions and questions bound to confound almost any theologian. Too bad I can only give it five stars."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Much as in The Autocrat at the Breakfast Table, in which ideas are thrown around under the premise of a breakfast room table conversation, Voltaire expresses his philosophical insights by having his character (Candide) engage himself in a number of conversations with a wide range of people.

To clarify one person's statement that Voltaire did not develop the character's or show the reader his (Candide's) travels, it was simply because he had no time. Candide was written under 48 hours by Voltaire and he was slightly angry when he wrote it (the night before he started, he had been jailed by the government and retaliated by writing a satire)."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Writen hundreds of years ago it's just as true today as when Voltaire wrote it.

Voltaire's Candide is clearly a stab at the church of his time, a church unwilling to accept what are now basic scientific truths such as the earth orbiting the sun (and not the other way around). The church is painted in a less than flatering light, seeing as a few characters in Candide include the daughter of the pope, a monk with a favorite prostitute, and an Inquisitor with an illegitamate lover. Characters such as Doctor Pangloss display brilliantly the ancient thought, painting it (perhaps a bit too exaggerated)in a way nearly blind to the real world. Pangloss's views of all things happening &quot;for the best of all possible worlds&quot; is clearly defied in the story which is in essence a collection of horrific stories painted in a comical array of words. The innate sarcasm in the book pokes a great deal of fun at the thinking of the times, and yet Candide's views are applicable today. Truly an entertaining and intellectually stimulating book, Candide is one of the greatest works of its time."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Voltaire has a knack for satire.

(Principally, you will ask yourself, &quot;Is there always a good side to everything, or are we trapped in a naturalistic world?&quot;) Candide, therefore, is an excellent book for discussion and debate, for it allows the reader to interpret one author's words and theories in so many ways."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"For the most part I thoroughly enjoyed Candide.

Likewise, adult readers will adore the exciting travels, as well as the sexuality and ridiculous situations. However, it is the underlying point that causes the most amusement because of its stab at a certain philosophy: optimism. Voltaire calls it &quot;the mania for insisting that everything is all right when everything is going wrong.&quot; Optimists espouse that all the pain, disaster, and suffering in this world is all part of a big plan which results in the ultimate bliss.

All you need is a &quot;garden&quot; to keep your minds off of boredom and dispair. Voltaire might be daed but his books live on though the centuries"},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"This book's eponymous protagonist is a naive young man who was taught by his teacher, the philosopher Pangloss, that ours is the best possible world and that everything in it always happens for the best. According to Pangloss, misfortunes only ever visit us because they contribute in some way to the general good and \\"the more private misfortunes there are, the more general good\\" there is. Pangloss also dusts off the old chestnuts that all men were created equal and that all property should belong to everyone. Voltaire wrote this novella mainly to refute these ideas, which he attributed to Gottfried Leibniz.It was hard for me to get excited about this book-length refutation because I don't know anyone who believes that everything in our world always occurs \\"for the best\\". Most of us are aware of people who think that private property is evil and that all men were created equal, but unfortunately, those are not the parts of Pangloss's thought that Voltaire spends most of his time refuting. He simply has Candide go through a long series of fantastically cruel misadventures, all just to prove to him that life isn't a piece of cake after all.At one point in the novella a character named \\"the wise man of taste\\" (oh, the subtlety!) holds forth on literature. Among other things he says that a good writer should always strive for newness without being bizarre. Voltaire clearly failed his own test here - all of \\"Candide\\" is bizarre.While pretty violent, this book is not at all depressing. This is mostly because Voltaire seems completely uninterested in his characters' inner lives. I can't imagine what a movie based on \\"Candide\\" would look like, in large part because a cartoon would be far more appropriate for it. After being hanged, raped and pierced with swords, the characters invariably dust themselves off to cheerfully continue their arguments about Leibniz's ideas. Their emotional responses to being hanged and raped aren't any more realistic or thought-provoking than the physical ones.Voltaire made his naive, honest, idealistic protagonist German. After two and a half centuries that stereotype hasn't really changed. Another one has though: in Voltaire's imagination Germany seems to have been a wild, provincial country situated on the far outskirts of civilization. In the 18th century his native France was still the cool kid of nations - a dynamic trend-setter, envied by everybody with a clue. Northern Italy had held that place during the Renaissance, but by Voltaire's time it was already considered a decadent has-been. Voltaire dramatized that feeling here through the character of the Venetian aristocrat Pococurante, who has seen everything and is tired of everything. The cycle that takes some societies from provincialism to leadership and then, almost invariably, to decline is, of course, fascinating. A century after Voltaire's death it was France's turn to become a symbol of decadence in the world's imagination, and Germany's turn to start setting the trends. Then, in the late 20th century, Germany itself joined the rest of Western Europe in the declinist camp, while America and Russia tried their hands at leading.In his time Voltaire was a notorious liberal, and consequently a very fashionable guy to know. But times change - so much so that some of the stuff in this book would probably get him thrown in jail as a Nazi in modern France. For example: \\"The northern nations have not that heat in their blood, nor that raging lust for women, so common in Africa.\\" Or this, from one female character's description of how she was raped by a pirate: \\"He was an abominable negro, and yet believed that he did me a great deal of honor\\". And this is how the same woman explains the pirates' attraction to her and to her European companions: \\"...our maids of honor, and even our waiting women, had more charms than are to be found in all Africa...\\" In a different chapter he describes women from an Indian tribe in Paraguay being amorous with apes, incorrectly stating that such unions are capable of producing offspring.Through the character of Pococurante Voltaire dismisses all scientists and their work as utterly useless: \\"...if only one of those rakers of rubbish had shown how to make pins; but in all these volumes there is nothing but chimerical systems, and not a single useful thing.\\" It's fun to note here that Voltaire belonged to the last generation of Europeans who could have honestly made that claim. He died in 1778, just as the Industrial Revolution was starting up in England.Another interesting thing in the Pococurante episode is that it contains a short review of what people of Voltaire's age considered great literature. Most of the authors mentioned were unsurprisingly Greek and Roman. Only one English writer is discussed and it is Milton, not Shakespeare. In 1759, when \\"Candide\\" was first published, Shakespeare hadn't become super-important yet.Voltaire spends a lot of time decrying the horrors of war here. Actually, I've never thought of the first three quarters of the 18th century as having been particularly violent. It is only with the French Revolution, many of whose leaders were inspired by Voltaire, that the quaint little wars and cartoonish despotisms of his age gave way to the megawars and megadespotisms of the Jacobin and Napoleonic types.Voltaire, a staunch enemy of organized religion, included an auto-da-fe scene here as an example of how violent his clerical foes could be. Of course, the Revolution and its copycats across Europe ended up killing a lot more people than the Inquisition ever could, with most of the Revolutionaries being as anti-clerical as Voltaire. It's important to state here, however, that unlike many modern European critics of Christianity, Voltaire was a consistent secularist - his attitudes towards Islam and Judaism were often negative as well.As a contrast to the crumminess of the real world, Voltaire included in this book a description of a utopia called Eldorado. Like everything else in \\"Candide\\", this utopia is painted in pretty broad, cartoonish brushstrokes, but I'd like to single out one of its aspects nevertheless.Eldorado is apparently devoid of war, crime and all other forms of human conflict. Let's disregard for a moment the fact that no such society has ever existed. Let's just ask if such a society COULD ever arise, and if it could, what would be the long-term consequences?I believe that man, like all other animals, is a product of evolution. The competition for survival, essential to evolution, takes many forms, most of them involving conflict in some way. Regardless of whether or not they want to admit it, most people enjoy conflict. I know that Voltaire did because I've just finished a book of his that joyfully attacks the church, Leibniz, a bunch of now-obscure Parisian writers who happened to be his professional rivals and lots of other people besides. If a society was somehow forced, against its will, to abandon all forms of conflict, what would become of that society long-term? Voltaire died long before the rise of political correctness, so he must have been aware of the correct answer to that question, yet he described his utopia as being devoid of conflict anyway. It is no excuse at all to say here that he couldn't have been aware of the theory of evolution as such. The 18th century was obsessed with the idea of breeding, both human and animal, so he must have known how that system worked even if he wouldn't have used modern terms to describe it.To me the most likely explanation for the Eldorado episode, as for much else in \\"Candide\\", is simple intellectual sloppiness."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"This book was moderately entertaining from a fictional standpoint. However, maybe I am shallow, but I did not see the philosophical genius which is frequently exalted in this work. I felt the conclusion was a great let down after all of the events that led up to it. Perhaps if it is viewed through a lense relevant to the time it is written it is more profound."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"This novel by French philosopher Voltaire is one of the most ironic and satirical prose that i have read in a long time! I was surprised in how funny and crazy this novel was. The chaotic events that take place, which continuously contradict Dr. Pangloss's notion that \\"all is for the best in the world,\\" meaning that the world is perfect because God made it, and the evils that take place upon the world are all part of a cosmic plan. But apparently, as we all know more than ever today, is that the world isn't perfect, and that we do have free will to prevent some things from happening. For such a short book, Voltaire portrays society, government, social classes, etc. very well into a very comical and sometimes appalling satire. I was very impressed, i look foreward to reading this again and again in the future. It's very entertaining, full of wit, exciting, and will make you laugh, make you shudder, and at the end, make you think. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Ever since philosophers began thinking about the meaning of life, a favorite question has been \\"Why do bad things happen to good people?\\". In Voltaire's day, this issue was primarily pursued either from the perspective of faith (everything that happens is God's will and must be for Divine purpose) or of reason (What do these events mean to you, as you interpret them subjectively?). Infuriated by the reaction by some members of the church to a horrible loss of life from an earthquake in Lisbon, Voltaire wrote this hard-biting satire of the human condition to explore these questions.Before reading further, let me share a word of caution. This book is filled with human atrocities of the most gruesome sort. Anything that you can imagine could occur in war, an Inquisition, or during piracy happens in this book. If you find such matters distressing (as many will, and more should), this book will be unpleasant reading. You should find another book to read.The book begins as Candide is raised in the household of a minor noble family in Westphalia, where he is educated by Dr. Pangloss, a student of metaphysical questions. Pangloss believes that this is the best of all possible worlds and deeply ingrains that view into his pupil. Candide is buoyed by that thought as he encounters many setbacks in the course of the book as he travels through many parts of Europe, Turkey, and South America.All is well for Candide until he falls in love with the Baron's daughter and is caught kissing her hand by the Baron. The Baron immediately kicks Candide out of the castle (literally on the backside), and Candide's wanderings begin. Think of this as being like expulsion from the Garden of Eden for Adam. Soon the penniless Candide finds himself in the Bulgarian army, and receiving lots of beatings while he learns to drill.The story grows more far-fetched with each subsequent incident. To the casual reader, this exaggeration can seem unnecessary and annoying. It will remind you of the most extreme parts of Swift in Gulliver's Travels and Rabelais in Gargantua and Pantagruel. But subtly, Voltaire is using the exaggeration to lure the reader into making complacent judgments about complacency itself that Voltaire wants to challenge. The result is a deliciously ironical work that undermines complacency at a more fundamental level than I have seen done elsewhere. Basically, Candide challenges any view you have about complacency that is defined in terms of the world-view of those who are complacent.Significant changes of circumstances (good and ill) occur to all of the members of the Baron's household over the course of the story. Throughout, there is much comparing of who has had the worst luck, with much feeling sorry for oneself.That is the surface story. Voltaire is, however, a master of misdirection. Beneath the surface, Voltaire has another purpose for the book. He also wants to expose the reader to questioning the many bad habits that people have that make matters worse for everyone. The major themes of these undercurrents are (1) competing rather than to cooperating, (2) employing inhumane means to accomplish worldly (and many spiritual) ends, (3) following expected rules of behavior to show one's superiority over others that harm and degrade others, (4) focusing on money and power rather than creating rich human relationships, (5) hypocritical behavior, and (6) pursuing ends that society approves of rather than ends that please oneself.By the end of the story, the focus shifts again to a totally different question: How can humans achieve happiness? Then, you have to reassess what you thought about the book and what was going on in Voltaire's story. Many readers will choose to reread the book to better capture Voltaire's perspective on that final question, having been surprised by it.Candide is one of my favorite books because it treats important philosophical questions in such an unusual way. Such unaccustomed matching of treatment and subject matters leaves an indelible impression that normal philosophical arguments can never match. Voltaire also has an amazing imagination. Few could concoct such a story (even by using illegal substances to stimulate the subconscious mind). I constantly find myself wondering what he will come up with next. The story is so absurd that it penetrates the consciousness at a very fundamental level, almost like doing improvisation. In so doing, Voltaire taps into that feeling of \\"what else can happen?\\" that overcomes us when we are at our most pessimistic. So, gradually you will find yourself identifying with the story -- even though nothing like this could ever happen to you. Like a good horror story, you are also relieved that you can read about others' troubles and can put your own into perspective. This last point is the fundamental humanity of the story. You see what a wonderful thing a kind word, a meal, or a helping hand can be. That will probably inspire you to offer those empathic actions more often.After you have finished Candide, I suggest that you ask yourself where complacency about your life and circumstances is costing you and those you care about the potential for more health, happiness, peace, and prosperity. Then take Voltaire's solution, and look around you for those who enjoy the most of those four wonderful attributes. What do those people think and do differently from you?"},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"It is probably fair to say that there is no book that is quite like Voltaire's 'Candide'. This is a venomous satire of the 'Optimistic' philosophy and outlook of enlightenment thinkers such as Leibniz and Alexander Pope. As such, it is served well by the unique combination of repeated brutality and a deft, light touch. If that last comment doesn't make sense, then you'll just have to READ THE BOOK.At a mere 144 pages (in this edition), this is a classic that is a breeze to read. As to the charge that this book is too &quot;violent&quot; or &quot;in bad taste&quot;, I would only ask you to remember that Voltaire was furious that learned members of a &quot;civilized&quot; society (like Leibniz, Pope, and even Rousseau)could claim that the apparent senseless violence and mayhem wrought by disasters, war, disease, man's cruelty, etc. was actually only a part of some 'greater good' - after all, God (being perfect) could not 'logically' created anything but the 'best of all possible' universes.Voltaire's touch is so light and understated that I defy anyone to write anything that contains a third of the violence in 'Candide' and still manages to read as breezily and somehow be genuinely funny.But dark satire must be funny - otherwise it lapses into pedantry.Read it - even if you do not like it, I guarantee you that it will disturb you and make you think.And for that, we can thank Voltaire."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"&quot;All is for the best...in the best of all possible worlds.&quot;Utopia generally conjures up images of beauty, brilliance and harmony. How is it possible to conceive of the violent and brutal happenings in Candide as &quot;the best of all possible worlds?&quot; Our world is clearly not perfect, so isn't it more logical to conclude that all is not for the best? At least not all of the time? Such are the questions raised in Voltaire's timeless masterpiece of satire, Candide.Candide tells the journey of a young man through the world and the realities he must face, deal with and eventually come to be defined by. During his ventures, Candide leaves behind the naive innocence of his childhood and assumes the status of an intelligent and distinguished man.Candide was born and grew up in the castle of the Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh, in the land of Westphalia in Germany. Soon after his mentor, the philosopher, Dr. Pangloss introduces him to the idea of extreme optimism, Candide's adventures begin as he is banned from the kingdom for kissing the Baron's beautiful daughter, Lady Cunegund.As Candide travels through Germany, Holland, the New World and the remainder of Europe, he encounters trials and evils of every sort--war, hatred, betrayal, starvation, natural catastrophes of all kinds, in short, any and every evil to which man has ever fallen prey.In the course of his travails, however, one thing becomes outstandingly familiar to Candide; the parallels of events that denote the universality of evil.Finally, coming full circle, Candide settles down to cultivate his own garden and make the best of his own possible world.As with most satire, the characters in Candide exist for one unique purpose rather than being fully fleshed out. Dr. Pangloss is the most notable. Pangloss is not present in most of Candide's adventures but he does provide the theme underlying the whole of the book. He serves to sway Candide with his one, unrelenting optimistic outlook on life.The epitome of Pangloss's philosophical outlook, &quot;Everything is for the best,&quot; is assimilated by Candide very early in the story. Being young, sheltered and naive at the time, Candide proceeds to live his life according to this tenet. When faced with a problem he always asks himself what Pangloss would do or say in a similar situation.Candide, however, eventually learns to form his own opinions and concepts and thus the philosophical optimism of Dr. Pangloss is tested and challenged throughout the book.The &quot;Pangloss Effect&quot; is also demonstrated through Candide's experience in El Dorado, Voltaire's fictional utopia. Candide, traveling with Cacambo, his servant, finally discovers El Dorado, the purported &quot;perfect&quot; place. Why would anyone ever want to leave this perfect place, Candide asks himself? His quest had been to prove the theory of optimism of Pangloss and now apparently, he had succeeded. However, all is not what it may seem, even in El Dorado, and Candide is confronted with many ironic and enigmatic questions.As his journeys draw to a close, Candide comes to realize that it is man's almost limitless ability to accept the fate that befalls him and move on to new and better things that allows him to remain sane, happy and productive. In this sense, Candide comes to represent change and development while Pangloss remains the apex of the unchanging and inflexible.While most satire grows stale and dated, Candide remains as fresh as it was when Voltaire wrote it. In the end, as Candide wisely shows us, in the best of all possible worlds, we all tend our gardens as best as we possibly can."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"When Voltaire's Candide was originally published in 1759, it must have really been something. Voltaire's goal, of course, was to satirize the haberdash Liebnizian view holding that everything that happens in this world - the good, the bad, the ugly - is all part of God's omnibenevolent plan, and hence, ultimately, for the good. Thus, by watching young Candide, a boy schooled in this philosophy, endure mindless tragedy upon mindless tragedy while despearetely trying to decipher how each fits into God's all-good plan, we see how ridiculous such a view is.While this everything-is-for-the-best-no-matter-how-bad-it-actually-seems view is not AS active today as it was in Voltaire's 1759, we still see a good bit of it. Witness Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell telling us that the 9/11 suicide attacks were God's way of punishing us for leftward political activities (as if an all-powerful God couldn't come up with some better way to get a message to us than this). And how many times, in the face of tragedy, do we hear platitudes like \\"It is all ultimately for the best,\\" or, \\"God works in mysterious ways.\\"In a sense, Candide is as biting and prescient now as it must have been in 1759. Of course, Voltaire isn't trying to disprove this Liebnizian idea. Satire can't disprove; that's what philosophic tomes are for. Rather, Voltaire is simply trying to show it's absurdity by allowing us to laugh at it (in the comfort of our own homes, of course). So those looking for an actual debunking of the \\"problem of evil\\" (as it is known in philosophy) should look elsewhere.Another warning: as fiction - purely as fiction - Candide is not a good work at all. It basically consists of the main character going from place to place (searching for his lover) only to encounter one attrocity after another. If one throws out the satire element, then Candide is a rambling, disjointed and drastically inferior Don Quixote. But as satire, the work is innervating and deep."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Candide is a short and rewarding read. Follow the adventures of Candide, an honest and naive young man who grows up in a baron's household in Germany, on his loss-of-innocence journey. Kicked out of his house after he is caught in a tryst with the baron's daughter, Candide is banished to wander the cruel world. From forced conscription to the Inquisition, Candide sees wonder upon wonder, always holding fast to the teachings of Master Pangloss, his philosophy teacher, that all things (no matter how bad) are right--because they must be so, and picking up new friends on the way.Candide is Voltaire's Swift-like satirical commentary on the society of his day (Europe) and all its dirty laundry--the hypocrisy, greed, cruelty, lecherousness, and demagoguery. Not a single ethnic, political, or religious faction is spared. Voltaire wants Candide, and his reader, to cast off our complacency and irrational optimism, embracing instead demonstrable truths and the responsibility to make things right.In short, Voltaire wants Candide to live up to his name, and maybe it is the most innocent and gullible hero needed to restore the integrity Voltaire saw lacking in the men and women of his day--a new beginning."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"I first read \\"Candide\\" when I was still in HS, around 4 or 5 years ago. Maybe it was because I was forced to read it for a class, but I really didn't \\"get it\\" back then. Having some free time while I waited for my next amazon.com book order to arrive, I decided to pick up \\"Candide\\" once again. This time around, my experience was much more enlightening.\\"Candide\\" revolves around the title character, who has had it instilled upon him by Dr. Pangloss, his personal philosopher, that we live in the \\"best of all possible worlds.\\" After seeing Pangloss fooling around with the chambermaid, Candide decided to replicate the acts with the Lady Cunegonde. After being discovered by the Baron, Candide is swiftly kicked (on his rump) out of Westphalia. This sets into motion a long and unbelievable set of events. Candide travels across half the known world in hopes of once again being reunited with Lady Cunegonde. Calamity upon calmity is witnessed by Candide yet he remains steadfast in his belief that everything works out for the best. To fully understand the insanity that marks this book you have to read it for yourself. I would do it an injustice it by saying anything further. I will say that the ending is quite a change of pace from the rest of the book.Although it isn't hard to discern that this story is wholy unrealistic, it is written in such a way that you feel it is somewhat plausible. This might stem from the fact that our society has done a 180 and is composed mainly of cynics and pessimists. Although it was written around 250 years ago, many of the basic issues that Voltaire attacks are still around today. While we don't have the Inquisition murdering people today, religious intolerance is still deep rooted in many humans.There are many reasons I so highly recommend this book. It is a quick read, something you can finish in only a couple hours. It also has several fantastical scenes that will leave you chuckling in disbelief. Finally, it is a good book to see exactly how much our world (at least the Western half) has changed."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"The story of Candide greatly affected the way I perceive occurances on a daily basis. I've always lived with a very optimistic outlook on life, assuming things will always turn out for the best. After reading the tragedies young Candide had to cope with and the way that he handled them, I realized that such a naive approach to life could be very dangerous. The proper amount of optimism is always good because it keeps hopes alive, but being irrationally optimistic in certain circumstances can often result in dire consequences."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"It [optimism] is the obstinacy of maintaining that everything is best when it is worst.\\"With satirical wit and humor, the great French Enlightenment thinker Voltaire espouses his philosophical beliefs in \\"Candide,\\" an 18th century masterpiece. At first, the intent of \\"Candide\\" may be a bit difficult to discern. If you have a mindset that this is a flowery treatise on Enlightenment philosophy, you may be disappointed (or relieved). \\"Candide\\" is neither realistic nor didactic. In fact, one can almost view it as a dark comedy or a biting satire, for most of the circumstances are absurd and far-fetched, to say the least.Although Candide (\\"The Optimist\\") is the protagonist, his teacher Pangloss is the most important character, for Pangloss is a magnificent (or so Candide thinks) philosopher who espouses the eternal optimistic view - no matter what evil befalls humankind, it is part of a perfect master plan. Indeed, this is the \\"best of all worlds\\". Despite being stricken with syphilis, hanged, nearly dissected, enslaved, losing an arm, ear and nose, burned and drowned, he maintains this worldview until his last dying breath. As a foil to Pangloss, Martin is an eternal pessimist. Yet, while this worldview may be more pragramtic in an imperfect world, it nevertheless discounts true good in the world and can also be a hindrance. Indeed, Voltaire criticizes both extreme optimism and extreme pessimism.\\"Candide\\" is Voltaire's forum for exposing the hypocrisy and brutality of the world he lived in. Voltaire bashes Catholicism by repeated references to gay clergy and the illegitimate child of the Pope. Voltaire shows disdain for Protesant zealots by illustrating the contemptible treatment of Candide when he expresses doubt that the Pope is the devil. Voltaire ridicules the aristocracy with the character of Cunengard's brother, a homosexual German baron. Voltaire ridicules the monarchy by virtue of six deposed kings bemoaning their fates in a village inn. Voltaire satirizes do-nothing philosophers through Pangloss and Martin. Voltaire rips Islam through the sultans and princes of Turkey. Anyway, you get the picture. Even the relatively progressive country of England is not immune to Voltaire's criticism.Another myth that Voltaire dispels is the Utopian ideal, embodied in the mythical city of El Dorado in South America. In this city, there is no religion, prisons, or crimes. The roads are paved with gold and diamonds and even the most destitute denizen lives a carefree, fulfilling life. There is no need for money, despite the land's innumerable riches. Yet, this utopia is nearly inaccessible to the outside world, as Candide stumbles upon it by a freak of nature. Although this utopia is perfect, no one will ever reach it again. In this way, Voltaire seems to imply that the pursuit of a utopia on earth is a fruitless endeavor.So what exactly is Voltaire's worldview? Through Zenoida, a desposed Danish noblewoman, Voltaire expresses his philosophies. Although we are all children of Providence, we are not exempt from sorrow, misery, and grievous atrocities, for life is a conglomeration of both pain and pleasure. The best one can do is to better the community one lives in and to follow one's conscience. Idleness and philosophizing without action is a useless endeavor.\\"Wait a minute - who the #@%! is Zenoida and since when was Pangloss burned and drowned. I've read the entire book and there's no reference to either.\\" Ah, yes, most novels only present Part I of \\"Candide,\\" where our merry adventurers our left to live out a fulfulling life on a modest farm in Turkey. But there's more to this story. Do yourself a favor and download Part II of Candide, easily obtainable on the internet through a free literature site, such as the Gutenberg Project. In Part II, Voltaire presents a tidy conclusion for Candide and his companions, while providing more items for contemplation. Honestly, I found Part II (which is shorter than Part I) a more enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Candide, which is subtitled Optimism, was written in 1759, and is proof that a sharp wit and biting satire was just as much appreciated in Voltaire's time, as it is today.Candide is the life story of a fictional character named Candide. He is a naive, innocent, and optimistic sort of person. If you ever feel that life has treated you unfairly, then you have nothing to complain about if you compare yourself to poor Candide. Just about everything bad imaginable happens to him during the course of his life. Fortunately, at least Voltaire leaves him still alive at the end of the book.Although the book is funny and fast paced (my copy has 115 pages), it can best be appreciated by recognizing the author's intention. Candide is Voltaire's commentary on the church's prevailing philosophy at the time.In Voltaire's time, the church preached that because God is perfect, he would only create the best of all possible worlds. To create a lesser world would imply that God was less than perfect. I don't believe Voltaire's argument was against this philosophy per se, but rather against the way it was used to justify all the evil found in the world.The &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot; proponents used the argument to justify all bad things as a necessary part of the world and so bad things should be accepted as just another part of life. However, Voltaire's philosophy was that &quot;we must cultivate our gardens&quot;, i.e., help the good to grow while pulling out the weeds. Greed, lust, vice, etc., were not necessary in Voltaire's opinion and we should make every attempt to ward off such evils rather than merely accept them.The &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot; philosophy is exemplified in the book by Candide's teacher, Dr. Pangloss (a footnote says that Pangloss means &quot;all-tongue&quot;). Pangloss teaches Candide this philosophy and Candide tries to use it throughout the book to justify the bad things that happen to him. Voltaire uses this approach to ridicule proponents of the &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot; argument for why evil things happen, and takes us on an exciting and funny adventure in the process.Candide is certainly one of the best books you could ever read. After all, there must be some reason the book is still popular today and has even been made into musical plays. Other quick Amazon picks include, White Noise by DeLillo, WILL@epicqwest.com by Tom Grimes"},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Candide is my favorite book, and I've read it multiple times in boh french and english. This is by far the worst english translation I've come across. It makes absolutely no attempt to preserve the grammatical structure of Voltaire's original, and consequently much of the irony and wit is lost. Read Candide, but not this copy.The Signet edition is not bad."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Like any story that is written in an allegorical style, it serves the reader well to investigate the story of the writer as a person before trying to understanding the motivations of the person as a writer. (Clarence Darrow's short, unofficial biography is an excellent reference.) Suffice to say that any philosophy that can be applied and re-applied through history must be treated as relevant. Candide's story, a quest to be reunited with a woman who represents an idea more than a person, of human suffering, of enduring injustice, and of noble intention twisted to serve the basest defects of human character, could evoke similarities in a modern setting as easily as it was applied to the brutish realities of the 1700s. Read this story. Better yet, read several of Voltaire's stories (Zadig or Fate, Princess of Babylon, The White Bull, etc.,). Monsieur Voltaire was a hero to not only many of his French brothers and sisters, but was inspirational to several rebellious British subjects in the \\"New World\\", most notably Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. The Age of Enlightenment owes perhaps more to this man and his spirit of personal freedoms, independent thought, and libertarian dogma, than any other thinker of his time."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"I'm not usually predisposed to the classics, but this is one I'd been meaning to read for quite a while, and it is relatively short.

Candide, albeit a short work, emanates incredible power. When first printed, Candide subsequently was banned by Louis XV for fear of rousing the proletariat. Upon reading Candide, one can, without doubt, ascertain why. Voltaire stresses resilience, realism, and an eschewal of blithe trust and optimism.For a short work, Candide provides more outrageously absurd events than one would deem possible.

I found this book a very tedious and I did not enjoy the wild plot as Candide and his fellow friends travelled all across the world, never to escape sorrows.

It's set in the eighteenth century and deals with all the tragedies of it's time. Voltaire touches base with many historical accounts including the earthquakes of Lima and Lisbon.

There are many things detestable about this novel so I will limit my critisicsm to only several aspects: the pot has no coherence, the character developement is not only unbelievable but also banal, the writing style ,although blessedly, terse is childish and unimaginative to say the least. And finally, a qotation I once read said something to this effect: the best novel are those that are novels not only of the hour but of all time.

I never agreed with that reviewer's assesment. In light of September 11, my disagreement is further entrenched in my body. Religious ignorance is still running amuck in the hills and desert dunes, and right in our own backyard. Has Voltaire's war been won? No, I don't think so. We're in the middle of it right now.

It tells the story about an illegitimate son of Dr. Pangloss. This book is a satire and as good a depiction of the follies and vices of men that you'll find. We follow Candide through many outrageous adventures which put into question all that mankind holds dear (such as science, philosophy, religion, government and romance). It attacks the pretentiousness of the upper classes. It attacks man's culpability, stupidity and crudeness. It's funny, warm and incredibly poignant. It is no wonder that the printer that was to publish Voltaire's book had to go underground to do so, and that he lost his business and his personal fortune because of this book. This is a masterful, if blistering satire on the follies and vices of men. Voltaire does not save anybody, no matter what walk of life they are in. In fact, the upper classes are painted in a very unflattering light. Candide is a young and impressionable if somewhat bumptious hero, who falls into and out of more trouble in his life. He is a nave soul who believes all that he is told and thinks that everyone knows more about things than he does himself. Voltaire spares no punches as he outlines his idea of man. To him humankind shows grossness, cupidity, and not a little outright stupidity. But even so the book is not as pessimistic as it could be. There is a freshness here in the simplemindedness of Candide, and in the occasional goodness that he runs across. His stay at Eldorado is part of the book that illustrates goodness, and the ending leaves on an optimistic note when Voltaire and his motley band of followers realize that good will come if man will stay at home and look after his acreages. Wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Candide is among the classics of world- literature.Voltaire wrote a hundred volumes or more but this is the only piece which is still read today. There is reason for this. The theme is an eternal one, innocent optimistic idealistic youth confronting the realities of the world, and being slowly disabused of his idealism. Voltaire takes on Leibniz whose views are represented by Candide's teacher Pangloss( Everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds). Voltaire writes with great satirical skill of the numerous misadventures of Candide who after them all comes to the conclusion that ' it is best to cultivate one's own garden' . One reason I never fully enjoyed the book is my sense of a certain predictable slaptstick element in which the cruelty preceding is certainly about to be followed by the cruelty to come. And this too has to do with a feeling a sense that Voltaire himself seemed to be enjoying the cruelty more than anything else. Voltaire it is true has an honored place in the human struggle for freedom of individual expression but he was on the personal level a quite terrible person. And that feeling that for him the cruelties of life are a bit of a delight did not escape me when reading the work.This to my mind means that the work cannot even come close to those peaks of world literature in which we have deep connection with and sympathy for the major heroes. Candide is a straw- figure and this little moral allegory still speaks a truth and a question."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Still today, over two hundred years after it was written, Candide still shines as one of literature's best satires.The book is full of pessimism does not prevent him from using humor throughout the book. Some of the humor used in the book is blatant; the governor of Buenos Ayres declares his love for Cun&eacute;gonde, says he will marry her, then never does. In case readers did not understand the hypocrisy, Voltaire gave the governor a name to remember: Don Fernando d'Ibaraa y Figuerora y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza. Another interesting name is that of Baron Thunder-ten-tronckh. The illeteration and mental imagery is what stood out for me; the name brings pictures of a corpulent man thundering down a hall. It does not sound aristocratic (if indeed, names can be aristocratic) and seems more of a misnomer than a label for a noble from Wittenburg. By examining the Baron's behavior (working everyone towards his goals and then profiting from their labor while he does nothing) the name is no longer a misnomer.Candide reminded me of Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote in that a man following the regulations of chivalry is driven to do the correct thing even though disastrous consequences may come of it. Candine discovers this when he rescues Cun&eacute;gonde from a Turkish noble and finds she is ugly and disagreeable. In addition, Don Quixote and Candide both find themselves in improbable situations over and over again. Both books are satire and they poke fun at the same government, social, and ecclesiastical principles. Despite the similarity, I did enjoy reading Candide more so than I did Don Quixote."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Yes, this is a rereading of a book for school, but like most books, I got more out of it on a second reading. I love this short novel of a young man's journey through the world of sin, evil, and darkness to test preconceived theological and philosophical notions that this world is the \\"best of all possible worlds.\\"Candide is Voltaire's indictment on an active, benevolent God, but he ignores the important fact that without an absolute standard of what is good, how can we call anything evil? Why are all the wars, rapes, thieving, murder, and vengeance Candide experiences considered evil if there is no measuring stick to define it against an absolute good? In the words of C. S. Lewis, how can we call a line crooked without any notion of a straight line? Contrary to Voltaire's findings, the evil and wickedness in Candide's world point to absolutes of goodness, fairness, and honesty. If there is no God in this world, how does the atheist explain the evil? To what standard can he call rape and murder wrong if there is no ultimate goodness?"},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"\\"When all is said and done, there is a sterling goodness in unsophisticated Nature; for instead of eating me, these people behaved most politely as soon as they learnt I was not a Jesuit.\\" Voltaire's protagonist Candide is certainly a character who withstood anything the world and mankind could throw at him and remarkably kept his spirit of optimism.Voltaire's satire - my first experience with anything Voltaire - was a quick and fairly easy read, and a rewarding experience to have acquainted myself with this literary work. Aside from the repeated tragedy experienced by Candide and his various travelling companions, one thing that struck me was how a satire written over 250 years ago still plays so well in today's world. It poked fun at a myriad of different societal aspects from Voltaire's time (mid-1700s): religious philosophies, man's penchant for power/riches/violence/domination, politics, and much more. Given that the satire seems just as relevant in 2011 as it was in Voltaire's time is a testament to me that there's creedence to the ol' saying \\"the more things change, the more they stay the same.\\"As for whether the Penguin edition of the story is any good or is an injustice to the original, I can't offer an opinion as I have no idea how the original reads or its literary style."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"This is my first attempt at Classic Literature, and I have to say that this one was very interesting, very well thought out, and dowright good.

Too bad it wasn't required reading when I was in high school."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Before you read Candide, you must place yourself in XVII Century France; a time with no middle class, where most diseases are deadly, where the smallest dispute would be solved in a duel, and where making fun of the monarchy could get you hanged or at the very least, flogged. Are you there yet? If so, poor you. But to enlighten your mood, grab a copy of Candide and I guarantee it will put a smile on your face.Candide is a young, naive man who lives in the lap of luxury under the mentorship of Pangloss, an optimist philosopher who believes that everything that happens, no matter how bad, is always and without fail for the very best. The premise of Voltaire's story is simple. Optimism is absurd. And the lovely, but yet horrible life of Candide is the tool he uses to prove it.Most people attribute the literary genre of magical realism to Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his novel \\"100 Years of Solitude\\", but that would be like saying that Christianity precedes the birth of Christ. Voltaire's \\"Candide or, the Optimist\\" is THE blueprint of magical realism and even satire.We follow Candide in his lifelong battle to be with his one and only love, Cunegonde, through a multitude of adventures full of misfortunes, unsurmountable obstacles, improbable situations, and downright silliness; all of which happens while he struggles to understand how so much misery can indeed be \\"for the very best\\". His travels take him through places like Germany, France, Portugal, and even Paraguay. It may sound crazy, but in the world of Candide, it all fits into place.There are so many politically incorrect and deliciously crafted remarks that at the time, would have been considered downright blasphemous. It's hilarious. Chapter 25 is a perfect example of this. Candide and a companion visit Lord Pococurante, a noble Venetian, at his breathtaking palace. Candide is impressed by the cultural collection of art and literary works he owns, but yet, Lord Pococurante is disgusted by it! When describing a Raphael painting, the senator explains that \\"the colours are too dark, the figures are not sufficiently rounded, nor in good relief, and the draperies in no way resemble stuffs.\\" Then, while they waited for dinner, the musicians played a tune and Candide found it delicious.\\"This noise,\\" said the Senator, \\"may amuse one for half an hour; but if it were to last longer it would grow tiresome to everybody, though they durst not own it. Music, today, is only the art of executing difficult things, and that which is only difficult cannot please long. Perhaps I should be fonder of the opera if they had not found the secret of making of it a monster which shocks me. Let who will go to see bad tragedies set to music, where the scenes are contrived for no other end than to introduce two or three songs ridiculously out of place, to show off an actress's voice. Let who will, or who can, die away with pleasure at the sight of an eunuch quavering the role of Caesar, or of Cato, and strutting awkwardly upon the stage.\\"After dinner they went into the library. Candide, seeing a Homer magnificently bound, commended the virtuoso on his good taste. To which he replied:\\"They used at one time to make me believe that I took a pleasure in reading him. But that continual repetition of battles, so extremely like one another; those gods that are always active without doing anything decisive; that Helen who is the cause of the war, and who yet scarcely appears in the piece; that Troy, so long besieged without being taken; all these together caused me great weariness. I have sometimes asked learned men whether they were not as weary as I of that work. Those who were sincere have owned to me that the poem made them fall asleep; yet it was necessary to have it in their library as a monument of antiquity, or like those rusty medals which are no longer of use in commerce.\\"Is this not brilliant? Forgive me for quoting so much in this review, but it's all so good that it'd be a shame not to share more!When confronted about Cicero's works, the senator said: \\"When I found that he doubted of everything, I concluded that I knew as much as he, and that I had no need of a guide to learn ignorance.\\"Reading this, most of us in modern times who have actually read such works cannot avoid screaming, \\"FINALLY, SOMEONE SAID IT!\\" If today, admitting such opinions around so-called intellectuals can be enough reason to earn ban in cultural society, imagine how devastating it would have been BACK THEN.Pococurante then concluded his argument saying that \\"fools admire everything in an author of reputation. For my part, I read only to please myself. I like only that which serves my purpose.\\"We are seriously considering making this the new motto of The Book Maniac.Some believe that long books can only be the work of great authors, but in reality, if an author is really great, he will be able to convey his message and leave a long-lasting memory of his work without wasting a single word. \\"Candide or, the Optimist\\", an all-time masterpiece, is less than 100 pages and our unanimous opinion was that this is the literary work with the richest and most exquisite use of language we have ever read. Considering we read the English translation, we can only imagine how incredible the French version must be.This was a review of the PDF belonging to the Electronic Classics Series by the Pennsylvania State University.

The only thing left is \`cultivate our garden.'This is a cowardly, selfish non-solution, to use Voltaire's own terms. Closing one's eyes for the realities of this world should not be an option.But how did Voltaire cultivate his garden? He profited handsomely from the slave trade. He even agreed that a ship for slave transport was named after him!

Throughout the book, in a comical, witty, and grotesque way, Candide, finds himself questioning whether that principle is really true, as it seems, things may really be for the worst. But, Candide being so naive and idolizing of his teacher, Dr. Pangloss, the man who taught him the philosophy, persistenly believes and defends it; although, it is clear by the events in the book that it is false."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"Voltaire's book, originally published in 1759, is a classic of world literature. At face value, it is an allegorical attack in the belief on progress of its age, but I think it is much more than that. With a plot similar to that of a picaresque novel, it tells the story of Candide, a nave young man taught by Dr. Plangloss (\\"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds\\") on Leibnizian optimism. Several misfortunes forces him to go on a journey throughout the world (among the lands he travels, very breezily, are his native Germany, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, South America, France, England, Venice and the Ottoman Empire). Through the book, the main purpose of his life is to meet his beloved Cunegonde, a friend of his childhood who seems to have been through as much misfortunes as him. The novel attacks not only the religious intolerance of the day, but European colonialism, and institutions then considered natural by most people, like slavery (when he meets an African slave in the Dutch colony in Surinam, the black man wonders why if the Dutch preachers tell him that all men are brothers, some peoples rule over others). In a Rousseau-like touch, the place most happy to him seems to be a place in South America, where the natives have found a shelter from the European conquistadors, and where gold is considered valueless mud. And despite being almost 250 years old, the book is very accessible (at least in the translation I have read)."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"I decided to read this book after watching its broadway rendition, and I have to say that it truly surprised me.

It is a very short book, and although I wanted more at the end, it was nice, fresh and held my attention throughout."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"This is a hilarious romp through the 18th century world that Voltaire knew. This book provided him to make fun of the intellectuals of the day (cannibals who only eat Jesuits) the politics of Europe and the social mores of the elite. His characters include the noble Candide who combines his good heart with his reliance of Gilgamesh like helpers in order to succeed. His hero worship for Dr. Pangloss, the Rasputin like philosopher (and later Martin) bailed him out of some situations but perhaps more importantly his lesser, Cacambo saved his life. All of the fantastic adventures that Candide experienced were all designed to reunite him with his true love Cunegonde.Many years later, Upton Sinclair wrote a \\"Candide\\" like, utopian socialist fantasy novel, Metropolis that I was reminded of while reading this novel."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"As a rule I don't recap the plot of books because I don't want to ruin anything for anyone, but for this one I will make a slight exception. Candide is a naive young man who lives in paradise worshiping his one true love, a princess at the castle in which he resides. The cruel world comes in and sends him on a trip of horrors that would make what Job went through seem like a blister. Fast moving, exciting and funny as a great novel can be.This book can be read as a fun tale of misfortune and woe, or it can be read as a deep philosophical tale. Which is why the book is brilliant, it works on many different levels. Actually, it works on every level, which is why I recommend it to everyone who claims that they love to read. The humor is biting and hilarious, which is why it is the greatest satire ever written, even if the object of the satire has long since died.I do want to point out one thing, and it won't ruin the ending, because the ending isn't as important as the journey. Many people see this novel as an unabashed, full on assault on optimism. It isn't. Read the ending again. In the end things work out for the main characters, just not in the way they could have ever imagined in the beginning.

When their love is discovered, Candide is expelled from his home, and the fun starts. The entire novel is then consumed with tongue-in-cheek melodrama of Candide's worldwide attempt to find and marry Cunegonde, who is, of course, constantly on the move.Early on in the story we realize that the important aspects of Voltaire's novel are not the plot's details but the higher themes: the \\"real-world\\" tragedy which disproves Pangloss' initial optimistic teachings, the hypocrisy of the day's religious theologians, and the inability of money to solve problems.

Voltaire knew suffering. He had been imprisoned in the Bastille. He meditated on calamities, earthquakes in Lisbon and in Lima. CANDIDE was publshed in 1759. Voltaire emphasizes the resilience of human nature. Finally, there is characterized the uselessness of metaphysical speculation and the value of work.Candid was granted a pardon from the King of the Bulgars because he was a philosopher. He encountered a charitable Anabaptist in Holland. In South America the lovely Cunegonde's, the woman of Candide's dream, brother appeared as a Jesuit. Candide had learned from their tutor Pangloss that he was deceased. The Jesuit Baron became angry with Candide because he wanted to marry his sister and then Candide had to kill him in self-defense. Subsequently Candide's life was spared because he was not a Jesuit. Candide and his servant, Cacambo, traveled to El Dorado. They left to find Cunegonde and ran into a sugar plantation.Candide embarked with an old man, the scholar Martin, for Bordeaux. Candide had the hope of seeing Cunegonde again. Candide went to Paris. He spent an evening gambling, and did not mind his losses, and so was taken as one of the English milords. Candide and Martin, through a series of events, were taken to lower Normandy to save their lives. Their ship went to Portsmouth, England. At length they reached Venice. Candide was reunited with his servant.The party went to Constantinople. First Candide bought Cacambo his freedom. Pangloss and Cunegonde's brother, the Baron, were found alive as galley slaves and their freedom was purchased. Cunegonde was found working in the kitchen of the Price of Transylvania.

Candide is a young man who is deeply in love with the baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh's daughter, Cunegonde. Although, the baron and his son will never aprove of their love Candide will always hold her love close to him. Candide is tricked throughout the novel and taken advantage of many times. He lives with the many philosphical points of his teacher, Pangloss. Candide doubts Pangloss' theorys throughout the novel, and decides what his own theory's are by observing people and through his many interactions that he encounters.

Optimism in the 18th century did not have the same meaning as it does today. Back then, it was the belief that ours is the best of all possible worlds, since it is G-d's world and G-d is perfect. Voltaire takes a naive adherent to this belief and exposes him to the horrors of the world: war, enslavement, theft, rape, heartbreak, etc. Not only does Candide experience these things himself but he hears everyone else bemoaning their situations. Perhaps the crushing blow is when Candide accidentally discovers the paradise of El Dorado, only to willingly leave and face the problems of the real world yet again.I will not reveal how the story ends, but I liked how it turned out. In my opinion, Voltaire does a good job of criticizing optimism, and he isn't afraid to take some more personal cuts at some of his philisophical opponents. The beauty of this story is that Voltaire accomplishes most of it through humor. Undoubtably it would have been funnier to an 18th century reader (I did not understand many of the religious references--and I still don't know what the Jesuits believe in) but I think I got most of the jokes.So, all in all, I give this a 4/5 for a story that still has value today."},{"Title":"Candide and Other Writings","review":"I had to read this book for english class. at first, i thought it would another one of those hard to read boring classics.

Voltaire has here written a gem of a story from the unpromising material of cynicism and farce. Don't try this at home -- apart from genius, it will fall flat -- but Candide ripples with wit.Leibnetz, it is true, is hardly a household name today. But I expect Candide was also meant to be a sword-thrust into the soft underbelly of theism, the \\"Problem of Pain.\\" While orthodox Christians do not claim this to be the \\"best of all possible worlds\\" (rather, a fallen one), the chaotic and apparently senseless troubles in it seem to a lot of us, too, to be the best argument against our faith. Voltaire twists the knife well. I was glad to see that though he excels, and delights, in mockery, the story functions ultimately as what may be an honest question, like that of Job or of Solomon. (In fact, ironically, the book Candide most reminds me of is Ecclesiastes.)In one regard, at least, Candide is less true to life than the Biblical point of view, however. Thousands die here, but no one is begotten. The insanity of life is celebrated to the full, but its beauty and wonder are not squarely faced. The one-sidedness of Voltaire's approach lessens it as a work of philosophy, in my opinion. I couldn't help but reflect that many in the 20th Century went into the hell-holes of communist prisons, where every horror Candide and his friends experienced occurred, and more (the atheists of the 20th Century were also, in their own ways, ingenious), yet emerged with a strong belief in God. (Even some, like Solzhenitsyn, who went in as atheists.) Why is that? Philosophy, it seems to me, needs to face all sides of a question. This Voltaire hardly pretends to do: the book is a question, not an answer. But as satire on premature answers, it sizzles.If all Voltaire's books contain cannabalism, libel, bestiality, and philosophical arguments based on slapstick humor, I can hardly blame the authorities for burning them. Being something of a Puritan myself, I docked Voltaire a star.

In fact, it may be more relevant now than at any time since Voltaire wrote it in the mid-1700s.What happens to Candide, Pangloss and all the other main characters in the novel is cruelly absurd. Real life itself, as we can all testify from personal experience, is often just as capricious, nonsensical and painful as the landscape through which Candide moves.And make no mistake -- this is a novel of movement: movement about the globe, movement up and down the social ladder, movement toward utopia and away, movement toward wisdom hard-won through experience. Voltaire has taken a common-place 16th Century literary form, the picaresque novel, and breathed new life into it. His aim is far higher than the genre's typical morality. In traditional picaresque novels, the hero -- the &quot;picaro&quot; (the genre is Spanish in origin)-- learns through a series of misadventures his place in the grand scheme of things, usually on the underbelly of the society in which he lives.Candide and Company range far and wide through a myriad of societies, including an Andean utopia, finding no permanent place. Only when they settle on the Propontus in Turkey and settle down as a family, not of blood ties, but of mutual suffering and experience, do they create a space for themselves.The novel's oft-quoted ending, which has Candide espousing the virtues of tending to one's own garden, is far more than a call to Protestant simplicity and self-denial. The garden Candide and his friends cultivate is a poor recreation of the original garden, the Garden of Eden. But it is theirs, won through misadventure, pain and suffering. Relentlessly pessimistic throughout the novel about the natural state of mankind, Voltaire hints at an optimism in the end, the possibility that the downtrodden can redeem themselves.This is a fun romp for high school readers and college undergrads will enjoy the overt sexual references scattered throughout. For their teachers, Candide offers the opportunity to show their students that we can all persevere and tend to our own gardens, if we can but recognize the claim of humanity we have upon each other.

For answering such a question, I would have to waste the pages of a little essay, but if you want a short response, there it goes, whomever is not drowned on the best-seller trash of our comtemporary times will get the point: If thee think Candide's philosophical, historical and sociological analyses are as small as the book, thee haven't understood the story, or better saying, never really read it; If you just laugh at the sufferings of the characters, remember laughing is one of the best ways for showing much of the human misery, and so,realize about what you smiled at, if it was not at yourself. I won't write much more, READ the Candide and, as Italo Calvino said, have this &quot;moving picture of the velocity&quot; on your hands, a book destined for immortality, as his writer and maker, who once said: &quot;to write is to act&quot;.

Primarily a happy gay love story, it's as much about mother love, coming of age and having something special of your own in a tough world.The basic story is the same as the film screenplay (but without scenes away from the appartment block). There are some really affecting lines in the play which didn't make it to the film (like when Jamie describes to Tony how one of Sandra's former boyfriends beat her up).If you've heard good things about &quot;Beautiful Thing&quot; but haven't seen it yet then I'd recommend seeing the movie before reading the stageplay (or screenplay).

I'm a programmer of some 20 years experience, but quite new to Acrobat forms, so I was hoping for a concise description of the specific details. There is certainly much useful information in the book, and it's more approachable than Adobe's Javascript specifications. I did work through the entire book, but found the sheer amount of extremely basic material to be frustrating and distracting. The assumption seems to be that the reader has zero prior programming experience (although, in that case, the discussion of Javascript's object-oriented design seems remarkably skimpy). Much of the information seems more suited to a general &quot;Programming 101&quot; course. For example, in the second half of Chapter 5, we meet the revelation that it's better to use global variables than fixed constants. Similarly, the topic of functions isn't introduced until Chapter 14. In summary then, I obtained much useful information from the book, but was frustrated by the plodding, linear pace of parts. It would have helped me a lot if the author had used some way of distinguishing the &quot;beginning programmer&quot; material from the Adobe-specific information."},{"Title":"Extending Acrobat Forms with JavaScript","review":"I have been making forms in Acrobat since version 3.0, and have a background in Dbase III, Foxpro, Visual Basic .NET, and SQL 2000. However, I never learned Javascript formally or in-depth.This book was an excellent springboard to a good working knowledge of JavaScript, especially relating to Acrobat. The chapters are broken down by functionality and increase in complexity, and each has at least one project that the author will guide you step-by-step (you can download the PDF's from the author's website). The book was edited very well, I found only one mistake (a typo) after reading the book almost page for page. What makes this an outstanding book is the clarity of the examples and explanations the author has so obviously spent much time on to help us \\"poor newbies\\".My focus was how to get started interacting with databases (SQL or Access), and while the first Chapter (16) was review for people familiar with databases, Chapter 17 really got me started. The project in the book gives the basics -- to go beyond, you need the following resources: the Acrobat JavaScript Scripting Reference and the Scripting Guide (...).Developers know that the devil is in the detail, so once I got past the database interface hurdle, the other chapters were just as useful to put the necessary finishing touches on my project.Here's the bottom line: If you are already advanced in your knowledge of JavaScript, this isn't your book! You know enough to pick up the Acrobat JavaScript Reference and figure it out. If you're just starting out or need to know, in detail, what capabilities Acrobat and JavaScript can give you for an IT solution, this book is an excellent resource.One last thing that makes the author of the book outstanding: He has a free newsletter for those looking for better ways of utilizing Acrobat (...)"},{"Title":"Extending Acrobat Forms with JavaScript","review":"I have been reading various guides including the Acrobat JavaScript Object Specifications and I was having the hardest time to perform the most simple tasks (I mean the ones not available in the software) such as &quot;spawning&quot; pages and working with templates, validating or formatting my forms; I was this close to giving up and have a programmer do it for me (I am a graphic designer) and I ordered this book.

Howard Colby Ives became a prominent Bahai. I feel that this book is a must read, and a book that I read as I was deciding to become a Baha'i.

This very personal book will pierce your soul."},{"Title":"Portals to freedom","review":"Portals to FreedomBook ReviewPortals to Freedomby Howard Colby IvesGeorge Ronald, Oxford 1947.When I first came upon this book in the Amazon listing, I expected a new work by an author new to me, and thus a fresh look at a subject as old as time itself. To find that it was first published in 1947 was surprising indeed in this world of instant gratification and \\"What's New?\\"The author was a Christian Unitarian Minister whose relatively sheltered life was thrown into turmoil through having met numerous times with 'Abdu'l-Baha, a charismatic gentleman of Persian descent who visited the United States in 1912. Of this visit, George Ronald, the original publisher of Portals to Freedom, remarked that \\"...If the claims of the Baha'i Faith have any reality, the story which it tells may well come to be regarded as the most significant and outstanding event in American history.\\" Howard Ives' story is historical, a one-of-a-kind taste of an unusual and arresting overview of what might well have occurred to a few individuals during the Life of Jesus. That Ives was a \\"man of the cloth\\" frames the story in an unique light. I was reminded of the lines from Robert Frost's, The Road Not Taken: \\"...I took the road less traveled by, and that has made all the difference...\\"In view of my having noted the steadily increasing influence of those claims to which Mr. Ronald referred, not only in the \\"Old World\\" but in the New as evidenced in the West, I borrowed a copy of the book from my local library, read it from cover to cover, and knew I had to have a copy of my own. My \\"fresh look\\" expectation was indeed there, rendering timeless the message inferred therein given to all and sundry: \\"A new world order is come.\\"The author's story begins in the years leading to World War I in which he sees a crumbling of beliefs in God and human morals. He says of his first meeting with 'Abdu'l-Baha, \\"...A new and exquisite emotion all but mastered me. My throat swelled. My eyes filled. I could not have spoken had life depended on a word... That is all. But life has never been quite the same since.\\" His adventures from that time until his final talk with 'Abdu'l-Baha aboard the ship S. S. Celtic which was to return him to the Holy Land, are of the most remarkable nature and substance. The writing is beautifully descriptive and carries in its wording an humble flair for simplicity that sets it apart from fiction or faction in the modern Western sense. I can see readily why Portals to Freedom was deemed worthy of repeated printings even in today's late date and in the face of popular demand for greater and greater elaboration of human foibles - this is a quiet but gripping account of a Christian Minister who met and talked with a man of simple greatness that spoke to his soul.No doubt in the interests of producing a book for low cost the publisher mentions among the opening pages that a photo of the person the author met belongs on that page, but instead lists only his name and the date the photo had been taken. By the magic of today's instant world wide internet one has but to enter the search command \\"Abdul Baha photo\\" into the Google search box and four views of him appears on the screen.. (A translation of the Persian words of his name/title is \\"Servant of The Glory.\\") I was struck by how similar his likeness seems to various artist's renderings of how Jesus might have appeared to those in His audience. I quote at length from the author's introduction: \\"...To those bred in the Christian tradition one might ask what would be the probable effect upon them if they could have been among the audience when the Sermon on the Mount was spoken, or if one of them, like John, could have reclined upon the breast of the Master. Without daring to suggest that the comparison is parallel, my own experience when brought into close association with 'Abdu'l-Baha', was so overwhelming, so fraught with sensations suggesting an entrance into a new and super-mundane world, that I can think of no other comparison more adequate.\\"I now own my own copy of Portals to Freedom!.--Waldo T. Boyd, reviewer."},{"Title":"Portals to freedom","review":"This is one of my favorite Baha'i books. A touching story of one man's spiritual search and discovery.Portals to Freedom, is the story of Howard Colby Ives who, in 1911 was a minister in a Unitarian Church in New York. His already fragile belief in God was challenged by his encounter with the new Baha'i teachings until 'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; arrived in New York in April 1912. Colby Ives's encounters with \`Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; profoundly altered the course of his life. He became a devoted Bah&aacute;'&iacute;, and in 1937, published Portals to Freedom, an intimate memoir of his days in the presence of \`The Master'."},{"Title":"Portals to freedom","review":"This book is a deeply intimate and emotional account of how one man, earnestly seeking truth and meaning his whole adult life, was spiritually reborn after meeting Abdu'l-Baha.Some of you may be fans of the \\"The Power of Now\\" by Eckhart Tolle.

I love to buy from Amazon because the price is usually decent and it saves an old person lots of running around."},{"Title":"Nessus, Snort, and Ethereal Power Tools","review":"I've read and reviewed the three previous books in Jay Beale's Open Source Security Series -- Snort 2.1, Nessus Network Auditing, and Ethereal Packet Sniffing. I liked all three of those books, and I'm glad to say that this fourth book -- Nessus, Snort, and Ethereal Power Tools (NSAEPT), is a worthy continuation of Jay's series. NSAEPT is a unique resource for anyone who wants to extend Nessus, Snort, and Ethereal. The book could save programmers hours of work, and it should be the first step for those looking to contribute to the development of all three projects.It's unfortunate that an uninformed three star review has been the only commentary on NSAEPT until now. Of course the book is not for beginners! Why write another introductory book, when the three earlier titles serve that role (and more)? NSAEPT is strong precisely because it starts where the other three books end.I learned quite a bit reading NSAEPT. For example, Part I shared advice on using Nessus to audit hosts directly, by examining Windows registry keys, package databases, or Windows PE files (.exe, .dll) directly. I appreciated the discussion of creating NASL checks that were more protocol-aware (for MySQL) or that could speak NTLM authentication to IIS Web servers. Ch 6 even gave tips on building NASL generators.Part II, covering Snort, gave better advice on writing Snort rules than what was found in the earlier Snort 2.1 book. I thought this part was the weakest of the three, however. I would have liked to have seen many more examples of using advanced Snort rule options. Table 8.10 should have said that the + flag means \\"match on the specified flags, and allow any other flags.\\" Also, I thought the author miscommunicated the purpose of the stream4 preprocessor when he mentioned dropping UDP and ICMP traffic. That's an issue when running inline, not passively as most people use Snort.I really liked Part III, which examined Ethereal. Ch 11 offered great guidance on reverse engineering an unknown trace format, namely iptrace from AIX 3. Ch 12 mentioned an undocumented tethereal flag (-G) that was new to me. I enjoyed learning about tap modules in Ch 13, and I did not know that Ethereal uses the wiretap library to read traces -- not libpcap.I subtracted one star from my review for a few reasons. First, NSAEPT features some really annoying formatting problems in many of the code listings. Every place the characters \\"FI\\" (any case) appear, they are changed into a single nonsensical character. I stopped counting the number of times this happened. For example, where one should read \\"Filename\\", we see instead \\"Xlename\\". The same seems to have happened with \\"FL\\"; e.g., \\"Flags\\" becomes \\"Xags\\". The reference to libpcap and \\"Chapter 1\\" on p 159 should instead point to Ch 11. I thought the inclusion of material from Brian Wotring's Host Integrity Monitoring book as Appendix A was unnecessary. Brian's book is great, but I don't think readers need 30 pages from another title. Is that just padding?Format-wise, NSAEPT features smaller fonts than one sees in more recent Syngress books. I thought the font was a little small, but in some ways an improvement over the jumbo text seen elsewhere. I also thought the paper used to print NSAEPT was much better than other titles. Compare NSAEPT with another 440 page Syngress book, Securing IM and P2P Applications for the Enterprise, and you'll see the latter book is much thicker.Overall I recommend NSAEPT to anyone who wishes to do more with Nessus, Snort, or Ethereal. NSAEPT is definitely a book for power users and developers. It's great to see a new book that starts with original material and avoids rehashing what's already been written."},{"Title":"Nessus, Snort, and Ethereal Power Tools","review":"Although this is a good book with valuable information, I think it is a bit vague and short. A good idea is to get 3 different books on their respective topics. Nessus and snort have nothing to do with eachother and snort is more powerful than Ethereal.

It pulls together in one place the information that it would take a lot of searching on the web to pull out.However, because the author also runs one of the affiliate web sites, he is very light on talking about the services that are competitive to his AdNet business. (AdNet is the publisher of the book.) The case histories he discusses are somewhat detailed -- but they are OLD -- from 1998 or so, and the world has changed since then.

The writing is quintessential Faulkner, with all particularities of southern dialect and narrative that tries to stay close to the protagonists' mental musings. The story is remarkable and intriguing in that the interpersonal relations between different characters aren neither predictable nor straightforward. In particular it eschews facile delineation between various parties in the war, and no individual fits into a stereotypical category. Sometimes the closest friendships are between those who should be the worst of enemies, and at other occasions those whom you regarded to be close confidants that in the end betray you. These are in fact all too familiar circumstances in most of our lives and in all generations. It's what makes Faulkner's novels so timeless and valuable to read."},{"Title":"Big Band Sound","review":"The illustrations in this book were first to catch my attention.

I was \\"stopped in my tracks\\" the first time I saw the inspiring work of this magnificient Artist.While I have many books on these subjects in my personal library of over 7000 books;there are none that can compare with the Art of Doolittle in combining all these things in her Paintings.Many times ,all at the same time.This short book, of only 32 pages, does an excellent job of showing the greatness of her Art and explaining what she and her Art is all about. It would be easy to pass this book off as something just for young readers;which it certainly is.However;that would be to sell it short. This book ,just as well introduces her Art to adults,both those who are new to appreciating the wonders of nature and the inspiration conveyed thtough art;as it is to those who have already acquired a love and appreciation for it all.What you will find in this book is a brief sampling of her art which can be found in her other books;particularly \\"The Art of Bev Doolittle\\" and \\"Bev Doolittle New Magic\\" .The latter ,I wrote a Review of on November 5,2003.Just like in the real world of nature ,there is always much more to see and experience when one knows what to look for and how to look for it .Bev's paintings are likewise ,much more than what immediately comes to the viewer. Take the Painting on the cover of this book for instance..It is titled \\"Wolf\\".It is much more than just a paw print in the snow.\\"Seeing\\" rather than a simple \\"look\\" or \\"glnce\\",results in the head of a wolf appearing...and a little more study,exposes the complete body of this wonderful creature of nature. Bev's Art has a lot of \\"hidden\\" images within it,just as does nature in real life,if one only takes the time to see.Elsie Maclay adds a lot to Bev's Art by explaining how to go about \\"seeing\\" that which is often missed and not experienced.If you have ever sat quietly in the woods,and finally noticed that animal,a deer,a snake,an owl,a raccoon,or even an insect, that has been deathly still watching you,come into view;you'll appreciate what I mean and begin to understand what Bev's Art is all about.If Bev's Art is new to you;a search of the net under her name will produce excellent examples of her Art."},{"Title":"Reading the Wild","review":"This book is a great tool to use to assist in having a different perspective.

The parable touches on personal dedication, patience, the chance of ecological redemption, and ironies introduced when the loner comes to the authorities' attention. The pace seems Zen-like, even monastic, as the speaker touches The Man's life at intervals of years.McCurdy's woodcuts complement the story perfectly, with gently elegant renderings of some selected moments from it. The images' black and white simplicity reinforces the simple life of The Man and the understated character of the writing.But, despite the words and images coming across in such a low-key way, I found the story deeply moving.

This is a book that should be read by many. It was written many years ago but will always be timeless. It should be in school libraries for young people to read, learn from and do.It begins when a young man is hiking in a barren area that is bleak and desolate. It is so bleak and depressing that few people live here. The young man, badly in need of a drink of water, keeps walking, then meets a man, a sheepherder, who gives him a drink of well water, cold and delicious and invites him to have supper, then stay overnight. The home is well kept up, the food is good, the shepherd dresses neatly and with care. This man is so much different than the rough, coarse mountain people in the area. He takes pride in himself and his surroundings.Elzeard Boulfier is 55 and picks out acorns to be planted and hopes they will grow into large trees.He is improving his environment. He once had a farm away from this area, but since his son, then his wife died, he felt he needed solitude with his sheep and his best friend, his dog.Years pass. The oaks are growing tall, Elzeard has given up sheephearding. The sheep would eat his young trees. He has become a beekeeper and has many hives.The forest grows, the beeskeep is also planting beech trees. Nature becomes helpful, brooks begin running, the wind scatters seed.

This is not one of them. Perhaps because Giono based this (albeit loosely) on my American hero, Johnny Appleseed, I love even more. It makes a wonderful gift that can be read over and over again. It never gets old.

His efforts alone--just out of love for planting trees--brings back life and energy to the small town of Provence.As author Jean Giono states, the moral message of this story is \\"to make people love the tree, or more precisely, to make people love planting trees.\\" Norma L. Goodrich's Afterword is a brief and interesting account of Giono--a man much respected and admired. Also included in this edition is educational material about forest protection and preservation. Michael McCurdy's wood engravings are an enriching addition to the book as well; they are charming illustrations, which depict Giono's descriptive scenes beautifully!You don't necessarily have to buy the book to read it, because you can very well finish it while lounging in the bookstore. Also, as one reviewer has previously mentioned, there are free readings of it available online.

Tolkein.In 'The Man Who Planted Trees' by Jean Giono we are introduced to a mysterious character called Elzeard Bouffier, leading a solitary existence in a desolate part of Southern France. In the arid, forlorn mountains of Provence Bouffier lives like a Biblical character with his small dog and herd of sheep, yet he has an agenda that is far-reaching; to plant acorns and bring life back to the surrounding desert.With almost realistic flair combined with poetic resonance Jean Giono paints a landscape that undergoes a gradual but beautiful transformation into a modern day garden of Eden. His primary intention in writing this small book was to invite readers into 'loving and planting trees' for the common good and future generations. This ecologically inspired motive is easily translated as something which can reverse the modern trend in global warming, to replenish the most important assets of our precious earth, and pave the way for a richer and greener future.The text is accompanied by wood engravings by Michael McCurdy; deep, evocative and earthy illustrations which match the broad significance of the text. Combined they present a complete 'tour de force' in fictional literature, spanning the gap between what we might imagine to be real and that which is actually occurring beneath our technologically focused minds. Truly inspiration for change, and reminiscent of the 'Lorax' by Dr. Seuss!"},{"Title":"The Man Who Planted Trees: A Story Jean Giono","review":"Read it in 30 minutes.

Jean Giorno wrote this parable gratis, for the benefit of future generations. Like the saintly character of this tale, Elzeard Bouffier, Giorno's motive was guided by selfless generosity.Starting with nothing but a handful of acorns, in a barren world devoid of hope, Bouffier produces a forested paradise that becomes a nature preserve four decades later. This story is like poetry in slow motion; a French version of America's Johnny Appleseed if you will.This engaging tale is about the powers of regeneration, of leaving a legacy for the generations that follow along after one's own life. It is a call to be active in renewing the world, whatever endeavors one may be involved with. This is truly a shining example of how selfless engagement can make a tremendous difference, even when and where hopelessness reigns.The wood engravings by Michael McCurdy that serve as illustrations in this little book are stunning in their stark beauty; they compliment the tightly coiled message in the words very effectively.Most highly recommended for all who care about those coming up behind.ParataxisThe Cloud ReckonerExtracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts"},{"Title":"The Man Who Planted Trees: A Story Jean Giono","review":"What a book.

Over a period of three decades, Elz&eacute;ard Bouffier, a Frenchman finding himself widowed and alone in a barren and desolate region of France, began to transform the area through the simple act of collecting and sorting acorns, and then planting one hundred of the most propitious-appearing acorns each day. It was a task of solitude and almost religious solemnity, taking place totally outside the view of others. Over time, Bouffier transformed the region, making it once again a hospitable place. Many years after the start of Bouffier's work, people - including foresters - marveled at what they \\"had missed,\\" totally unaware that this was the life's work of a single human being.Almost anyone could have narrated this simple tale of regeneration with effectiveness.

Bouffier's planting of thousands and thousands of trees results in many wondrous things occurring, including water again flowing in brooks that had been dry for many years. The brooks are fed by rains and snows that are conserved by the forest that Bouffier planted. The harsh, barren land is now pleasant and full of life.Written by Jean Giono, this popular story of inspiration and hope was originally published in 1954 in Vogue as \\"The Man Who Planted Hope and Grew Happiness.\\" The story's opening paragraph is as follows:\\"For a human character to reveal truly exceptional qualities, one must have the good fortune to be able to observe its performance over many years. If this performance is devoid of all egoism, if its guiding motive is unparalleled generosity, if it is absolutely certain that there is no thought of recompense and that, in addition, it has left its visible mark upon the earth, then there can be no mistake.\\"The Man Who Planted Trees has left a \\"visible mark upon the earth\\" having been translated into several languages. In the \\"Afterword\\" of the Chelsea Green Publishing Company's edition, Norma L. Goodrich wrote that Giono donated his story. According to Goodrich, \\"Giono believed he left his mark on earth when he wrote Elzeard Bouffier's story because he gave it away for the good of others, heedless of payment: \`It was one of my stories of which I am the proudest. It does not bring me in one single penny and that is why it has accomplished what it was written for.'\\"This special edition is very informative. Not only does it contain Giono's inspirational story, which is complemented beautifully by Michael McCurdy's wood engraving illustrations and Goodrich's informative \\"Afterword\\" about Giono, but it also contains considerable information about how wood and paper can be conserved in the section \\"The WoodWise Consumer.\\" Goodrich writes about Giono's effort to have people respect trees.\\"Giono later wrote an American admirer of the tale that his purpose in creating Bouffier \`was to make people love the tree, or more precisely, to make them love planting trees.' Within a few years the story of Elzeard Bouffier swept around the world and was translated into at least a dozen languages. It has long since inspired reforestation efforts, worldwide.\\"The Man Who Planted Trees is not only a wonderful story, it will inspire you and your children to care for the natural world.-Reviewed by N.

I found the book extremely inspiring.The interesting thing is that there indeed are unsung heroes and heroines in many parts of the world who do do such inspiring work without thought of reward.Some months back I read in Indian newspapers about a poor couple in the Karnatak state of India who decided to plant trees to assuage their sorrow in being childless.As they had no land of their own they decided to plant trees on the roadside.And ended up with magnificent avenue trees on miles and miles of the road near their village.

They define us like our most vivid memories do. Not many books or stories deserve that kind of devotion, but this one does. It isn't timeless - it's deeply rooted in 20th century France - but its honest treatment of the time and place is one of the things that makes it universal.There are dozens of facets that could be highlighted in a review, but the one I find most compelling is Giono's treatment of a man alone and how he is yet connected to the world around him. Even a solitary figure can contribute to the birth and health of a community. It's not clear why he does his work, but it's clear that the work is good.There is such hope here, but no easy palliative.

It's the story of a shepherd who plants trees over many years, slowly transforming his barren part of the world into a flourishing fecund forest during the years of the First and Second World Wars. And despite the destruction the trees remain. The message - man's capacity for creation is as great, if not greater, than his own for destruction. And godlike acts can be done by anybody, even an uneducated shepherd.A fine message I agree, and with strong environmental imagery this is something many people have latched onto as literature for people who care about nature. Sure, except...Except it's a short story not a book. If you took away the large font and the page long woodcuts (though they are an excellent addition) and put the story into a regular font on regular sized paper (the paper used here is especially small) you'd wind up with a story maybe half a dozen pages long.And the story is especially simple. Man plants trees, trees grow, man dies. The end. The writing is ok but not spectacular, nor is the story especially memorable. Really it's just a very average short story that nonetheless has become something of a popular classic because of it's accessibility and positive message.\\"The Man Who Planted Trees\\" is not the best read nor as profound as others would have you believe and is one of the few books I've read where I've found just reading the title would have told me everything about the book without having to read it."},{"Title":"Keeping Warm: A Sensible Guide to Heat Conservation","review":"I picked this off of a library shelf merely on the merits of the title, and was pleasantly surprised at how readable and fun this book was.

Good practical information, but also ample amounts of philosophical rumination (almost all of which I happen to agree with).Primarily concerned with retrofitting older houses in the New England area, although the ideas and concepts apply to any cold weather climate.Read this book on a cold night, next to a crackling fire, and have a hot drink at hand."},{"Title":"The Case of the Haunted Husband","review":"This case is one of the most convoluted of the Perry Mason series by Gardner. After I finished it, it was not quite clear to me who exactly did what. It begins with an attractive female (Stephane) quitting her job and hitchhiking to another, she is picked up by a man in a tuxedo who offers her a drink and then tries to do more. When she resists, the car is involved in a fatal accident and Stephane is charged with vehicular manslaughter. One of Stephane's friends asks Perry Mason to take her case and although it is out of his normal mode, he agrees to do so.The case quickly becomes one familiar to Mason as one of the key players is murdered, leading to the involvement of Lieutenant Tragg. The best part of this book is when Mason and Tragg find common cause, even to the point where Mason, Della Street, Tragg and Paul Drake go out to dinner together and Tragg dances with Della. When Mason and Tragg verbally spar, probing each other for information, it is clear that both men do respect each other personally and that respect transcends their natural adversarial roles.The agreement between Tragg and Mason to cooperate is a refreshing aspect of this story, as Gardner so often portrays Mason's adversaries as self-serving stooges that never seem to learn from their failures and Mason's successes. In this case, Tragg is depicted as an intelligent and competent officer just trying to do his duty and see justice served."},{"Title":"The Case of the Haunted Husband","review":"The Case of the Haunted HusbandStephane Clair quits her job as a hat check girl, and hitch-hikes to Los Angeles.

I immediately felt attached to this \\"family\\" of children trying to survive in the aftermath of a plague-like \\"Fire-Us\\" that killed off all the adults and was completely caught up in their struggles and hopes. It's a story so absorbing it's tempting to read the book in one sitting. The book, however late it keeps you up, is not only a page-turner, but a richly imagined account of a world that is somehow recognizably ours even as it has been made strange and often menacing. The Kindling plays on the fantasy all children have of being in charge of the world (there's something thrilling about the idea of scavenging for food and salvage in the unpeopled strip malls and abandoned houses of post-apocalypse America without adults to supervise or set rules even as such \\"hunting\\" (as it's called in the book) is a life-and-death necessity for these kids), but given the damaged landcape and psychologically scarred inheritors of this world, that fantasy is turned here to something perilous and completely absorbing. That the authors have made this world so strange, familiar, and utterly convincing is a testament to their fine prose and deep powers of imagination. We care about the way their characters must face this world and themselves in order to survive and when they take to the road in search of answers, we go with them, attuned to their every action and nearly breathless for their survival and success. I can't wait for part two!"},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"A small band of children in Florida are trying to scrape up a living in a burnt out dead town. A plaugue (nuclear holocaust, diesease....whatever) killed the adults on the planet which indirectly lead to the death of nearly all the children as well. These 7 children (the oldest being 17) are fighting to make a living when a strange teenager (around 15) appears on the doorstep.He calls himself \\"the Anchorman\\" and intices the children into a wild journey to find a man named \\"President\\" (kinda corny dontcha think?). The journey is laced with strange happenings and interesting appearences but has a killer cliffhanger at the end.This book could have been very good, but was far too wordy. It spent far too much time trying to make stories, rather than developing the characters and the plot. On the hole, a rather disappointing start to a series. This review is by a 15 year old avid reader........who is definitely not impressed."},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The Kindling(2002). Jennifer Armstrong and Nancy Butcher's First Novel Collaboration, and the First Novel In The &quot;Fire-Us&quot; Series.In my predictable Summer Reading List chockful of big-name authors, I saw 'The Kindling', a novel I'd never heard of, so I decided to give it a chance. Like so many novels before it, 'The Kindling' chronicles the after-affects of the End of the World, may it be by Nuclear War or Plague, and we find the lone survivors banding together to remake Human Civilization. But, the question arises, does 'The Kindling' offer anything new to the table, or is a rehashed 'End of the World' novel we've already read twice before? Read on to find out!Plot-In 2007, In Lazarus, Florida, 7 survivors dwell in the aftermath of the 'Fire-Us' plague. 'Fire-Us' wiped out all the adults on Earth, and the kids, left alone and neglected, mostly died out without supervision, but a select few banded together and learned to survive without Electricity and everyday appliances. We meet Mother and Teacher, two teenage girls who look after the little children such as Doll, Baby, Teddy Bear. Also, Action Figure and Hunter hunt down food and water for the sole survivors. For five years, the young group of children have survived on their own, leading a predictable life of feasting off of old supermarkets and the land, but their food supply is running low. But,just as their about to start really worring about their supplies,a knock on their door will change everything, and the person behind the door will take them on a journey that will test their strength and their friendship.Writing/Opinion/Etc.-'The Kindling', while following the basic approach to 'End of the World' novels, has some individuality because it uses children instead of adults, and Armstrong/Butcher's take on a child's reaction and interaction with a destroyed world is quite interesting. The writing here is pretty straightforward, with getting the story out being more of interest to the author's than writing techniques, but that's fine since this is a book for Young Adult's anyways. Also, the authors did a great job of fleshing out the characters, and the reader learns to love the characters, and it's quite addictive to follow them on their quest. My only problem with the novel is that it doesn't really pick up until about 100 pages in, and the first few pages don't seem quite as well-written, but once you get past that, it's an enthralling read from start to finish, and I'd be interested in reading the other books since this one leaves you at a rather big climax.Overall, 'The Kindling' is a solid read for Teens and Children(Over 8), and it's one of those popcorn novels, that reads like a movie, and ends with you on the edge of your seat. I'm encouraged to read the other novels in the 'Fire-Us' series, because the climax you're left at almost forces the reader to!RECOMMENDED TO YOUNG ADULTS, CHILDREN, FANS OF 'END OF THE WORLD' NOVELS, AND ADVENTURE NOVELS. BE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE OTHER NOVELS IN THE 'FIRE-US' SERIES IF YOU LIKED 'THE KINDLING'!Also Recommended-Keepers Of The Flame- Jennifer Armstrong, Nancy ButcherThe Stand- Stephen KingThe Andromeda Strain- Michael ChrichtonThanks For Reading!"},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"It is the year 2007. Five years ago, a catastrophic virus wiped out most of the population, leaving the survivors-seven young children-to band together and find a way to survive in this new and terrifying world without adults. Their pasts are a distant blur, their present: a constant fight for survival alone and abandoned in a dead town. Even their names have been forgotten. But Teacher, Mommy, Hunter and the children are about to discover that they are not alone-and they are about to embark on a dangerous quest to find the answers to what happened five years ago. This is the first book in an exciting trilogy by Jennifer Armstrong and Nancy Butcher, the second and third volumes of the Fire-Us trilogy: The Keepers of the Flame and The Kiln finish up the story begun here.The premise isn't terribly unfamiliar. Adult readers can easily see aspects of Stephen King's THE STAND, or other post-apocalyptic novels. What is different about this book, however, is that it does not take place in a distant future, but in a time contemporary enough to feel frighteningly real. Nor does this tale take place during the crisis, --it opens five years later when the survivors have had time to become accustomed to their life. They are no longer the children they once were, and the roles and people they have become reflect their surroundings and the trauma they faced. Nevertheless, they've become a family-a family whose foundations are threatened when they discover they are not alone after all. A stranger finds them, a teen-age boy who seems half insane. He's determined to seek out the Grown-Ups; he's convinced that some of them still live, particularly one called the President. In time he persuades the family to leave the relative safety of their town, and take to the roads to journey to Washington. But the way is fraught with peril and the horrors that the children faced five years ago. It is only by working together that they can hope to reach their destination. Of course, since this is only the first book of a trilogy, there is no conclusion of their journey at the end of the first book, and readers are left with a rather huge cliffhanger.There's a good deal to recommend this book. It's startlingly realistic in feel-it's easy to picture the characters surviving in the manner they do so. I enjoy survival books in general, so it's always a pleasure to read one that can explain that survival so vividly and readily, and keep it feeling fresh and interesting. The relationships between the characters in this book, their shifting roles and personal traumas are powerful and poignant. This is as much a book about the internal struggle of the characters as it is about the adventure. And while this book is clearly toned to younger readers (characters are all young teens or younger, no mention of sexual themes) it never falls into sounding young or sugaring the plot with cuteness.Some other reviewers have found issue with the writing in this book, and I can understand their reservations. Jennifer Armstrong has always been a profoundly poetic and lyrical writer, prone to play with language, and this book is full of her craft. Rather than intrusive, I overall found the affect appealing and powerful, but those who are looking for a streamlined adventure story may find the writing a bit heavy handed at times. I did have two complaints related to the writing. The first is the sort of \\"misheard\\" language that crops up in the beginning among the characters. It feels a little forced at times, and the entire effect seems to fade by about the middle of the book, which was welcome, but makes its use in the opening a little inconsistent. The second concern is that the writers seem to favor a limited omniscient viewpoint, but they jump around too much, from knowing certain character's thoughts at one point, to not knowing them later on. The effect of this was a bit jarring at times, as it did not occur with natural scene breaks or for a seemingly good reason. My final complaint is that I have a problem with series books that don't offer a full story within one book and compound that by having a huge cliffhanger at the end of the first part of the story. I can't rank a book as five stars that leaves me hanging and dissatisfied and readers who pick this up may want to have the other books readily available so that they don't run into this problem.I recommend this for 10-14 yr. olds who are looking for some serious SF stories with a strong grounding in reality. Young adults and adults may enjoy it too, and get more out of the writing style Armstrong employs. It's a good book for a strong reader, and I look forward to continuing the story with book 2, The Keepers of the Flame. Those who enjoy this book may also want to look for the Obernewtyn Chronicles by Isobelle Carmody and The Giver by Lois Lowry.Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshad"},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is the story of a group of children left to survive on their own after a virus (hence the series title \\"fire-us\\" - which is virus in baby-speak)has killed most of the human population.Some parts of the story are interesting. One of the older kids, Hunter, spends a great deal of time searching for food in old stores and houses. The dialogue between the kids, however, is tedious and boring. It is also very difficult to believe that children would end up acting the way the main characters do in this story.If you want to read really good survival stories, then try reading Philbrick's Last Book in the Universe or Robert Swindells' Brother in the Land."},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book was amazing The way the author made it sad and very exciting.

These books are not in the same catagory as these classics.This is a riveting, adventure, survival series featuring fourteen year olds as the main characters, all of whom have suffered mental illnesses from the trauma of surviving a viral illness that wiped out nearly every human being on earth. Disturbing images are described in gut-wrenching detail of the children walking through the piles of skeletons of the victims of this global disaster. It highlights their struggles to retain a shred of sanity in overwhelming circumstances. Angerman, the boy who comes onto the scene in the first book to lead the children north, is severely disturbed and carries a mutilated and dismembered manikin around that speaks to him in his mind and causes him to go out of control.The story paints an ugly portrait of bible believers. The surviving adults, individually named after Christian Bible verses, turn out to be the perpetrators of the viral pestilence that has destroyed the human race. Led by the crazed president of the US, these \\"keepers of the flame\\" quote endless bible verses and engage in forced marriage,child rape and infanticide by fire. The story ends with a youth murder/suicide. Impressionable children may have an unreasonable fear of manikins and be suspicious of their church, pastors or Christians after reading this book. I strongly recommend parental guidance for the young juvenile readers who may pick these up."},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is a sci-fi novel about the end of the world. Every single adult on the planet died. THere are a couple of kids living in a house alone. So begins the Fire-Us trilogy, fascinating, scary, and intriguing.The story is really interesting - I mean slap in your face, give-me-more, I LOVE THIS intersting. A couple of the images were really disturbing, though, like the fact that Hunter had to move the skeletons out of his way at the supermarket. The kids in the story are fascinating, and the Teacher's scarpbook-thing was so . . . wierd that it was actually kind of scary.Then Angerman is introduced. He's really messed up, but I get the idea that he knows something about the virus (Fire-us) that the others don't. This makes him an amazing character, and even if you don't like the story its worth reading the sequel just to find out what happens to him and his battered dummy.I really love this series, though some of the descriptions might be a little too much for younger readers. Well worth anyone who is into sci-fi and apocalypse, as I was at the time.P.S. I read this book five months ago and I still remember all of the characters and their names and quirks. Talk about powerful writing!"},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"In the year 2002, a deadly disease killed out all adults in the world. Eventually, kids died because of the lack of food, shelter, and other things adults gave them. But seven kids got together and helped each other survive for five years. Now in the year 2007, the town they live in is running out of food and supplies, so when a boy named Angerman came to them wanting to search for the president, they jumped on the chance to leave. Now they are in the wilderness traveling from Lazarus, Florida to Washington D.C. in a world dominated by alligators, panthers, and the deadly disease!I liked that occasionally they would switch the view of the characters to show different perspectives on the story. I also liked that I disliked the fact that they put Bad Guy in the story, when that just seemed to get me confused.I would recommend this book for both boys and girls between the ages 12 and 14. I think you would like this book if you are into action or adventure. I really enjoyed this book, and I think you would too."},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This was a pretty blatant ripoff of &#34;The Girl Who Owned a City&#34; by O. T. Nelson. It was probably out of copyright by the time this was written but the entire premise is the same. This book takes a different tact and takes place later after the disaster so the problems are somewhat different but if you like this story I would encourage you to read the trilogy because it is still entertaining, then go get &#34;The Girl Who Owned a City&#34; by O.

I was hooked from the first novel, and traveled on the journey to the climatic end. These books are unlike anything you'll find anywhere else, I guarantee that. Nor will you easily forget them either. The characters are lovable, weird, distasteful, kind, and overall unique. The plot is unpredictable and different, which makes it a particularly refreshing read amongst the has-beens and copycat authors of today. Highly recommended for middle school and up, though to fully appreciate it you'll probably need to be a high school level reader. Very well-written and memorable."},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I read the three books in this trilogy last year during 10th grade. I love them all. My favorite character is Anchorman."},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"As an adult who loves children's fantasy and survival novels, this was a real page-turner. It sounds morbid to say I 'enjoyed' the book, but I don't think that was the author's intent. I felt a gloom and sense of foreboding dread the entire time. It's gritty, real, and very immersing, even heartbreaking at times to consider the story of these kids and how they would grow and develop without adults in the world. It was reminiscent of Lord of the Flies and Red Dawn, with a little bit of Stephen King's 'The Stand' thrown in for good measure, but it wasn't derivative of any of these.I must also say that the style of writing was very different and engaging - these two authors have a great voice, style, and the prose flows right along - impressive without being obtrusive. I'm very excited about reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"In the first year of Fire-Us, there was a disease that started and was said to have killed all of the grown ups on the planet. Now for the last five years Mommy, Teacher, Hunter, Action Figure, Baby, and Teddy Bear have been living together in the cold dark town. The reason they are called these odd names is because they don't remember their names from being enclosed for so long. When a man named Angerman comes to their town, they think he's an alien and don't trust him too much. Angerman is going to be going onto his trip to Washington DC and bring them with him to find a man called President to speak to him about rescue efforts. But the only thing is, Mommy hasn't left the house in five years. Will she leave the house? Will they finally reach Washington If you want to find out these questions, you must read this fantastic book.I thought that this book started out boring like how mommy hasn't left the house for five years and how all of the characters are surviving. As the book progresses, it gets more into focus and gets more exiting. I liked the part when they caught the wild children that thought they were a dog and a cat.I think that the emotional people would like this book the most because of all the people that died; it's just a really sad book. For the most part, it is a very adventurous book that I advise everyone to read. If you have read this book already, I would read the second book."},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"First of all, bits of this book might be a bit too disturbing for younger children. The themes are powerful and alarming. At first I thought it was a book written by creepy religious fanatics or something.Boy was I wrong.I got stuck into the story of these children with their allegorical names. It's filled with powerful scenes. Angerman has got to be the best catalyst character ever who takes these children that would have soon died from starvation on an unforgetable dangerous journey to discover why all of this happened.He is disturbing and powerful and my favourite character in the whole series.I also loved the way the writers used language, the puns they used, terms and phrases tranformed by the characters young minds.It's a brilliant and chilling first book in these series."},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Interesting read. King's \\"The Stand\\" for younger readers is the best way to sum this story up. It was somewhat a slow start, however, ends good.I feel there is no major character development going on in this book, however there are two more I've yet to read. The only two characters I really feel any strong emotions towards are Hunter and Angerman. Hunter is one of the main characters and seems to me pretty level headed. Angerman on the other hand is kind of creepy. I seriously hope is killed off in this series soon. He agitates me too much. Him doing so, however, proves to me that his character was well developed (seeing that I feel so strongly towards his demise).Overall a pretty good read."},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The Kindling took place in the year 2007.

I suggest that anyone who wants a good book should read the Kindling."},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The premise behind the FIRE-US trilogy is not new, disease has killed most of the human population in the world. Reminiscent of EARTH ABIDS or the STAND in the general context, FIRE-US looks at the survival of a group of children left on their own when all the grown-ups died. This is not a novel giving the nuts and bolts of their survival but more a story of how their group is changing given that the oldest members are now facing that radical change of puberty.The story gives an exciting and surprisingly believable account of what children might do if left to themselves, given of course they still have all the stores to raid to keep alive. These children, Hunter, Mommy, Teacher, their names prior to the Fire-Us (virus) having been lost and their identities fully enmeshed with their new roles in life, are the older ones taking care of a number of younger children. They have lived these roles for five years but now forced by the failure of their food supply and the addition of three newcomers to leave their home and find the President of the United States, the grown-up who will save them.The book, alright books if you insist, are fast paced action filled stories that should capture the attention and the imagination of young readers. Be warned though there are parts that are not for the squeamish. There are inferences to what can only be called the rape of adolescent girls and infanticide. Additionally it deals with the coming of age in the older children, their fears and tentative explorations. Nothing brutal or explicit, but there none the less.In all a well done story, and while I can't say their a MUST read I can say I do RECOMMEND them for our young adult readers."},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The Fire-Us trilogy is an entertaining post-apocalyptic thriller for those who are too young to remember the fears of nuclear annihilation that came to an end in the 1990's.Unfortunately, in the final installment, the authors' political biases become all to clear.For adult readers, this trilogy is an example of the kinds of evil allegations that our currend political Left is willing to spread about conservatives. If a conservative writer were to say such things about liberals he or she would be called a witch hunter, a McCarthyite, or worse. But so be it. The tale itself is entertaining enough on its own merits.THE KINDLING, opens in the town of Lazarus, Florida. We learn that five years earlier, a mysterious plague called Fire-Us had wiped out every adult on the planet. Although the plague did not harm children, most of them have died of neglect. But a hardy band of survivors in Lazarus boast that \\"We're still here!\\" The eldest of them would seem to have been only eight or nine when the plague struck. They have been so traumatized that they only have dim recollections of their First Mommies and First Daddies, and their First Names are only dim recollections. But they have survived by taking shelter in an empty house and by raiding abandoned stores in the town.We meet Teacher, with her holy scrapbook that records the history of the band and gives surprisingly good advice on the decisions of the band. There is Mommy, who attends to the needs of the younger children; Teddy Bear, Baby, and Doll. Hunter and his brother, Action Figure do the hunting for the group.A stranger of dubious sanity who calls himself Angerman shows up and joins the group along with Bad Guy, a store mannequin that seems to be his alter ego. Soon afterwards, the group rescues Puppy and Kitty, a boy and girl who seem to be too young to have been born before Fire-Us (virus?). Puppy and Kitty cannot talk, only bark and meow. Angerman persuades the group to seek out President to learn what happened in Fire-Us. They set out. As this installment ends, they reach and abandoned shopping mall and encounter the first adults they have seen in five years."},{"Title":"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Okay, lets start at the begining. This book had a hooking plot and all, and the story was great. It's a sci-fi about a plague that wiped out all the adults in the world. Kids relied on their parents so much, they couldn't survive without them, and died of hunger and fever etc...Now, five years later, we have a group of kids. Three of them are around 13-15. They take care of younger kids, who are way too un-intellegent and immature to be realistic. The plot is hooking enough to distract you from that. Their fate twists when another person shows up at the door. He is misterios, and calls himself Angerman. He has a maniquin who he likes to blame the plague on, and beat up. Either he is a little luny or his something about his past is disturbing, because he's plain wierd, but still my favorite character.Okay. All in all, this book is not how I think it would be if a plague really did come. I guess this book deserves a better rating. I don't know. Let me warn you, the second you finish you'll want to pick up the second book. It really leaves you at a climax."},{"Title":"Please, Spell the Name Right","review":"Film and television actor Jed Allan is best known for the roles that he has played on day-time soap operas such as \\"Days of Our Lives\\", \\"Santa Barbara\\", \\"Port Charles\\", and \\"General Hospital\\" (where he currently plays Edward Quartermaine).

I'm an actress still living check to check and I was completely inspired by Jed's tales of triumph and failure and triumph again. PLUS, he talks so much about a Hollywood and New York I'll never get to know because times have changed so much since he first stepped onto the boards. Not only does he write with a straightforward charm, his anecdotes are funny, heartwrenching and surprisingly honest as he paints a tale of good choices leading to bad choices leading to the wisdom to know the difference.AND, even if you're not an actor or interested in the entertainment business, woven between the stories of his career is a bold and embracing love story between he and his rock-steady wife, Toby.This is an easy, fun and inspiring read for everyone."},{"Title":"Please, Spell the Name Right","review":"I think the other reviewers missed something here.

Wilson had too quickly made territorial concessions to Italy, contrary to the principles of the very Fourteen Points which had made a Wilsonian of Harold Nicolson. And the American idol would fall farther and faster thereafter. --Woodrow Wilson rendered more and ever more to Caesar while asserting that he was doing the work of God and the American people. Nor was Wilson the only sanctimonious hypocrite among the leaders of the Allied and Associated Powers at Paris. --Nicolson's diaries and reflections convey, as he intends to convey, the sense that the peace made at Paris to end World War I was the product of poor planning, disorganized diplomacy, growing fatigue and a very large disconnect between experts and decision-makers. --PEACEMAKING 1919 was written as a manual for young British diplomatists who would face future peace conferences. If they heeded Nicolson, they would then be in a position to avoid the disaster known as the Treaty of Versailles. For peace should not be made, as it was in Paris in 1919, in an atmosphere of a &quot;riot in a parrot house.&quot; -OOO-"},{"Title":"Gus the Greedy Puppy (Puppy Friends)","review":"gus is on his normal route when he spell't a woderful smell and couldn't resit! he snuck into the house. then the owner (who was REALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLY mad!) whent to were gus lived because after his visit her (the owner) ring was missing. gus has a great idea. but if it dosen't work.......gus could be sent to the pound"},{"Title":"Adoniram Judson","review":"Great little overview of this amazing missionary's life. It is a very slim vloume at only 128 pages and can be read in an evening. I wept several times while reading it and recommend this book to all. It is a great example of the transformation Christ works in a man. It is a great portrait of a heart that is in fire for Christ and His gospel. It is an excellent introduction to missions and what a missionary must be like. The suffering this man went through will bewilder the mind as the uncompromising passion and dedication to seeing Christ proclaimed challenges the depths of your soul to live every moment as if everything depended on it. Can't say enough about the work God did in this man. This should be required reading for all Christians. As a note, I do plan on getting To the Golden Shore as it goes much more in depth into the life of Judson than this short but inspiring read."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom continues the Highland clans tale of the Maitlands and the connected clans. This is the story of Brodick and Ramsey but leans less toward bodice-ripping romance and more toward the interaction of the characters and the developing relationship between Brodick and his soon-to-be bride. The 'escapism' part for me by far are the heroics of the Highlanders and the undying loyalty toward the English woman who protects a small child. You will love this book and you may laugh outloud when you read it. This is the best Garwood and the best of this series. She turns what could be 'trash' romance into a real story that you become involved in, with a plot that you may indeed know the outcome of ahead of time, but you will love getting there! It's a great read! If you enjoyed Kathleen Woodiwiss when you were younger or Jude Devereaux, pick up Garwood. She's fabulous!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Julie Garwood is one of my all time FAVORITE authors EVER. Her books are always hilarious with witty characters and plots to die for. This book captures a reader and brings them into a totally new world of courage, love, and betrayal. One minute there will be a page that will have you laughing so hard there are tears running down your face, and the next, you will be crying with tears running down your face because of some evil deed. Gillian is an amazing person to carry around the secret, and knowledge that she has for her whole life, in addition to whitnessing the massacre of her family. Brodick is the perfect guy for Gillian because he is too stubborn to let her do anything that might hurt her, and he is caring to a fault. All in all, this book was my first Julie Garwood book and i love it because , I've been fascinated with 13th-century England and Scotland ever since. It deserves MORE than five stars, and is a must read for anyone interested in old England and Scotland."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom is a beautiful, epic story about a young English woman's quest to save her uncle, and at the same time three Scottish Laird's journey to take revenge on an evil Baron who has threatened them all. Ransom is also about the developing relationships between Gillian and Brodick Buchanan and Brigid and Ramsey Sinclair.Some reviewers have mentioned that they felt Ramsey and Brigid deserved more time or that they should have had a separate book. They have also commented that Brodick and Gillian were not so interesting. I don't normally comment on other reviews - we all have a right to our opinions after all! - but in this case I just had to respond, as I couldn't disagree more.Gillian and Brodick are a wonderful couple; Gillian is clever and smart as well as beautiful and brave, and Brodick is confident, protective, sexy and brave too. What I loved was that he always had respect for Gillian's abilities unlike many alpha heroes, even when Gillian doubted herself he always reassured her. He even defended her skills to other people rather than belittling her or treating her badly as heroes in other historicals are prone to do with alarming regularity.Gillian and Brodick in my opinion deserve the extra time - although Brigid and Ramsey were great too - because they were much less conventional than the other couple, which made their story even more engrossing. Their dialogue was electric and it was clear to me that they belonged together - no one else would have been quite right for them.Overall Ransom was fantastic and included all the elements I love in a romantic novel. I would caution readers that Brodick and Gillian don't meet up right away, I think it's a hundred pages in, but as the book is 450 pages+ this doesn't matter as the two are together almost continuously after that point so there is plenty of time for their relationship to develop. Read this if you like Scottish Laird meets English Lady stories that are charming, funny and above all romantic. I have a feeling this novel is just what you're looking for.JoAnne"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book was amazing. I think its better than the original book The Secret. It has the same flair for humor that J.G. always immerses in her novels. It will make you laugh (sometimes out loud), cry, scowl, and fall in love with all the characters. This one goes right up there with Saving Grace!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I will never foget this book, mainly because it was the first romance novel I ever read. JULIE GARWOOD IS AN AMAZING WRITER. This book was full of intrigue, heartwarming romance, suspense, adventure, and danger from the beginning to the end. Gillian is sweet, strong and very brave. Broddick is Macho, sexy, sexy sexy!!! did I say sexy! ^^ courageous, and sweet (when he is around Gillian). They make a PERFECT! couple. THE OTHER TWO CHARACTERS: Brigid and Ramsey ( he too, is gorgeous-sexy-sweet and, falls in love with Brigid). THIS BOOK WAS SO AMAZING, I WAS DISSAPPOINTED WHEN IT ENDED!! If you are looking for a romance novel, THIS IS THE BOOK TO READ! WARINING: Do not read this book at night, because you will not be able to sleep. :) :) :) ^^"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is the second book to a series, the first is The Secret.This book will not disappoint any fan.I am so glad that she wrote a story on Brodick Buchanan, as I loved his character in The Secret. Although it would have been nice if Ramsey Sinclair had his own book."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This was the first Julie Garwood book I read and wasn't aware of her literary capabilities! She really draws you into the lives of her characters and makes you feel all their emotions, especially their rapture when love finds them. I have since purchased all the &quot;kilt klassics&quot; as I describe them and should tell everyone that it would have helped to know that I should have read The Secret first -- just for history. Julie Garwood's characters are intriguing and full of details that she carries throughout and that has made her books wonderful choices since I can re-read them and never tire of all the details. Julie: Keep up the writing and please make your next book a &quot;kilt klassic&quot;!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"The story starts out slow, but soon it gets real exciting. I loved it when Gillian and Brodrick first meet. I like the way Ms. Garwood made Gillian look real beautiful and the how the Buchanan Clan protected Gillian from other men that just stared at her. I especially liked Brodick being so possessive and protective of Gillian. I loved the way Brodick tricks Gillian into matrimony and how the priest kept on saying &quot;A man of the cloth&quot; after he finds out he had been tricked as well in getting them married. It was just so hilarious. Brodick's character seemed so rough and mean, but he was still afraid of telling Gillian he tricked her into marriage. It made Brodick really look like a real gentle hero. I thought that it would have been better if Ms. Garwood had another story on Ramsey instead of putting it in the same book because Ramsey looked like a interesting character. But the story was still great with two heros. I just loved the way Ramsey found out he was the studpid guy Bridgette had lost her heart to and the way he told Bridgette that he loved her,too. It was by far the best book of Julie Garwood's I read so far. I just loved it!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This was my very first Julie Garwood book. But won't be the last. I really loved the story and characters, I've finished it in just 2 days! I've learned that some of the characters are also in &quot;The Secret&quot;, so of course I got that one too. &quot;Ransom&quot; has everything - suspense, adventure ,and romance. This book is one of the best that I ever read! And Julie Garwood is the first-rate romance author!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love Julie Garwood. She makes the characters come alive and makes the reader actually care about what happens. RANSOM kept me engrossed for the frist two hundred pages. I couldn't put it down. The middle of the book seemed a little slow. I would have liked a way of Gillian telling Alec good-bye, after all they did go through a lot with each other. Also Iain and Judith should have said something to her as she left with Brodick. All in all I thought the book was very good, Maybe not as good as THE BRIDE, but I still plan on reading it again and again. Lets hope for more adventures in the Highlands."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I enjoyed this book a great deal. I loved the characters, the plot, and the dialogue. I would have loved to see more of Ramsey's story developed because they were just as interesting as the main couple. The story moved along without a dull moment, and it was not predictable. When I finished it, I was still wanting more. That is how I know it is a good book. I would definitely recommend."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This one of Garwood's best historical romances. The plot is well bound and the events keep you on the edge from beginning to end. A must read, and a novel that will get you more attached to get everything that Julie writes. Great work this time."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This was my favorite Garwood book so far... I actually laughed during parts of it and truly enjoyed the story which I'd describe as a rollicking lusty Highlands adventure! The characters were well-developed. Since I'd already read The Secret, which was a book that preceded this tale, I loved reading a bit involving characters from that tale also ..."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I absolutely lovedThe Secret, the previous book in the series to Ransom, and didn't think it was possible that the follow up could be better. Garwood did it though! This book was absolutely spectacular. I was so worried that I might not love Brodick as much as I did in the previous one since so much changes when a character goes from a minor one to the hero of a story. Yet Brodick retained everything I loved about him inThe Secret. I love how much fun he is to irritate and I really enjoyed seeing his loving/caring sides. He might just be my new favorite highlander, I would definitely let him whisk me away.I nearly put the book down to read at a later time because the beginning was so dense and confusing. It was a lot longer thanThe Secret's introduction and I honestly thought I might have been reading the incorrect book. I cannot put into words how thankful I am that I kept reading though. Once I made it through the 'prologue'-eque scenes and Ramsey's scenes, the book really picked up and was intensely enjoyable. I actually came to like the beginning once I understood everything that was going on, I don't think it was the best way to start the book but I can't think of how else it could have been told.I loved how similar this book was toThe Secret. It has the same humorous, witty tone, which I absolutely love in historical romances since it's so rare. I loved the wedding scene in the previous book, it blew me away with how unique and funny it was. Ransom had nearly the exact same wedding yet the whole scene remained fresh and hilarious. Garwood is definitely a talented writer to take something she's done before and make it so interesting and enjoyable that the reader doesn't care.I'm all about the characters for this book. I was especially excited by all of the returning characters, mainly Iain, Judith, Catherine Frances and Patrick. Judith was a little... blah but Iain was just as lovable as a minor character. It was interesting seeing the interactions with him from Brodick's POV. Brodick was the highlight of this story for me. I fangirled all over him in the last book so seeing him as a main character was amazing for me. I would definitely swoon had I been the heroine whenever he was around. I love how fierce, protective and possessive he is yet sweet (secretly). I'm so glad that he got a heroine that I felt was worthy of him, that was another concern for me after reading the beginning of the book. I was so worried that Gillian would be annoying and pathetic so I'd feel bad for Brodick the whole book. I fell in love with Gillian too though. It's hard not to after witnessing how caring and brave she was with Iain's son (another character I fell madly in love with.) I usually hate 'future' stories featuring the characters' children but I would be all over a book with him as the hero.The side hero and heroine, Bridgit and Ramsey, were cheated. I loved reading about Bridgit while see was adventuring and causing trouble with Gillian. Her love for Ramsey was heartfelt and believable despite how quickly it was forced to develop (pagewise). I liked Ramsey and enjoyed how put off he was by his horde of women followers. His side of the relationship with Bridigt was forced and happened in a matter of paragraphs which drove me crazy. If they'd had a whole book, or even a short story, I think Garwood could have done wonderful things with them. Shoved in to Brodick and Gillian's story just wasn't fair to their romance."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"\\"You know what?\\" was one of my favorite lines in this wonderful book. And, I loved Alec, the adorable young boy who kept asking that question.This is my first book by Julie Garwood, but it won't be my last. Ransom has everything I look for in a good book -- engaging read, well-written, vivid and descriptive details, believable story and importantly likable characters -- especially the hero Brodrick and heroine Gillian. Their personalities were consistent throughout the book (not extreme changes in behavior, as I sometimes notice in other characters), which made for a good read. The dialogue between them was good and made their developing romantic relationship believable. And there was definitely great chemistry between Brodrick and Gillian.Nor, was the story predictable -- of course, we hope for a happy ending, but it's how one gets to the ending that makes the read worthwhile. And Garwood weaves an entertaining tale, filled with interesting characters that keeps the reader engaged until the very end. I personally would have liked a different ending, one that included a reunion with little Alec, since he was so central to the story, and a bit of Gillian in the Buchanan environment. An epilogue would have been sufficient. Regardless, it was an excellent book and one I would highly recommend.Kindle alert: I have the Kindle edition of this book and around page 5867-5869 there is a gap in the reading. It does pick up again and you can see missing parts inserted on the next pages. I ended up going to a local bookstore and reading that section and it turns out that only a couple of pages/paragraphs are effected, but it gave me quite the scare. I was anxious to keep reading and see what happened next, so the thought of missing pages was not good.I look forward to more of Julie Garwood's books. Ransom was an excellent start and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I loved reading about Ian and Judith again. One wish would be that it was a wee bit longer. Ahhh, Mz.Garwood please go back to historical romance!!!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is one of those romance novels that make you want more. Not only is the sex great - as it should be - but the story is actually interesting and keeps you guessing. I read this when I was younger then found it at my library recently, read it again, and bought it here. I would recommend this to anyone who likes historical novels, romance novels, or anything in between."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"When I picked this up from the grocery store shelf, and even when I read the back and bought the book, I had no idea that I was about to read my first romance novel. By the time I figured it out, after an tense and action-packed prologue about a family fleeing their home in the night and a few chapters where the heroine bravely protects a child and takes a journey to the Scottish highlands (with, of course, a strong and handsome laird keeping her company), I didn't mind at all and kept reading. In fact, I kept reading all night until I was finished and had about an hour left to sleep.I loved the characters, was amused by the situations they found themselves in, enjoyed the highland setting, was intrigued by the mystery, and thought it a really good book (although a re-read years later made me much more aware of some of the flaws, most noticeably the sometimes unnatural dialogue and behavior of the heroine, and of the unrealistic-ness of the story as a whole--but I enjoyed it only a little less than I had). I didn't like the romance parts, but apart from those I really kind of loved it.After reading this, I read a few other books by Julie Garwood, some of which I liked a lot, includingThe Secret, the story of which came before Ransom, a couple of which I didn't, but none ever approached the level of Ransom for me. Maybe I'll read the rest of her books someday, but for now I prefer my books to be good historical fiction with elements of romance, rather than the other way around."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"That is what Ransom, The Bride, The Secret, Honors Splendor and most Garwood books are for me. If I've had a bad day or the cramps or just down, I usually pick up Ransom (it is my favorite) and it just makes me feel better. I know the story is wonderful and it makes me laugh in some parts, other parts make me want to put it down and find my husband ;), she makes you feel what the characters do. Other parts make me upset, but I'm upset at the right people, the villians. I have read this book so many times I've lost count, it isn't just picked up when I don't feel good. For those times when a new story just doesn't appeal because you don't know if you will love it or hate it, that is when I pick up a Garwood since I love most all of them. I don't usually write reviews, only one other and it was because the story ambushed me with so many things that I wasn't expecting it seemed neccesary to warn others. But after reading the 1 and 2 star reviews for this book, they just seemed unfair. This book isn't some dark, twisted, have trouble following the plot line story. If you want that, read Kushiel's Dart, I skimmed through that one and still felt my time was wasted. Ransom is a book that makes you feel good and inspires your romantic side."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I can't imagine Julie Garwood writing a book that wasn't great. I have read 7 or 8 of her books, and have not been at all disappointed in them. I read them in 1 or 2 days, because I can't wait to find out what happens. Ransom, as well as The Prize, The Secret, The Wedding, The Bride, so on and so on, are very enthralling. Remember, these are romance novels, so if it's not what your into, don't leave bad ratings for those who love these kind of books. If you love romance, you'll love these."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I suspect if you're a Garwood fan you will enjoy this novel. To me, her novels are all too similar. With Ransom, she takes the reader yet again into the highlands with a bit of mystery, adventure, clan-loyalty, and romance. Actually, the romance aspect is debatable b/c attraction is NOT romance as far as I'm concerned.Garwood's characters are all the same, she merely changes their names in each of her books. I'm not saying they are dislikable, just redundant. Other reviewers boast this is Garwood's best highlander romance; if this is true, I am not interested in reading any others. It wasn't awful, it was just the same old stuff."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have always liked Julie Garwood (until the Roses). But this book is pretty lame. It has echoes of her past style, but is vastly inferior. The first few chapters were so confusing that I checked to see if pages were missing from my book. I tried hard to like it, but how many times can you read: Brodick; Yes Judith; Gillian; Yes Brodick; Ian; Yes Ramsey; Did Ms Garwood need some filler? No one talks that way. I was quite disappointed, but read it anyway."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This a different review---I purchased the hardback copy and the print was so faint that I returned the book! I showed it to the salesperson and she and I searched through the books but we both agreed the printing was hard to read."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This was the first ever Julie Garwood book that I picked up, and so I didn't have anything to really compare it to. If you have never read any of the author's books, you may like this one. Otherwise, you'll find it dissapointing. It doesn't hold a candle to The Secret or The Bride, as I found after I read those two. As far as characters go, I was left feeling unfulfilled. Brodick was a perfect supporting actor in The Secret, but here he doesn't seem to carry his own. His dialogue is slow and there is little of it. I was left with the feeling that he was not very intelligent: all brawn and little brain. Not the kind of hero I look for. The heroine was also dissapointing. Gillian wasn't exactly winy, but she allowed herself to get slapped around too much. She wasn't the quick-witted, tart-tongued, well-intentioned meddler that I have come to expect from Ms. Garwood. What I found most disappointing was the lack of humor. I have laughed out loud at the antics of several Garwood heroines, but this one doesn't seem to deliver. Few laughs, obvious villain, and an all too predictable plot. Final verdict: This is a bum read. Pick up The Bride instead, and prepare to laugh til you cry."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book promotes everything that a woman should not be: stupid and submissive. I am sad for Gillian, I am totally repulsed by Broderick - a possessive and rude pig, and I am bored by the book that reaks of a day-time soap (you know what is going to happen 10 pages in advance). I am sorry, Ms. Garwood if this is an ideal love for you for it surely seems like an abuse to me. I am truely sad that women still find books like that exciting and interesting."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I read through the first 50 pages of this book, and I couldnt keep up with all the characters. I Did not read the first book &quot;The Secret&quot;, and maybe it would have been easier to keep up with if I had. Either way, it was just way too confusing."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I found this to be a very enjoyable book to read. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"possibly the worst book I have ever read...her history is not good-being English the term &quot;Pa will paddle my backside&quot; is not really something that a modern English person would say let alone someone supposedly born in the reign of King Richard. It just grated so badly that the rest of it left me cold, I love historical romances/fiction but please make some effort to get the time period even remotely correct!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Good God! This was the first book of Ms. Garwood I ever looked at and I swear it will be my last! I can't believe something so shallow and unbelievably cheezy still gets published! All the characters do is look at each other, sigh, rapidly hug and kiss and realize over and over and over that they are in love...It was so tacky I couldn't force myself to finish. This is housewife's bliss! All that's missing is Fabio on the cover."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"My aunt persuaded me to read this book. I am not a big fan of Romance but I gave it a try. Did this book change my mind about this geanre? No, not really. The characters seem very undeveloped - the author told us upfront what they thought and felt rather than letting them convey it through their actions. Brodick is very rude and primitive. All that comes to mind is that he talks &quot;gruffly&quot; - that word was used 98 times to describe him (and that is only where I bothered to count). As for poor Gillian, she is just too irritating even to talk about. To wrap it all up -- NOT an interesting read. (Sorry Gulie Garwood..)"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Once I read the first Julie Garwood historical Scottish romance, there was no turning back, and I've read all of them, my favorites being \\"Ransom\\" and \\"The Prize\\". I loved this book so much that I recently read it again. I was fascinated by the dialog between Gillian and Alec and how Garwood captured the spirit and liveliness of Alec. He literally jumped off the page. Garwood must have had a wonderful early life because she writes her characters so clearly. There's always a tangible emotional thread woven between her characters, which is why I think her books are so popular. The story simply evolved from there and opened into a wonderful adventure of love and relationships and the age old Scottish feuds. I loved Brodick and his strength and Gillian for her spirit and stubbornness. I thoroughly enjoyed the Maitlands and would have liked to have read more about them and well as more about Ramsey and Brigid. Too bad there wasn't a sequel to this story. Engrossing, five star reading."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Wow! This was a great book! I LOVED it!!! This is another book that makes you sooooo sad it is over!! This is my 3rd Julie Garwood book and my favorite thus far! I just happened to read THE SECRET before this one and had no idea that it takes off years later with some of the same characters! I loved that! Maybe that made it easier to understand the background of the book a little more knowing something about a few of the characters beforehand. You will find this one hard to put down! Don't let the 500+ pages scare you, it will seem like nothing once you get reading! I thought I'd never find another book to compare with Judith McNaught's - but this one of Julie Garwoods is right up there!! You will be glad you read this one!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Gillian was just a small child when she saw her father murdered by the vicious Baron Alford. Claimed as Baron Alford's ward, Gillian was fortunate enough to be raised by her beloved Uncle Morgan, but Baron Alford soon called her back to his castle. For the Baron needed to produce Arianna's Box, a bejeweled golden box commissioned by King John, or King John would kill him. King John had never forgiven Gillian's father for murdering his great love, his beautiful Arianna, but he was convinced that Gillian would know where the box was hidden. Unfortunately, Gillian had no idea, but she knew that they would carry through their threat of torturing and killing her Uncle Morgan if she didn't find the box. She also knew that they would kill the young child, Alec, the son of a Highland chieftain, as soon as they discovered that they had kidnapped the wrong child. Left with no choice, Gillian took Alec and fled for the Highlands to find her long-lost older sister and to return Alec to his home and parents.Gillian knew that she needed help to find her sister and she knew that she would need a strong champion to help her save her Uncle Morgan. When Alec waxed eloquent about his protector, Brodick Buchanan, Gillian knew that she had found her champion. By pretending to be Brodick's bride, Gillian ensured that Brodick would find her quickly and she could see his skills with her own eyes. When Gillian first spotted Brodick, she knew she was in trouble. The man was so stubborn and exasperating, but she found herself falling in love with him regardless. Brodick knew that Gillian was English, which was a pretty big flaw, but he had never seen anyone so lovely and she didn't seem to be afraid of him, which was a first. As he escorted Gillian and Alec to Iain's land to return the lad and then took Gillian to Ramsey Sinclair's land to find her sister, he found himself falling in love with her. However, just because he loved her and married her didn't mean that Gillian would obey him...Many of Ransom's characters come from Garwood's book, The Secret, which introduced Laird Iain and his bride. Brodrick and Ramsey were Iain's commanders at the time and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing them again in this book as they sought out their own happiness. I thought that the romance between Brigid KirkConnell and Ramsey Sinclair was too rushed and would have liked to have seen them have a book of their own, but their plot was integral to Brodick and Gillian's story so I understand why it was a subplot instead of a full story. However, I still would have liked a separate story as Ramsey was such a handsome devil that he deserved a woman who would give him a bit of trouble! Other than that complaint, I would have to say that the story is thoroughly enjoyable and fast paced. I appreciate Garwood's efforts to actually create a story with memorable characters and historical background and detailing, rather than a shallow book with small links between sex scenes. I liked the characters and thought that it was a fun, fast read. If you enjoy historical romances, especially those set in the Scottish highlands, then don't miss Garwood's excellent romances based there!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"The only reason I didn't give Ransom 5 stars is because of the over-shadowing of Ramsey's and Bridgid's story. Their's could have easily been made into a book of their own. This was my one and only complaint, but I guess it's a pretty big one. Brodick and Gillian's story was wonderful to read, but Ramsey and Bridgid's was what I remembered most and what made me go searching for this book again. They were incredibly adorable and sweet, and I loved reading the few interactions they had. I only hope that Ms. Garwood will decide to write another sequel featuring Ramsey and Bridgid. Their's is a story I would truly enjoy reading."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book reminded me why I love Julie Garwood novels. Though I enjoyed Garwood's foray into the American West, Ransom brought back together all the qualities I read Julie Garwood romances for that were maybe absent in the Rose books. The heroine of Ransom was classic Garwood(Gillian reminded me of Joanna and Madelyne) and comedy was back in full force. Read this book and you will immediately want to start rereading your collection."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This was the first book by Garwood that I have ever read. She has the most intriguing way of ending almost every chapter with one liners that compels the reader to read on. In chapter 24 she carries the reader on an emotional climax only to have it come racing back to reality with one devastating line.I will definitely have to read more of her works, and would highly recommend her."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have been a fan of Julie Garwood since I read The Prize and found her work to be excellent ...and this book is no exception. You are able to identify with her characters and to immerse yourself in the plot. I love the way she ties in characters from her other books to make a whole picture that is interesting to read. I thought the character of Gillian was admirable in both her courage and her sense of honor. Congrats to Ms. Garwood on another great book!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have loved Garwood books since I stared to read them. Ransom is one of her best. I waited for it, and couldn't put it down till it was finished. It made my heart race with the passion. I felt like I was right there in the book, I can't wait till a new one comes out and hopefully ones that are contiued of others."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"After rubbing my hands in expectation, I found myself extremely dissatisfied with this sequel to one of the best Julie Garwood's ever written, &quot;The Secret&quot;. In fact, it failed to measure up to any of the others she has written, even what I consider her worst yet, &quot;For the Roses&quot;, and those very slim (and we're not just talking page-length here) &quot;Red, White &amp; Pink Rose&quot; offerings. I felt used by the teaser on the book's synopsis about how this was about Brodick AND Ramsey and Ramsey's story wasn't even there. In addition, I found myself re-writing a lot of the plot to keep it more interesting. Where was the humor so prevelant in all the other books? I missed having a smile on my face after I read the last page...and neither did I begin it all over again as I have the others. I can only hope that the story of Ramsey and Brigid is written in another publication, for they were severely shortchanged in this one. I'm certain a writer of Ms. Garwood's talent can return to her original form and THAT book I greatly anticipate. However, I don't think I'll buy it in hardcover...or at full price."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I really enjoyed this novel.It was my third Garwood read, The Bride being the first. I have to admit that the first chapter was pretty confusing and I almost gave up trying to understand the story line. However, once it became clear as to what was going on I was hooked,and it was oh so hard to put down. It had a complex but thoroughly enjoying plot that was very witty and mysterious with the missing Arrianne's box. Brodich is very much an arrogant but endearing leader who met his true soul mate in Gillian. They complemented each other completely.This book had a lot of characters and a bewildering start. But don't give up. I think this is Garwood's best yet!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Her storytelling has me traveling back in time and loving it. She has told this story with a believable skill that is hard to find in books anymore. Good, believable historical romances are few and far between and I can only commend Ms. Garwood on her talent. Please keep them coming."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Julie's newest book was the best yet. I have read every single one of the books she wrote, and never have I been disappointed. Gillian and Brodick are what each of us hope to find in love. Ramsey was the typical male who wouldn't know love until it left him. Julie, please write more on Ramsey and Bridgid, you left us hanging! I will read this again and again until Julie comes out with her new book."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Judy Garwoods new novel, Ransom. I had read The Secret already and was impressed with this continuation. I found the strong character of Gillian inspiring. I love it when a heroine is strong and clever enough to save the hero. And as always, I enjoy the humor Judy Garwood incorporates in her stories. Definitely a good book to cuddle up with."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I loved this book. It was so exciting. I am so glad she has gone away from the westerns and back to the Highlands. I love all her books. But this one is going to be one of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Sorry JG, but I can't make any comment about this book because it hasn't been translated into my language!. I envy all english speakers because they are always the first one who read your books!. I understand pretty well english but my sister and mother not so I have to wait until someone kind publish them in spanish. It gets on my nerves!.Julie, Couldn't you help me?I'll try to guess about it...I'm sure this is other incredible book plenty of adventures and risk, but very hilarious. The characters will be brave, wild and tender at the same time, and they will fight against their feelings until realise they can't live separated. However, I'm sorry for telling this, but sometimes the stories are very similar because the characters have more or less the same personalities. I don't care at all!. I will be your best fan forever!!!!!!!xxoooxxoo...."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I thought this was an entertaining and interesting book. However I was disappointed that Ramsey's romance was shortchanged. I would have thought he deserved his own book. All in all, this is one of Ms Garwood's better books."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is the best novel I've read in a long time. It was funny and sweet and I just loved it! My only regret was that it had to end. These two were so adorable together that it reminded me of The Bride. No one writes about the Scottish Highlands better and my only hope is that Julie brings us back there again soon."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I really loved this book. When I read the Secret I thought then that the characters of Brodrick and Ramsey would be great for another book. I'm so glad she used them for this one. Ransom had such a great story with wonderful heroes and villans I loved to hate."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I HAVE ALL OF GARWOODS BOOKS AND EVEN THOUGH I AM NOT THRILLED WITH FOR THE ROSES COME THE SPRING OR THE CLAYBORN BRIDES I WAS THRILLED THAT SHE WENT BACK TO THE HIGHLANDS. I HAVE NEVER READ AANYTHING I ENJOYED SO MUCH. I WAS LITTLE DISSAPOINTED THAT RAMSEY DIDNT GET HIS OWN BOOK BUT AS ME AND MY FRIENDS FIGURE HIS FUTURE WIFE COULD ALWAYS BE KIDNAPPED FOR YEARS AND HE COULD BE BITTER. I AM HOPING ROBERT DYLAN AND PROSTER COME BACK IN BOOKS OF THEIR OWN. I MET JULIE GARWOOD AT A ROMANCE CONFERANCE AND SHE IS AS GREAT AS SHE WRITES. THIS BOOK IS A KEEPER. IM SO THRILLED WITH IT I PLAN ON REREADING IT IMMEDIATELY. DEFFINATELY ONE OF HER BEST. USUALLY THE WOMAN IS FUNNY BUT THESE MEN WERE HILARIOUS. THEY HAD ME LAUGHING SO HARD I CRIED."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ms. Garwood has hit one out of the ballpark with her newest novel, Ransom. I loved it! She has a real knack for character development. I am looking forward to more Scottish Romances from her."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I started on a Friday and was done by Sunday night I didn't want to put it down. I just had to know if they were going to make it and how it would all turn out. I recommend this book highly, it was great!!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I just could not put down this book. It almost made me late for work one day. I love the fact that we get to revisit old friends. I always wondered what had happend to Ramsey and Brodrick and how they faired on their journey into England. Now I know. This book is definitely a keeper. It is one of the few books that I just zipped through."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I read this book 5 times. I just couldn't put it down. I have also read Secret. It was good to see old friends again and find out what has been happening in their lives."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I tried to wait until the book came to the library but I just couldn't do it! Went out and bought it to add to my Garwood collection and couldn't put it down long enough to even cook dinner. So, I ordered a pizza for the family and read on. What a fun story. She always manages to keep me in suspense and in stitches. Her wit and charm shine through in all her books. (I'm still waiting on a book about Quinlin &amp; Faith from THE WEDDING)"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"ONCE AGAIN JULIE GARWOOD HAS WRITTEN A BOOK WHERE I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN. ALL I WANT TO DO IS READ, READ, READ. I FEEL THAT I AM BEING TAKEN BACK IN TIME AND THAT I AM ACTUALLY A PART OF THE STORY, A THIRD PARTY, OF COURSE. RANSOM WAS A FUN-LOVING BOOK WITH OLD CHARACTERS RETURNED FROM THE SECRET, AND THEY HAVE A MAJOR ROLE, NOT JUST A FLY-BY- NIGHT MENTION."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I first read The Secret a few weeks ago and was thrilled to discover i had co-incidentally purchased ransom as well. this book starts out great and only gets better. I have fallen in love with these strong spirited but soft hearted highlanders and hope that garwood will bring them back to us in yet another story soon. Ransom takes us on another journey through the Scottish highlands at a time when honor and loyalty were of utmost importance. The characters in this book are loveable and fun as well as deep. I highly recommend it to anyone but a word of adivise read The Secret first to understand fully some minor character development."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom, like all of Julie Garwood's books, kept me in one place for the entire reading. My husband kept asking me why I was smiling to myself? I loved the easy banter between all of the characters and the fierce loyalty that they always portray. Julie Garwood always makes her heriones strong willed yet feminine women. Which is something many authors seem to forget. We want to be kissed breathless but listened to!! It is such a delight to read about charachters that you have already glimpsed in other books. Julie Garwood brings you home!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Although I would have enjoyed seeing Brodick and Ramsey having their own individual stories (each were just as deserving as Iain) I laughed (Alec was priceless) until I cried and read the entire book in less than a day. I have to re-read it again so I can slowly enjoy each page! Ransom far surpassed For the Roses and the Clayborne Brides and I'm glad to see that Julie Garwood is back to her original style... humor (know what...) and love (Gillian and Brodick's love story was beautiful), adventure (the escape) and action (retribution). One minute you're laughing and the next minute you're crying! Amazing... (by the way, Secret was even more incredible)!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"A reader is captured with the first page of Ransom and led into a world of intrigue, betrayal, and revenge. The love story is rich and rewarding. I especially enjoy the &quot;love at first sight&quot; story line. Julie Garwood introduces the characters with such wonderfully descriptive words that one can almost get an image of what the characters look like. My favorite book by Julie Garwood is The Secret so I was very happy to hear that she had written a sequel. Once again readers get to meet Judith and Ian Maitland and their children. The unquestionable love that is expressed in any Julie Garwood book makes any story written by her one that I must have. I look forward to her next novel with great anticipation."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I Started reading Julie Garwoods book when my friend and I were vacationing on the beach last summer. I Fell in love with &quot;the bride&quot; and couldn't get enough of the Highlands after that. &quot;the secret&quot; captured my heart and I didn't believe I would find better characters. I was wrong. Brodrick and Gillian's story was beyond any other. The Strong Laird learns that love doesn't weaken a true warrior. Gillian learns to trust while falling in love with a noble man. I hope that Julie Garwood will continue to write about these fabulous men."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Good story and interesting characters. It was fun getting to know the Buchanan ancestors. Evidently the Buchanan men have always been tall, arrogant, stubborn yet honorable and on occasion even gentle. A always, I enjoyed Garwood's quirky humor. I'll read this one again."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Many points for the story, but take away for dropping too many characters from other books.I am a Garwood fan, but some characters are just to large to drop in and out as minor characters."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"The Ransom book by Julie Garwood is truely riviting and the characters come to life. I have this book in paper as well as on Kendal book. this is one of my favorite books by far. I have read this Ransom about 5 times now from cover to cover. Everytime i read it i capture the true essense of Characters. I would love to see the younger generation in the books to come spring to life. I cannot seem to get enough of Julie's, characters; Ian, Brodrick, Ramsey Patrick and their wives, I would love to see the story unfold more.Thank you for your stories they are truley inspirational! A devoted Fan!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have always enjoyed reading Julie Garwoods historical romances and this one along with Saving Grace is my favourite. Honestly, its the children in the book that make it so enjoyable.It is definitely worth every penny. This is actually about the tenth time I have read it.I won't do what everyone else does and write an essay telling you everything that is going to happen, so that you do not need to read it. Just trust your instinct. All of her books are great."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Love the characters. Love Brodick, could not put the book down. wish for more stories and characters like this one."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is one of my favorite Julie Garwood books. Could not put it down. Love the characters and her humor."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I liked this book. The characters are very enjoyable and the plot was interesting. It was a little predictable though..."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love Julie Garwood's books. My favorite is probably The Secret and Ransom is now tied for that honor. I was already in love with many of the characters from the first book and Gillian and Alec were wonderful new characters. There were tense moments, scary moments, and many, many romantic moments. When I saw how thick the book was, I was a little wary, but I just couldn't put it down and, by the end, I wished for a few hundred more pages. If you liked The Secret, you MUST read Ransom."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"You never get too old for romance. Julie Garwood created a timeless classic with this novel. Garwood takes you back to the time when men were men and instead of a meek woman, she created Gillian. A feisty heroine, that follows her heart and never gives up no matter how many trials and tribulations she has gone through. Garwood paints the tale of Gillian and Brodick in such vivid detail, you as the reader feel transformed to the harsh times of the romanticized Scotland. It is a story of love, treachery and betrayal and with times of intense suspense and simple emotion, the book is a page turner. I could not put it down. Literally I read it in a single day. In modern times the heroine and quest for love is often forgotten and this book takes you back to a simpler time,and draws out emotions I have never felt when reading a novel. One can;t help but root for and become attached to the characters in this story. I have now read it four times and will only continue to increase that number."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Pleasant reading material, but not in the same league as some of the other Julie Garwood books I have read. A good tale, but not much excitement."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"A Novel that takes back in time, you will laugh and cry thoroughly enjoy this love story set in another era & country."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have to say that I have read all of Ms. Garwood's books and by far this one is my favorite. I have read it over several times and still love it each and every time!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This was my first Garwood book. It actually had me looking for more. I like that the hero and heroine were together through most of the book with lots of feelings and dialogue in between. There were a few things that I found annoying about this book. Gillian was such a strong character at the beginning of the book and then as the story progressed she became weaker and weaker. Brodick seemed to love her for her strong will but somehow he stomped it out of her anyway.Ramsey and Bridgid seemed a bit rushed. I think Ramsey definitely could have carried his own novel. The book was also a little repetitive at times. Every single character had to be told the story how Gillian saved Michael. Michael became a little bit repetitive also and a bit annoying.Spoiler***Lastly, when Gillian finally finds her sister it is very anti-climactic and a little hard to believe.Even with these flaws it was still a very nice read."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Amazing book! Garwood at her best. I absolutely loved it! Do yourself a favor, read The Secret (equally excellent) FIRST. It'll introduce you to the two of the characters and give you some background.I can't really go into detail about the plot without giving spoilers, but suffice to say the book is basically about Gillian's (englishwoman) escape and journey to find her long lost sister & a jeweled box in the Scottish Highlands in order to free her beloved Uncle Morgan from his captor Baron Alford. There's a whole mystery surrounding the box, its contents and their significance. In her escape, she saves a boy and determines to bring him back to his family in the Highlands first and then pursue the whereabouts of her sister & box. She gets help from the Laird Bodrick and his warrior soldiers at first and then their joined by Laird Ramsey and Laird Iain (The Secret).The scenes with the boy (can't tell you who he is *spoiler*) and Gillian are hilarious. He's a real talker! And the constant verbal sparing between Brodick and Gillian is so funny and touching at the same time. These two were made for each other. Both stubborn to a fault.There is also romance between Gillian's friend Brigid and Laird Ramsey, but I have to agree with other reviewers. It's just not meaty enough. I would have liked to have seen more.There is also a a bunch of surprises involving the identity of some Highlander traitors. It'll keep you guessing.This is a great book for anyone who loves highlander historicals (circa 1200) with romance and a heavy dose of mystery. There are tons of plot turns and twists which will keep you glued to the book. Be prepared for a long night!I also recommend, for those of you that liked this one, Garwood's Honora's Spendor and Saving Grace and The Wedding."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I loved the story of Gillian and Broderick. As another reviewer posted, I think that the Ramsey and Bridgit story could have had it's own seperate book. Without giving away their story, it just didn't have a lot of meat to it. Over all though, I really enjoyed this book! I think the plot development and the main characters were outstanding. Gillian isn't a whimpy heorine who backs - to the very last chapter, she stands up for what she believes in, without loosing her softer side."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have read all of Julie Garwood's books - several times and this is one of my absolute favorites! I had to go out and buy them all!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"BUT...while many sequel-type stories will also stand alone, one simply MUST read The Secret before Ransom. The enjoyment of Ransom will be 10-fold. Usually these sequels give a passing nod to our H/Hs of earlier books. In this book they play a much more significant role. Besides, The Secret was also a lovely story and the 2 together are just 10 stars.I have had mixed reaction to the JG stories I have read because they were a bit 'light' to the historical romances I usually preferred. She certainly got my attention with these 2 stories however."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"THE BEST YET!Julie is the best when it comes to Highland Love stories. Couldn't put this book down."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I loved this book and can't relate to anyone that thinks this book lacked depth. Garwood focused on the characters as always. You see lots of dialogue and thought. Brodick is absolutely breathtakingly powerful. Gillian is brave yet innocent. I loved Alec (Maitland). I appreciated that Julie took time to develop the story rather than cramming everything into 300 pages."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"MY GOSH I THINK THIS WAS PROBABLY THE BEST OF JULIE GARWOOD....PERFECT SPIN OFF OF THE SECRET...A MUST MUST HAVE!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I must admit, it's been a while since Ms. Garwood has written a really and truly good story. The characters were well-developed and the plot just complicated enough so as not to be predictably boring. She was my first and, still is, my favorite romance author. This one I just COULD NOT put down! I finished it in a day! for anyone who loves historicals, this one is definitely a must read! :)"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"What an amazing book! Gillian, the sweet heroine, and her love Brodick, the strong Highland warrior with a ruthless reputation, make an incredible couple. From the beginning there is chemistry between these two and unlike most historic novels, we don't spend the whole book with them at odds until the final chapter. It flows so easily that I finished the book within 2 days because it was so hard for me to put down! The characters are so extremely likeable and inspired that this book makes even the hardest of hearts yearn to find and experience the love that these two have. Wonderful reading and would make a great Christmas present.Ms. Garwood is easily one of the finest historical romance novelists around. I have read so many of her books and I have enjoyed each and every one. I particularly enjoyed the fact that this was set in the Scotland Highlands, which I love."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This was a really good book. I cried on parts and laughed in others. This one is a keeper. I've read all of Ms.Garwood books and they just keep getting better. I look forward to the next one!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"... but shallow. I couldn't much connect with this story.Maybe it was because I kept wondering where Ramsey's story was. The back cover promised a story for both Brodick and Ramsey, but all we really got was Brodick's relationship with Gillian. It would have been better if Ms. Garwood had saved Ramsey's story for another book.I also didn't care for the lack of historical depth to this story. John, one of the most wicked men to hold England's throne (so evil that not another king in English history since him has borne his name), was portrayed as basically an okay if confused and inept monarch. The Scots' hatred of him is shown more as unreasoning prejudice against the English in general than as a principled disgust for evil. Gillian's loyalty to her king, as a manifestation of her loyalty to her country, is admirable, but should have been balanced with a more historically correct portrayal of John.I'm giving RANSOM four stars because I appreciate that Ms. Garwood usually portrays sex within marriage. There's not enough of such books out there. My only comment would be that Ms. Garwood should be aware that since she brought up the issue of annulment, she should have researched the issue more carefully. Brodick's and Gillian's marriage was null from the beginning because Gillian had no idea she was consenting to marriage. Such nullity would not have been changed to validity by consummation of the marriage. Thus, Father Laggan (even in medieval times) would have had no trouble petitioning for an annulment on Gillian's behalf."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is another great book by Garwood. I will admit, though, the beginning was kind of confusing with too many characters all at once. But, if you stick with it, all falls into place and it turns into another great read like all of her others. I'm a fan."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"The story line and characters were full of detail and charm. This book reminds me of her books prior to the &quot;Rose&quot; series. Both Brodrick and Ramsey were such strong characters in her previous book with Judity and Ian Maitland that I was glad to see &quot;their&quot; story. However, I felt Ramsey deserved his own book or more of this book to share his story. I feel his character and involvment could of been enhanced in greater detail and length. I liked the pace of the book, it kept moving throughout the story."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Julie Garwood returns to her usual high quality with Ransom. Come the Spring was boring, but this latest novel is full of romance and intrigue. I loved the two love stories, though I thought Ramsey and Brigit could have had their own book. Also, it was great to see how Judith and Ian turned out after reading the Secret. Their little boy is so sweet! A good, fun and fast read."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I began reading Julie Garwood's books on the 15th of August, since then I have completed all of her works except one, and that is because I can't find it yet. I picked up Ransom two days ago, and was only upset because I finished the book so quickly. The strength of the characters was breath taking. As always she relied on intelligence, trust, desire and respect to create dynamic females character, as well as strong male conterparts as well. Mrs. Garwood please take a bow. AND GIVE ME MORE!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This good novel was made better after I read The Secret! Duh -- I loved Brodick in The Secret and was intrigued by Ramsey. I'm very pleased that Brodick was the central character. I am disappointed that more was not done to develop the &quot;sisters&quot; line. I feel that wrap-up was lacking. Overall, however, I liked the book. Different from her others ....."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"The long awaited sequel to The Secret was worth the wait. Julie Garwood has created another terrific adventure combining characters I fell in love with in The Secret with new ones. Her brilliance again noted in her ability to make me laugh and weep. This is another keeper to add to my collection of The Bride, The Wedding and The Secret. I look forward to another Highland romance in the future."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Great book, just wanted to all let you know. If you ever pick up this book and start reading it, you will never be able to put it down again!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"If you are a Julie Garwood fan, you will love this book. The way she writes of the people and the countryside are so descriptive you feel as if you are there. My heart is set on visiting the Scottish Highlands and maybe hopefully catch a glimpse of what I saw through her writing. A captivating story that you won't want to put down...Julie Garwood you have done it again!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love Julie Garwood, but this was great even for her. A wonderful story and great characters. I loved the mystery, the suspense and, of course, the romance. Read it today!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Loved the wit and humor along with the romance.I would have liked to have more written about the characters Ramsey and Bridgid. Ms. Garwood can make up for it in another book about Uncle Ennis. I can't wait for the next one to add to my collection. And don't forget the charcters in the Wedding, Quinlan and Faith."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love all of Julie Garwood's books. Not only is their love and romance, the plot is always great. The biggest plus is the HUMOR she put in it. Keeps me entertained and laughing. Big strong men and strong women. ****** She gets all my stars (6)."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love the continuation books! I loved reading about characters that Julie Garwood had already introduced us to! Wonderful reading! More please!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Well worth reading. I was very disappointed with Garwood's last book; however, she certainly redeemed herself this time. A light, easy read with likeable characters."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This was a wonderfull book and a great romance story. They have reviewed this book as a sequel to &quot;The Secret&quot; but it's not realy a sequel-we do revisit a few old friend from there. It's the story of Brodick and Gillian (and a side story of Ramsey and Bridgid - a very small part of the book), two of Ian's best male friends that were introduced in the Secret. The story is centered around finding a missing jewel box (known as Arianna's treasure that belong to King John's mistress Arianna). I enjoyed this book very much - expecially the part when Brodick and Gillian get married - and when she finds out that she is married. My only disapointment was that Ramsey's and Bridgid story was such a small one - I think they deserved their own story. But it's still a great read and worth the money for a hardcover."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have read all of Julie Garwood's books and this one doesn't disappoint. I love her writing and I love all of her characters."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom is set in the 13th century. The English heroine, Gillian, and her older sister are seperated at a very young age as their father tries to get them out of harms way when the unscruplous Baron Alford attacks their family home stealing not only their home and her father's life, but also his reputation. More than a decade later Gillian is trying to save the uncle who raised her by finding her sister, Christen, and a treasure box her father gave to her sister for safe keeping. Gillian is aided on her quest by two Scottish chieftains who have their own agenda with not only Baron Alford but also with the highland traitor who is working for the Baron. The book is as unforgettable as the love discovered between Gillian and one of the chieftains. To find out if their love can survive, if the highland traitor is discovered, and what is the mystery behind the treasure box, be sure to read &quot;Ransom&quot; by Julie Garwood."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book was truly wonderful. I loved meeting back up with Judith and Ian. I laughed and I cried. I also got thrown for a loop because I thought Brigid was someone that she turned out not being. Way to go! Keep 'em coming!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I read The Secret just before reading this one. It was a wonderful lead-in to Ransom. I couldn't put this book down. I feel in love with Broderick and Gillian. And it was great to include Iain &amp; Judith Maitland. You always wonder what happens to the characters in the other books, and it's great when you see what happens to them."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have read all of Garwood's books and this one was my favorite. I laughed and cried. The characters were terrific and well-developed. I couldn't put it down and have read it at least ten times since I bought it."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"In Ransom, we finally see the long awaited story of Brodick and Ramsey. After reading the Secret, I was captivated with them, especially Brodick, and it is he that Ransom follows closely. Some were concerned after the Rose trilogy that Ms. Garwood had lost her touch, but Ransom proves that she's still got it! I read it in a single sitting, it was so good! I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys chivalry and romance, and Garwood is always terrific for the beginning romance reader as well as the seasoned(my first romance book was a Garwood novel). This book is a must have."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Julie Garwood again doesn't disapoint! Ransom is heartwarming and clever, taking twists and turns that are not the formulas that many romance novels follow. The only slight disapointment is that I wish she had spent a little more time on Ramsey and Bridgid's romance. I like how she split her time between 2 romances in Come the Spring, and I was kind of looking forward to that here. But I always love revisiting old characters of Julie's."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"From the begining to the end the book is great. Ms. Garwood has done it again. The book holds you captive from begining to end. I felt like I was actually in the book with all the charcters. Thanks again and I can't wait for your next book."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Julie, I have all the books that you have written and have read them until the pages have about fallen out - Ransom will soon be in this condition too - I would like to request that you have your books done on audio tape (unabridged!!) that way I can enjoy your books even more. I can hardly wait for your next book - keep typing!! Your admirer in Phoenix - Karen"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom was an entertaining romance. The characters were lively and humorous. I hope to read more Julie Garwood stories from the Scottish Highlands. I highly recommend this book because Garwood does not disappoint."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Oh, Julie, Julie, Julie - THANK YOU!!! This was perfection! RANSOM is as good as your other &quot;keepers&quot; - The Prize, The Secret and The Wedding! I loved them all and this new one rates right up there with them. RANSOM proves you haven't lost your touch like so many of my other old favourites: McNaught, Roberts and Lowell. This wonderful story of Brodick and Gillian was charming, enchanting and felt very real. Yes, Ramsey and Bridget's love story could have been more detailed, but that's OK. And using little Alec (...know what?&quot;) to work back to the Maitland story was a great technique. Needless to say again, THANKS JULIE!!! I loved every page!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Julie Garwood proves that she is a very talented story teller. She will take you back to when men had courage, and women had morels. I have read her new book twice in one week. You will love this sequel to The Secret. Happy reading!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Julie has done it again! The sequel to The Secret was amazingly done, if it did end a bit quickly. I guess she got tired towards the end and just decided to cut it.The beginning was so heartwrenching I couldn't help but cry. Two helpless little girls. Such loyal soldiers. A kind and loving father. It was so devastating. They were torn from their home and Gillian had to witness the murder of her father.Forward to the future and she is saving little Alec Maitland from death. Alec's talkativeness is very heartwarming and you can't help but smile. Once she runs away with him toward Scotland, she enlists the help of Brodick, Laird Buchanan, to bring the boy back to his parents. Along the way, they fall in love.All through the story, Gillian tries to find her estranged sister, who is said to live in the Highlands, with the Macphersons. Ramsey Sinclair is also in this story. He falls in love with the beautiful Bridgid. Since his land borders the Macphersons, Gillian travels there with Brodick after parting with the Maitlands. On their way there, Brodick tricks her into marrying him.Gillian and Bridgid become fast friends, and since Bridgid had blond hair, I thought that she might have been Gillian's long-lost sister. But that was an anticlimax. Gillian's sister didn't want her. It was very disappointing that Gillian couldn't have had a perfect ending.Some of the shortcomings of this book were the fact that Gillian kept on retelling the story of how she was abused by Baron Alford, the same one who captured Alec. There were so many instances where she repeated part of the story or it was written that she repeated the story. Garwood even made Alec repeat what happened to them over and over again. I got so sick of that. Another thing was how they never returned to Buchanan land. I really wanted a description of her home and how the people accepted her. In Ramsey and Bridgid's love story, the details were few and far between. I had no chance to see their relationship develop and throughout the book, it was frustrating how they never came together as a couple until the very end, and even then, all I got was them talking for about two pages, and then it ended with him proposing. Garwood didn't even show me her response. It just skipped right over to Brodick and Gillian, with Brodick narrating that Bridgid and Ramsey went home to get married. I felt that the author could have further developed Ramsey's story.But don't despair. Despite the drawbacks, the good still outweigh the back, and I would definitely read this book again. It has a lot of appeal and emotion. Well-written, if a bit abrupt."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I've read every single one of Julie Garwood's books, and Ransom has to be my favorite over all. All things considered, the book is idyllic yet realistic at the same time, making a dazzling combination.From the very beginning, Gillian, a young English woman, and daughter of a late Baron, and Brodick, a Scottish Laird from the Highlands, (and an original character from the Secret) had sparks sizzling between each other, and although they both had rather different personalities, they didn't clash at all, but made one of my favorite Garwood couples. Gillian faced many fears throughout the book, but Brodick, a true Scot at heart who thoroughly despised the English, generously helped her try to overcome all of them.The story of Ramsey, (also from The Secret), is in the book, too. I admit, I was disappointed that Ramsey and Bridgid didn't have their own novel, but all in all, it was still a great story with two very charismatic characters.The beginning of the story started out wonderful, and it just continued to get better and better. Throughout the story there are many surprises, and a great plot to go with it. There are also a few disappointments like in any decent book, but you are too caught up in the story to pay any mind to it."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love Julie Garwood, but I think this is my absolute favorite. Gillian saves the life of a little boy and has to enlist the help of powerful Scottish Laird Brodick to get him home. And as they travel into the Highlands, Gillian can find her long-lost sister. The sister is key to finding a royal treasure that Gillian needs to save a beloved uncle from evil clutches.We see favorite characters from previous books and meet new characters we learn to love. Grab this book, even if you haven't read the earlier books in the series."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book lets you have another look at some of the characters from &quot;Secrets&quot;. You can continue in their lives and see what happened after the book ended. Broderick was a interesting choice for the second book, but he was mentioned frequently in the first book. Gillian is a wonderful herione. She is strong and gets muddled when she is twitterpated just like everyone else does. Humor as always is in this book. What romance fictional or real doesn't have some. The setting is one of my favorites-Scotland."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have only read 2 of her books first I read Ransom and I just finished The Secret I would never suggest you to read it in that order read The Secret first and then read Ransom YOu will fall in love with the characters so quickly. Julie Garwood is so good at adding humor and romance and drama into her novels. These two novels compliment each other and once you pick these books up they are hard to put down. I promise that they are a great buy."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love JG's writting. Ransom is my favorite of hers. I have read this book over and over many times. The story is very funny and loaded with good old fashion romance. The dialogs were great between characters. Althought, Ramsey and Bridge was a bit short may be they will have their own book later.I have read JG modern romance and like them, but JG is much better at Historical romance. I prefer stories like Ransom with all those Highlanders and Englishs. It's much more enjoyable to slip back into the historical time for a romantic tale.I have read Ransom over countless of time. Specially on a night that I just want to read something fun with a happy ending. If this book ever becomes a movie that even be better!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"JG never cease to amaze me. I love all her books and RANSOM is definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"*Although I've read most of JG's books, I wanted to review RANSOM because it's my favorite. The Prologue is extremely serious, but you'll soon find yourself laughing outright, mostly when the lovable little boy, Alec Maitland is involved.*The ever-present group of friends loyal to the hero, and ultimately, the heroine is a wonderful idea. The characters are always subtle yet charming. JG should definitely stick to this format. (In fact, I was slightly disappointed JG didn't include such a group in the wonderful book HEARTBREAKER.)*The story of Brodick and Gillian is witty, romantic, and thoroughly enjoyable. I love how they met!**BUT...like so many others, I was equally interested in Ramsey and Bridgid. JG should find a way to write their story, no doubt about it. I confess, I read the book the 2nd time with Ramsey & Bridgid in mind first, Brodick & Gillian, second. Both couples are equally endearing. This is the kind of book you can't put down and one you certainly don't want to end."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK! It's so good....I think it was the first Julie Garwood book I read and I became obsessed with her after that. I read this book about 4 times. :o) Im such a loser but it's so good. I recommend this book to anyone it's really funny and cute. I like the hero (?) Brodick cause he's so rude it's hilarious. I like Gillian because she just so cute! I love everyone in this book. Just read it and you'll see what I mean"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I own all of Julie Garwood's books. I love her stories, characters and her wit (I laugh outloud). Her book RANSOM has got to be one of my all-time favorites (I have read it twice). This novel has it all suspense, loveable characters and laughter. Don's miss this one. It definitely is a keeper. I cannot wait for more Julie Garwood books to be published!!!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I really love Ms. Garwood's books. This one was no exception!!! The only complaint that I have is that Ramsey's story was not followed through. This was a disappointment and I think had the making of an excellent story. Even if it had to be a complete separate book."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have followed Julie for many years and after the disappointment of Come the Spring, Ransom restored my faith in Garwood as the First Lady of romance writing. The characters are strong, witty and will keep any reader captivated for hours. I hated when the story had to end but look forward to her next mastepiece."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Julie hardly needs my review, but I must say I've never read a book of hers I didn't like. She makes me laugh. She makes me cry. She makes me fall in love with her heroes. What more could one ask of a book?Ms. Julie Garwood is one of the best historical writers. Her books and characters are so alive and vivid, one totally lives in another time and space when reading her beautiful stories. -Lee Emory"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book was great. The characters were great, and everything was so easy to understand. It was so fun to read, i could not put it down! I am definately going to get more of her books!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have been reading Julie Garwood ever since The Secret was first written and I have been eagerly anticipating Ramsey's story. I loved the book - but I could not help feeling a bit disappointed that Ms. Garwood did not include more of a rich tale about Ramsey and Bridgid. If she had to have two romances in one book, I know that I would have bought a book that was twice as long with equal emphasis on both romances.Ms. Garwood, if you read this, please continue with your Scottish romances - I am now fascinated by the Highlands and its brave, courageous people!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I simply adored this book though I agree with everyone who wrote in that Ramsay should have had a book for himself instead of sharing a teeny little piece at the end which was a pity."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"After having read The Secret and falling in love with Ian, the main character, I couldn't wait to read Ransom. I wasn't disappointed. I laughed at their antics and longed for their passion. This was a most intriguing book."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This was my first Julie Garwood book, but now I'm a fan!! I loved the characters Brodick and Gillian. I can't wait to read more of her work!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I really loved this book, but I had been waiting since &quot;The Secret&quot; for a story that I hoped would focus on Ramsey Sinclair, as he was written to be the more &quot;irresistible&quot;. I enjoyed Brodick but didn't find his character in &quot;The Secret&quot; to be that exciting. At any rate, &quot;Ransom&quot; is well written and I did enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I loved the book. The characters had depth and you could feel their though processes. You could understand the way they would react in certain situations because you could understand the way they though as well as why they thought that way. It was an excellent read."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Gillian claimed to be Brodick's bride to spark his curiousity. He tricked her into marriage to claim her heart. What Brodick didn't know was that in order to claim her heart, he had to give her his. He had to show her he cared.This is a truly heartstopping romance, one that I found I couldn't put down. It's about the brave, stubborn young Gillian who is the only key to finding King John's beloved jeweled box, and the only key to the toughest Hilander Lord, Brodick Sinclair's heart"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"As usual with Julie Garwood's books, I had to make time to sit down and read it in one sitting. I was a little disappointed with Come The Spring, but Ransom is fabulous.What fun to read Brodick's and Ramsey's stories. Everyone I know has been clamoring for this book from the instant they realized Brodick and Ramsey from The Secret had gone to England to find brides as perfect as Judith. How wonderful to revisit with Iain and Judith Maitland, Frances Catherine and Patrick, Winslow and Isabelle,etc. It's a tribute to Ms. Garwood's writing ability how sad you feel when it's mentioned in passing that one of the older characters from The Secret had died; these characters are alive.I would've liked Ramsey and Bridgid to have had their own book, but you can't have everything. If you haven't read The Secret, you don't know what you're missing. Read it immediately and then read Ransom; both are on my &quot;keeper&quot; shelf."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have this book next to my nightstand!. I have both of her books in this series. Wish she could have done a third!! I love scottish historicals, and whenever I feel like having a little bit of comfort, I grab these 2 books and enjoy them over and over again!Try \\"The Secret\\" and \\"Ransom\\"!! They are \\"feel good \\" books!!!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"If you have read THE SECRET, then you would already be acquainted with those two sexy Scottish rogues, Brodick Buchanan and Ramsey Sinclair. As hinted on the ending, Brodick and Ramsey seek Iain Maitland's permission to go wife hunting in England after falling for the charms of Iain's English wife Judith. Now in this book we learn what actually happened to their quest.Brodick and Ramsey are now lairds of their own clan. When Brodick's godson disappears, everyone feared him dead. But little did they know that Alec Maitland was actually abducted by Ramsey's enemies who mistook the boy for Ramsey's brother, hoping to lure him out so as to ambush him. Conspiring with an English baron in search for the king's treasure, Alec was held captive in England, in the same castle where Lady Gillian was kept.Gillian was a mere child when she saw her father and people murdered by Baron Alford. It wasn't until years later that she finds out about the so-called Arianna's box, which the baron accuses her father of stealing from the king. Now all grown-up, the Baron threatens to murder her beloved uncle unless she finds her sister who he believes carries the box, and who is now apparently hiding within Ramsey's clan. So upon learning of Alec's relation with Ramsey, she risks everything to go to Scotland intent on returning the boy to his family and hopefully finding her long lost sister. But one thing she never expected is to fall in love along the way.Taking place seven years after Iain Maitland and Judith's married, RANSOM is a wonderful follow up to THE SECRET and I personally thought that the author outdid herself with this book. I enjoyed revisiting some of the old characters from THE SECRET and finding out what has happened to them since. There's plenty of humor to keep you entertained and I especially loved the banter between Brodick and Gillian and Alec Maitland's childish innocence and candor is such a joy. Gillian is a lovable heroine, courageous and compassionate and just the perfect antidote to Brodick's gruffness and cynicism. And how I enjoyed seeing Brodick slowly lose his heart! The extent he went through just to be able to keep Gillian with him, with the help of Ramsey and his own soldiers, was just delightful. And yes, the way Brodick's soldiers became so protective of Gillian was a riot. I pitied anyone who dared get near her.With its blend of murder, conspiracy and wonderful romance, RANSOM is one of Garwood's best. It was great revisiting some of the old characters from THE SECRET and finding out what has happened to them since. I thoroughly enjoyed it and, together with THE BRIDE, is so far my favorite Garwood novel."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is my 5th Julie garwood book, and she's a wonderful author. My 1st was THE BRIDE, and I was instantly in love with the characters, the story, the splot, the hero, everything, EVERYTHING about the book.. Then i read several other JG's books, they're good, but somehow I can't find the charm, the laughters I got in THE BRIDE, until now.. Thanks to Tanya L. Schaub \\"TSchlaack\\"'s review (you see it below) the minute I read her compare this with THE BRIDE, i purchased right away, without second thought, and how I love this book. It's SOOO sweet, so charming, and .. so long.. yup.. one thing about THE BRIDE is that i hope it would be a little longer. THere are much more going on in RANSOM, the plot is more complexed, and the characters, oh my, the beautiful Gillian, and what can I say about Brodick.. how possessive and masculine can you get..lol.. i love everything about this book, and if possible, I think it's even better than THE BRIDE.. Julie Garwood, you have to write more books like this!!! a MUST read!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Having just finished \\"Gentle Warrior,\\" which was a disappointment, I was eager to recapture the Garwood magic with one of her most popular books--\\"Ransom.\\" I was not disappointed. I read the 500+ pages on this book in a single sitting and could not bear to be torn away from Ms. Garwood's wonderful characters for even a second. I never read \\"The Secret,\\" but did not feel like I missed out by reading this book first. \\"Ransom\\" is one of Julie Garwood's best writings as it is laced with all the elements that make her such a great writer--a courageous heroine, a handsome giant of a hero (with a gentle heart), characters we want to hold close to our hearts, a love that fills your eyes with tears, and an adventure you feel grateful to be part of.Brodick Buchanan finds himself as champion and protector of Gillian, whose life has been painful and difficult, and he knows almost immediately that he will never let her go. Their love story develops quickly and intensely. The moments they share are written so beautifully that you can feel the love between them. Both characters are intelligent and kind, complimenting each other's personalities to perfection, and you want to hold them both close to your heart. Gillian is sweet, kind and noble, but also brave, strong, and so pure of heart. Brodick is the stereotypical warrior, but his demeanor gentles when he meets Gillian. Like he says at some point in the book, the \\"mere wisp of a woman\\" changed his life forever.Read this book. It's beautiful. It will make you laugh and cry and celebrate love. Brodick and Gillian are a treat to get to know. Make them your friends."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"A longtime, avid romance reader, I became captivated with the genre with Garwood's The Bride years ago. She excels at creating fierce heroes, tender heroines, passionate love scenes and situations, and whimsical dialogue. This is true of possibly her best novel, The Secret, and its sequel here, Ramsom. The Secret develops the sparks between an English maiden and her foe/beau Scottish chieftain, Iain Maitland. He returns here along with his friends and fellow lairds Brodick Buchanan and Ramsey Sinclair, and we are glad to revisit them. As in The Bride and Secret, the storyline is along the lines of dueling alliances between an Englishwoman and a Scotsman. But though fun to read, Ransom was an uneven, at times frustrating romance.First and foremost, though the novel is billed as a dual romance (part of the reason I bought it) and it begins with equal development of both romances, the more compelling romantic plot gets left by the wayside until nearly the end. The main romance, between the passionate, stubborn Spartan blond giant Brodick and spunky and loyal Gillian, is fine. Their relationship is interesting but a bit transparent, given their open characters. For this reason, the more covert, subtle and layered characters of Ramsey and Bridgid are more intriguing and deserved their own complete plot development, if not their own novel, as another reader has suggested. The end does finally bring these two together but so quickly it's frustrating! I wanted far more of these two lovers.Second, as in all her other novels, Garwood lapses into some formulaic idiosyncrasies. All her heroes border on brutish and dense (what's wrong with both brawns and brains?) and they go around doing things like (her favorite expression, for some odd reason) &quot;hauling&quot; the heroine along with them, as if their woman were a sack of potatoes. This is the middle ages, not caveman times, even in the Highlands! She also has the annoying habit of conducting repartees between the lovers punctuated with ongoing interruptions where each speaker delays or needs to clarify the obvious. A little of this verbal coyness goes a long way.Third, the lost sister plot had a surprisingly weak and unexpected resolution. I thought all along that Garwood was setting us up with the figure of Bridgid as Gillian's friend, but the actual reunion scene between Gillian and her sister Christen falls flat, and no allusion to an alternative is ever made, though there clearly is one with Bridgid. Many loose threads in this plot.Despite all these flaws, it is an engaging read. Little as there is of them, read it for Ramsey and Bridgid!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Julie Garwood never disappoints. Lock the door, take the phone off the hook and just enjoy. This is definitely a keeper, you will read it again and again and again. Brodick and Gillian are wonderful characters and the marriage scene (or when she finds out they are married) is a real laugh - something a little bit different. It was also wonderful to return to the Scottish Highlands and find out what happened to Judith and Ian from The Secret.Keep it up Julie!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom continues the Highland clans tale of the Maitlands and the connected clans. This is the story of Brodick and Ramsey but leans less toward bodice-ripping romance and more toward the interaction of the characters and the developing relationship between Brodick and his soon-to-be bride. The 'escapism' part for me by far are the heroics of the Highlanders and the undying loyalty toward the English woman who protects a small child. You will love this book and you may laugh outloud when you read it. This is the best Garwood and the best of this series. She turns what could be 'trash' romance into a real story that you become involved in, with a plot that you may indeed know the outcome of ahead of time, but you will love getting there! It's a great read! If you enjoyed Kathleen Woodiwiss when you were younger or Jude Devereaux, pick up Garwood. She's fabulous!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom is a beautiful, epic story about a young English woman's quest to save her uncle, and at the same time three Scottish Laird's journey to take revenge on an evil Baron who has threatened them all. Ransom is also about the developing relationships between Gillian and Brodick Buchanan and Brigid and Ramsey Sinclair.Some reviewers have mentioned that they felt Ramsey and Brigid deserved more time or that they should have had a separate book. They have also commented that Brodick and Gillian were not so interesting. I don't normally comment on other reviews - we all have a right to our opinions after all! - but in this case I just had to respond, as I couldn't disagree more.Gillian and Brodick are a wonderful couple; Gillian is clever and smart as well as beautiful and brave, and Brodick is confident, protective, sexy and brave too. What I loved was that he always had respect for Gillian's abilities unlike many alpha heroes, even when Gillian doubted herself he always reassured her. He even defended her skills to other people rather than belittling her or treating her badly as heroes in other historicals are prone to do with alarming regularity.Gillian and Brodick in my opinion deserve the extra time - although Brigid and Ramsey were great too - because they were much less conventional than the other couple, which made their story even more engrossing. Their dialogue was electric and it was clear to me that they belonged together - no one else would have been quite right for them.Overall Ransom was fantastic and included all the elements I love in a romantic novel. I would caution readers that Brodick and Gillian don't meet up right away, I think it's a hundred pages in, but as the book is 450 pages+ this doesn't matter as the two are together almost continuously after that point so there is plenty of time for their relationship to develop. Read this if you like Scottish Laird meets English Lady stories that are charming, funny and above all romantic. I have a feeling this novel is just what you're looking for.JoAnne"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book was amazing. I think its better than the original book The Secret. It has the same flair for humor that J.G. always immerses in her novels. It will make you laugh (sometimes out loud), cry, scowl, and fall in love with all the characters. This one goes right up there with Saving Grace!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love her books and this one was no exception. Garwood takes you right to the heart of the story and it is impossible to put the book down. I can Ransom over and over, it is her best book yet. I am eagerly anticipating her next novel and I highly recommend her books for ALL romance readers!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is the sequel toThe Secret (Highlands' Lairds). We get to see Judith and Ian and thier sons, as well as Ramsey. I am re-reading this on my kindle for ipad. I read the hardback several years ago.I just adore Brodick and his second-in-command, Dylan. Soooo steaming hot! No, this is not a man crush. Broderick loves Gillian.It is implausible in parts, but I get the feeling that it's deliberate -- all the descriptions of Brodick's super-strength. I think we are supposed to be chuckling at all the mythically godlike and larger-than-life alpha warriors, especially Brodick and Ramsey.The secondary romance with Ramsey and Bridgid was okay. I could take it or leave it.Flaws: The beginning was confusing. At the end, Gillian and Brodick were separated too long -- too much narrative dwelled on her flight to England and her dealings with the baron, so we never got to see Brodick's home. Gillian and little Alec shared a tight bond but she suddenly left, with no goodbye.I can't argue with reviewers who say Brodick is a sexist mcp, but I &lt;3 him anyway. Yummy!!Content: 2 sex scenes, basic swearing, no religious cussing, violence."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I loved this book!!Funny and romantic. Simply great! I actually found myself chuckling now and again at the banter between the characters. And the story kept me interested and althought the plot wasn't a complete surprise, it was good enough to keep me from skiping pages - which I found myself doing more often then not, when I read boring historical novels.I loved the fact that gruff exterior of the hero does not hide the fact that he is a total marshmallow where Gillian is concerned.Even more so that the fisical apearances of both of them wasn't the main reason they fell in love for each other.Love in it's simplest (and lustful) form.I highly recomend it!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is the sequel to The Secret. We get to read the story of Brodick and Ramsey,the lovable warriors from The Secret. Both has set off to England to find brides and came back disillusioned. It is a great story of love,loyalty and revenge."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love Julie Garwood's historical romance novels, especially the ones that have to do with the Highlands. Reading this book was like catching up with old friends from the book The Secret. If you haven't read The Secret you should read that first then read Ransom so that you will be familiar with the characters. You will fall in love with Brodick and his gruff nature but you will see that he is just a pussycat, I just wish that Ramsey and Bridgid's story was a bit more longer. Either way I would definitely recommend this book to read."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Although I've read all of Julie Garwood's books, Ransom is definitely my favorite. Brodick Buchanan wasn't looking for love, or even a woman to call his own, but found one anyway, although he refuses to admit it, even to himself. Gillian has enough backbone for several heroines, but not in a \\"too stupid to live\\" way. Although she puts herself in harm's way, it has to be done. Unfortunately Brodick doesn't agree, and can't believe he's fallen in love with a woman who's determined to save herself despite being married to a warrior. Gillian, however, can't move on with her life until she puts her past to rest."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Brodick is by far my favorite character of all the romance books that I have read, and after having read the first book in this series I was so glad to see his story was told in this book. He makes up his mind almost from the beginning, without any wishy-washy hedging or any attempt to maintain a cold, distance. He knows his mind and he knows his heart and no amount of fear could override that. Gillian needs some persuasion and coercion to come around to his way of thinking, and Brodick is more than happy to accommodate her.There is also a secondary romance in this book between Ramsey and Bridgid. The last book in this series is Shadow Music and includes Brodick and mention of other characters from the first two books. Highly recommended series!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I've always loved how this author so adeptly weaves a tale of intrigue, romance and mystery...(at least with her Historical Romance novels). JG lays a solid foundation right from the beginning of her stories, with strong, well defined and well developed characters and this book is no exception. The banter she lays out between an entire group of characters (I'm thinking of the marriage trickery on the mountain pass) is downright hilarious. gawd I loved it and I was literally laughing out loud being grateful (more than once) that I wasn't sipping coffee (or some other beverage) during those laughable scenes. (I'm bustin' up just thinkin' about it all again)... I loved how JG wove two romances into one (Brodick and Ramsey). Brilliant!I missed the simple Scottish \\"lingo\\" of \\"nay, aye, dinna, doona, or canna\\" etc... It takes away from this type of story when common, modern language and terminology is used. Also, the ending is so abrupt! The dialogue between Brodick and Gillian could've been drawn out a few more pages and ease the reader into a finish rather just droppin' us abruptly.Loved cranky Uncle Morgan!!! Seems like there's always a character like him in all of JG's books..It WORKS! Keep it up JG..you RAWK! (with your Historical Romances that is)."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I am a huge fan of Julie Garwood. I have read every single book of hers. But Ransom is deffinitely my favourite. Why I loved the book? First of all, the heroine is not a weak, silly girl. She is strong and the way she behaves and holds herself when she is in pain was amazing. Second, I can feel the love between Brodick and Gillian every time I read the book (and I assure you, I have read this book for 4 times already). Besides, every single dialog means something and I never got bored while I was reading the book. The third thing is deffinitely this is not only plain romance between 2 people but also there are intrigues and real conflicts pulling the reader in. There are always something happening through the book so you never get bored. I would like to say a little about why I didnt like the book but there is not even one reason!!! 100% loved it !!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This by far is my favorite book by Gardwood and probably one of my top 10 favorite books of all time.

I just can't get into the current-time stuff!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I loved this story!!! If you are like me and you reread all her stories this will be added. It did not lack or miss anything. I came away from this book with a smile on my face. &quot;Come the Spring&quot; and &quot;The Wedding&quot; just seemed to lack the depth that I've come to expect from Julie Garwood and I was hoping and praying to see the old Julie back in evidence. It was wonderful. Now I would like to read all about Nicholas and Clare's story from &quot;Saving Grace&quot;."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is the best Ms. Garwood has produced so far!

Thank you for the stories that women can daydream to."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Anyone who has had the pleasure of reading Julie Garwood's classic tale, THE SECRET, will remember the two lovable rogues, Brodrick Buchanon and Ramsey Campbell. Now they star in their own story. They are matched with obstinate women who are their destinies. Adding to the overall fun is the appearances of Ian Maitland and his spouse (no SECRET as to the title of the book where they are the stars). The duo plays pivotal roles in propelling this story line forward. The plot is crisp, entertaining, and makes Medieval England seem real. Ms. Garwood's sequel is clearly a keeper.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I waffled between giving the book one or two stars, but I ended up giving it two because I didn't absolutely hate it. However, I would not recommend this book to a friend if she asked me for a good read, which is a shame because I think the plot had a lot of potential. Jolly old England in the days of Robin Hood, sexy Scottish highlanders with delicious brogues, murder, long-lost sisters, and a beautiful heroine: sounds like the making of a great romance!! But alas, this book just did not do it for me. I won't bother with a synopsis since plenty of other reviewers have given one; rather, I'll just mention what my major issues with the book were.Gillian, the heroine, is quite possibly the kindest, most courageous, clueless, annoyingly perfect main character I've read in a long time. She's so stoic and humble I often found myself unable to suspend my disbelief that anyone is that good. She also misunderstands situations that anyone with two brain cells would understand. The author tries to portray her as innocent or naive, but I often found myself thinking that she's just stupid. Brodick is so stereotypically uncivilized and testosterone-laden I could not make myself like him. He disregards Gillian's wishes constantly, lies to her repeatedly (and feels no real remorse at all), and shows no respect for her as a partner, and yet somehow she falls in love with him? I couldn't figure that one out! Brodick basically treats Gillian like an overprotected child, which struck me as really unattractive. As for the dialogue, I often found it unrealistic and stilted. Gillian stumbles her way through the Gaelic early in the story and the Buchanan soldiers laugh at her, but then somehow she becomes instantly fluent... except when people are talking about something she \\"shouldn't\\" understand, and then the language barrier pops back up. Brodick often emphasizes his statements with some form of \\"damn it,\\" which after a while became a bit comical to me. And why did the author have to muddle the story with Brigid and Ramsey's poorly fleshed-out romance? They should have gotten their own book. Lastly, the sub-plot about Gillian and her estranged sister Christen was just badly done. Gillian spends the practically the entire novel searching for her sister, but when they are finally reunited their meeting just didn't live up to the hundreds of pages it took to get there. Disappointing. Which basically sums up how I felt about the whole book."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Seriously, 200+ thought this book deserved five stars? This was my first Julie Garwood book and will be my last. I enjoy dialogue between characters, but seriously-- 10 pages of dialogue between the heroine and a six-year-old? The characters were superficial and the amount of dialogue was way overkill. If they hadn't told me the book was set in Scotland and they didn't frequently throw in the word \\"Laird\\" I would have had no idea. There was no culture, no historical authenticity... I agree with another review that said it read like someone's very first novel, and a bad one. I ventured outside of my normal genre of historical fiction and this is what I got. I'm only giving it two stars because it wasn't HORRIBLE, but definitely cliche and boring."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"The story really captivated me, I've read it soooo many times. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I like Julie Garwood's book, seriously, I do but this one is not her best. If she intends on making the heroine brave and all by constantly doing stupid things and not listening to her husband than can she at least make her more braver and stronger instead of getting slap around? It just get me so angry that she goes through these stupid attempts just to injure herself and then have her husband comes along and save her from the stupid mess she gets herself into. Do we female seriously act stupid like that? How can Julie Garwood write a heroine to be this stupid? And how often can she forget that she's mad at her husband for lying to her, breaking promises to her and hurting her feelings. Do we female often let everything slide so easily with just one kiss? One touch? Please!! I'm quite disappointed. I feel as though all her heroines in all the other Highlander romance novels are quite the same way as this one too but at least with the others, Julie Garwood at least write them to have a little more pride than this heroine here in this book. What a disappointment. Check out Maya Banks highlaner series \\"The McCabe\\". You'll find it more enjoyable than this book. Sorry Julie, you disappoint me. I'm ready to move on to another Author."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I won't summarize the story since so many have done so before me and did a better job than I could ever do.This book is the sequel to \\"The Secret\\" but stands perfectly well alone. The plot of the story is very similar to \\"The Secret\\" and immerses the reader right away into the happenings of the story. However, the storyline couldn't maintain this momentum throughout the book and soon after the two main characters met, the atmosphere and suspense of the book dropped, culminating in an absolutely rushed and trivial ending. What a pity! The disappointment for me didn't stop there. I had the impression that certain scenes were far too similar to the previous book, such as the ruckus of the marriage between Gillian and Brodick. Wasn't there a nearly identical scene in \\"The Secret\\"?The heroine is a strong-minded and independent young English lady, whereas the hero is an oversized, strong and absolute alpha male Highlander. Since this book is a sequel, I can understand that there need to be certain similarities. However, the resemblance in characteristics and actions of the central persons to the main characters of the previous installment were far too striking.If you haven't read \\"The Secret\\" I can only recommend \\"Ransom\\". It's a pleasurable, entertaining and well written book of this genre. However, if you read former, then you might get upset by the many \\"close encounters\\" to the previous book."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Good love story even with misspellings on pages 394 and 462.

I do hope Ms Garwood now gives us a sequel for THE WEDDING,I'll be crossing my fingers."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom seems to be a continuation of some of her other stories. Finally, all of Garwood's Lairds have found their soul mates. Ransom follows the same plot as her previous Scottish tales. This story line, however, was more predictable.

I love being transported back in time and living every delicious detail."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book would have been better if the couples were switched though to tell you the truth I don't understand why Bridig was even in the book, she was extremely irritating. Brodick was also another irritating character, I mean like some kind of wild caveman. I Liked Gillian and Ramsey and think they would have made a better couple. This is her first book where I think she overwrote the male lead. This is the first book I've read by JG that I wasn't crazy about but Gillian, Ramsey, Ian and Judith made up for the shortcoming with this one."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I was so enthralled with the book Ransom that I promptly went out and bought the audio book version for my commute. I've purchased many abridged audio books, and though I understand the need for editing to fit the book on a specific number of tapes -- the story lines have always stayed true to the heart of the author's book version. Not true for Ransom and I am terribly disappointed. The abridgement changes the context of the book. The time spent on describing the importance of Arianna's box should have been spent on describing Gillian's fear and pain. The importance of visiting the woman's house to heal her arm is gone -- no mention of the attempt on her life. Even the discovering of the traitor -- changed, much to my disappointment. The actress reading for the audio book has a monotone through-out the tapes that does nothing to express the desire, fear, excitement or thrill that Ms. Garwood wrote in Ransom. Stick with the bound book version and stay away from the audio book."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I found ransom a great read.Interesting from the first page to the last. It has both a story line and romance. A must read for all Garwood fans."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Written in an amateurish, stream of consciousness style, RANSOM reads like an author's first attempt at a novel. The omniscient point of view, deployed arbitrarily, prohibits any sort of conflict or sense of immediacy. Pages and pages of inane dialogue also fail to create intrigue, plot development or chemistry between two-dimensional characters. And we've met these nice, uninteresting people before (although Ms. Garwood &quot;tells not shows&quot; how arrogant, stubborn, brave, gorgeous etc. they all are.) Scores of needless, faceless characters are given names, a smokescreen for the lack of plot.The series of non-events, which fill three-fourths of this overlong book, creep toward a unsatisfying climax, though by the end the reader has forgotten where the story was heading and ceases to care.Try an active voice, Ms. Garwood. Give the heroine something to do besides be pretty, stubborn, and handle flesh wounds well. And more descriptions of settings and descriptions sprinkled throughout might have helped; often the voices spoke from a void.Nothing is more wonderful than a historical romance where the hero and heroine conquer insurmountable odds to be together in love and a happy ending.Unfortunately in RANSOM, neither the characters nor story was up to it."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I haven't read a Julie Garwood in 10 - 20 years. I did enjoy some; Lion's Lady, The Bride, and even \\"The Secret.\\" But, nothing has changed with her historical novels. Still flaky and almost child-like heroines. This was a long and ridicules story. Sorry Julie, I have out grown your historical novels. I still think she is a talented writer, her contemporary novels are not that bad. Sorry . ):"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I am very shocked to see so many reviews with five stars for this novel.It was bad, I mean real bad.Some one gave this to me several years ago, and I tried to read it then but it seemed so silly. I picked it up again thinking maybe I would change my mind (I have done that before). It was just as silly as the first time but I bore with it for the most part though I will admit I did some scanning.Besides the main flat characters, the long juvenile plot, and the horrid dialogue (the women's speech and thoughts are also juvenile) there is very little historical content. And it is over four hundred pages! The time period of the book was supposedly around the 1200's but very little in the book referenced that time period, facts or customs.It read like four hundred pages of romance clich&eacute;, but I suppose some people enjoy that style, and I am not knocking them. I just prefer a bit of substance when I read, and this book does not have any.Truth be told, romances can be a bit like fantasy. However I prefer mine with a touch of reality."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Historical details are woven into the plot of this novel, which is about the romance between two English Navy officers in the 18th century."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This was my second Julie Garwood book, my first being Honor's Splendour-which I definitely reccommend! This book wasn't as good as HS. For one, the hero and the heroine don't even meet till page 125. I like my romances to start off at the beginning even though this is a long book, it doesn't make up for it! Also, Brodick doesn't change at all, he always remains the domineering egotistical one who always gets what he wants. He does want gillian to be happy though, even though if she does get her own way , the reader knows that he would be miserable. I also wish that Gillian and Brodick had more time to talk and had more witty banter with eachother, but Gillian is off making friends with Bridgid and Brodick is busy doing something or other. I thought it was sweet that Brodick liked Gillian because she was a strong woman and that she could stand up to him and so forth, *SPOILER* but I felt like he was taking advantage of her by marrying her when she didn't even know it, what is up with that! What happened to that little boy Alec anyway? I guess Gillian didn't care about him at all once he returned to his parents, maybe he was just a way for Brodick and Gillian to meet. I also don't understand how when they only knew eachother for such a short time, they were already going to get married. There are also good points to the book though, Gillian and Brodick do have some witty banter and they do have good sexual tension. Brodick does do some stupid things though later on, which are annoying, he even admits to using her later on, but he says that is only because he wanted to protect her. The book is fluffy is a way, but there is a story line about a jewled chest that gillian needs to find to save her uncle. I guess this book didn't appeal to me that much because the hero was not tender and gentle and romantic with the heroine and that is what I like."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I'm a fan of Ms. Garwood, but please madame, try to enforce some shrewdness into your heroine's character. Gillian just irritated and upset me throughout the novel. She is described as having a strong character, but does nothing to emphasize this. I found her dense, very slow in the brain, and lacking, especially when the priest was marrying her to the hero (couldn't she get the hint that she was getting married, how stupid can a person be!) As for the hero, I must admit that for the setting of the story, he was described in such a way that did justice to his character as a Scottish laird, even if all he wanted to do was to get her in the sack."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I am a huge Julie Garwood fan, I buy her books as soon as they are published. I have recently read Ransom for the second time, I knew I was disappointed the first time but I couldn't put my finger on why. Well, I figured it out! My main problem is with Gillian, she is made out to be this strong woman with thoughts and opinions of her own, but she never demonstrates to the reader any actions to back that up. I miss the heroines like Judith from &quot;The Secret&quot; Strong characters need to do more than think strong thoughts they need to take actions too! I am still looking forward to reading Ms. Garwoods next book, hopefully it will be more fulfilling!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"The kindle version has a few pages out of order, which is incredibly frustrating. Luckily I have the print version and could figure out what was going on. I informed Amazon about it but don't buy the digital version until it's fixed."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"The prologue of the story was great I didn't get into the story till the 2nd or 3rd chapter. Personally felt like there was TOOO many characters to keep track of at the beginning. Not only were there 3 seperate lairds, there were 2 kids, there men and additional minor characters to keep track of. Most of them were ok but the extra warriers that Julie Garwood mentioned seemed inconcequential and unnecessary.The plot was interesting but to dilluted. The story began with Gillian , the main character, and her sister were sent out of their house because they were being attacked. Their father's last dying wish for Christine (Gillian's sister)was to take and hide the king's treasure box. There was a struggle and Christine escaped, Gillian was captured by the evil Baron, and their father was killed. Years later, the evil Baron and an unknown Highlander were conspiring to kidnapp a boy named Michael, Laird Ramsy Sinclair's brother. Instead, they kidnapped the wrong boy. They kidnapped another Laid's son named Alec. Gillian meets Alec when she accidently finds him susspended by a thin rope over a cliff/gorge. Anywhoo, she saves him and he learns to trust him. After she distracts the evil Baron's attention away from the boy, she recieves a severe beating. She finally escapes with the boy and calls upon Brodick Buchanan. But before she leaves, the evil Baron tells Gillian that he will hold her Uncle Morgan for ransom..so she can find and bring her sister and the the treasure box.The story had a lot of tender moments, when she was getting her arm wound taken care of , Brodick sympathized with her ...well kinda and helped to hold her arm down. Or when he found out she was physically abused, he tried to do everything to get their names. Overall, just a good book. Mainly because of the extra needless characters and the too complicated plot twist. Furthermore, the climex wasn't what it was supposed to be. The man is going against his word and essentially 'lying' to her about going there and getting the evil baron's butt kicked ... despite knowing about the ransom. And what does she do?? Gets mad momentarily and forgets about it. The book would of been a lot better if this tirade didn't just make a big flop."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is the second Julie Garwood novel I've read now, the first was 'The Secret' which overlaps with 'The Ransom.' I was, I think now, unduly impressed with 'The Secret'--I thought it was remarkable for busting out of the romance genre's strictly adhered to rules and formulas. What I've found, now that I've read a second Julie Garwood novel, is that, while she eschews the genre's standard tripe, she's created a set of rules and formulas of her own. I suppose I'm naive to be surprised and disappointed by this, but I am.Now, to be fair, I enjoyed 'The Ransom.' The story is actually more fraught and intriguing than 'The Secret.' The novel begins with a series of tragedies in a toddler's young life--her mother dies, her home is invaded by brutal warriors, she's separated from her older sister, and she witnesses her father's murder at the hands of one of the invaders. Thus begins the adventure that sets the heroine on the path that will eventually lead her into the arms of her strong, heroic, handsome highlander. Our heroine proves to be strong-willed and brave, and, of course, gorgeous and sweet.I enjoyed the adventures as well as the romance, but was disappointed with the limited role that the characers from 'The Secret' played, and the overly quick progression of the romantic track. I found this novel less charming than 'The Secret,' but that may mostly be due to the transparancy of Garwood's formula now shining through and detracting from the novel's impact."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is a must read for any fiction reader, not just romance. I have re-read this book four times since it was published and still enjoy it. If you have never read a Garwood book, I would start here, then read The Bride, The Wedding, and the complete set of For The Roses series."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have never told my husband to leave me alone because I'm not doing anything until I finish a book, but that is exactly what I did with this book. It ranks as one of the best fictional books I've ever read. It had much more to the plot than any other Garwood book. The heoroine by far made the story. She was so courageous yet at the same time you loved her vulneralbe side. The villians in the book are the most dreadful of any romance that I've read. I was dissappointed that the hero broke his word one time. In the end though it doesn't matter. Brodick is a hero we love no matter what. This is a DEFINATE for lovers of romance. I loved that is was over 500 pages becaue I did not want it to end. Thanks Julie - You've really outdone yourself this time."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love Julie Garwood books. I can't wait until her next one comes out. Ransom lke all of her book held my attention. Could not put it down. Took it everwhere with me. You become so involved with the main people. She makes them very real. You can picture just what they look like. It's like a movie running in you head. I could not wait to see what happened next. This book like all of hers left me wanting more. I highly recomend this book to any one who like to read a good gripping story."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom is the best book written by Julie Garwood. Ever. The book featured everything a good historical romance novel needs to keep the reader enthralled. The plot was exciting. The pacing of events was perfect. I almost felt like I was watching a movie. I wasn't even aware of turning the pages as I became more and more engrossed in what was taking place. All of the characters were well-rounded. Heroic, but human, strong, but flexible, etc. They seemed like real people. A touch of humor could only make this recipe for romance a masterpiece. Throw this in your shopping cart and whip up some today, you'll be thrilled with the results!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I truly enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down until I finished it. I was sorry it ended and I hope Garwood writes a sequel -- possibly with Ramsey as the main character. The relationship between Brodick and Gillian is so touching and I also enjoyed the love that little Alec had for Gillian. This is a definite keeper and I will probably read it again in a few months."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have read a few of Julie's books and generally liked most of them. Castles is one of my shelf keepers. Having said that, it seems like she is falling into the same pit as a lot of other writers who write historical as well as contemporary romances, using modern phrases in historical settings. There was way too much modern terms being thrown around in this book.Terms like \\"letting you off the hook\\"A big hulky highlander using a word like \\"unseemly\\"And a little boy who constantly uses the term.. \\"know what?\\"All these and a bunch of others didn't seem to fit into the book.Also, the story of Brigid and Ramsey should have been a separate book. I feel completely unsatisfied with their story... like eating a big slice of chocolate cake only to have it be dry and tasteless.The book dragged in a lot of places, and I found myself reading things that had already been explained over and over in the book previously. It is almost like she was repeating things to extend the book. I found myself skipping pages just to try and muddle through it.I really wish writers would stick to one genre. If you want to write historical romances, then just do that. If you want to write contemporary, then do that. There are very few writers out there who can do both."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Julie Garwood has written a number of books based on English ladies and Scottish lairds during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries such as The Bride, The Wedding, The Secret, Ransom and Saving Grace. The Secret was the first Garwood novel I read upon the recommendation of a friend. I really enjoyed that book and I was thrilled to learn that it had a sequel. That discovery happened five years ago and I keep coming back to these books and have to read them at least once a year, especially Ransom.Ransom concentrates on Brodick Buchanan and Ramsey Sinclair eight years after The Secret ends. Enter Lady Gillian who's on a quest to find her sister and the treasure box in order to ransom her Uncle Morgan from the evil Baron Alford. By rescuing a Highland boy, she's able to enlist the help of Brodick and his friend Ramsey. While trying to help Lady Gillian, Ramsey discovers he has problems of his own one of which is Bridgid KirkConnell. As luck would have it there is an happily ever after.Let's face it, the characters are stereotypical and the plot predictable; however, for me it's the interaction and dialogue between the characters that keep me entertained. The witty banter is refreshing and Garwood even provides laugh-out-loud moments of pure mirth that will have others curious about what your reading."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"In my opinion that costly flaw is not necessarily with this book, nor this author but with her publishers refusing to have her books with speech to text feature.I really like Julia Garwood and I would definitely buy more of her work if it had this feature. I and many others only can read if it is a multy task operation.For instance I take the book into the room I am working in and Play is out loud as I work. Sort, of like books on tape or plug in and listen on the commute to work. I have had this book in my Kindle for at least a 1 year and have just taken the time to read.It's a wonderful story. Has all the things I like in a romance. Laughter, humor, intrique, sorrow and triumphant love story and love scenes, but because of it's ONE flaw I just now got to it. I can;t afford to buy stories that I don't have time to read. So, unless I already bought her story without this feature, I won't be purchasing any others.I cannot recommend to anyone who wants to have text to speech feature. I know this is a costly error in the long run for I read a LOT and so do my FRIENDS.Consider Speech to Text PLEASE!!!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is such a wonderful series and have read The Secret several times before I learned about the speech to text feature.

I love to return to these stories over and over and would gladly purchase them again if the speech to text feature was available."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"It was really good but Ramsey was hardly in it and it bothered me his appearance was only described as handsome and nothing more.

I've already bought 12 that are on my TBR shelf and am hoping her comtemporary romance will be as good as her historicals since I pretty much just grabbed everything w/ her name on it lol."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I've read all of Ms. Garwoods books, and have rarely been disappointed. A few are not up to her standards, but they will still find an audience. The books I have disliked the most have been the few where the heroine was a silly whining ditz. The heroine in Ransom is beautiful, strong, intelligent, resilient but a little unrealistic. Our heroe is everything you could want in a man. My problem was that the plot, which was interesting, was at the expense of really developing the relationship between the heroine and heroe. And, may I be frank, the physical side of their relationship was not nearly as detailed or well explored as in some of Ms.Garwood's earlier books. Including Ramsey and Bridget's romance was an interesting aside, but I would have preferred that it had been a separate book so that it could have been more fully explored. While I don't rate this book as her best, ( that's reserved for &quot;The Prize&quot;)I still found it to be a good read and recommend to others who enjoy Ms. Garwood."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book was great. I loved the characters, the story line, and all aspects of the book. I have read every book Julie Garwood has written, and she has not disappointed me yet.

Keep writing about this area Ms. Garwood and keep books of this calibor coming to avid readers like myself. I personally Thank You."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love all of Julie Garwood's books, but this was one of my favorites. She makes her characters funny and human as well as romantic.

A friend left it on my desk at work and said I'd love it! I certainly wasn't disappointed. I fell in love with the characters and the beautiful scottish highlands. As for the two main chacaters, Gillian; firey, beautiful and determined. And Brodick, honourable, handsome, equally firey himself. The two - what a combination! It was fast paced and kept me turning the pages way into the wee small hours.

And read it I did...almost in one sitting! I could not put it down.I love Garwood's intense descriptions both of the action between the characters and of the subtle emotions that take place behind each characters thinly veiled exteriors. The book is a fast read and is richly detailed.I was very excited to see that Ransom is a return to the characters already introduced in The Secret. I haven't read that book but I fully intent to go out and get it tonight!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom is a great story. Julie Garwood keeps you turning the pages so you won't miss out on the action. Gillian shows lots of courage and is a heroine who is witty and strong. She recognizes the short comings in herself and keeps her promises. Gillian is faced with many perils including meeting her hero, Broderick. He may not be the best leading character Garwood has created but he is certainly interesting. I love stories set in the Highlands and Garwood does a wonderful job of telling this story. It reads more like a mystery than a romance, however the story keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next plot twist. If you like historical romances than this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I absolutely loved this book! Unfortunately, I read it before The Secret, where Brodick and Ramsey first appear. But hey, it was enough to make me go out, buy The Secret and read it in 3 days! I thought it was very well written, I enjoyed the dialogue and thought that Brodick and Gillian's love for one another was touching. It was sweet to see how love can change people for the better, which I think is true in real life! I'd recommend this to any romantic. I do wish they'd given Ramsey and Brigid their own story--especially since Ramsey was a big key to the story. It was a little hard to believe Ramsey falling for Brigid when their contact in the book was quite limited. All in all though, I thoroughly enjoyed Ransom. I've read it twice in 3 months! And, it spurred me to go out and buy 2 more of Garwood's books!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I really liked this one! I read it, loved it, then proceeded to re-read The Secret (the first introduction of Brodick and Ramsey) as well as my entire Garwood collection (with the exception of the Roses series - yuck!). A minor downfall in the beginning -- there is maybe a little too much information to grasp. But alas, things pick up as Brodick and Gillian meet. I enjoyed Brodick's character as I did in The Secret. I had a constant silly grin on my face throughout the majority of the book and much to my own embarassment, laughed out loud quite a few times. I did find Gillian a bit questionable, but could deal with that. She was fearless and courageous one minute and accident prone the next? Whatever. I enjoyed the incessant dialogue and witty bantering of these characters much more than reading paragraph upon paragraph of blah, blah, blah. There were things I didn't understand such as the loose end of Gillian's nightmares and a few other things.I agree that Ramsey and Brigid deserved their own novel and would have preferred the hint of a relationship forming in Ransom only to have it blossom into their own special story. All things considered, I highly enjoyed this book and did NOT want it to end, therefore I had to read it two more times! Thank you Ms. Garwood!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I absolutely love the way Julie Garwood writes and have been waiting a long time for a new book! It seems whenever I am reading one of her stories, I just can't put the book down! This one is no different! I loved the story and rate it right up there with The Wedding as one of my all-time favorites! The romance between Brodick and Gillian was so tender, and the fighting so fierce that the two parts complemented one another! I can hardly wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is the first book I've read by Ms. Garwood. She's got me hooked!! I find it hard to put the book down. It's not your typical romance, it's got it all -- suspense, laugh-out-loud humor, and, of course, the reason we all read romances, steamy sex!Ms. Garwood is an excellent writer. The characters are well developed and her writing easily pulls you into the story. I highly recommend this book and will look for other books by her."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have enjoyed every book written by Julie Garwood. This one was no exception. My one complaint is I don't think there was enough written about Ramsey and Bridgid. I think that would have been an amazing story. I hope she'll get around to writting about them."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"To Ms. Garwood: I own every book you have ever written and was absolutely delighted to find some of my most favorite characters in this book. This book is so filled with love and laughter that I *had* to read it from cover to cover, and was sad to finally close the book on such vivid personalities. Should you be inclined to allow any of the other characters fall in love in a third book, I would be thrilled!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I'm one of those people who says she wouldn't be caught dead with a romance novel. Imagine my surprise when a friend loaned this to me and told me it was a mystery, which she knows I love and I finally relized it was a romance! Julie Garwood lovingly developes her characters; she interests, involves and excties this reader and tells me a wonderful story. I ran right out and bought the &quot;prequel&quot; &quot;The Secret&quot; wherein we meet the Maitland clan and many of &quot;Ransom's&quot; characters. My note to Ms Garwood is, 'Please, please', take us home with Gillian Buchannan to the places and people she has not met, and keep us in touch with the Sinclairs and the Maitlands. A trilolgy would be such a joy!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book took off from the very first page and it never let up. I wouldn't expect any different from Julie Garwood. She is one of the most talented writers of our time. I felt as if I was in the Highlands from her descriptions. I loved the characters, Brodick and Gillian. You could just feel the love and desire between the two of them. I enjoyed this book and you will too."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have just recently finished reading Ransom. It is by far the best book I have ever read. The author really knows how to get the reader in the book. I felt every one of the carachters emotions. I could not put the book down. At the end of every chapter, I had to keep reading because I was in suspense. The storyline was very interesting and the landscape very descriptive. The love between Brodick and Gillian was so strong that it made them seem invisible. It was simply amazing. Thank you."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"It's hard to choose which one of Ms. Garwoods books are the best. This one is no exception......It keeps your attention from the very first page. I love how you can read her books and know the characters from other books and catch up on what has been going on with them yet if you have'nt read any of the other books you would'nt know that they are not new characters. I can't wait for the next book!!!!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"i thoroughly enjoyed the book. it was funny and i just fell in love with the heroes and the heroines . it was a book worth waiting for. i really liked the chemistry between Brodick and Gillian. They sounded like they were made for one another. As i'm such a fan of romantic comedies, this one goes to one of my must-haves. i really loved it."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"If you liked &quot;The Bride&quot; or &quot;The Wedding&quot; (both by Garwood) this is a must read! We meet again in this novel Iain &amp; Judith Maitland, as well as Ramsey and a new cast of friends. This book will make you laugh and cry with the characters. They hero and heroine are so vivid they almost seem to walk right out of the pages to tell you their story."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"&quot;Ransom&quot; is a delicate tapestry of intrigue, suspense, passion, and love. Garwood authored a beautiful tale that grabbed my interest and kept it until the very last page. My only wish was that she had split the dual stories into two books and would love to see an additional book about Ramsey and Bridgid."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have long time been a fan of Julie Garwood. There are some books I don't care for that seemed to do well in the mass market, *cough* for the roses. This book is probably one of my all time favorites of Ms. Garwood's work. I love the Secret which is probably on of the reason's I like this book. Revisiting old characters, humor, and a bit of mystery are the perfect ingredients for Ms. Garwood's work. The main characters are strong, flawed, and loyal. I wish Ms. Garwood would return to her true talent and background, the highlands."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"this book was the first garwood book ive ever read and i cannot put into words how amazing it is. its a light read and has tons of humor in it, which is a big plus for me. i loved all of the characters...i loved everything about the book! it is without a doubt one of my favorites, as are most of her other books...i definitely reccomend saving grace...it is a must read, as is this one!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I'll skip the synopsis since many of the reviews have already thoughtfully provided them. :)After reading The Secret, I knew I just had to pick up its sequel. Brodick was such an interesting character. I feel as though this book dulled Brodick's personality. Throughout the book, I kept hoping that Julie Garwood would show more facets of Brodick's character. Also, I was hoping that she would provide more details about Ramsey and how he found love. The brief glimpses you see of Ramsey and Bridgit are the same scene on repeat. It'd be better if she took out Ramsey's story or make another novel out of it. It would be much more appealing. I'm not saying that this isn't a great love story. It just lacks some of the finer points that have been in her other novels."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This was only my 2nd book by Julie Garwood, followingThe Secret, and I think I found a new (to me) author to glom. I just LOVED these books!Brodick Buchanan was a secondary character inThe Secretthat had \\"hero\\" tattooed on his forehead, so I was more than happy when I found out thatRansomwas \\"his\\" book. He was the typical alpha hero and we all know what happens when this kind fall in love. They fall hard and forever, but not always have the grace of acknowledging the fall, LOL. Brodick was just like that, and it was funny to see him trying to deal with it. When he told Gillian that SHE loved HIM, I giggled like a schoolgirl. And when he tricked her into marrying him, I laughed like a lunatic. That was one short-lived Big Misunderstanding I had no problem with. \\"On a horse? I was married on a horse?\\" Too funny! I doubt Brodick would get away with his antics in real life but he just turned out to be one of my favorite heroes in Romancelandia.Gillian was perfect match for Brodick. She didn't need to be coddled, which was refreshing when it comes to heroines in Romancelandia. Not that she was harsh or anything like that, she was just strong and independent. And yet, once she fell in love with Brodick, she wasn't afraid to admit she needed him to make her happier and she enjoyed talking and sharing her feelings with him. If I have a minor quibble about her, it's her behavior near the end of the story, when she almost drove her uncle crazy with her crying over Brodick: it was a bit out of character but, all things considered, it didn't bother me much. It did make me smile imagining her uncle's \\"suffering\\". :)As for the plot, I was a little confused in the beginning: there were so many players and so much going on that I felt kind of dizzy. Why hadn't Gillian been killed by the villainous Baron Alford? Was Gillian's sister truly alive? How did Gillian and Alec meet considering how prisoners are supposed to be kept isolated? So many questions... Thankfully, everything started making sense soon enough and there was no stopping after that. Great story!There was a secondary love story involving Ramsey Sinclair, a friend of Brodick's who also appeared inThe Secret, and Bridgid, a member of the Sinclair clan. It was nice, funny but underdeveloped. Ramsey and Bridgid were very interesting characters, their (few) interactions were funny and entertaining, and I think they deserved a book fully dedicated to telling their story. I didn't get to see the build-up of their relationship, especially on Ramsey's side, so it was kind of disappointing to see their HEA crammed into Brodick and Gillian's.This was a long book (546 pages) but, frankly, it didn't feel like it. It was filled with romance (duh!), humor, action, intrigue, suspense, some angst, and wonderful characters that I couldn't help but love. A true keeper!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Now, when most people think of Historical Romances, they wouldn't be necessarily wrong if they lumped it all into the Harlequin Romance genre. But a well-written Historical Romance or HR for future reference, can be a beautiful thing! I never read an HR for the sexual content, as is the first comment I get when I tell them I'm reading this genre. The sexual content is least of what interests me, if at all! A well written HR explores much more! It is usually a study in period norms which includes dress, habits, transport, architecture, literature, art, lifestyle, fashions, speech, vocabulary, historical facts and characters loosely or not so loosely based in fiction, etc.!!!Julie Garwood captures these features in her characters with Ransom! She has a truly refreshing take on the dashing knight and the princess-in-need-of-rescue theme! ...www.ramblingsofbookworms.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I am a Julie Garwood fan and have read most of her books. I especially like her historical fictions books. THIS BOOK IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!!! I have read it many times. When one paperback copy fell apart, I purchased the book again. The love story of Brodick and Gillian is just great. Although the book also has a secondary romance between Ramsey and Brigid, it's really Brodick and Gillian's story. They click on all levels. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a great romance, historical romance, Highland romances, Julie Garwood, etc., etc., etc."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I've had this book for so long now and I just kept passing it up to read others. After reading The Secret last week, I decided I would go ahead and read it. I thought it was so long that I would definitely get bored, but to my pleasant surprise, I never did. The story just kept moving and it didn't get bogged down with musings over the same emotions, as often happens. I wish I had known Brodick just a little better. Other than that, the other characters were well developed and I cared about them. Very enjoyable and a quick read."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love this book so much that I tell my girlfriends to get their own copy...cuz I'm not sharing mine! I have re-read it a dozen times and find something new to enjoy each time. This book takes you on a journey, so be prepared to settle in and let it unfold at it's own pace. It's well worth it. The plot is engaging, the characters strong, and there's enough hot-steamy-stuff to keep you warm at night. You will be enthralled by the chemistry between the lead characters, be charmed by a little boy, and wish you could lay your heads on a man like Brodick. Great summer reading!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Excellent I loved it !! I could not put it down !!!I was great to see more of Broderick and Ramsey"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book is one of my favorites. It is destined to be a classic."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"&quot;Ransom&quot; started out very strongly with a very well developed plot and likeable characters,however, I felt that once Gillian and Brodick met, the story fell flat....I believed this for a couple of reasons...the first reason being...All of the attention was focused on the development of the plot, but we were rushed into Gillian's and Brodick's relationship...for this reason, I didn't care overlymuch about the outcome of their love....But my main problem with this book was that we didnt really get to know Bridgid and Ramsey...I was so interested in them..I feel that they should have gotten their own book...all in all ..not a bad read...there were some definite perks..for instance, I adored Alec..he was so sweet...and I really enjoyed Bridgid with her myriad proposals.....This book had such promise, but there were just too many loose ends when it was all over and done with.....NOT Garwood's best."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I read this book last year yet didn't write a &quot;review&quot; for it right away. I didn't know exactly what to rate it then. I read it the second time today and finally realized that I have mixed opinions about this book. One minute, I am loving each page... then next minute, I am somehow full of uncontentment. I don't want to say that I am totally disappointed in this book because I am not. It's just that there are many things I preferred would have turned out differently. Like for instance, I strongly feel that Ramsey Sinclair and Bridgett deserve their own book. Their love story was too endearing to be hastily combined with Brodicks and Gillian. In THE SECRET (prequel of this book), Ramsey was described as the most handsome of the three Laird friends (Iain, Brodick &amp; Ramsey). He was always composed, nonchalant &amp; roguish. Therefore, he deserves to have a longer story line. His love story would have truly been a fascinating read. I was also disappointed in how Julie Garwood twisted Christen's character in the end. It was too sad for me to know that after all the childhood closeness of Gillian and Christen, they had to go on seperate ways in the end. I don't want to ruin it for others but I simply must mention this part so that readers will be prepared. Perhaps I expected a warm reunion that is why I was devastated by Christen's decision. It was dreadfully annoying considering all the search and all the hard works Gillian put in just to find her... It was rather selfish of Christen to only think of her own self. Not even asking about her sister's sacrifices. Gillian went through a lot more than her! No matter how scared I would be to be in Christen's situation, I truly would still prefer to have a relationship with my sister. I would be happy to see her - I wouldn't act the way Christen did. I also found it a bit unbelievable that Christen would rather not have anything to do with Gillian considering their closeness once before. What hurt would it do for Julie Garwood to simply soften this part up and made it a warm reunion between sisters? I mean, There were so many protectors involved in this book! What is one more Lady to protect, huh? Oh well, that's just a small niggle in my part. Others might not have a problem with this.As for Gillian and Brodick, their love story was unique and electrifying. I don't have any problems with their romance and developement. I enjoyed their banters! I enjoyed their adjustment to each other (esp. Gillian's adjustment to the Highlands and to Brodick's clan who live like a Spartan-now that was a riot!). I love the Buchanan clan. They are all fierce, possessive, protective and BEARY lot. Gillian is a strong &amp; courageous Lady. Truly what Brodick deserves.Since I love the prequel of this book, The SECRET, I enjoyed reading updates of Judith and Iain. I love the part wherein their son was involved in the plot. It was unexpected and the conclusion was heart warming. The action/mystery twist of this book was also exciting. It didn't overshadow the romances involved but added a tasty spice to it all. Overall, RANSOM was an interesting &amp; worthy read despite some of my small complaints above. However, compared to THE SECRET, this one couldn't past as one of &quot;Julie Garwood's Best&quot;."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love Julie Garwood books, especially ones that are set in the medieval era as this one is. I remember having read this book well over 10 years ago, but I was most likely too young to appreciate and fully comprehend the storyline at the time (I say this only because I seem to only remember the prologue before I realized I had read this book in the past and knew I had liked it then but did not recall the rest of the story). This book DID NOT disappoint the seond time around. I enjoyed it so much I had to go back and re-read some of the chapters in the beginning that really made an impression on me. I loved the fact that the heroine, Lady Gillian, knew and readily admitted her love for Brodick Buchanan without hesitation each time he asks her, even though he never fully tells her his feelings. She is a strong character who is not afraid to stand up for what she believes in and protect the people she loves, yet is a gentle lady and appreciates everyone around her. The young boy Alec is so endearing...if this was a movie, I'd say he stole the scenes in which he was in. I can almost picture and hear him asking \\"you know what?\\". I would have loved a separate book on Ramsey though. I feel he got cheated out of having his own story :-(."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have a weakness for Julie Garwood books, and repurchased this book in Kindle format after buying the original version many years ago. While there are a few formatting errors, there is also a gap in content starting at location 5869. It appears there are several pages missing. Extremely annoying -- will be returning this book."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have to admit I'm really not a Julie Garwood fan, But Ransom is the Jewel of the collection. It was an excellant adventure.Gillian, a stubborn and willful woman has to go and find her sister Christian in the Highlands to retrieve Arianna's box for the horrendous Baron Alford in order to save her Uncle Morgan. Arianna's box is this magnificent jeweled box King John had commissioned for his mistress Arianna based on this legend. Arianna was murdered and the box stolen. King John has been searching for years, Baron Alford is obsessed with the box and wants to find it so he can get the reward for himself. Alford attacked Gillian's home Devanshire and killed her father. Christian had gotten away but Gillian was trapped. Now she's right in the middle of the tangled web of chaos. This is where she runs into Alec Maitland, a little boy of five years old who is about to fall off a cliff. Her and Alec escape from Devanshire to try to make it to Brodrick, Alec's Uncle and champion.Brodrick is a warrior who does not compromise. He is strong, willfull, and just as stubborn as Gillian. They make a pretty interesting couple.There are two love stories in this book. The second couple is Ramsey Sinclair, new and young laird of the Sinclairs, and Brigid KirkConnell. The book mainly focuses on Brodrick and Gillian, but Ramsey and Brigid are definietly there too.You won't be disappointed with Ransom. It truly is a good book, it has the right amount of everything.This is a book I would read again."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I am so impressed with the novel, Ransom , by Julie Garwood. The main characters Gillian and Brodick were such a delight to read about. They were so funny together. My favorite scene was when Father Flanaggen announced to Gillian, Brodicks trickery. I laughed so hard. Julie Garwood brings the characters to life with this read. I felt I was watching it the whole time. I am going to read this one again in the near future. And I don't ever read novels twice. Pick this one up, you will be glad you did."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I've read many of Julie's books and although I've never read one of her books that I didn't like, this is one of my two favorites, the other is The Bride! They story is well told and includes many storylines. Ramsey's love story is the weakest but like Lady Gillian, he didn't impress me as much as Brodick! Believe me, if your a fan of Julie's books, you'll enjoy Ransom"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"4 1/2 stars. I found this to be a very enjoyable book and it kept me interested throughout. From the first page I was hooked. It was fast paced, funny, entertaining and romantic. I loved the relationship between Gillian and Brodick because it evolved and wasn't forced. Yes they fell in love quickly, unbeknownst to the both of them, but it wasn't contrived as in some cheesy romances I've read. It was inevitable that they were going to be attracted to one another b/c they had so much chemistry. There is so much to this story that I won't break down the plot for you as others have done. I'll just say that the plot was really good and there was a also good sense of mystery involved. I also liked the secondary characters in the book such as Ramsey Sinclair, Brigid and Ian Maitland. I think the love story between Ramsey and Brigid could have been made into their own book and that the end of their story was tied up so neatly and cut off, but it was still good nonetheless. I loved when Ramsey asked her who she was in love with and she told him, without really telling him.. \\"I can't tell you that LAIRD/RAMSEY\\" she'd say. He he he.I loved Gillian's character. Although she was \\"stubborn\\" and \\"tough\\" in her own right, it wasn't overboard. It was just right. Brodick is sexy, rough, confident and a ruffian ...all perfect for a hero. This is a must read for any romance fans."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I discovered Julie Garwood by accident and I've gone through most of her books in record time. This is one of the sweetest little stories around. If you're only interested in raw sex, look somewhere else. If you want romance, interesting and endearing characters, a good story, and if you like \\"braw\\" Scottish Lairds with a tender side, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Now this is my first 5 star rating ever. I loved this book and it ranks right up there with the Outlander by Diana Gabaldon. It may even be better.The characters were so well developed. You couldn't help but love them.The only very minor drawback was the plot perhaps. Seemed like it wouldn't have taken much to avoid the whole quest and save the uncle (who probably didn't need much saving in hindsight), therefore avoiding the whole search for the sister and Arianna's box. But there were enough side plots and romance to make this such a minor drawback, and the characters carried the whole story, even young Alec, who reminds you of every little boy you've ever known.I found this book thoroughly enjoyable and the double romance was totally refreshing.This is my first book by this author, and it certainly won't be my last. It was compelling, an easy, pleasant read, and took me all of a night on a plane in Iraq to finish it. I have to say, \\"splendid characterization,\\" and I loved how much it made me laugh. I'll be reading this one again and again to see just how Garwood accomplished so much in such a short amount of space. I wanted an epic of these characters by the time she was done."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I absolutely loved this book and could not put it down. The heroine - Gillian - was full of courage and didn't back down when faced with problems. Laird Buchanen - the hero - is all man - but you can feel how much he cares for Gillian. At the same time - there are 3 or 4 other storylines taking place that culminate in the resolution of Gillian's main problem - will she get to see her sister? does she find the treasure? how will she get Alec to his home after he is kidnapped? who is the traitor to the Sinclairs? and more! I read this book in 2 sittings - and it left me feeling happy!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I anticipated this book when I heard the slightest mention of it's release. To my own emmense satisfaction, this book lived up to it's level of excellence as with every other Julie Garwood romance. I found Gillian to be one of the best heroines I have ever met, she is brave, honest, loving, and loyal. I came in expecting only the best, and am glad to say Julie Garwood delivered just that."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"&quot;Ransom&quot; was my first Julie Garwood novel and I am now a devoted fan. Garwood's a true story teller! The characters in this wonderful story are so deep and real that the reader can truly relate. Gillian and Bridgid are strong, yet extremely feminine and lovable. Gillian is such an amazing woman; I love the way she is so brave one minute and so vulnerable the next. The men are real men and as rough as they may seem, they epitomize the feudal code. Always ready to fight the honorable fight, never backing down in the face of trouble. I also love the way Garwood keeps you guessing through the whole book. She has a method of writing that won't allow you to drop the book. From the first page, you are already in the middle of an adventure and in love with the characters. I look forward to reading more from Julie Garwood."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Garwood's book has always intrigued me from the beginning to the end. This book was no different.

Ransom has an evil baron who murdered the heroine's father before her eyes years ago and now holds her captive until forcing her to do his bidding. Learning he's involved with a clan traitor and had a child kidnapped, she bravely saves the boy at great cost to herself. She and the boy reach the Highlands. As a sure way to bring his warrior protector, she calls herself the bride of the Buchanan; a daunting, fierce giant of a Laird whom all fear. She's like no other woman he's met. She has to save her uncle from the evil baron by finding her sister who has hidden safely in the Highlands thus far and outwit the baron. Ramsey's and Bridget's story could have been given more time but a great read. It stands on my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom was a great Julie Garwood book. I just purchased the book a couple of days ago and started to reading it! That plot was amazing and I just loved how Julie Garwood used previous characters from &quot;The Secret&quot;.It was entertaining and a great read. Too bad, she didn't concentrate on Ramsey's and Bridget's love story as much as Brodrick's and Gillian's love story. If you loved &quot;The Secret&quot;,you must read this book! The book is worth to buy. You just want to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I loved this book! This is one of those stories that I really hated to see end.

Julie Garwood delivers once again. It was great to meet up with Iain and Judith and all the great characters from The Secret. One of my favorite parts of Ransom is the interaction between Gillian and the little boy Alec (Iain and Judith's son). It was so well written and emotional. The dialogue between the little boy and Gillian and then when they are saved, was great!!! The heroes Brodrick and Ramsey were easy to fall in love with, although Iain by far is my favorite Laird. They were strong and fierce but yet soft when it came to their women. The love story and chemistry between Brodrick and Gillian was fantastic. Both characters were very likeable. Garwood is a genius in stirring up the readers emotions. I laughed, I cried, and I had butterflies in my stomach. This was a great fast-paced romance novel with an enjoyable storyline. The characters jumped off the page. I was sad to once again say good bye to these wonderful characters that Garwood with her wonderful story telling brought to life!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"this was my first book written by her and It kept me going to buy all of her books. the historial fact are great and you can't tell what going to happen next.

I feel like we never got to see the fabled Buchanan Spartans, though, which was a bummer for me.Sweet story with one and a half heroines and one and a half heroes. Couple of surprises and highlanders who were, predictably, clueless about their feelings.I think these stories have been charming but I perhaps need to space my reading of them so that they don't feel so similar.Still, a good story, involving and fun and one that leaves you with the &#34;Awww....&#34; and &#34;Finally!&#34; there at the end. :)"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I had this book in paperback and just HAD to buy it on my Kindle so I'd have it wherever I went.I've loved this story ever since I picked it out of my mom's bookshelf back home.

Julie Garwood has done it again & provided the reader with another great highland tale!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Absolutely loved this book! The story, characters, romance! Garwoods generally make me fall in love. Definitely be purchasing all her books. She has a wonderful sense of humor."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love, love, love this book! It really feels like there are two books in one. The first half of the book the heroine is taking rescuing and caring for a small boy. The second half she is seeking her sister. I really enjoy the first half the most. Julie Garwood has caputured a 4 year's questions, comments and actions perfectly.I've worn out my copy of this book and keep it together with tape. Hope it comes out on Kindle so I can re-read it there!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I thought this book was unlike most of Garwood's historical books. I liked the strong character for Gillian and that she was a hero way before she met Brodick. Her adventures rescuing the boy was a wonderful lead-in and I loved that Garwood showed much strength in her character by withstanding incredible pain and sorrow. She complimented Brodick and was his equal. I liked Brodick's character because he wasn't brooding like most of the male characters in Garwood's books. He was likeable right away and very tender towards Gillian even in the beginning. I liked that Garwood gave Gillian's character many opportunities to show her courage and strength and the admiration she garnered from Brodick's men. Wonderful book to the end!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is a must read! You don't even have to like historical. Excellent story. I have read this so many times my book fell apart and I went to buy hard cover."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Garwood is one of my favorite historical romance authors (her contemporaries aren't as good, but that's another review). Her stories are funny and \\"light\\" (not as emotionally wrenching as other historical romance authors can be), and I always feel good when I finish one. The only books that get 5 stars from me are those that are keepers (rereads). This one fits that definition. The tension/romance between the h/h is just right, with plenty of witty dialogue and romantic love scenes. That said, sometimes the secondary romance in this novel slowed it down a tad. Other than that, it was one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I read this while I was really, really sick, so my first complaint is that the book (I have the hardcover) was WAY too heavy. LOLBut that does lead me to an actual complaint--it was a good story, but it dragged on too long, and got repetitious in spots. I loved the interaction between the h/h, but they had the same argument with nothing resolved too many times--I accept that people do this in real life, but in a book, showing it to the readers once should do the trick.It was also two romances in one, and the two stories weren't well intertwined. Although we're told that the two heroes were friends, and we see the two heroines become friends, there's not much interaction between the pairs.My other complaint is that, oddly though it seems from my complaint that the book was too long, there was a lot left out. For example, we jump from the heroine's escape to someone informing the hero's men that his bride has arrived. It yanked me out of the story for a page or two while I surmised that that must have been the heroine's plan to enlist his aid, though why or how she came up with that plan is never explained, and since the rest of the story hinges on that, it's a real weak spot.That's not the only time I felt that way, either. It's obviously a sequel, because when several characters were introduced, I swear I could read \\"pause for applause\\" between the lines.Complaints out of the way, it was a good story. A little too complex to easily sum up here, but the main heroine is strong and brave and honorable and never once disguises herself as a boy, and the hero just makes me grin. Clueless, gruff, and--get this!--he falls in love with her because he's impressed with her, not because she's \\"the most beeeyouteeful woman he's ever seen.\\" For that, I'll forgive a book a lot. Like her sister, who just disgusted me no end--I couldn't believe they shared genes. The secondary story was cute but predictable, and could have been developed better, IMO."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"The story was interesting and complex, the characters were likeable, and there was plenty of romance. This book contains some characters from The Secret, which was also a heart-warming story."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"So I love Julie Garwood. Her books are great, however this one is just good. I do feel that it lacked a bit of emotion between Brodick and Gillian. They don't meet until page 130! More info needed to be in there about Brigid and Ramsey, it would have made the ending have more of an impact! Anyways, it's still good and worth the read, just not as good as The Bride or Saving Grace! Just started reading Honor's Splendour."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Beautifully written! I finished the book in a day and reread it again the next day, that was how good it was!!! A must read! If you don't believe me, read it for yourself! Ms. Garwood is one of my favorite authors!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This sequel to 'The Secret' is pretty good but I liked 'The Secret' better than this one. 'Ransom' is a fast read but ends a bit abruptly. The author could have developed Ramsey's romance in a separate novel. That would have justified his charming personality.A new reader would find this novel neat but if you have read her earlier novels like Saving Grace and The Secret, this doesn't stand a good chance."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have read and reread this book many times and it never fails to be an excellent read. Brodick and Gillian were a great match. I've read all of Julie Garwoods historicals and they are all great. Most are funny and I end up laughing throuhout, at the antics of some of her characters.Nothing she writes can compare to those stories and I certainly wish she would at least write a few sequences to possibly Ransom,The Bride,Honor Splendor or Prince Charming. I have a book shelf filled with her earlier work. So many today are writing romantic mysteries etc and although she is good at those she is not great in my estimation. Please,Please write some of the historicals, I for one, would be first in line to purchase them"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I recommended to anyone who hasn't read Julie Garwood work. She is a great author and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I bought the new Kindle version of this book. Believe it or not, I just started reading Julie Garwood and have liked her work for the most part. I loved The Prize and The Bride. Lions Lady was okay. I did not like Ransom at all. The heroines both seemed weak to me and the heros were always in control and getting the better of the heroines. The heoines never stuck to their guns on any issue and there were several badly needed \\"hero grovels\\" scenes missing. Honestly, I didn't feel the love. Oh well. I'm thinking of trying the Secret just to fill in Judith and Ian's story, but I'm not sure I'm interested anymore."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Julie Garwood's (Ransom), is one of my favorite historical romances, filled with mystery, intrigue, romance, and humor, it is a great read. I loved how Brodick used trickery to marry Gillian, and when she found out later, it was one of the most hilarious scenes. The mystery of the box that her father left, and how it was because of that box that her life and her family's life was torn apart. There is also the story of Ramsey integrated very well with the story of Brodick and Gillian. And the relationship between Ramsey and Brigdet, also has its great memorable moments. Not to forget the action/adventure that complement the plot perfectly, as Gillian and Brodick set out to free Gillian's captive uncle from the villian of the story, and to find Gillian's missing sister in order to find the lost box. All the characters from Brodick, to Gillian, to Ramsey play an intergral part of the story. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I think Garwood did a better job here than in the Secret...INTRODUCTION WITH PROLOGUE: I thought it started off pretty good. IT begun with a tragedy and a promise of vengeance. I like Gillian's character and I think she is the best Garwood heroine. She had endured a lot of hardships and I find myself symphatizing with her. Garwood has perfectly molded a courageous and brave heroine, though she's oblivious with her strengths. I also think Alec is adorable with his you-know-what questions. I met Brodick in the Secret, and I like him better than Iain.THE MIDDLE: I was almost impress with this novel...but when I got into the middle, it slid off into the usual Garwood pattern...Gillian and Bridgid turned into \\"Judith\\" and \\"Frances Catherine\\" Father Laggan was hilarious. The mystery of the traitor's identity kept the novel from going downhill altogether.THE ENDING: Here, it started to climb up again. Garwood has brought back the adventure and excitement that was lost in the middle part. The ending, thank god, is not cheesy. I thought it was funny and just right.All in all, this is a good book which is worth reading. I hoped that Garwood has written a better prequel than the Secret."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Having read most of Julie Garwood's books, this is by far one of my favorites (I'd also recommend the Wedding). It is a highly suspenseful story with many twists that will hold you enthralled in it's grasp! The characters are strongly developed and it was a very good read."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I do believe Julie Garwood is quickly becoming my favorite Romance writer. This was the 2nd one of her books I have read and I am headed to the library to get another one. But I messed up. I read Ransom and now am headed to get Secrets, which is opposite of how I should have read them. There is love, humor, sadness, adventure, etc. in Ransom. I loved Brodick being good looking but not with the the best of personalities, infact he has a hard personality. Gillian was strong, beautiful, carrying, and devoted. It is a great read!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have read all of Julie Garwood's book and find that while this one is a pleasant read and a good read, it is not up to the level of her great books. I preferred her other works such as the Secret, The Bride...etc.The fundamental problem with this book is that while there are two romances, only one is developed fully. I found myself wishing for more interactions between Bridget and Ramsey and for more of a storyline for them.Still though... if you like Garwood you will like this one. Note that I still gave it 4 stars! :)"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Fiesty female, bullheaded, arrogant male with a very good but sometime predictable storyline. Is there to be a book about Ramsey and Bridgid? Hope so!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"For such a long story, I was disappointed in the content. The setting of this story takes place under King John's reign in England. That is one of the reasons I picked this book up, it is a time period not often written about. Unfortunately, this book could have been written in any time period from 1066 to 1800. There was no connection between the plot and the era it was written in. The descriptions were not time specific and could have encompassed any time period as well. If anything, I think there were a lot of anachronisms, such as the importance placed on the tartan. That did not come about until much later.Thus saying, the characters were enjoyable to read about, and their stories interesting. It is not easy to make a tough warrior seem approachable, but Ms. Garwood succeeded with Brodick. Except by how other people reacted to the Buchanons, I never really got the feeling that they were a ruthless, Spartan-type group. We saw them through Gillian\`s eyes and they didn't look too tough from that prospective. We kept getting allusions about their rough life style and strong women, but since we never made it to Brodick's holdings, I have no real idea what type of life is awaiting our heroine.This was a decent book, I suppose I was just expecting more because of its length. If you want an easy read, with not too complicated a plot then pick Ransom up."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I am a great fan of Julie Garwood and like all her other books-EXCEPT THIS ONE! This book made me really ANGRY.The heroine Gillian did not have any backbone at all. How could she not know that she was getting married, for God's sake????And the hero Brodick did push her around a lot, did not value her opinions. Did not even ask her if she wants to marry him! Now that is stretching things a little too far.But to be fair, the plot of the book was really good. And this book did not stop me from reading Garwood's other books."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I loved this. Brodick and Gillian were surely meant for each other. And, of course, Ramsey found his Bridget."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I've had 'RANSOM' in my possession for less than one week, and I'm reading it for the second time. I can't tell you how wonderfully written this novel is, so you'll just have to read it to find out. 'RANSOM' is the sequel to 'THE SECRET', which is my favorite book ever. I can't read any other author but Julie Garwood. So I go on re-reading her novels until she comes out with a new one. You'll enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book and &quot;Come the Spring&quot; are well written, but aren't as funny as her other books. I love her books because they make me laugh out loud, and, while Ransom was very well written, it didn't have the laughter in it that &quot;The Bride&quot; or &quot;The Secret&quot; did. Maybe next time..."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"As always, Ms. Garwood delivers another page turner. I have yet to be disappointed by one of her books and look forward to the release of each one. I only wish they were delivered more frequently!!!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have always loved Julie Garwood's books and am ALWAYS waiting for her to come out with something new. Ransom is not one of her best books, but it was still good. She is such an exceptional writer that it seems hard for her top what she's already done. The characters Brodick and Gillian seemed to be missing something. They just didn't seem like they were as well suited for each other as some of the characters from her other novels. I was actually more interested in Ramsey and Gillian and really think they deserved their own book. That would be a GREAT story, I think."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Julie Garwood is one of my favorite authors. I loved this follow up to The Secret, however I too was disappointed that Ramsey and Brigid did not have their own story.

It is so much fun to go back and &quot;visit&quot; with favorite charecters."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Thank you! Thank you Julie Garwood!! I was hoping you would write about Brodick and Ramsey .

I am looking forward to the next masterpiece.Pam Schneider"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"It was wonderful, I could hardly wait to get home and read it. I was thrilled to find out what happend with Judith and Frances Catherine. Ms Garwood is my favorite author. This was truly one of Ms. Garwoods finest books."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I loved every page of this book, I very much enjoyed the tie in with the Maitlands clan. I read this book in a weekend, and have re-read it again and again. I would recommend this book to any romance reader."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I could not put this book down. I loved the romance and intrigue. I really missed Julie Garwood, and I think she has another winner with this one. I'm glad I got to revisit Iain and Judith, as well as the whole Maitland clan. And Brodick and Ramsey-they are to die for! Only in your fantasies can a woman admit she likes the handsome, strong, and laconic type. I was actually disappointed when the story ended because I wanted to see what happened next. How was Ramsey and Bridgid's wedding? Did Brodick build Gillian a house? I wish there were another sequel."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This was my second Garwood book and I loved it just as much as the first one (The Secret). This time Brodick Buchanon and Ramsey Sinclair from The Secret are the heroes with a brief appearance by Judith and Iain. In a plot to kidnap Ramsey's younger brother, Iain and Judith's son, Alec, is taken by mistake. Lucky for him, a young woman, Gillian,is also being held. Baron Alford believes she knows where a certain box belonging to King John is and he will stop at nothing to get it first. After beating Gillian and threatening her uncle's life, she is sent to find her sister. When Baron Alford killed her father when she was a child, she and her sister were given the box and sent into hiding. The two children were separated and Gillian never saw her again. If she didn't find the box and return it, Baron Alford threatened to torture and kill her uncle. Knowing that Alec's true identity would cause the baron to kill him, she escapes with him and hands him over to Brodick. Of course it was attraction at first sight and the fun begins here. There were many humorous parts and I loved seeing Gillian stand up to Brodick at every turn. There was a secondary romance between Ramsey and Bridgit that could have very easily been made into its own book. These two books have made me a big fan of Julie Garwood."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I loved this story.If you have read the story &quot;The Bride&quot; by Julie Garwood this story is a must. This is Brodrick and Ramsey's story.In this story the characters are wonderfully developed. The women are strong and are not weak little push overs. This is evident when Gillian's arm is treated, as well as when Birgid and Gillian foil the soldiers who just want a &quot;little kiss&quot; from them.In this story Gillian helps to save a little boy (I won't spoil it for you) while trying to solve a very old mystery about &quot;Adrianna's Box&quot;, find her sister and keep her Uncle safe as well as herself. Enter the highlanders - Alec, Brodrick and Ramsey who are uniquely drawn into the story. They are all lairds of their own land now and it is interesting how JG shows that they are all still good friends even though they are very different and their &quot;ruling&quot; style is very different.I don't want to say to much about this but there is romance, lots of laughter, courage, humor (if the little boy had said &quot;You know what&quot; once more I think everyone would have had to throttle him)and love woven in around the fierceness of the situation...I have read the book (5+ stars) and also listened to the tape (the abridged one is about 3 stars, as it looses a lot of the depth to the story)."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom by Julie Garwood is only my second book by this author (the first being Heartbreaker which is more contemporary but nonetheless very good). Overall this book is simply wonderful, heartwarming, romantic, exciting... I could go on forever. I would recommend this book to any mystery, romance, historical fiction lovers out there. Judging from my first two Julie Garwood novels, she is a very talented author and I look forward to enjoying much more of her work. I have already placed three of her novels on order at my local library.Ransom is the story of Lady Gillian, whose father is killed and family destroyed when she is only five and Baron Alford invades her home. She is separated from her sister Christen, who flees into Scotland for protection. Gillian remains in England with her Uncle Morgan. When she grows up, her uncle is held for ransom until Gillian can find Arriana's box, King John's missing treasure that holds the clue to who killed his one true love. Gillian has reason to believe that her sister has the box, so she escapes the baron with a kidnapped Scottish boy, Alec. They head to Scotland to find Christen, and fall together with the laird and a few soldiers of the Buchanan clan. Gillian falls in love with the laird, Brodick.Also included included in the storyline is the romance of Ramsey Sinclair and Bridgid, although it plays a disappointingly secondary role to the main romance between Brodick and Gillian. Between searching for her sister, finding a traitor in the midst of the Sinclair clan whom only Gillian can recognize, and falling in love, the plot is amazing in its complexity. The setting feels utterly real and the dialogue is witty and entertaining. (I especially love the conversations between Alec and Gillian because it makes Alec innocently lovable while being realistic - hey, all five year olds talk practically nonstop about the most mundane things and then say all the things they shouldn't!After all my praise, I must add one tiny complaint. The first few chapters are very hard to get through. I was completely confused as to what was going on with Gillian and Alec (why was he hanging off a cliff, why was Gillian chasing him, how did Gillian come to know about Alec being held prisoner, etc.). Maybe I missed a few hidden clues about what was happening, but it took me a few chapters for everything to make sense and at the time I was getting very frustrated. Perhaps Julie Garwood was attempting to try something different by plunging right into the action, but I feel she could have started at the beginning and the effect could have been the same if not better. This might also have prevented a few readers from giving up in the beginning. However, once everything clicks into place, this book is awesome. I loved it and stayed up till 2 in the morning reading.*****Also, I shall be going back to read The Secret, which I have discovered is the prequel to this, centering on Iann and Judith, who are the parents of Alec and minor characters in Ransom. I look forward to it!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This was actually two romances in one--although the Gillian-Brodick romance takes center stage, and the Bridgid-Ramsey relationship develops in the margins. But you won't mind.Like the other reader who would have liked a little more history, I too would have liked a little more detail from the period. The novel's real strength is that it really moves along...you really feel like you are on an adventure with these characters. While with some novels you can see a predictable conclusion on the horizon, this one really keeps you guessing. I really couldn't guess how things were going to end. What fun!The characters are also very likable--Brodick is a man who wins you over by his compassion and his rough edges.Overall, a very enjoyable read that I too found very hard to put down (I read well into the evening one night!)."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"\\"Ransom\\" is a wonderful book. Unlike other romance authors, Julie Garwood knows how to tell a story, instead of just writing detailed sex scenes. This book is the sequel of \\"The Secret\\" which is written about the romance between Ian and Judith, the parents of the little boy Alec who was responsible for the meeting between Gillian and Brodick.The characters were well defined. The painful past made Gillian strong and courageous. Brodick, though a fearsome warrior, possessed a tender and gentle heart. His character was somewhat different from the description in \\"The Secret\\", but this book took place 8 years later and therefore, didn't really present itself as a problem. I love those Buchanan men, they were very protective and possessive of Gillian and I think they were real cute!Contrary to what other viewers belief, I think that it was not the intention of the author to develop two separate love stories in this book. Make no doubt that this book was all about Brodick and Gillian. I think that the reason of the detailed description on Ramsey and Bridgid's first meeting was to lay groundwork to the treachery and deception. I believe that the mystery of Christen's identity also played an important role in the detailed description on the secondary characters. Personally, I don't really care about Ramsey and Bridgid's romance as much as Brodick and Gillian's. I think it's refreshing to read a novel in which the hero of the story knew his own intention and not \`mean'; most of the author of romance seemed to think it was necessary that heros don't know their own hearts. (No wonder Bridgid though men were stupid.)I was surprised by the outcome of Christen and Gillian's meeting and must applaud for Garwood. Though I am sorry about the outcome, it made the story more realistic and unpredictable.With all the treachery and deception, this book was full of wits, too. I laughed so much when I was reading the part involving the wedding. It was terribly funny and I appreciated the humor.I strongly recommend this book to you. If you like to read love stories and do not like to be overloaded with sexual descriptions, I suggest you read the novels by Julie Garwood."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"As a child innocent four year old Lady Gillian watches as her father is violently murdered by a ruthless English Baron. Now years later the same baron has called on her to find King John's missing box in Scotland and bring it back to him.

Will King John's box ever be found and will her father's name ever be cleared?Julie Garwood once again brings us back to beautiful medeival Scotland, reuniting us with the wonderful characters from The Secret. If you love Julie Garwood's medeival series, this book is highly recommended. But one warning, plan on clearing your day since you will undoubtedly be immersed in the story all day long."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This story is set in England and Scotland between the years 1198 to 1215. It begins during the reign of King Richard the Lion-Hearted of England, and takes the reader into the reign of his younger brother King John.Gillian and Christian are two innocent little English girls who lose their father and their ancestral home when Baron Alford, a friend of King John's, goes on a murderous rampage. He thinks their father is in possession of a treasure box filled with jewels. The jeweled box once belonged to the beautiful Arianna who was the lost love of King John. The sisters are separated; Christian is taken to Scotland, and Gillian remains in England with her Uncle Morgan and near her old home which is now ruled by Baron Alford, her father's murderer.Baron Alford has never been able to locate the treasure and finally comes to realize that it must be in Scotland with Christian. Gillian is now a beautiful and intelligent young woman and Alford sends her to Scotland to find her sister and locate the treasure box. She's threatened with the death of her beloved Uncle if she does not return with the information about the location of Arianna\`s box.Gillian is well received in Scotland because during her flight from England, she managed to save a young Scottish boy was also being held hostage by the evil Alford. One of the Scots who she meets is Brodick Buchanan, a handsome warrior who lets her know from the beginning that he's very interested in her and does not plan to let her return to England. The attraction between them is pretty intoxicating and Gillian falls in love with him; however, she's determined in her quest to find her lost sister and return the box to England. Brodick and the other Scottish warriors have their own ideas on how to deal with Baron Alford.This is the first book that I've read by Julie Garwood and I found it to be a fast-paced and exciting story. As an avid reader, it's a thrill to discover an author who you've somehow missed. Now, I'll go back and read her earlier books."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"JULIE GARWOOD IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE ROMANCE WRITER. I'VE READ EVERYONE OF HER NOVELS (EXCEPT FOR HER ROSE SERIES)AND I WASN'T DISSAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE.

I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN IT CAME OUT AND I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO LOVE TO READ GREAT ROMANTIC STORIES TO GET RANSOM!!! I CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEW BOOK TO COME OUT!!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have loved the writings of Julie Garwood since I was about 20 years old. I started reading her and couldn't get enough. I have since had two children and gotten behind in my reading. By chance I picked up Ransom at Christmas to give my mother as a gift for her to read and hopefully like as much as I had in the past. She, at 67 years old, has lost her husband (my dad) and I had hopes of giving her something to do to keep her mind off the loneliness. She loves this book! She told me she read several parts over again and again. After she finished, I borrowed the book from her and I couldn't stop reading it. I had to wait until the children were in the bed to read without any interruption and read into the wee hours of the morning. Gillian and Broderick are great! I loved how they just fit together. Reading about the whole group was like reading about someone you know personally because you know about them from reading The Secret. This book held me spellbound. I can't wait to go back and re-read The Secret over again to refresh my mind on the characters and their lives during that time. Well done to Julie Garwood. I, for one, hope to see more and my mom is just getting started! She has already started looking for more! She has her nose buried in For the Roses right now! Thanks Ms. Garwood for that excited feeling we get when we see one of your new releases on the shelf!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Julie Garwood has remained as one of my truely favorite romance writers. I was a little concerned with the Rose series, but am ecstatic about the return to Scottish historical romance (even though the English romances are just as good). What can I say about the book, one of my favorites. It captured me from the first page and I couldn't put it down. My only regret, and I mean only, is that I felt Ramsey &amp; Brigid's romance was cut a little short. It still tugged at the heart strings but I was left craving more. Broderick and Gillian were written perfectly and the reader couldn't help but wish them the best. What I love most about Julie's books is not just the humor, but the fact that when reading them, you feel like they're right next to you, well...not quite that close, but you get the picture! Julie it was wonderful...please keep them coming!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book follows one of my favorite formulas for a romance book. You have a plucky and self-reliant heroine who needs more rescuing than she is willing to admit. Then you have a gruff and stoic hero who has never been in touch with his feelings and doesn't believe in love. When these two people meet, the chemistry is instant. Add in an assortment of villains and sidekicks to add tension and comic relief, and you have a wonderful story.These characters are really quirky and wonderful. Brodick is off-putting but endearing. He is huge and scowly and bear-like. His personal habits are barbaric. He doesn't even like to sleep in a bed. Gillian is fearless and stubborn and doesn't care about appearances, her reputation, or even her own injuries. She is entirely focused on rescuing other people, including her beloved uncle and a little boy she happened to meet.It never occurs to her that her uncle ought to be capable of rescuing himself. She takes responsibility for all the burdens, and can't even release her worries to Brodick, who is disgustingly competent at simple things like storming castles and rescuing uncles.It all turns out well in the end, although you get the impression \\"happily ever after\\" isn't going to be what happens next. More likely these two will blunder through adventures and misunderstandings for years and have a wonderful time doing it.I loved this book. I loved the characters, and the funny dialog, and the romantic setting, and the satisfying conclusion. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ms. Garwood has done it again. She wove an intriguing tale of desire, adventure, danger, bravery, and love into this exciting story. I love sword fights! And this one has it and much, much more. It was fun to see how the story unfolded and how Garwood was able to tie all the loose ends and make everying come together and make sense.It is an exciting read and will leave you wanting the story to never end.The one thing I wish could have been changed is for Ramsey to have his very own story. For such a brave, HANDSOME, dashing, diplomatic man, there wasn't enough attention given to him. I wish Garwood would have created a story just for him. He is the kind of hero I consider a favorite in any story line. PERFECT.I love all of Garwood's books and highly recommend all of them. If I had to choose a top five they are: 1. Honor's Splendor, 2. The Gift, 3. The Secret 4. The Wedding 5. Ransom. Read them all. You won't be disappointed!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book was great! I enjoyed every moment, and actually read it twice. Gillian is a strong character, and is a perfect fit for Brodick. In the first book that featured Brodick, \\"The secret\\", I did not think much of the character. He seemed gruff and slow-witted, in this book. J.G. builds a splendid well-developed character, which makes you want to swoon. If you like your men strong, kind, protective yet not overpowering- this book is for you. The storyline is intriguing and suspense holds until the end. In a nutshell- BUY IT NOW! Its one the best and I've read many, it takes a really good book to get me to write such a review. While you're at it- get the first book to, and read them together."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love JG's writting. Ransom is my favorite of hers. I have read this book over and over many times. The story is very funny and loaded with good old fashion romance. The dialogs were great between characters. Althought, Ramsey and Bridge was a bit short may be they will have their own book later.I have read JG modern romance and like them, but JG is much better at Historical romance. I prefer stories like Ransom with all those Highlanders and Englishs. It's much more enjoyable to slip back into the historical time for a romantic tale.I have read Ransom over countless of time. Specially on a night that I just want to read something fun with a happy ending. If this book ever becomes a movie that even be better!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"At the beginning , I really wondered who were the main characters. I thought the couple in the story were Ramsey and Gillian but it turned out to be Brodick and Gillian. I really admired the Gillian's bravery. The parts where Gillian was talking to Alec were very enjoyable, even though Alec's &quot;You know what?&quot; could be quite annoying sometimes. I would like to know what had happened to the children after Brodick and company left Iain's holdings. I also agree with many other readers that Ramsey and Bridgid deserve a book of their own.Overall, the narration of this book is good with an excellent plot and many interesting characters who make you feel like you know them as real people.I love all of Julie Garwood's historical romance, maybe except &quot;Gentle Warrior&quot;. I feel that this book is DEFINITELY A KEEPER!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"The prologue was one of the best parts of the book! I loved it, and I don't think Ms. Garwood has ever written a more riveting begining (although the start to *Come the Spring* is pretty darn close). You hear about Gillian's night adventure as she is seperated from her family and sister and taken to her uncle. The whole romp left me breathless, and I couldn't turn the page fast enough! Then we are taken to a scene where some old faces, Brodick Ramsey from *The Secret*, are reitnroduced. Then we whirl back to Gillian where she is trying to save a little boy from certain death. It is thought that, by Baron Alford (the man who killed Gillian's father, stole her home and was currently holding her captive), that the little boy is Ramsey's kid brother (who is thought by Ramsey to have drowned, when infact he was kidnapped). But the boy is really Iain and Judith's (also from *The Secret*) son. When Gillian saves him, they must face the rath of Alford. When the tense meeting occurs, Alford orders Gillian to find her long lost sister and ask her where Arianna's Treasure is (this is the legend that started the whole thing). Gillian knows it is an impossible task, but Alford is holding her dear uncle captive and so she must do as she is told. In the middle of the night, Gillian and Alec (the little boy) escape through one of the secret passeges. He tells her that she can take him to his guardian Brodick, and that Brodick will take him home. So the couple journey to the Highlands to meet Brodick. Brodick and Gillian start to fall in love, and it is discovered that Gillian's sister may be hiding out with a family living with Ramsey's clan. Romance and mystery grace the pages of the book as Gillian rushes to find her sister and the lost treasure in time. But will her one true love be lost as well? This book is so exciting that you read it into the night and stop only because you have fallen asleep. My parents couldn't get me to stop reading. I read while brushing my teeth, in school, even while walking home! Brodick and Gillian's love was well developed and your heart goes out to both of them as they search for what everyone wants in life... happiness, a home, and love. The characters were well proportioned and three dimensional. They feel like family at the end of the book, and you don't want to let them go. The plot is unusual and unique and holds you attention until the very end. If you've read *The Secret*, *Ransom* is a must read!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"i read this book in like ten hours! i just couldn't put it down. julie garwood is one of the best writers i believe i have ever read! i just couldn't help but fall in love with gillian and brodick... i hope we see a follow up with ramsey and bridgid."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I was so sad to see this book end, I immediately read it again and enjoyed the second time around just as much! This is definitely one of Julie Garwood's best (and there are many)! Julie Garwood returns to her best subject matter, the Scottish Highlanders! I love her witty characters, and the romance, suspense, and adventure combine for a thoroughly captivating read!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"If you like romance novels, especially those set in the Highlands this is a very good book. It might do for a Diana Gabaldon/Outlander fix, but in no way would I consider these two books or authors as equals. While it is a fun and funny tale to read, I would not consider it well researched or historically acturate. Anyone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but:1. I believe women in the middle ages always kept their hair well braided and covered, it being quite scandalous for any man but your husband to see your hair loose. Yet throughout the novel Gillian's hair was always flowing free.2. There was constant mention of the Scots speaking English instead of gaelic to accomodate Gillian, who spoke English. If I'm not mistaken, the \\"English\\" nobility of that period were still Normans, and thus spoke French.That being said, it was still a good read. It's a bit confusing at the start, the way the author bounces around in the past/future in setting up her story and characters -- especially the part between Gillian and Alec hanging literally by a thread -- I couldn't figure out what was going on, but it made sense the second time I read the book.I loved Brodick (sigh) and Gillian, both strong and stubborn and undeniably attracted to each other. With the exception of Jamie Fraser in Outlander I think Brodick is right up there as my all time favorite hard-headed stubborn hero in a kilt. The banter was fun, especially between Gillian and Brodick's guards. Downside -- not enough between Ramsey and Bridgid and sorely missing was an epilogue. After all the hoopla about how the Buchanans lived like Spartans I very much wanted to read about their return to Scotland and how Brodick's clan accepted Gillian.Lastly, and not to critisize the author but a HUGE THUMBS DOWN on her publisher, Pocket Books. Every Garwood book I have read has had at least one serious typo. Several of these books have been reprints, so you would think the publishers would catch them and correct them but apparently not. In this book, I found Gillian printed as Gilliam and Brodick printed as Broderick. If I recall that was in the same chapter. A bit distracting to the story to misspell the main character names. Another expample was Murder List, where the H&H; and going for their first kiss and she grabs his jacket lable instead of lapel. LOL."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I was held completely enthralled through the first half of this book. i loved the setting and it's description. I loved the heroine and the 'wee lad' she took under her wing. My only problems with it were that, for me, there weren't enough love scenes, and they arrived too late in the story...and the fact the author decided to throw in another couple into the mix, without fully fleshing out their story. I think Ms. Garwood should have stuck to her main protagonists and left the other couple for another book"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Gillian is only a child when she watches her father be murdered. Before his death, Gillian's father entrusts her sister with one of King John's most prized treasures, a jeweled box commissioned for his love Arianna. In their haste to escape before they meet the same fate as their father, Gillian and her sister are separated. Years later, the usurper who killed Gillian's father inhabits his home and demands that she find her sister and the box, or he will kill Gillian's uncle.Brodick Buchanan is a fierce, proud Highlander and the leader of one of the most fearsome Highland clans. When Gillian tells him of her mission, he is charmed by her innocence, beauty, and kind heart. In order to protect her from those who would do her harm, Brodick decides to make Gillian his wife. In so doing, he agrees to help her find Arianna's box and save her uncle from certain death.Ransom like reading three stories in one. Gillian and Brodick's was only the primary story. There is also the secondary story of Brodick's friend Ramsey Sinclair, another Highland laird, and his infatuation with his ward, a girl so beautiful that soldiers keep proposing to her despite her insistence on marrying for love. Then there's the story of the merging of Highland clans and the inherent difficulty in mixing their heritages.This story wasn't exactly a romance, since the romance took a backseat to the subplots of revenge and pride. But I still enjoyed it. Julie Garwood can do no wrong in my eyes, and her story was still carefully crafted and well told despite its focus on family matters rather than the relationship between the hero and heroine. I also had a problem with the fact that, while the story was more than 500 pages, only after the first 300 do the hero and heroine even fall for each other. This story was good, but not great and is definitely not one of Garwood's best. I would recommend Honour's Splendour or the Bride if you want to read a more fully developed Garwood romance."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Garwood is, hands down, my favorite author of historical romance. And of all her books, Ransom is the one I could read every day and never get bored. The heroine is wonderful and the hero is sublime. The story moves at a fast clip, never once dragging the reader down. Be sure and start with The Secret as this is the sequel, but you won't be disappointed in either. Thank you, Julie Garwood!! You have given me many, many hours of escape and enjoyment."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have read Ransom at least six times. It is a really great book. Brodick who have sworn never to marry an Englishwomen has finally met his match. Gillian who has lived with her uncle after witnessing the murder of her father was brought back to her home by the person that had murdered her father. She was given a task to fullfill by a specific date or her uncle will die. She befriends a little boy who was kidnapped, he happens to be a verry powerful lairds son (Ian Maitland in Secrets). Although they kidnapped the wrong boy without knowing it, the traitor was returning to England to let them know, so they could kill the boy. So Lady Gillian had promised to get hime home. In order to do that she needs the help of Laird Brodrick Beuchanon. She sends a message to him to come and collect his bride. Thats when the story gets really interesting. Lets just say that at the beginning of the book Brodick knows his feelings toward Gillian is strong, and that he will marry her whether she wants to or not."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I've been reading 2 books a week for the past 40 years (yes, I'm 60), and this is the best book I have ever read. I couldn't put it down and it was such a fat book I spent nearly the whole weekend with my nose in that book. I loved it. I've only read a few of Garwood's books but am off to buy some more. These reviews are very helpful when selecting a book. Thank you, all."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I've been a fan of Garwood's work for years, and rate several of her novels as among the best ever written in the genre. I love The Secret and was eager to read this sequel and to learn more about Ramsey and Brodick's quest for true love. Unfortunately, for me at least, this book fell pretty flat. The plot was needlessly complicated (I feel like a lot of explanatory details were left on the cutting room floor) and I think would have worked best as two separate stories. The entire Ramsey-Bridgid plot had a lot of potential, but to me was never satisfactorily fleshed out. A separate book would have allowed for some expanation of Gideon's motives, of Ramsey's rise to power, and of Bridgid's early life; I think they (and we) deserved that story.Ransom deserves 3.5 stars (oh Amazon, give us half stars) and even a luke-warm Garwood is better than many of the other romance novels out there. Her trademark humor and steamy scenes make this novel well-worth the read, but I recommend following it up with some of her earlier, 5 star works (The Bride is my personal favorite)."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I've just finished reading Julie Garwood's latest book \\"Slow Burn\\" and it just reconfirmed that Ransom is the best book that Garwood has written. The plot and the characters are interesting.It's one of the few books that Garwood has written where the heroine and hero of the book weren't perfect, and they made mistakes on a regular basis. I felt that Broderick (the hero) was full of flaws, but so was Gillian (the heroine). I think Garwood has a tendancy in her historical romances (in particular) to string along a bunch of plot points, rather than having one overarching plot. This was not the case with Ransom. The only other book I feel is close to the quality of Ransom is Killjoy."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I got this book by accident, I was in a group of books that a coworker left for to look through. And after reading it I was just captivated by it all and wanted to read more of julie garwoods book. The story was just wonderful and all that I love to see in stories.I loved how ms garwood told the story about guillans father and his death and how her and her sister were talken away. It was wonderful and helped later in the book to already understand things and not have to wait to find out why this or that was going to happen.My favorite part of this book was when guillan finds out that she was married on a horse. &quot; A horse, I was married on a horse&quot;? It was just perfect..I look forward to reading all of Ms. garwoods book and hope that she will be writing for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"In my opinion, this is [possibly] the best romance ever written. This is Julie Garwood's best work by far, and I've lost count of how many times I've read it! This is a book you'll fall in love with, even if you're not a big romance reader. The historical setting of the book is beautiful, as well as the characters and their fates! I definitely recommend this book. :-)"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I absolutely LOVE this book. It is my favorite JG book!! I love those Buchanan men, they are so sexy and so funny!! Gillian is such a courageous woman and she is definitely the perfect match for grumpy Brodick. They make such a cute couple!! Ramsey and Bridgid definitely need a story of their own!! Christen pisses me off and I can't believe she would treat Gillian that way. Ugh!! Gillian has suffered so much and for Christen to not want to have anything to do with her was heartbreaking. This book has it all, suspense, comedy, romance...etc I love Julie Garwood and wish she would write more historical novels!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I started reading Julie Garwood at the suggestion of an aunt, and boy am I glad that I did. She never dissapoints!! Every time I buy one of her books, I read it immediately because i know it is going to be awesome. Ransom kept me intrigued from start to finish...I dont remember Brodick being so aggresive in The Secret, but, then again, I havent read it in a few years!! Time to get it out and refresh my memory. I loved getting the update on Judith and Ian, and their little boy was adorable!! Brodick was such a good hero for Gillian. And Gillian's character had me laughing out loud!! She is not afraid of anyone. I was also thoroughly pleased with Ramsey and Bridgid. What a great couple. This one will go on my never ending pile of favorites, to be read again a thousand times!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I loved this story and have read and re-read it a dozen times. It is witty and funny and has a good story. LOVE IT!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"It was a wonderful well written Book!!! I have read many of Julie Garwood books and I love them all. This was one of my first that I read of hers and I loved it!!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I loved the way Ms. Garwood allowed us inside the minds of more than just one character. Also, I appreciated the fact that she did not feel the need to wear out the reader with every single detail of events that really didn't contribute to the storyline. However, having said that, some of the characterizations were a little simplistic, but not enough to interfere with the enjoyment of the book. I love stories of the Highlands and this was a good one."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Laird Brodick Buchanan and Gillian's book.Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsRansom is the second book in the Highland Laird series. I did not read \\"The Secret\\" first as it was proving to be a difficult book to hunt down. I did eventually find it and I'll update a review on here later. Regardless, I don't think I needed to read the The Secret about the Maitland's before this one.Ransom was simply FAB-U-LOUS and it will go down as one of my most favourite historical romances that I have ever read. I would also say that Ransom is my favourite Julie Garwood book of all time. I completely enjoyed reading all about Gillan and Brodick. The story was captivating and a page turner. In fact, I devoured it so quickly that I turned right around and re-read it. I wanted to feel that magic connection all over again. There were so many enjoyable parts to the novel. One of the main deep routed themes of Ransom was protection. I loved how protective Gilllian was to the young child Alec Maitland and in turn, I adored how protected Gillian felt with Brodick.One of my favourite scenes of Ransom was how Gillian and Brodick got married while they were on a horseback and Gillian had no idea that the marriage was even taken place. Brodick's friend Ramsay had a perfect part in that trickery and it had left me giggling. I thought the entire peice was extremely well written and very well thought out. I can't imagine being an author sitting down and thinking \`okay I am going to marry them but I don't want Gillian to know what is happening' Somehow Julie Garwood wields her magic and creates one of the most memorable scenes I will never forget.I often find when I love a book as much as I adored Ransom, it is difficult to review because I want to spill with spoilers all the amazing scenes and banter that occurs between the characters. I just don't want to ruin for any potential new readers. If you love alpha Highland Lairds, warriors who strive to protect, smart, brave and witty female characters you will adore Ransom right along with me.There are twists and turns in Julie Garwood's plots so I kept expecting something predictable and I was pleasantly surprised when it didn't turn out that way.Teasers: secret treasure, brutal beating, rocky cliff conversation \\"You know what?\\""},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book is a page turner from the first few chapters till the end. This was my first book by this author and it made me an instant fan. The hero and heroine have great chemistry and I really like the way Garwood describes Alec's character. I though the ending was a little abrupt and would have liked an epilogue, but overall it was a great read."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is the first Garwood that I've been able to give 4 stars to. It could be thought of as a loose sequel to The Secret (which I rated at 3 stars). Set in 12th century England and Scotland, it tells the story of a family shattered by betrayal and treachery. Lady Gillian's father was killed before her eyes by the evil Baron Alfred and she and her sister were separated as young girls, one to be raised in England by an uncle (Gillian), and one (Christen) sent north to Scotland to have her identity changed and to be raised among the Highland Scots. Years later, Gillian, now a beautiful young woman, is forced by Baron Alfred to travel to the Highlands to find her sister and King John's treasure box all believe Gillian's father entrusted to Christen. Before she finds the Highland clans she is searching for, Gillian rescues a young boy, Alec, who is the son of Scottish laird Iain Maitland (from The Secret). On her way to Maitland, she seeks the support of Brodick laird of the Buchanans, a powerful and harsh young chieftain who is Alec's godfather. Failing to understand the customs of the clans, Gillian uses a ruse of claiming to be Brodick's bride to get him to come to her to help her find Alec's family. Brodrick, however, decides he likes the spirited and courageous girl and may not let her go.The story held my interest, the twists and turns were intriguing, and I did like the romance between Brodick and Gillian; HOWEVER there were some distractions from the beginning as there always seem to be in Garwood's romances. Initially the story was difficult to follow as it jumped around from place to place and different time periods. She introduced too many characters and names at one time, some without description so they were soon forgotten and when some reappeared, I couldn't recall who they were. The conversations between Gillian and the young Alec (a 4-5 year old) were unrealistic. A young boy does not speak that way. For example, at one time Alec said \\"The lady's better off dead than married to King John\\"--4 year olds don't talk like that! As with at least one other of her books, the heroine gets confused when her wedding is taking place and the intelligent young woman's mind turns to mush and she fails to recognize she was just married (I have to say it was a bizarre wedding). Then, too, another Garwood trait is to render the heroine the submissive wife at one point and that's in here, too, which I found annoying. Lastly, I didn't think the relationship with Gillian's friend, Bridgid, and Lord Ramsey (who seemed an attractive hero) was very well developed. His confession of love came out of the blue. With these negatives, the story is still a good one and I think you'll enjoy it. In my opinion it is better than The Secret."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is my all time favorite. When I first bought in paperback, I thought it sounded boring. I even had a hard time following it then bam I could not put it down. I have reread it several times. It is funny, full of adventure, and so romantic. I was not crazy about the ending."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book is so good. Fast dialogue, adventurous, romantic and full of heroic characters. You laugh, you hold your breath you cheer. I have read this book no less than 5 times. I have now added it to my Kindle.

I LOVE everything about this book!!!! Only problem I have of historical romance is that the heroine can come off as whiney and annoying but the heroine in this novel is NOT.

Gillian is raised by her loving uncle but is once again forced to face the baron who threatens her uncle with death if she can not produce the treasure. Meanwhile, the baron orchestrates the kidnapping of a young Scottish boy hoping to incite a war. Together Gillian and the little boy Alec escape, all the while Gillian proving her merit to the reader. She and the boy form an adorable relationship. Brodick is a fierce Scottish laird who happens to be Alec's protector (kinda like a godfather). When Gillian and Brodick meet he is immediately impressed by her bravery and beautyThere's also a sweet side romance between Ramsey, another Scottish Laird, and Bridgid a young girl all the soldiers are crazy for.There's more to this story than a straight romance, which is good because I though Brodick was a jerk. He lies and uses Gillian and she just forgives him - just like that.Read in 2 days. PG-13. B"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book was an intriguing read - I could not wait to turn the page! Until the last there were unexpected twists. Gillian was the beautiful and courageous heroine every girl wants to be, especially with a handsome hero like Scottish Laird, Brodick, who finds himself inadverantly falling in love with the \\"accident-prone\\", and unfortunetely English, girl who called herself his bride-to-be, to gain his help and protection from the evil Baron who tore her family apart when she was a small child, and continues to threaten her now.

(though i will say, it seemed like once alec was safe at home, gillian didn't really think all that much about him. from what i discerned of her character, i would have thought she'd be thinking about him more in the story, but he's barely mentioned after he's back w/his parents. and i totally agree with everyone who said that bridgid & ramsey could have had their own book! julie! write another book about those two! they were so much fun!) this book really takes you in & you feel like you know these people. very well written & developed characters. thank you, julie!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom is the sequel to The Secret and details the romance of Brodick Buchanan. For added measure, it also includes the romance of Ramsey. I loved it! It was hilarious. Brodick and his men are grouchy, mean, loveable bullies. This is a book well worth reading, buying and keeping!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book is great! I fell in love with all of the characters in Ransom. The story is well thought out and it never drags or becomes dull. I have read ten Julie Garwood novels and so far I have never been disappointed. I would recommend any of her books."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Nothing like a hard unbending man to make you beg for more. Brodick a character from another of Julie Garwoods novels(The Secret), holds his own in this one. If you like a adventure, Romance, and surprises.

I swear there are parts in the book (when Brodick says &quot;she will not make a sound&quot;) that you will just adore. though this book may be a lot like other garwood books who cares? It's enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I've been reading romance novels for the last 10 years. This is without a doubt my absolute favorite!! I reread it within a week after the first reading. My sister, who doesn't typically read romance novels, enjoyed it so much that as soon as she finished reading, she started over at the beginning. I can't recommend this book enough. Anyone who enjoys historical romance novels will love it!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"The first of Julie Garwood's books that I read was The Secret; as I continued reading I had no doubt that it would always be my favorite. And then I read Ransom and had to change my mind. Gillian is a fabulous heroine, one who is strong and led by her own sense of fairness and justice. Brodick (who I had adored in The Secret) is a perfect match for Gillian. I laughed, I cried, and I've reread the book any number of times! If you like Julie Garwoods's books, you must read this one."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"The first Julie Garwood book I read was Ransom. I enjoyed it because I was not looking for a typical love story, but rather a book which actually had a plot besides two characters continually feuding until they finally realize they love each other, then live happily ever after. I definitely enjoyed Ransom, because the plot of the book kept me involved, and the affection the characters felt for each other was understandable and believable. Also, it was a side note that the characters fall in love--their romance did not dominate the book, an aspect I particularly liked. This was a very good book! Out of all the Julie Garwood books I've now read, this one remains my favorite. It's not a typical romance novel--a very enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I read this book last year when it came out and thought it was pretty good but I was ready to have a baby so I had other things on my mind. Than two weeks ago I picked it up again and started to read and loved it, as always I love everyone of Julie Garwood's books. She has a talent of letting you totally being taken away in the story. I can totally escape into that world. I fell in love with the story of Brodrick and Gillian, so much so that after I was done reading it I went back to THE SECRET (another great book) and than reread Ransome again. If you want to take a break from life and have a good laugh and romance I reccommend this book. There's not many books that you can find on your bookshelf and want to reread again and again, but with Ms. Garwood I always do."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book is one of my all time favorite Garwood novels because it features one of my all time favorite characters - Brodich Buchanan. Brodich is most definitely an alpha male with a wry sense of humor. The supporting characters add to the fun. The only downside to the book was the rushed treatment that Ramsey received. The secondary romance was a bit weak for my taste. Even so, I gave the review 5 stars because Brodich is that good."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ramsay Sinclair and Brodick Buchanon, make a reappearance in this new novel as the heroes. Both now Lairds, they must discover who plots to harm Ramsay's young brother. In the process they meet two remarkable women who disrupt their lives and teach them about love. Fun to read, with a lot of action, adventure and ludicrous dialogue between these feisty women and their oh-so-stubborn suitors, this book keeps you turning the pages. However...Aside from the fact that all of the characters fall in love too quickly for me to keep track of, this book was a great read with the exception of the weak ending. Ms. Garwood, made the women appear both weak and weepy, when those words are a far cry from their indomitable characters. A better attempt could have been made to keep the characters true to form."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I was looking forward to reading another great book by Julie Garwood, what I got was a book that had flat characters and didn't make me feel anything the way her other books have. Maybe if I hadn't read her other books and hadn't expected so much of this new one I would have liked the book better. The bottom line is I am sick of all of her heriones getting lost and having no sense of direction. And if one more wrings her hands together I think I'll scream! Miss Garwood needs to start to give her heros and heriones new personalities and stop having them all share the same traits and act alike. The only reason I did not give it one star was because the story was there, but the characters were not."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I like Garwood's books; they are usually fun, romantic and easy to read and this was no exception.This book is the second of her Highland series and - though I do recommend reading all of them in order - I actually would suggest not reading them one immediately after the other because eventually you will find them a bit repetitive ( in the type of characters - that is incredible beautiful heroine that falls in love with the tough and handsome highlander that resist to admit he is in love - and also in the writing style and descriptions ). I found that if I mix these books with other author I always enjoy them better."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have the majority of the author's series and prefer this era instead of her current novels of modern scenarios. Julie Garwood knows how to enthrall readers!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"If you are a fan of historical romance fiction, you'll love Ransom. I've reread this many times and it never gets old."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I really enjoyed this book, I read The Secret before this one which is the first book in the series.I recommend both"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Although I normally really like Garwood's books, this one was difficult to follow in the beginning and hard to catch the plot line."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Good story wish it would continue into another story line. Love this book but where is the next one to follow"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom is one of Julie's best books. Brought back characters from a previous book. Love her writing and use of humor."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I picked up Julie Garwood's book at the book store because of the cover design. Frankly I refuse to buy any book with pictures of lovers on the cover since they don't usually represent what I imagine the characters to be. Would someone stop doing that for all great romance novels! No only is this a heart-warming story between lovers, it had enough supporting roles to keep you interested, laughing and guessing all the way to the end. I do love a good romance with great humor and dialogues. It is a book to get hook on. If you love this book, the Prize and the Bride are also very good. Although their story is not as interested and involved as Ransom. I think I will read it again tonight."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I was looking forward to reading another great book by Julie Garwood, what I got was a book that had flat characters and didn't make me feel anything the way her other books have. Maybe if I hadn't read her other books and hadn't expected so much of this new one I would have liked the book better. The bottom line is I am sick of all of her heriones getting lost and having no sense of direction. And if one more wrings her hands together I think I'll scream! Miss Garwood needs to start to give her heros and heriones new personalities and stop having them all share the same traits and act alike. The only reason I did not give it one star was because the story was there, but the characters were not."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book was harder for me to get through than most. I found it a little plodding and contrived. The historical content and language were poor - I prefer to read historical novels that at least attempt to keep with the language and characteristics of the time. This one did not. I found Gillian to be a little weak in just succumbing to Brodick's wishes and getting caught or in trouble whenever she didn't. Some central characters, such as the little boys who were the initial start of some of the trouble and Gillian's sister Christen, were not dealt with to my satisfaction. It is almost like they were created, then forgotten and then brought back again just so they could be wrapped up.While I won't say this is a bad book, it was somewhat disappointing. Be prepared to suspend your belief and get through some plodding moments and you can manage to enjoy this book for the most part. I just didn't after a while."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Loved the caraters but was hopping to see Ramsey in his own book. It seemed rushed at the end to include both Brodrick and Ramsey. It is a wonderful book but nothing compared to The Secret."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I've read three Julie Garwood novels which were similar: The Secret, Saving Grace and Ransom. All three have an English heroine going to Scotland and falling in love with a Scottish laird. All three women were too saccharine for me. They bring some changes and knowledge to the Scottish people by telling them not to commit certain crimes, to be polite and to have better manners. For example, one heroine says never steal horses, just borrow them and return them later. One tells the ruling council to give more rights to women. One says a husband doesn't curse in his wife's presence. In two of the books, the heroines bring improved medical knowledge to the Scots. These were too much of the same story and the heroines were too syrupy sweet for me. The heroes were the same, strong, silent warrior types and excellent leaders. In both The Secret and Ransom, the author creates mystery by not having normal communication between the two main characters. In Ransom I was angry at the author for drawing out confusion and mystery through miscommunication. For example, a priest blesses Gillian and Brodick. She thinks it means they are bethrothed (engaged) but the truth is they were married in a method she didn't understand. Later she tells someone she is bethrothed and a soldier says no she is not. If she had then responded to him by asking what the priest had been doing, he would have said that was a wedding. Instead, she says I don't want to talk anymore and walks away. Her not knowing that she was married lasted through several scenes in the book. There were other situations where Brodick would say half of a thought, not finish it and she would assume something incorrect. Or, she overheard part of a conversation, and then assumed something incorrect. Too much of this was happening for me to enjoy the story.Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: two. Setting: medieval England and Scotland. Copyright: 1999. Genre: historical romance.For a listing of my reviews of other Julie Garwood books, see my 2 star review of \\"The Secret\\" posted on 6/21/08."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love Julie Garwood&#8216;s writing. When I received my kindle fire, Ransom was one of the first books I downloaded.."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is a wonderful book!! I enjoy reading it again and again. I actually had the book in paperback and enjoyed it so much I repurchased it so that I could read it anytime."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Beware!!! No text to speech option. Amazon was wonderful and refunded the cost of the book. Amazon has great customer service. I have contacted the author and publisher to voice my option on this matter."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I love all of Julie's books and have a terrible time putting them down! This one was no exceptiion. Hats off to a great writer. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A Christmas gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have every book Julie Garwood has ever written. I am puzzled, why sometimes (and this book is one) it appears she has lost her zest for writing; using the same format and wording from prior stories. Your price however, makes this a very good buy, within this novel you learn about old friends, from some of her other works. It is worth reading, but I wouldn't rush out and pay full price a second time."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I loved it!!! If you loved The Secret (and Julie Garwoods other medieval stories) you will love this one just as much-- or more. You can't help but read it all at once. It's too good to put down and totally worth feeling sleepy over the next morning because you couldn't. I can't wait to see who's story we get next...."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have read all of Ms. Garwoods's tales and they are all wonderful! I especially enjoy the stories that revolved around the Scots! Ransom is no exception! My only complaint is that the relationship between Ramsey and Bridgid was not very developed. Perhaps Ms. Garwood would consider telling Ramsey &amp; Bridgid's story in greater detail?? Hint,hint!I enjoyed Ransom immensely and would highly-recommend it to other readers!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"If you liked or loved Julie Garwood's THE SECRET, you will love this sequel. I enjoyed the development of the main characters, Ramsey Sinclair and Brodick Buchanan, in this book very much, as well as the return of characters Ian and Judith Maitland. Overall, I think this is one of her best books, and I love her stories about those Scottish clans! Also, if you haven't done so already, and you enjoyed this book, you should definitely read THE BRIDE!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have read all of her books and I think she is a fantastic writer. Ransom is by far one of her BEST books. No body else can compare to her!!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"RANSOM was wonderful. A compelling plot and characters that come to life.

All of Garwood's books are great, but RANSOM is now my favorite."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have read all of Garwoods's books and I am estatic at her lastest book: RANSOM. It has all the characteristics of a great Garwood book. The writting is witty not to mention funny. Readers will surely be enthralled by Brodick's and Gillian's story.The only complaint I have about this book is that the relationship between Ramsey and Bridgid is not as developed as I would like. Ramsey is such a great character that he should have his own book. But, having loved Ransom, I cannot complain. This book is a great buy. I recomend this book strongly."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"All I have to say is if you are a true Julie Garwood fan you will go and get this book. I love and own all her books and this one did not disappoint. Reading it was like visiting old friends, happy to be there again laughing and crying, yet sad for the good time coming to an end. This book was so much fun to read. You should read &quot;The Secret&quot; first, and then read Ransom it will make the story that much more complete. My only regret is that I finished reading it so fast, but that's ok because now I can read it over again, this time slowly."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Julie Garwood is my favorite author, and this is my favorite book. The characters are written well and the story is outstanding. I couldn't put this book down. I have read it several times and never get bored. The love story is good and the scenery is wonderful. I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Julie Garwood. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is definately one of my all time favorite books and although I'm only 15, I have read a number of them.

If you haven't read this book, do so."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is definately one of my all time favorite books and... I have read a number of them.

If you haven't read this book, do so."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I haven't read of mid-evil Scotland in years, though it used to be one of my favorite topics studying history in school. It was nice to read a novel that wove through the Highlands of Scotland, including history as well as a wonderful plot. I have enjoyed many of Garwoods books, and this one does not disappt."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"As a new reader to Julie Garwood I found myself falling in love with her books even thou this was only her 2nd book I had read. I lost myself in this story for hours and couldnt put the book down for anything. It was beautifully written and I felt as thou I knew Brodick and Gillian by the end of the book forever. I hope she continues to write more books in the Highland settings due to the fact the Lairds time period was fascinating. It was very enjoyable and I would highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I loved this book. Brodick is rough but believeable and &quot;Lady Buchannon&quot; is full of courage and spirit and I was completely drawn into her story. All the characters are larger than life but funny, and interesting. Even Brodick's guards are enchanting. Garwood is fast becoming my favorite author. Her detail sets you in the middle of the scene and the plot flows well - you laugh and get teary-eyed... It's a keeper."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I've read every book Julie Garwood has written. I started in paperback and have watched her books go to hard cover. It's a testimony to how much I enjoy her books, that I can't ever just wait for the soft cover. I rush out and get the book the day it releases. Ransom lived up to all of my expectations. If they asked me to pay twice I would have. The characters are engaging and the dialogue is witty and intelligent. The romance is sweet and romantic in spite of the Buchanans reputation."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"What can I say? This is one of the best GW books that I have read. It is so good that I think I have read it 3+ times. I fall in love every single time. As with almost every romance novel you know how the end turns out, but don't you just love the journey getting there? If you haven't purchased this book already, do so! There is nothing about this book that is bad. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Gillian is summoned by the man who murdered her father when she was a child to determine the location of a stolen treasure. As she tries to find a long-lost sister who may have the treasure, Gillian turns to Scottish chieftain Brodick. As he tries to help her find the treasure and save her uncle, she unwittingly marries Brodick, who has decided he will simply take what he wants, a tradition of his people that does not sit well with English-born Gillian. His strength and bravery win her over, however, as the two take on all of England to clear her father's name and restore her family's legacy.This is a well-spun tale. Although the Highlanders are a little edgy and rough, and Gillian keeps changing from flimsy damsel in distress to fighting, serious-wound-enduring heroine, I liked the pair and their many cohorts. Not a believable story in many respects, but an entertaining one."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I don't think that I have ever read a bad Julie Garwood book and this just reinforces my belief. I loved this book. I picked it up to read on a four hour plane ride and then couldn't put it down with only 100 pages left to read. I must say that I totally ingored everyone until the book was done. Gillian is such a strong heroine that I felt real emotions for her. I cried when her uncle beat her, I laughed when she didn't realize that she had married Brodrick. Brodrick is also a wonderful character. He truely is concerened about Gillian and I don't blame him for &quot;fibbing&quot; about waiting to go after the three rotten english lords who have hurt her most of her life. All I can say is that I am eagerly awaiting Ms. Garwoods next novel."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have never read a book from Julie Garwood I did not like. I can never put a book written by her down once I start it. This one of course was no exeption. It was wonderful. I loved visiting Judith and Iain and fell in love with Gillian and Brodick. I loved Brodick in THE SECRET and he was wonderful with Gillian. The book made me laugh and cry out loud. I can't wait until Julie's next book. Maybe a whole story about Ramsay and Bridgit? Whatever its about, I'll own it."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This book was given to me by someone in my office. She did not want the book it was given to her as a gift. However it was not her type of book. THIS BOOK WAS WONDERFUL from the begining to end. This was the first of Julie Garwood's books that I have every read. It wont be the last.I can wait to read her previous book called Secrets some of the same characters are in that one."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"WELL THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FROM MS GARWOOD. JUST LOVE IT...... CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEXT BOOK ."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have always enjoyed Julie Garwood's books. Ransom is one that I finished in 1 day. The main charaters were wonderfully independant and wonderful together. They compliment each other, which in turn compliments Ms. Garwood. Strong start, exciting middle and beautiful ending. Recommended to any who enjoys a well rounded book."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"This is hands down the best romance I've ever read. I'm reading Secret now and it is also excellent.Hopefully, we'll have a book starring Ramsey. Keep them coming Ms. Garwood!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have read every one of Julie's books and I must say that this is one of her best. Her stories sound and feel real and she knows just how to tug at your heart. Making you laugh and cry, almost at the same time. I love her books so much that I don't wait for the paperbacks anymore, I just buy the hardcover. I can't wait for her next book, but I guess I have to."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"I have read all of Ms. Garwood's books, and find Ransom to be one of her absolute best. However, I would definately recommend reading the prequel, &quot;The Secret&quot;, first. They are both wonderful!"},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom was definitely one of Julie Garwood's best novels to date. It was right up there with The Secret and Saving Grace. I can't wait to see what's next. My only complaint is that Julie's books don't come out fast enough."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom is an amazing book. As with every other book Julie Garwood has written, the story comes to life. Her characters are incrediably realistic and you feel like you actually get to know them during the duration of the story. I've owned Ransom since it came out and have already read it at least 10 times. It's an amazing story and I would reccomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Ransom","review":"Ransom will captivate your attention from the first page until the last. You will laugh and cry, but most of all you will feel like you are there with the characters. Ms. Garwood tells a story like no one else can. She keeps it lively and moving right along."},{"Title":"Bringing Baby Home: A New Owners Manual for First Time Parents","review":"In the chapter on Pets, Zahn lists &quot;euthanizing your companion&quot; as an option if &quot;Fido or Kitty will not take kindly- ever- to your baby.&quot; (p103)This struck me as rather compassionless, especially for a book about parenting. She could have mentioned the possibility that some pet owners may have to find new homes for their companions, and left it at that."},{"Title":"Bringing Baby Home: A New Owners Manual for First Time Parents","review":"As soon as I picked up the book- I felt like she was speaking to me...I'm a first time mom-to-be...and I have a lot of baby anxiety. It's excellent for those who want a real down-to-earth reading about baby care. I would totally recommend it to friends and am considering buying this book as a shower gift for my friends who will be having babies."},{"Title":"Bringing Baby Home: A New Owners Manual for First Time Parents","review":"Reading this book is like sitting at Laura Zahn's kitchen table and getting the scoop on what to expect when you bring your new bundle of joy home. It's written in a friendly, sincere, down-to-earth tone. I read it several times before my son was born and it really helped me feel emotionally prepared. It's small enough that you can read it cover to cover, and yet it also has an index so you can use it as a reference, later. I also bought Penelope Leach's book and Dr. Spock's latest edition. They are great for reference, but page for page, I got more good information from Zahn."},{"Title":"Bringing Baby Home: A New Owners Manual for First Time Parents","review":"The author relates wonderful, realistic first-hand experiences. It was a nice companion to the more clinical, medically oriented books I had. It was like a girlfriend was telling me exactly went she through--no judgements, no child-psychology mumbo jumbo, just what it's like to bring home a new human being that is totally dependent on you.I bought this book 5 yrs. ago when I had my son and have purchased it several times since as gifts for pregnant friends."},{"Title":"Bringing Baby Home: A New Owners Manual for First Time Parents","review":"I feel so much better after having read this book. While much of the advice from the author I have seen in other books, many topics were covered much more thoroughly. You hear all about how you won't have any time after the baby's born, but this book helps give you a good idea why by breaking down how much time feeding, sleeping, changing and awake time actually take. Of course, every child is different, but I feel better having at least a vague idea! Also, the author's diary of the first month with her child was VERY reassuring. I will definately give this book to all my friends who are first time parents."},{"Title":"Bringing Baby Home: A New Owners Manual for First Time Parents","review":"If you've read anything else, don't get this book. The information in here is SO general that it could be applied to just about anything. The book lists quick explanations of what will happen, but no information on how to respond to what you'll experience. Additionally, there were frightening statements in this book letting me know the author was no expert on the subject of baby rearing. I was exasperated to read her thought that babies should usually be placed in the backseat of the car. I think that everyone knows that is the ONLY place to put a baby in the car. Though, I'm afraid unknowledgeable people will read this book and think it's ok to do such things as put a baby in the front seat of the car.If you've read ANYTHING else, you don't need this book. In fact, if you haven't read anything else, you still don't need this book. Don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"Bringing Baby Home: A New Owners Manual for First Time Parents","review":"The author who wrote this book did a very good job on keeping it entertaining all through-out. I read some other baby care books that it was literally hard to stay awake for, but this one kept me turning the pages. Answers most questions new mothers would have. It even has convenient shopping lists at the end of the book so you know what to get and what not to waste your money on. She even included a diary of a new mother's first 30 days with her little newborn at the end of the book so that you can get a glimpse of what your new motherhood will be like."},{"Title":"Bringing Baby Home: A New Owners Manual for First Time Parents","review":"I can't see quite why so many people gave this such terrible reviews. It is a small book written about the first six weeks of having a newborn at home. The author bottle-fed and circumcised her baby boy so if you have made those choices you might feel more comfortable with her book (she still gives information about breastfeeding, which I found to be accurate and I was grateful for) than others. It isn't really meant to be comprehensive, just short chapters about what you really need to have ready when the baby comes home, and a diary of what it is like for the first six weeks. I found it tremendously useful in trimming down the loads of information in other books into something I could wrap my head around. I had zero experience with babies before I had my daughter, and this book was very straightforward and helpful. Because of its small size and basic information, I was even able to get my husband to read it (he thought he'd just figure it out as he went along before he read the book). Quibbles about pet euthanasia (I wouldn't have put my pets down) have nothing to do with the information she presents. I would and have recommended this book for people with little or no experience with babies. If you are familiar with newborn care and lots of people around you ready to give you advice about newborns, this book might not be necessary or seem too basic."},{"Title":"Bringing Baby Home: A New Owners Manual for First Time Parents","review":"My husband and I wanted to research the ins and outs to having a baby before we got in over our heads. This book not only tells you what to expect, but, it helps with simple, inexpensive little hints for the &quot;breaking even&quot; first time parents."},{"Title":"Bringing Baby Home: A New Owners Manual for First Time Parents","review":"In the chapter on Pets, Zahn lists &quot;euthanizing your companion&quot; as an option if &quot;Fido or Kitty will not take kindly- ever- to your baby.&quot; (p103)This struck me as rather compassionless, especially for a book about parenting. She could have mentioned the possibility that some pet owners may have to find new homes for their companions, and left it at that."},{"Title":"Bringing Baby Home: A New Owners Manual for First Time Parents","review":"Maybe a lot of people enjoy being addressed as though they're just a little bit dumber than this 1st time Mother, but I did not. The author writes as though becoming a mother is akin to being left alone in the nuclear bomb assembly room without an employee handbook. As a first-timer I needed more specific information and less hand-holding from a fellow neophite. Keep looking if you want a book that will yield something useful when he's crying frantically at 3:00AM."},{"Title":"Elements of Agricultural Trade Policies","review":"Economics texts will never make for good bedtime reading, at least not for most of us. But Houck's book is remarkable in its thorough and brief overview of agricultural trade. All of the essential elements are here - tariffs, quotas, specialization, comparative advantage, subsidies, proportionality - as well as a look at how these tools apply to agricultural trade in particular. Minimal prior knowledge is assumed; Houck's explanations are substantial but accessible, straightforward but never dumbed down. As befits an introductory text, each chapter is amply supplied with suggestions for further reading. While it's not long on theory or depth, this book serves as an excellent reference for understanding the basic questions and problems of trade. Recommended for any intermediate economics student!"},{"Title":"Red-Color News Soldier","review":"I salute to the author who kept all these highly restricted photos in a secret location before it deemed safe to be released (after the political climate changed in China). No one in the outside world would be able to imagine the gravity of the Cultural Revolution in China without reading this photographic account on one of the most important event in human history. Although it is a bit expensive, but I've found it worth all the penny and cents."},{"Title":"Red-Color News Soldier","review":"The book contains truly unique photos! I also salute to the editor Robert Pledge for the great selection and the whole rhythm of the book. Since it is a heavy publication a hard cover may better fit."},{"Title":"Red-Color News Soldier","review":"Li's photos captured the extreme madness of hundreds of thousands people in China during that so-called Cultural Revolution and it reveals the very dark side of human nature as seen from, for instance, that young woman cheerfully recorded the place, date and time when she saw Mao going by in his jeep, the humiliating punishment of all sorts of people such as Communist Party Provincial secretaries or provincial governors, newspaper workers, peasants, or whoever in huge mass demonstration against so-called \\"Anti-Revolutionary Reactionaries\\" to different Red Guard factions infightings they reminded me how Hitler got into power, how Japanese militarism got in total control in Japan in its war efforts, and, believe it or not, how George W. Bush & Co. got \\"elected\\" into the White House, they all show that similar built-in weakness of human characteristics- or the human genes! This book tells a lot about all of us. The monolithic political power, century's religious indoctrination are at work around clock and real enlightening secular education around the world is probably struggling in a losing battle. A good book of historical documents."},{"Title":"Red-Color News Soldier","review":"This book looks at a Zhensheng, a propaganda soldier who is rolled up into the Cultural Revolution. When I bought this I thought it was a look at how China used to military information, particularly command information, but this is not the case. It's still a good book and very well illustrated with some great photos but more of a footnote to the Cultural revolution than anything else."},{"Title":"Red-Color News Soldier","review":"I remember reading a review of this in the Far Eastern Economic Review (Oct 16, 2003 issue) and I said to myself after reading that review that I had to somehow find a copy of this book. One week later, I found it. If this truly is part of the only (known) complete collection of photographs of China within 1966-1976, then Li Zhensheng must be commended for his bravery in capturing some of the most poignant &amp; stark imagery that I have ever seen in my life.Starting from the beginnings of the &quot;revolution&quot; in 1964-1966, we are taken through from the initial scenes of relative calmness to the all-out assault on those &quot;bourgeois&quot; elements within Heilongjiang province by the time of 1972-1976. I took a look at the images and could not believe how humanity could do these things to its own. Thank goodness that Li Zhensheng (with Robert Pledge and Jacques Menasche) make mention that only in 1981 did China suddenly realise that the Cultural Revolution did not really achieve anything but set China backwards.There are between 300-400 prints in this book that were culled from over 30,000 negatives taken by Li to New York. If the images in this pictorial story are anything to go by, God only knows what those other 29,600-29,700+ negatives contain. Definitely one to buy for your collection. Recommended without any hesitation."},{"Title":"Red-Color News Soldier","review":"Although the photographs are the main focus of this book, the accompanying text is also illuminating as an individual's account of his experiences of the Cultural Revolution. The text has, of course, been written with the benefit of hindsight - and one gets a sense of retrospective self-justification coming in. The passion that the period inspired amongst the younger generation is also evident, however.The photographs are, of course, contemporary accounts of the living through that period, and consequently have the power to shock significantly. The &quot;struggle session&quot; photographs of senior party leaders undergoing &quot;self-criticism&quot; are particularly horrific. The concluding photographs of a &quot;victor&quot; of the Cultural Revolution on her way to her execution after the restoration of a more normal society also have a big impact - though curiously there is a sense of the pathetic about the woman that Li captures.The photography merits a 5 star rating, the text probably a three. The images are a valuable insight into the strength of emotion in that remarkable period."},{"Title":"Red-Color News Soldier","review":"For those of us fascinated and puzzled over the cultural revolution in China, here are photos to bring to life what we've been reading.There are many faces to study. This document seems curiously objective even though the author has his own story to tell of being treated unfairly. I would not describe the photos as shocking to those who have studied these events in China's history. This is a great companion to any other narrative one might be studying on the subject. Also, the author is a remarkable person. This is another work on the cultural revolution where I come away feeling gratitude toward the author. Li Zhensheng has a more benign story in comparison with some other personal accounts that were part of my introduction to this subject. I enjoy this additional perspective. There is much to see here."},{"Title":"Red-Color News Soldier","review":"For those readers whose knowledge of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution is limited to film, here is a document that shows that most, if not all, of those scenes were not exaggerated. These photographs do more than document. There is something uncanny about them, as though the events depicted happened only yesterday, or as though they happened to YOU. The text that accompanies the photographs follows the story of the photographer and his work through the years. It is mesmerizing. The horrors of totalitarianism are well known, but this book communicates something original about the human condition that I believe is priceless and rare. If you can't afford this book, you should seek it out at a bookstore or library and read it."},{"Title":"Red-Color News Soldier","review":"I confess that this review is only based on a browsing of this startling book in a bookstore. It presents what it claims is the only known photographic documentation of the entire period of China's Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) that the author collected during his days as a photographer for a Communist Party controlled newspaperThe photographs capture the revolution's sudden grip and the mass hysteria that went along with it. There is some pretty stark imagery of public humiliations, of forced &quot;self-criticisms,&quot; of rampaging Red Guards, of executions.There must nearly be around 300 prints or so. A stunning collection that is perhaps a required addition to the library of any Chinese, and a proud addition to everyone else's."},{"Title":"Red-Color News Soldier","review":"I teach art and history, and this book is an absolute godsend for both of these subjects. its a fantastic example of reportage photography, and the Photographs alongside the memoir mean it is an invaluabe resource for teaching about the Cultural Revolution in China, and Asian History. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Red-Color News Soldier","review":"I would not call the photos \\"shocking\\" so much as chilling. This is as much a psychological treatise as a historical one. A testament to the insanity found in mass movements. The unconditional acceptance of the irrational. We all need to be reminded of what this phenomenon looks like."},{"Title":"Red-Color News Soldier","review":"Some might call Li Zhensheng brave or foolhardy. Regardless, he let his conscience be his guide and stowed away negatives that captured celebrations, executions and public denouncements. His hidden photos are probably the most critical photos of China to ever appear in print. Well written, put together and documented - this book is absolutely indispensable to any historical library or anyone who wants to understand the Cultural Revolution right here. Photo journalism at its most complete and best."},{"Title":"Red-Color News Soldier","review":"Things can go horribly wrong in China. The current leadership seems wise, but they still revere the instigator of the cultural revolution. It is hard to know what lessons to be drawn from this period. It was the final attempt to severe the Chinese from their thousands of years of rich history. It makes me angry when people don't protect their own culture. The world needs diversity and cultures should be protected. Leaders and people that instigate attacks on their own cultural traditions have my full contempt.In this book you see the cultural revolution through the photographs of one brave photographer. It will build up your hatred towards totalitarian regimes. It will hopefully teach you not to trust government people, who say they do things for your own good. This is a lesson for humanity not just the Chinese."},{"Title":"Red-Color News Soldier","review":"This isn't just a history book laced with photos; this is also a personal view on the Cultural Revolution from the photographer's point of view.

(The short exceptions are damp-proofing basement walls, and repairing fireboxes.)The book features clear step-by-step instructions and color photographs (one good photo for each and every step of every project -- HUNDREDS of photos total) for working with natural stone, stone veneer, brick, glass block, concrete block, poured concrete, patio tile, stucco, and hypertufa.The projects cover all the simple outdoor jobs (such as walkways, walls, and patios), the common elaborations (such as adding lattice panels to a block wall, or laying tile over concrete), and quite a number of complex constructs -- like &quot;Building a Stone Moon Window&quot;.EVERY section of text has one or more illustrating photographs to show what they're writing about. EVERY photograph is in color, with good contrast, color rendition, and composition. EVERY project includes an &quot;Everything You Need&quot; box, listing all the tools and materials required. EVERY tool that's used in the projects has (1) a picture in the &quot;Masonry Tools &amp; Equipment&quot; chapter early in the book; (2) a closeup of the tool in use; and (3) explanatory text discussing proper technique. EVERY material used has pictures of all states through its life -- from the bags clearly depicting brand names like &quot;Quikrete&quot; and &quot;Lehigh&quot;, to the dry materials, the mixing process, the layout stage, and finishing with the final assembled project.If this book had the same comprehensive coverage for INDOOR projects (tiling bathrooms and creating concrete countertops are high on my wish list), it would be worth SIX stars!"},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Home Masonry: Step-by-Step Projects & Repairs Using Concrete, Brick, Block & Stone (Black & Decker Home Improvement Library)","review":"With a chapter covering a project or two in each flavor of medium, this book in a general sense yeilds what you need to build basic walkways, walls, patios.

I love to spend hours in bookstores looking for different kinds of books and am pretty quick at purchasing what I know I will like. This book intrigued me just by the title - it went right to the top of the pile of books that I brought home that day. I started reading it right away.The story deals with how the Yasui family copes with the trials and daily living of being different. It also gives a look into how they at times fit in with their white (hakujin) neighbors and no one noticed.The story is both touching and exciting as the reader goes through the generations of Yasui's and how they feel about the world around them.I think that Ms. Kessler did a very good job of telling the story of each family member while weaving them into the importance of the famliy as a whole. I too come from a large family with generations of history. It has inspired me to start better record-keeping for my own children and the ones to come.I never knew of the reasons behind the internment of the Japanese Americans during the war. This book not only gives facts and history but the details of how real people had to cope to survive. I recommend this book to anyone interested in history, and an admirable approach to finding the courage to start over in life."},{"Title":"Stubborn Twig: Three Generations in the Life of a Japanese American Family","review":"I found this book while browsing in the stacks one day. I had no idea that Japanese had been imported to build the Railroads in the Northwest during the late 19th and early 20th centuries (this was because Chinese were not available... laws had been passed making their immigration to the US illegal), and mainly ONLY MEN. It was a real eye-opener (I have seen NO such information ever in any US History book I read in school, and I am born and educated in the US -- graduated from UC Berkeley).This book is very easy to read and become engrossed into. I could not do anything else in my spare time other than work on finishing reading this. It goes a long way to filling in much of the missing pieces with Japan of US History before, during, and after WWI and WWII.Most US Citizens NEVER heard of Min Yasui, a newly minted Lawyer and Japanese-American US Citizen (by birth) from Hood River, Oregon, who decided to challenge Executive Order 9066 by deliberately disobeying it, getting arrested, charged, convicted, and put into Solitary Confinement for the duration of WWII even as the US Supreme Court ruled against him regarding the Constitutionality of it. And, yes folks, Executive Order 9066 could be reissued today, against anyone (even you), without Due Process. You too could be treated just like the Yasui's, ripped out of your job and home, have your bank accounts frozen, told you had 48 hours to pack and could only bring what you personally could carry with your hands and nothing more... and then lose your property and home when you could not pay the property taxes (because your Bank Accounts had been frozen by the Federal Government).You say you're a US Citizen? So were the Yasui's (except for Min and his wife, who were prohibited by Federal Law from ever becoming Naturalized Citizens -- a Law that was not changed until 1958!! Whites could, and Blacks after the Civil War in 1865 were added to the list. But Asians were never mentioned anywhere. It didn't say they could not, but it didn't say they could either. It just didn't say... and so the US Supreme Court ruled that Asian Immigrants were EXCLUDED from ever becoming Naturalized US Citizens. Hard to believe? Read about how the Yasui's coped with this issue. And the next time you eat an apple from a box marked HOOD RIVER, OREGON... you will know &quot;the Rest of the Story... &quot;.This book should be Required Reading for anyone taking or even remotely interested in US History."},{"Title":"Stubborn Twig: Three Generations in the Life of a Japanese American Family","review":"This was my book club book this month. Good thing. Otherwise I might not have 1) chosen it...I don't tend to pick up history nonfiction books for my reading, and 2) gotten through the dense first few chapters. I'm so glad I kept reading. Kessler does an amazing job of pulling together an incredible amount of research and interviews to clearly show the history and culture of Japanese immigrants moving to our country as well as their experience here, in the past and up to current time -- all through the lens of one large extended family. I'd certainly heard about the internment of Japanese-Americans during WWII...but I had no idea of the full extent of what that meant. I think every American should read this book so that we don't ever allow that kind of treatment of our citizens again. This book may well have you reevaluating your own sense of right and wrong and what it means to be prejudiced. And it will have you thinking about your own background & history.Kathie Hightower, co-author of Help!

Some summer afternoons my father would take me with him to buy vegetables from a Japanese farmer. My father, normally outgoing, was reserved and deferrential. Dad explained that the farmer before the war had been a successful engineer, but had lost everything when he was forced to go to \\"the camp\\" - a tragedy and great waste. I've been haunted by that guiet farmer ever since, so it was with enthusiasm that I began Stubborn Twig, the story of a Japanese family's American experience.Stubborn Twig is well researched and chock full of details about the Yasui family. Reading their story should be compelling. It's not. It's repetitious, tedious and a slow, difficult read. The last 50 pages, the third generation, is a mix of biography and sociologist psycho babble. So why read Stubborn Twig? Because it's an important story, an American story that has much to teach us, and one that shouldn't be forgotten."},{"Title":"Stubborn Twig: Three Generations in the Life of a Japanese American Family","review":"Interesting story but I had to skip a lot as I found it very dry.

I live in Oregon and this helped me appreciate the book even more as I could visualize where a lot of these events took place. Overall, a solid historical account of the events that this family endured, and an important story, but not a great book. The writing style was way too dry."},{"Title":"Stubborn Twig: Three Generations in the Life of a Japanese American Family","review":"Even if you think you are informed about the internment of Japanese- Americans during WWII, this will surpise you.

Guess that is what I hoped it would be. My book club is discussing it tomorrow night at my home and several have echoed my thoughts---should be an interesting discussion."},{"Title":"Stubborn Twig: Three Generations in the Life of a Japanese American Family","review":"I recently discovered Stubborn Twig, the featured book in Oregon Reads, a statewide reading project offered in conjunction with Oregon's sesquicentennial celebration. Lauren Kessler has provided a well-researched and compelling multi-generational story of the Yasui family, a Japanese American family headed by patriarch Masuo Yasui.Masuo emigrated to this country in 1903, and eventually settled in the Hood River Valley, Oregon. He built up his power and position in society as a community leader and successful businessman, even while he and his family faced rising anti Japanese sentiment. This culminated in the family's internment during World War II, as a result of President Franklin Roosevelt issuing Executive Order 9066 in mid-February of 1942, calling for the removal of all people of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast. This book follows the Yasui family through the internment and the war's aftermath, touching on Masuo's legacy to the next two generations.It has only been relatively recently, on August 10, 1988, that then President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Civil Liberties Act, calling for an official apology to all survivors of the internment, as well as some financial reparations. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to gain an understanding into what is one of the more shameful chapters in our country's history."},{"Title":"Stubborn Twig: Three Generations in the Life of a Japanese American Family","review":"This was a touching, heart-wrenching, yet also inspiring account of a real Japanese American family. The author took us through the daily, normal and even mundane early life of these children, so that as the terrible events of World War II unfolded, the reader could see the nonsense and horror from their point of view. The treatment of Japanese Americans by friends, neighbors, fellow citizens and our own government is inexcusable."},{"Title":"Stubborn Twig: Three Generations in the Life of a Japanese American Family","review":"This was a gift to someone.

Y. 2003, 933 pagesThis is the most gripping and fun read I had in a long time. A friend, we met on a trip up the Columbia River, recommended this. I bought it out of respect and curiosity but put it aside until I read most of the books described above and below these Booknotes. It is a rollicking good novel and like all fiction combines memory with fantasy. Even science, history and biography combine fact with memory and fantasy. But fantasy has less free reign in most history, biography and science.I suspect the author lived or knew people who lived most of the events described in this novel. It feels true even if, at times, it reads like the Perils of Pauline. And naturally the central character comes out as the most admirable.That said it is a tale of redemption and a look at a world where all ethnic, cultural and religious groups are equal. The book will give you a realistic look at prisons, the city and people of Bombay, crime lords and criminals and corruption in general. There is plenty of high-level philosophical conversation. To paraphrase one exchange,One million evil men, ten million stupid men and one hundred million cowardly men rule the world. The rest of the five billion of us endure them all.The one million evil men are the top criminals, religious, political and business leaders. The ten million stupid but brave men are the police and soldiers and the one hundred million cowardly men are the functionaries and bureaucrats who know what is going on and say nothing. There are also some interesting talks about the definitions of good and evil, right and wrong, The Big Bang and the evolution of the Universe. It is a very hard book to put down once you start reading.In short you will get an interesting and exciting tour of a world that, God willing, you will never see or experience. And you will find it filled with interesting, believable, admirable and likeable people. They all are, like us, a mixture of bad and good but no one is condemned and all struggle toward the light."},{"Title":"Stubborn Twig: Three Generations in the Life of a Japanese American Family","review":"This book was required for a class at Eastern Oregon University and I ordered it for use in the class."},{"Title":"Stubborn Twig: Three Generations in the Life of a Japanese American Family","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book; it is well written. It opened worlds I had no knowledge of. My father was raised in the Hood River Valley and went to school with some mentioned in this book; this is real and living history to me. My life has been forever changed."},{"Title":"Stubborn Twig: Three Generations in the Life of a Japanese American Family","review":"Like many Americans, I knew virtually nothing about the unconstitutional internment, property seizure, and harrassment of ethnic Japanese before, during and after World War II in the United States.This book takes a prominent Hood River, Oregon family and follows their struggles as Issei (first generation immigrants) carve out a home in the small town amongst judicial and societal bigotry, loose everything, and then suffer emotional and financial effects as Nisei (second generation) and Sansei (third generation) face their own troubles carving out their identity as Americans.What Stubborn Twig does is put a face on the internment experience. You find yourself cheering for Masuo Yasui and his wife as they break race barriers in Hood River's town, business, and schools.You find yourself wincing with shame as their children are ostracized from clubs and normal teenager dating behavior.And you find yourself chilled with loss at their personal tragedies.As a person more-than-averagelly interested in the history of Japanese and American relations, there wasn't much in this book that was surprisingly new, just a level of detail that was fascinating. This is a real family who lived real lives in a tumultous time in Oregon's history.What did constitute new information to me was the extensive coverage of Nisei son Min Yasui's struggle for redress for the crimes (yep, I used that word on purpose) committed against ethnic Japanese during World War II by the United States government.The detailing of his fight, purposely breaking laws to be a test case, attempting to force the Supreme Court to rule, etc, and how his children carried it through may feel a bit long and dry sometimes, which is why the book doesn't quite get the 5th star, but for readers interested either in history or in facing a very dark time in US history it is definitely interesting.This book's Snack Designation Rating: Tart and sweet Hood River Apple slices for how pushing through the hard-to-swallow sour racism to the sweetness of humanity's ability to survive and hope for healing sweetness in the end"},{"Title":"Stubborn Twig: Three Generations in the Life of a Japanese American Family","review":"A well-researched history of a Japanese American family that settled in Hood River, Oregon at the turn of the century and the struggle they endured to carve out a life for themselves in a racist political and social climate. Hard to read at times, Stubborn Twig describes how Mat (Masua) Yansui worked hard to establish himself as a business owner and orchardist, start and raise a family of well-educated children, and become a respected member of the community and how quickly his world came crashing down after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Denounced by the community that had come to heavily rely upon him, and arrested as a Japanese spy, Mat spent many years in federal prison camps while members of his family were interned in Oregon and California. I was amazed that throughout their horrendous ordeals, the Yansui family stayed ever committed to the U.S. and its justice system. Even more amazing is that as a country we have failed to learn from our past mistakes when characterizing people based on race. The blatant attacks on Arab Americans post-September 11th comes to mind. I believe we would all do well to learn more about this grim chapter of our country's history, if not from Stubborn Twig, then elsewhere. My one gripe with Kessler's writing style was that details were repeated again and again and the storyline was a little anachronistic, which is why I gave it only three stars."},{"Title":"Stubborn Twig: Three Generations in the Life of a Japanese American Family","review":"Coming a little late to the party, I'm grateful for the chance to read Kessler's thoughtful portrayal of the Yasui family. The story of Masuo and his heritage is set amid a time when Americans didn't shine so well. The Japanese people who were tragically mistreated during WWII faced the sorts of prejudices we're all prone to practice in our own eras and cultures, especially when it seems like no one is watching. The fortunate piece of the sad outcome for the Yasuis and others arrived decades later, in the light of their courageous sharing of their story. I agree with other reviewers that Stubborn Twig should be required reading. It casts the same sort of spotlight as do places like Dachau concentration camp in Germany, where every school-age child must visit.This book has rightly won its honors. Kessler writes with feeling, yet as a journalist. Those expecting an epic novel will find a more subdued approach. I, for one, appreciate the lack of melodrama. This story is told by an author immersed in the understated ways of the Japanese, and I find the style appropriately powerful."},{"Title":"Stubborn Twig: Three Generations in the Life of a Japanese American Family","review":"On a flight from San Jose to Mobile, I read most of \\"Stubborn Twig\\" by Lauren Kessler. I got up early the next morning and finished reading the book.It amazes me that some readers found this book boring, because I found it fascinating to see how three generations of Japanese-Americans used their courage, creativity, and traditions to survive a very difficult situation (i.e. internment) and become extremely successful, accepted, and well balanced. How many other groups have so quickly overcome such terrible adversity? Some people remain mired in bitterness the rest of their lives after facing problems less difficult.Many of the Japanese-Americans who were put into internment camps during WW2 lost all they had gained after years of labor, but most of them in one generation were achieving success with little bitterness. I believe they are an amazing people and a good example for the rest of us on how to \\"make lemonade out of lemons\\".The patriarch of the family, Masuo, knew that as a second son he had no future in Japan, so he committed himself to making a place for himself in the USA. He studied English so diligently that years later he corrected his American born children's English compositions. How many immigrants can match Masuo's determination to do well in the USA?In building his businesses, Masuo has all of his children work hard to make the businesses a success. By doing this, Masuo taught all of the children to work hard to be successful and they all are.When Masuo and most of his family are imprisoned in internment camps, Masuo helped to keep his family from becoming bitter and helped them to make the best of the situation so they don't spend those years being bitter and useless.One son became a lawyer and committed most of his life after WW2 was over to challenging the constitutionality of the internment of most of the Japanese-Americans who were living on the west coast. Very few German-Americans were interned. Masuo efforts were successful and finally a Federal apology was issued to Japanese-Americans interned during WW2.Most of us in the USA have never experienced anything comprable to what Masuo and his family experienced, so by reading this story we have the opportunity to vicariously live what they lived and perhaps learn a few lessons from the experience."},{"Title":"Stubborn Twig: Three Generations in the Life of a Japanese American Family","review":"A thought provoking and somewhat disturbing history of a multi-generational Japanese family in the US....this book causes one to ponder the results of fear and ignorance, and how some truths (we WERE eventually at war with Japan) can be distorted into exaggerated and corrupted pronouncements, (all the Japanese were here to take our land, spy for Japan, and \\"take over\\"), causing actions of far reaching consequences.

His life is one of struggle, success, disappointment, and at times, true suffering. From this man, and the woman he marries while she is still in Japan, springs a second, then a third generation of Japanese-Americans, most of which lead fascinating and successful lives.This is not a novel, but the well-researched story of this family's life. In telling their story we learn of the lives of many of those around them, friend and foe. And we learn a lot about our nation. I'd recommend this book, although I might suspect that it would not be a page-turner for many. At times it may seem to move slowly, and in tying together the various family members there is some repetition, but it's just enough to remind us of who we're about to read about and where we last left them.I would very much like to hear from any Japanese-Americans who read this book.

The fact that Malmouth chooses not to play in tournaments has stirred controversy over the years from those whose primary involvement in poker is tournaments.

Miriam Lichtheim's \\"Ancient Egyptian Literature - Volume I: The Old and Middle Kingdoms\\" was my starting point.The customer reviews recommended it - and what other customers have to say about a book is usually an important factor as to whether I will buy it. In this case, I was cautious and only bought the first volume. I enjoyed it immensely.Professor Lichtheim's aim was to provide an up-to-date translation of a representative selection of Egyptian Literature, and in preparing these she states that she has made full use of existing translations and studies. I found her introductory survey on the development of Egyptian literature and her detailed explanation and notes of each text to be most useful in helping me understand what I was reading.This first volume includes translations of about 50 texts dating from the 5th dynasty of the Old Kingdom to the 14th Dynasty of the Middle kingdom - which covers the period c 2450BCE to c 1650BCE. The texts include tomb inscriptions, selected \\"Utterances\\" from the Pyramid texts, Didactic Instructions, Songs and Hymns, as well as three amusing and interesting prose tales - The Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor, ThreeTales of Wonder, and The Story of Sinuhe.The Didactic literature is also very interesting, generally being instructions from kings to sons on how to properly rule the kingdom after his death. But they also include such texts as \\"The Dispute between a Man and his Ba\\", \\"The Eloquent Peasant\\", \\"The Satire of the Trades\\", and the much (partially) quoted and often misquoted \\"Admonitions of Ipuwer\\".The book was worth buying for the this last item alone, since this text has often been described as providing textual evidence of events leading up to the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. According to Professor Lichtheim, the only surviving text is on a 19th Dynasty Payprus comprising 17 pages of about 14 lines with lacunae in various places, and she provides the complete translation of all that is still legible. In her explanation of the text, she discusses at some length whether the text is \\"a direct response to a calamity\\" or an \\"historical romance\\". Her conclusion is that \\"The Admonitions of Ipuwer has not only no bearing whatever on the long past First Intermediate Period, it also does not derive from any other historical situation\\" She believes it to be \\"the last, fullest, most exaggerated, and hence least successful composition of the theme 'order versus chaos'\\" Even if you have already decided that Ipuwer IS describing events leading to the Exodus, it is worth buying this book to read the translation of the full text by a scholar who has provided a most cogent explanation of its provenanceI know this is going to be one of those books which I shall read time and time again. I thoroughly recommend it to other readers, and I certainly intend to obtain Volumes II and III."},{"Title":"Ancient Egyptian Literature: Volume I: The Old and Middle Kingdoms (Near Eastern Center, UCLA)","review":"When I was learning to read Middle Egyptian, it was Lichtheim who kept me on track. She has a wonderful gift for translation. Her translations, while very close to literal, somehow manage to carry the atmosphere of the original without sounding as bizarre as a literal translation would."},{"Title":"Ancient Egyptian Literature: Volume I: The Old and Middle Kingdoms (Near Eastern Center, UCLA)","review":"This is an excellent corpus of translations from an authoritative hand, including from simple &quot;funeral&quot; and &quot;biographical&quot; inscriptions from the Old Kingdom upto nice and good renderings of all the major &quot;tales&quot; and &quot;stories&quot; from the MIddle Kingdom: The Tale of Sinuhe, The Dialogue between a Man and His Soul, the Tale of Kheops and the magicians, and many other paramount titles of the ancient Egyptian literature dated to the aforesaid periods. Each piece contains an introductory notes with the &quot;history&quot; of the documents and end-notes full of interesting comments as for the translation's details and plenty of bilbiography.

It contains a representative sampling of Pyramid and Coffin texts, monumental inscriptions, didactic and wisdom literature,including the famous &quot;Dispute Between a Man and His Ba&quot;, a few hymns, and prose selections, including &quot;The Story of Sinuhe&quot;, &quot;Three Wonder Tales&quot;, and &quot;The Shipwrecked Sailor&quot;. For me the clincher in deciding to purchase this particular volume over its competitors was Ms. Lichtheim's decision to leave the words &quot;ka&quot;, &quot;ba&quot;, and selected other terms untranslated rather than giving anachronistic, supposed modern equivalents, to these complex words, as other recent translators have done. There are, additionally, excellent introductions and notes."},{"Title":"Ancient Egyptian Literature: Volume I: The Old and Middle Kingdoms (Near Eastern Center, UCLA)","review":"Perhaps I am being a bit pedantic in my mediocre review of _Ancient Egyptian Literature_, but the flaws in the translation and the relative narrowness of its scope compared to other anthologies warrant a solid 3 star review. Lichtheim's introduction is fantastic - its explanation of the role and importance of Egyptian writing strikes a perfect balance between clarity and academic exposition. However her translation of the Htp di Nsw (\\"Hotep di nesu\\" - a formulaic prayer common throughout Ancient Egypt) immediately caught my attention.The prayer (\\"An offering the king makes ...\\") should be translated with the preposition \\"for\\" or better, \\"to\\" (\\"An offering the king makes to [insert diety here: Ra, Set, Anubis ...]\\") - yet Lichtheim has is as \\"An offering which the king gives and Anubis ...\\" which really makes no sense at all given the context and purpose of the prayer not to mention it is simply incorrect. Admittedly I am being nit-picky here, but such a basic error brought into question the accuracy of the rest of the literature she translates. This minor issue aside, the selection of literature in the anthology is good: Lichtheim includes autobiographical stelea, excerpts from the Book of the Dead, songs and hymns and a handful of prose tales. Taken as a whole, they give a solild overview of Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom literature. Were this the only book on the subject, it would warrant a much higher rating from me. However, it is not.The Literature of Ancient Egypt: An Anthology of Stories, Instructions, Stelae, Autobiographies, and Poetry; Third Editionhas many of the same inscriptions and narratives included here (and several that are not, although to be fair, Lichtheim's anthology here is only one of three volumes). To compare apples to apples, Simpson's anthology has more Old Kingdom narratives and instructions, and more Middle Kingdom religious literature._Ancient Egyptian Literature_ is fine - good, even. But if you are interested in more detail (with a better translation), I recommend Simpson's anthology."},{"Title":"Ancient Egyptian Literature: Volume I: The Old and Middle Kingdoms (Near Eastern Center, UCLA)","review":"Great!

A suit-wearing, veddy-veddy English magician with style and a forceful personality, rather than the usual Gandalf-clones. But rather than focusing on a group of people or an individual that Chrestomanci helps, this book focuses on Chrestomanci's life -- more specifically, the events that molded him into the powerful magician ahead.Christopher Chant is essentially a semi-normal little boy in Victorian England &#8212; the abnormal things are discounted, such as meeting mermaids -- or dreaming of places, and coming back with souvenirs. His parents are almost nebulous figures, and his nursemaids change continuously. One day he meets his Uncle Ralph, a friendlier person than any Christopher has encountered before.It turns out that Christopher is a \\"spirit traveller\\" -- when he dreams, he actually drifts from one world into another. To add to this oddity, he also has nine lives (he uses up a few of them as the story progresses). And not only Uncle Ralph is interested in Christopher's talents &#8212; his father manages to get him to Chrestomanci Castle, to be trained as the next Chrestomanci (the person in charge of all magic).And Christopher hears something more &#8212; about smugglers getting illegal magical goods from the different worlds. And Uncle Ralph may be connected to them. Who is good and who is bad? Christopher, the Goddess, and Thogmorten the cat try to save themselves from the sinister smugglers and the guards of another world...One endearing thing about this book is the way that Diana Wynne-Jones understands a small child's way of thinking, such as Christopher assuming that if his mother wants him in a good profession, she wants him to be a missionary. We see Christopher gradually shifting into a more world-aware viewpoint as his powers grow. Wynne-Jones also acknowledges, as many books such as Harry Potter do not, that simply because a place is harder to live in and not as much fun as elsewhere, does not mean that it is a bad place. The people who expect the most from Christopher also care the most. Lessons about responsibility, using your natural-born gifts, and caring about others are also sprinkled throughout it.Christopher is a very realistic protagonist. He's not perfect, and simply because he is powerful people don't revere him as being better than anyone else. One of the best scenes in the book involves a friend of his scolding him for being self-absorbed and cold to others &#8212; and Christopher realizes with a shock that it's true. The Goddess, a very bored incarnation-of-a-deity from another world, is an excellent female lead and counterpoint to Christopher. (The scene where they debate who is a heathen is hilarious). Most of the other characters flit in and out too quickly and briefly for us to form a solid opinion of them, but Throgmorten (\\"Wong!\\") is also a priceless personality.Writing style is nearly impeccable, very evocative and only goes dead in a few areas. There is also a lot of humor in this book: the scene where Christopher runs wailing through the hospital, Throgmorten the \\"wong!\\" cat, Christopher's obsession with being a missionary, and other tidbits of hilarity.This is a wonderful fantasy book, especially if you're already a fan of the Chrestomanci books. You don't need to have read any others to enjoy this on its own."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"This wasn't worth reading, sadly. The plot was pretty well thought out, but the dialogue and characters were really underdeveloped."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"The story of young Christopher Chant and how he grows in to both his magic and his inheritance. To Christopher the landscape beyond his bedroom which leads to multiple worlds seems normal. It takes time for adults to realise he can access these worlds, and longer still for Christopher to understand the barriers to his own magic and the full extent of his powers. This book is conceptually vast, yet is also a fast paced adventure/mystery/fantasy story. I greatly enjoyed this book, which I read in one sitting, and look forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"Christopher is an only child of two parents that constantly bicker, and every night, Christopher travels to other worlds for great adventures. He has a cool uncle Ralph that seems the understand him.

Christopher, it is discovered, has nine lives and his so magically powerful that he is destined to become the next Chrestomanci. He befriends a similar powerful young person, a Goddess, in another world. Slowly and without realizing it, Christopher falls into darkness, becoming an angry, unkind, and disagreeable child that is breaking the laws of magic. Christopher must determine who is good and who is just trying to use him. My favorite character is Tacroy, who is quite ambiguous, and yet is sort of Christopher's Sirius Black, as the only one who can identify with him as a spirit traveler and understands him. The book itself is just another beautifully written, incredibly clever and imaginative and magical work from Diana Wynne Jones. The images and so vivid and so brilliant. Grade: A-"},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"I read this book many years ago, and did not even realize that it was part of a series until recently. I bought the other books in the series, and was expecting the other books to be similar to this writing style. While the other three books in the series are good stories and entertaining reading, it is \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" that is the best of the series. This book has more depth and humor than the other books in the series. I devoured this book in one setting, because of the wonderful imagery and use of dry humor and wit. I actually don't think that you need to read the books in the series in order; besides the first two in the series, these books really don't have much in common with each other, besides the Chrestomanci character. Each book is a wonderful book in its own right. However, it is this book that gives the best background of the world in which Chrestomanci lives. Highly recommended, especially if you like J.K. Rowling - this book is the most similar to Rowling's style."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"While chronologically this story comes first in the series of stories that comprise the Chrestomanci series, it is best to read after the wonderful \\"Charmed Life\\" because that story is the one that makes you wonder about the intriguing boy that is the hero of this one. Knowing what will become of young Christopher does not in any way detract from the delight of this story -- in fact it heightens the level of anticipation. This story and the preceding one (\\"Charmed Life\\") are easily the most complex and interesting stories in the series, and really the ones that the rest hang upon, because they really explain who and what the \\"Chrestomanci\\" is, and the role he plays in the fascinating universe Diana Wynne Jones has created. This is fantasy at its best, well written and very inventive, with characters that seem both familiar and bizarrely unique. It is, I suppose, not life-changing fiction but it keeps you there and makes you care and gives an opportunity to wonder. (It is no accident that Hayao Miyazaki based his latest film - Howl's Moving Castle -- on one of Jones' novels: they seem to have imaginations that operate on the same wavelength; like him, she is endlessly inventive and capable of a sublime blending of the supernatural and the ordinary, and loves finding magic in machines, and has an obsession with cats.)The basic premise of the \\"Chrestomanci multiverse\\" is that every time there is a major event that \\"changes\\" the world, the world actually divides into two alternate realities, one in which the event occurs and one in which it doesn't. Somehow, though, while the possibilities might seem infinite there are a limited number of possibilities that resemble the one Chrestomanci inhabits enough to warrant his general attention and concern. Within each major world variation, there are nine alternates (don't ask why just nine) that are apparently unified because they have the \\"same\\" people doing different things in them. It sometimes happens, though, that an individual within one of those realities has no parallel in the others, and so the \\"lives\\" that would belong to the other realities actually belong to him or her. Such a nine-lived individual has powerful magic and becomes a likely candidate for taking over the position of the British-hired Chrestomanci (think a mixture of Rowling's Minister of Magic for an indication of his range of responsibilities, with Head of Hogwarts for his overall competency).Speaking of Rowling, some have compared Jones to Rowling and there are some interesting parallels -- so many that it is hard not to think that Rowling had at least read some of Diane Wynne Jones' stories. Still, I don't agree with others who say Jones is a better writer than Rowling. There is a way in which she is: for her elegance of prose, her compactness of style, for the overall simplicity and completeness of her stories. Still, I think that Rowling is superior because what Jones doesn't try to do Rowling does very well. Jones creates another world whose basic features are similar to ours, but is different in specifiable ways. In that sense it is pure fantasy, a work of the imagination that she can tinker with and alter in various stories but is basically self-contained and organized in such a way that each story can be really complete. Rowling fits her story of another world into THIS world and sets herself with what seems to me a much more difficult task of accommodating her fantasy to the unknown and improbable and strange and unfinished character of any story set in this real world. The edges in any such story are unwieldy and it is a real tribute to Rowling (though in no way a criticism of Jones who has other aims) that she can wield them so well."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"Diana is one author that has never ceased to amaze me with her skills and novels that sweep me right into the books.

The lives of Christopher Chant is no exception. Quite possibly it is one of her best works, but I'll let you decide on that one. This particular book actually takes place before any of the others, but for some reason it is the fourth in the series. It stars a young chrestomanci - Christopher Chant - a boy who can traverse through the multiple worlds at will, who unknowingly posesses nine lives and is one of the strongest magic -users in his own world. He is taken to Chrestomanci castle, where he is trained to become the next Chrestomanci, a sort of overseer for all the magic that goes on in the many worlds. However, he is also secretly recruited by his uncle Ralph to make a series of dreamlike trips into the other worlds to retrieve and deliver mysterious packages, one of which is incidently revealed to be dragon's blood, a highly powerful and illegal magical ingredient prohibited by the law. Christopher is exposed to countless dangers on these forays and each time he dies in his spirit trips, he is killed in the real world by a parallel accident. As time passes and Christopher continues to lose his lives, the reigning Chrestomanci is killed and the worlds are pushed into chaos.

His Uncle Ralph, excited of his nephew's extraordinary powers, begins to send Christopher on missions in his dreams.

But soon the story picks up with an extraordinary gripping plot that will fill the reader's mind with magic. This novel is literally a dream come true."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"Although Christopher Chant appears in the other books of the Chrestomanci series, this is the deepest look into the character of Christopher, and instead of a breif glimpse, we are given a basis for his actions and his ideas in the preceeding books.In 'The Lives of Christopher Chant' we start by looking at a different world through the eyes of young Christopher: his strange and distant relationship with his parents, the continual changing of his nursery maids and governesses, and his private trips in his dreams to mysterious places. When his Uncle Ralph appears and treats Christopher differently, more as a capable person than a isolated child, he is ready to idolise him and obey him in any way possible, believing Ralph to be kind, unselfish and caring, when in reality he is quite different. Christopher is asked to go on trips to these other worlds, and does so without question, returning with strange items, not suspecting the trickery behind his actions.Christopher goes to school, where people begin to suspect about the extrodinary power behind his average facade.In this book we see aspects of rebellion, friendship, childish hatred, boredom and unhappiness that many children are able to relate to. All this is tied in with adventure, magic, believeable characters and imaginative twists. Another great aspect is the faint idea that not all people classed as 'evil' are so easily catagoried when you compare their actions to the humane areas of their personality.I loved this story, and felt it to be one of the best books in Diana Wyne Jones's Chrestomanci series. From here you really start to understand the character of Christopher, laying new undercurrents in the other titles. The concepts, language, plot and dimension, as well as the originality, makes it one of the few really brilliant children's books around.This book was extrodinary, and deserves much more popularity and recognition than it has got."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"I found out about this fantastic book on amazon.com and requested it at the library in our disrict.

Chrestomanci turned the sterotype of old, sagely wizards upside down in the first Chrestomanci book with his dapper attitude and humorous qualities. However, I'll be frank; I did not enjoy this book as much as I enjoyed \\"Charmed Life\\". The story was very slow in places and the ending was very rushed. But, Jones still won me over with her delightful characters, quirky magic, and adept talent at writing meaningful and thoughtful fantasy.Christopher Chant starts out as a normal boy who doesn't quite understand everything that's going on around him. Christopher never even bothered to tell people, ecspecially his feuding parents and nannies, about his dreams and the worlds he visits in them. But one day, Christopher's new nanny discovers all of the objects Christopher brings back from his dreams, and informs Christopher's Uncle Ralph, a charming enchanter, about them. It turns out that Christopher is a spirit traveler, or a person who visits the twelve related worlds in their dreams. Uncle Ralph soon recruits Christopher for many \\"experiments\\" where Christopher must bring him back various goods from the related worlds, and Christopher is only too happy to oblige.On these experiments, Christopher soon loses many lives at such an obvious rate that he realizes he has nine lives and is a powerful enchanter, even though Christopher can barely manage the simplest of spells. Christopher is soon sent to live in Chrestomanci Castle for training, and he hates it. He would much rather play cricket than become the next Chrestomanci, but everything changes when Christoper realizes that his \\"perfect\\" uncle is really an inter-world illegal smuggler, and Christopher so happens to be his partner-in-crime even though he didn't know what he was doing in the first place.The story is told with Jones' usual quirky prose and humor. Many readers who read the first book will smile as the story goes on and many of Chrestomanci's background is cleverly explained. Christopher as a character is skillyfully progressed from a naive and somewhat cold child to an aware and powerful enchanter. However, the story, as much as I would like to deny it, does suffer some problems. The beginning is a very long drawl, as well as the middle, and nothing interesting happens till Christopher finally arrives at Chrestomanci castle. From there to the ending its a smooth ride. Unfortunately, it appears that Jones didn't know what to do with her ending as its very quick and jumbled. For the last fifty pages, everything is unusally described and very confusing. I just wish that the story had ended with a strong conclusion rather than the sentence \\"that is really all, except for a letter that arrived for Christopher from Japan soon after New Year ...\\"Even though the ending was a jumbled mess, we're still talking about Diana Wynne Jones here, and her brilliant writing and humorous details makes even a very weakly plotted book enjoyable. While I did not enjoy \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" as much as I enjoyed the first book, readers everywhere are sure to enjoy how Chrestomanci went from a timid boy into a powerful enchanter."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"This an incredibly lovely book that I have read a million times; and each time has been just as enjoyable as the last.This book is the second in the Chrestomanci Quartet, and is my favorite of the four. The story is about a boy named Christopher Chant who discovers that he has magical powers, and, in due time, a truly amazing and exciting life ahead of him. Buy this book! I assure you that you won't regret it;~)"},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"Evey night when young Christopher Chant goes to sleep he turns a corner in his room and enters The Place Between. From there he enters the Anywheres, magical worlds where people are kind to him and give him gifts. And when people find out about his gifts and the fact that he has nine lives they're more than thrilled. CHristopher suddenly finds himself thrown into two words. The world of his Uncle and his magical tests in the anywheres, and the world of the Chrestomanci in the Chrestomanci castle. Through this story CHristopher's magic and loyalty will be tested. And even though he dosen't want it, he's destined to become the great Chrestomanci who we know of so well in Charmed Life.In my opinion this book housed what the last one I read (Magicians of Caprona) lacked. THe actual presence of the Chrestomanci for more than a couple scenes. I really enjoyed this book and even though I'm done with the series (it was good while it lasted) I'm thinkign about digging into more of the authors work. If you like tales of magic and adventure you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"I finally got my own copy of &quot;The Lives of Christopher Chant&quot; and my collection is complete. Even if you have never heard of Chrestomanci in your life you will think he is the greatest after you have completed this book. Jones makes young Christopher interesting and convincing as he is swept through this adventure. It is great to see Christopher's powers forming and a delight when he finally comes into his own. His friend The Goddess is also wonderful. Like many of Jones' young heroines The Goddess is more intelligent and real than many young girls you read about in inferior books. Those who are familiar with the character of Christopher will be enchanted to see the beginnings of the little quirks that make our favorite enchanter so interesting. One of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"Christopher tells this fiction story and it is written in the neatest way! How the author came up with all of the creative storylines and cool creatures...I'll never know! Read this book as soon as you can . But just don't be fooled by the not-so-interesting begining !"},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"This is another of the Chrestomanci series, chronologically the first. It is the story of Christopher Chant, who has peculiar dreams. When he goes to sleep, he can get up out of bed, round a small corner in his room- and suddenly he is in a moist, foggy, rocky world. Depending on where he climbs in this odd place, he can get to many other fantastic worlds. He has friends in these worlds, among them mermaids and the incarnate form of a goddess. Christopher has told no one about these dreams, and he is thought to be a little bit of a disappointment because he exhibets no magic talent. However, dangerous mishaps begin happening to him at an alarming rate, and finally, after an incident that should have killed him, it is realized that despite his apparant lack of magic, he must be an extremely rare and powerful nine-lived enchanter- which means that he is one of only two people in the world who have the innate ability for world-travel- which is what his &quot;dreams&quot; are. This is one of my very favorite Diana Wynn Jones novels."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"Diana Wynne Jones is the best fantasy writer ever. Why is she not more famous than J.K. Rowling? The Lives of Christopher Chant was our first introduction to the worlds of magic and adventure that Diana Wynne Jones spins in every book. We barrelled through the Christopher Chant series, The Dalemark Quartet, and searched all of the bookstores for every last story. Our family's all-time favorites are Time of the Ghost and Archer's Goon. Every kid from age 6 to 66 will love these charming, enchanting tales."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"This is Diana Wynne-Jones at her best. It's a fantastic novel and should be read with all the other Chrestomanci boos, too. If you've read Charmed Life, you'll appreciate this book; it tells you how Chrestomanci in Charmed Life (really Christopher) became Chrestomanci, aswell as explaining the coming of his wife, 'Millie', who was origionally a goddess in another world. It's a little confusing, but a great book."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"The Chrestomanci series is a great series, this is one of the better stories of the four that are written. The two things that run consistent through all the stories is the Chrestomanci and the many worlds that exist. The title of Chrestomanci is for the person who makes sure that all magic is used properly. It is very difficult to get because one of the requirements it that the person must have nine lives rather than the usual one. The multiple worlds are an interesting concept in the Chrestomanci stories. The concept goes like this, when a big even occurs, such as a battle, one of two things can happen. Either one side of the battle wins or the other side wins. Since both of these things cannot happen at once, the world is split into two worlds where in one world, one side won and in the other world, the other side won. This concept is used by Diana Jones as a base for plots and interesting twists.&quot;The Lives of Christoper Chant&quot; is not about Cat but rather it is about the childhood of the Chrestomanci in &quot;Charmed Life&quot;, so the book takes place some many years before &quot;Charmed Life&quot;. Christopher Chant is a spirit traveler. He is able to travel to the other worlds. What is even more special is that he is able to take back things from other worlds to his world where as nobody before could do such a thing. Christoper didn't realize this was a gift but thought that these were dreams when he went to the other worlds because he could only go there once he fell asleep.Unfortunately for Christoper, his Uncle Ralph, whom he admires greatly, finds a way to exploit Christopher's gift by making him take expensive and illegal items from other worlds into his own. While Christopher lives in Chrestomanci's castle doing this, Chrestomanci at the same time is trying to find the smugglers who are bringing this stuff into their world. I love the ending where many elements of the story and other side plots merge in to one.This is a great story and I recommend it to anyone, one note is that you may want to buy the &quot;The Chronicles of Chrestomanci : Charmed Life/the Lives of Christopher Chant&quot; book because it has this story in it and the &quot;Charmed Life&quot; story which I think go together quite well."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"This book is cool.

It inspired me to read her other books."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"Diana Wynne Jones wrote the archetype that the Harry Potter series seems to be derived from in every aspect. These are funnier, constructed more carefully, and slightly more challenging.

Was this early art for Charmed Life or did the artist not read the book?"},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"The Lives of Christopher Chant, is humour at its very best! Wynne Jones is one of the best children's fantasy writers, she pioneered techniques still being used today. This is one of three books (Witch Week and Charmed Life) and gives us an understanding of the person behing the lofty and mysterious Chrestomanci. Its a very funny and tongue in cheek look at Christopher Chant's childhood, as he walks between &quot;Anywheres&quot; and gets caught up in illegal activities unknowingly. Wynne Jones puts plenty of laughs into it, from Christopher reading the Unabridged Arabian Nights, to the interesting Goddess who freezes Christopher in a wall until he agrees to her demands....and all the while, Christopher is losing lives....."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"This is the first book of Diana Wynne Jones' that I've read and it got me completely hooked.I re-read it at least twice a year.

Blessed, or cursed, with nine lives and the ability to travel to spirit worlds in his dreams, Christopher isn't too thrilled to discover that he is destined to become the next Chrestomanci. Quite content with his dream worlds and performing tasks for his Uncle Ralph, Christopher is horrified when he is made to leave school and friends behind and travel to Chrestomanci Castle. Here he will learn the skills necessary for his future role, a role that Christopher definitely does not want. Soon the future Chrestomanci is battling a group of smugglers attempting to steal from the dream worlds....\\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" is young adult fantasy at its best. The plot is magical and will keep you reading right up until the end. A little slow to get going, the action soon picks up and never stops. Anyone who likes adventure or fantasy should love this. I can't wait to read the remaining books in the Chrestomanci series."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"\\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" is set twenty-five years before the events told in \\"Charmed Life\\", but was published after it in 1988. Although many would avidly insist that you must read such books in publishing rather than chronological order (just look at the debate that rages over how you're supposed to read the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\") I would suggest reading this before \\"Charmed Life.\\" It will not ruin any of the surprises in that book, and instead drops little hints throughout (such as Chrestomanci's aversion to silver, and the name of his future wife) that will become that much more enjoyable when you read of them in \\"Charmed Life\\".Set in a parallel world where magic is an everyday occurrence young Christopher Chant lives a rather dull life, caught between his neglectful and feuding parents. Thank goodness for his dreams, which allow him to wander about in secret worlds - and are so vivid he often brings back objects with him into waking life! But after he meets his Uncle Ralph things begin to get more interesting. Organising his young nephew to meet a man named Tacroy in his dreams, Ralph instructs Christopher on removing other, larger things from his dreams into the real world. Seeing it as a fun game, as well as liking both his uncle and Tacroy very much, Christopher plays along.Between these exertions and visits to the young girl known as the Living Goddess, Christopher finds that life is not entirely what he wants it to be. With a longing only to become a professional cricketer, Christopher is horrified to find that he is destined to be the next Chrestomanci - the nine-lived enchanter in charge of governing magic in the worlds. Taken to Chrestomanci Castle, he is sulky and unco-operative - until the magic smuggler known as the Wraith grows in power, and the Goddess herself escapes into his world. Now Christopher is forced to take action...A fascinating, intricate, quirky book that takes place over several years and draws on several genres (only Diana Wynne Jones can go from English boarding school to Arabian Nights to elfish and Biblical lore), this could possibly be my favourite in the Chrestomanci quartet. Once again, the author proves she is an expert at human behaviour, a fan of cats and someone who's not afraid to tackle large and important issues in children's books.She's also wonderful at portraying the lack of self-awareness in people: one of the most memorable scenes is when Christopher makes an off-handed comment and is suddenly reprimanded by his teacher for years of selfishness and snobbery. Christopher is stunned, having no idea that he was so disliked - but on closer reflection he realises it's true. \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" deeply explores these ideas - that we can't always follow the dreams that we want, that we must sometimes put others before ourselves, and we have a responsibility to use our natural gifts.The characters are wonderful as usual - from Christopher himself who you watch grow as the novel progresses, to the spunky Goddess, to the terrifying cat Throgmorton and the amiable, elusive Uncle Ralph. Things are never quite what they appear in these novels, and it is as fun to explore the \\"Anywheres\\" along with Christopher. \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" is a great read, and a wonderful place to begin the journeys into the rest of the Chrestomanci books."},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"\\"Oops!\\" The dragon spews fire all over Christopher and \\"There goes another life!\\" The Lives of Christopher Chant is a book about a nine-lived boy named Christopher. Every night he dreams he gets out of bed, walks around the corner of the fireplace in his room, and slips into a dreary world called \\"The Place Between.\\" While conducting experiments there Christopher loses some of his nine lives.Strong things about this book are that the story line moves along quickly, so your interest stays captive. You'll also appreciate how Dianne Wynne Jones's story line is unique. No other author has ever written anything like her \\"Place Between!\\" Her strong characters really pull the story together. Take \\"The Christomancy\\" (The Magic Governor) for instance. It seems like he was always a strict and stern man born to be \\"The Christomancy.\\" However, he actually started out like Christopher, angry and bewildered.More details would improve The Lives of Christopher Chant. Having additional information would make it easier to visualize Asheth's Temple, and why The Living Asheth (the girl who acts as a channel for the god Asheth's power) wanted to get away. More explanation about why silver stops Christopher from working magic would be helpful. Was it Christopher's dad's fault that silver stops him operating magic?Rush out and buy The Lives of Christopher Chant, it's a page turner! The story line is new and interesting. It is a magic book, and you can never tell what's going to happen! I hope you don't lose your nine lives as quickly as Christopher Chant!"},{"Title":"Lives of Christopher Chant","review":"If you are into fantasy, adventure, humor, or all of the above, you have to read The Lives of Christopher Chant.

Some like bald eagles and cardinals are a no-brainer. But what about all of those indeterminate grayish-brownish-whitish birds that may only be identifiable by their habits? This is where a book like &quot;Life Histories of North American Nuthatches, Wrens, Thrashers, and Their Allies&quot; proves to be useful. It contains 142 black-and-white photographs of birds performing activities such as feeding and incubating, and in the case of the white-breasted nuthatch, creeping head-first down a tree-trunk---not just sitting on a branch and looking mysterious.By no means are the photographs the highlight of this volume. Arthur Cleveland Bent was one of America's foremost ornithologists, and his twenty-volume series on North American birds was originally published under the sponsorship of the Smithsonian Institution. In this particular volume he and his correspondents have compiled specific observations on about 104 different birds, including various nuthatches, creepers, wren-tits, dippers, wrens, mockingbirds and thrashers. Bent also utilizes the writings of America's great naturalists of the past, including Audubon, Burroughs, and Brewster.This Dover edition is an unabridged, unaltered republication of the original 1948 edition. Its anecdotal style is very readable, even charming. The copious details of avian nesting habits, courtship patterns, plumage and field markings, food, songs, and flight habits are made interesting by the dedication and enthusiasm of the hundreds of observers who contributed to this book.In it, I finally learned why one of my favorite birds, the white-breasted nuthatch moves head-first down tree trunks. Francis H. Allen (1912) points out an advantage in this procedure, saying: &quot;I suspect that by approaching his prey from above he detects insects...which would be hidden from another point of view.&quot; The woodpeckers and the creepers can take care of the rest by moving up the trunk.By all means, begin your bird-watching career with some of the good field guides such as &quot;Eastern Birds&quot; by Roger Tory Peterson. When you are ready to delve more deeply into the natural history of your local birds, I strongly recommend these volumes by Arthur Cleveland Bent."},{"Title":"The Sing-Song of Old Man Kangaroo (Just So Stories)","review":"Kipling was a master children's story writers and this story is one of his best!"},{"Title":"The Sing-Song of Old Man Kangaroo (Just So Stories)","review":"The gorgeous illustrations caught my eye and so I picked up the book for the first time. What a wonderful story. Kipling has a way of writing that just flows and makes reading the story out loud a pleasure just to hear the words."},{"Title":"Field Quantization","review":"The book's focus is on carefully explaining what quantum field theory is. Starting from classical field theories, ie. the harmonic chain, Greiner goes on to discuss 2nd quantization for spin 0, 1/2, and spin 1 fields. The results are then applied to derive the perturbation expansion for interacting fields. The last sections on quantization with path integrals is also well written, and contains more details than eg. Sakurai. Throughout, many (sometimes tedious, but) instructive examples are presented that lots of other authors just assume to be understood already."},{"Title":"Field Quantization","review":"This book starts with classical field theory and moves on to some simple, but very relevent examples of nonrelativistic field quantization. Greiner works through all important relativistic system of free particles before a spectactular introduction to Feynman rules via quantum electrodynamics as the primer. The book finishes with a nice introduction to path-integral quantization. This book covers mathematical detail of relativistic field theory in a simple way, making it an excellent introductory text."},{"Title":"Field Quantization","review":"There are so many different QFT text books, but this one is of special value:(1) It is a really thorough work, e.g., symmetry principles, path integral, QED, even scalar qed are discussed in detail here! (2) The details are all included, so you will not find something like \\"it easily follows from..\\". (3)It introduces everything in a good order. For example, it treats non-relativistic Schrodinger field first before going to the relativistic theories. It has shown that non-relativistic fields permit both boson and fermion rules. From this you can easily see how quantization rules are related to relativity. I am sure you can learn some solid QFT from this book. Of course, I recommend this book along with the standard reference by Peskin-Schroeder, and the lively book by Zee."},{"Title":"Field Quantization","review":"The only reason this copy is 50 dollars cheaper than the other printing of \\"Field Quantization\\" is that the manufacturers screwed up the margins, and the inner margin is tiny. Text is obscured, and it is not really usable without great sacrifice.I'm surprised Amazon even sells this copy. Don't get had."},{"Title":"Field Quantization","review":"Unfortunately, for this particular printing, I cannot disregard the particulars of the 'physical quality' of the book. (Normally I consider this to be barely worth a mention.) This is the sole origin of my rating, please appreciate this. The rating refers specifically to ISBN-10: 3540780483.As one other reviewer kindly mentioned, the margins have been screwed up: when you open the book, you can barely (if at all!) read the text next to the inside margin. There's maybe a quarter of an inch (or so) from the text to the point where the pages are bound together. Once you press the book down, laying it completely flat, it is readable. It does still look rather awkward. I decided on keeping the copy, since it is mostly for reference; if you intend to learn the material from this book, it could be actually too distracting/annoying. (Personal preference: if I intended to spend many hours with this book, I would return this copy.) I consider this manner of the publisher, or/and amazon, to be beyond 'an acceptable variation' on the quality of print: customers should have been warned. As the other reviewer nicely says, this is why this printing is so much cheaper than the 'regular' one. (I did not take their advice seriously enough.)As for the book itself (content), I give it 5 stars without much thinking. If you are a serious student of quantum field theory, this is a most excellent resource. Note that Greiner's whole set of books is organized very differently from many other, still excellent, books on QFT. You'll find that a lot of things that are typical in a 'normal' QFT book, are delegated to other books in Greiner's series; there are three or four other books that may be relevant to a particular purpose that your study of QFT has. (For example, one of them is in fact Greiner's third book on Quantum Mechanics: Special Chapters.) This frees him to present in this volume the material that is more strictly related exactly to what the title is: quantization of fields. Other than this aspect, the book bears every mark of his series: lots (and lots) of very good examples, of many kinds, worked out in good detail. It's a truly good resource. (Please don't give in to a possible temptation to simply 'read through' them. This is not a way to gain command over any material; you want to, and must, *work through* stuff.)In summary: I very readily recommend Greiner's books, this one included. (As for the purchase value, please appreciate that for a full coverage of a subject you may need multiple volumes.) But as for this particular printing, consider carefully whether you can put up with a very strange physical layout.As for mine rating the book by its physical appearance: in this case I feel that, unfortunately, I must warn other possible buyers of this very unusual issue. Two stars: this manner of the publisher (or amazon) is unacceptable, and this copy may in fact be unusable for many people; but it is possible to read it. (My friends were appalled; but one of them 'wouldn't mind.')"},{"Title":"Field Quantization","review":"I found this book fairly easy to follow. It is well written in terms of teaching the subject because it includes most of the steps for derivations. As a person who only has a good background in quantum mechanics but no background in quantum field theory I was pretty happy reading through the book.I did not have any problem with the margins, and in fact wrote quite a lot of notes in the large outer margins. Chapter 11 is missing its first page which at first caused me to think 10+ pages were gone because it substituted page 350 for page 337.Because I don't have time to memorize things, I found myself going back through the book to look for definitions. Everything is well defined before it is used. When ever I ran into a symbol I forgot the meaning of, I could always find it earlier in the book. This is good proof to me the author was careful about how ideas are introduced and combined.There were only a couple of places where I could not follow a derivation by writing down every step at the time I read the passage. But returning to that place again after finishing the chapter I could finish filling in the steps.Given the price of most quantum field theory books, this is definitely worth getting just to help with a different point of view on a difficult subject."},{"Title":"Field Quantization","review":"My E&M; professor tried recently a very ambitious project: teaching QED as part of graduate-level electrodynamics. So first semester we ran through Jackson, and second semester we marathon-sprinted through this text, getting as far as Feynman diagrams. This book might be slightly too advanced for first-years, but not much so. It is written as an introductory text, to prepare graduate students for the more advanced treatment of QED in the authors' later book.Quantum ElectrodynamicsThe text is organized very well. The main subject matter is quantum field theory, but this subject is developed through physical examples; uniformly weighted HO chain, Schrodinger wave function, Klein-Gordon field, Dirac field, Mawell field, and then on in to second-quantizations of these. It's a sort of step-by-step process that builds a great basis in the mechanics of field theory with increasingly more complicated examples. It's a great structure.However, the math is really sloppy. I don't really expect pure mathematical rigor from a physics book (no one should), but the book uses ideas that aren't well-defined; e.g. A functional derivative of a functional of a functional. That is, dF[G[f(x)]]/df(x). Some of the math isn't very well-motivated, either. Maybe it's just the nature of quantum field theory, but a lot of the explanations seem really magical; we do this because it makes the answers work, and that's that. There's a lot of ordering conventions (at least two) that are supposed to make \\"explicit\\" infinities disappear (which they're still there) and the only motivation for them is to avoid infinities. At some point, it becomes more a kind of hieroglyphics with a particular grammar, as opposed to a field of mathematics. Again, that may be the nature of QED, but the lack of mathematical rigor or meaning is very apparent from the way math is handled in the book.While the math is sloppy, the physics isn't. The physical meaning of the equations is the important issue to the authors of the book, afterall, and it is explained very well. The organizational structure helps very much to build up to the advanced subjects of interacting photon and electron fields in a relativistic framework. Reference is made to classical mechanics and to \\"classical\\" quantum mechanics, and from there establishes a relativistic picture. It is very straightforward and confusion is minimal.Sometimes, I felt there was a lack of clarification in some things. Only things like skipped steps or poor motivations, or maybe translational ambiguities. Some statements were not as self-evident as they seemed to the authors. This was not enough to obscure the subject, whose results are still clearly presented.The price is another factor to consider. It's somewhere around ~$20, and delivers a LOT of book for that itsy bitsy price. I felt a deep joy in being assigned a textbook that cost me less than dinner out, and delivered an approachable wealth of knowledge on a very advanced subject. I'd recommend grad students or PhDs interested in field theory buy it. It's a great way to get your feet on the ground in the subject.Given how low the price, this might seem attractive for self-study or as a supplementary reference work. If you like owning your own reference books, this would be a good one to get. If you're taking a more advanced course on QED and find yourself stuck, this might bring the subject on a more intuitive level to get you started. As to self-study, I don't know how useful this would be. There aren't a lot of problems, which is essential to self-study.Overall, I give the book 4 stars. I can't entirely blame it for the sloppiness of the math, and it doesn't pretend to be a math text, but the math is really sloppy. The price, though, more than makes up for poor form in mathematics, especially for those more concerned with the big physical picture and not the formal minutiae.After writing the above review, I read some of the others and noticed they complain about the margins. To be perfectly honest, I never even noticed there was anything fishy about the margins. There's a lot of space on the outside of the pages, but I assumed that was for notes. I went back and looked at my book, and sure enough the text runs right to where the seams meet. Everything is still legible, and as I said, I used this book a whole semester and never noticed; but if it will bother you, maybe another printing? The text itself, regardless of printing issues, is fantastic, and I didn't find the printing issues even noticeable."},{"Title":"Field Quantization","review":"I am deeply disappointed and thoroughly frustrated with the perplexing and redundant complications of the book. It is true that the author, apart form being a very fertile textbook writer, has a very thorough approach when it comes to derivations and mathematical explanations. However, in doing this, he obscures the physics contained. The author insists on very thorough mathematical explanation without reference to intuition, making the topic more about mathematical derivations then physics. The mathematics is not complicated, it is just tedious. He does not leave anything to be done by the reader, turning the learning process into an effort of understanding how the author thinks and how he thinks you should understand the topic."},{"Title":"Cairn Terriers (Kw Series, No. 169S)","review":"I found this book very informative on the subject of Cairn Terriers.

To my amazing discovery as I was reading this book, I found that some of our present day leaders already follow a lot of these very principles and are the first to acknowledge that none of their success would be possible without their faith in the Almighty One. This book should definitely be among the second book a person reads aside from the original plans for man given directly by our Creator to the prophets, as it reiterates the path to success in all of lifes affairs.

GOD BLESS!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Leadership Secrets of Jesus","review":"Other than the Bible, there is no other book I have ever read that combines mind and heart so lucidly, and shows us how to use both to their maximum potential in service to the Lord. \\"The Leadership Secrets of Jesus\\" contains tough, uncompromising Bible teaching that if one is willing to walk the straight and narrow path, will lead one to new levels in life, and help reach for excellence one never thought one was capable of. It is also brilliantly written, full of a light that can only emanate from wisdom attained by God.Dr. Murdock is a great motivational writer and speaker, and his words inspire one with a fire that makes the narrow path easy, and once traveled on, an inner peace and knowing in the truth of God's mighty Word. This book is especially valuable to those who are in business for themselves, or in a position to supervise others. There is a lot of content on the ethics and management of one's career (\\"Your integrity will always be remembered longer than your product,\\" pg.21), planning one's time (\\"The secret of your future is hidden in your daily routine,\\" pg.33), and money (\\"money is for movement, not accumulation,\\" pg. 118).The path cannot be walked without courage (\\"You must be willing to go where you have never been, to create something you have never had,\\" pg. 52), and faith and prayer. Reading the Bible on a daily basis is a priority (\\"Make a daily appointment with God,\\" pg. 172). Dr. Murdock suggests nurturing the habit by reading the book of Proverbs, since it has 31 chapters, and reading a chapter a day per month, so that it becomes a part of one's routine.The layout of this sturdily constructed book is excellent, with a font size that is easy on the eyes, insets of \\"Wisdom Keys\\" that are concise and memorable, a prayer and some insightful questions to ask oneself, and a Bible quote on the subject of each chapter. If one is diligently seeking Him, and willing to walk the walk, \\"The Leadership Secrets of Jesus\\" can be a life-changer."},{"Title":"The Leadership Secrets of Jesus","review":"This is definitely not Murdock's best. Some of his books are excellent (eg., 7 Laws You must Honor to Have Uncommon Success) and some of them appear to be just pamphlets taken out of the Biblical text designed more to raise funds than to inspire with original insight into the scriptures. This book is typical of that type.

In a Europe teeming with literally millions of Allied and Soviet soldiers, and amid often hostile populations over whom they had previously exercised their power with frequently breathtaking brutality, how could so many have made good their escape and live out their lives in relative peace? Uki Goni doesn't have all the answers, but he sure has a lot of them.Goni is concerned in his research with how so many of these malefactors made to specifically to Argentina, more specifically, to Juan Peron's Argentina, and why. To this end he looks at Peron's ambitions and goals, the various networks available to him established both during the war and after its end, and at the type of people he was able to bring over. We see how routes are established (and eventually blocked) through Spain, Denmark and Sweden, Austria to Italy (Genoa), and most importantly of all, through the good offices of the Vatican. Some of these routes and people running them overlapped, others were independent; at times the operation seemed centered in Europe, at other times run by remote control from Buenos Aires. But throughout, there is the money, the support, the direct intervention from the very top in Argentina.\\\\Why? Although Schellenberg was to remark that Argentina shared a similar world view with the Nazis, the fact is that Belgians, French, Croatian and other war criminals were defended or helped first, Germans as a general rule not until later. While Peron made an effort to bring in engineers for his jet pilot program, he was specifically looking more for Catholics, anti-communists and not Germans per se. The Vatican shared an interest in protecting Catholics, especially Croations, from deportation back to justice, and had hoped to rely on anti-communist Ustashi elements, for example, to help roll back godless Tito-communism.Goni has done tremendously detailed research, revealing more documented evidence than ever seen before, showing exactly how these various trails led from danger to South America. His work is very well footnoted, his recreation of what took place riveting. Few people, including agents representing Britain and the United States, come off looking entirely clean; officials representing Switzerland, the Red Cross, the Vatican - including Pope Pius XII - and of course Peronist Argentina, are fully exposed.Some of the more prominent war criminals' individual journeys are examined in greater detail - Mengele, Eichmann, Priebke, Bohne and Schwammberger. It is interesting contrast the very different lives led by some of these types, eg Mengele's relative comfort vs Eichmann's abased destitution in exile. Goni also sheds some valuable light on the way Eichmann was identified in the first place, and how/why the Israeli government came near to welching on their payment of the reward, paying up only 12 years after Eichmann's capture.There is plenty of information not covered in this book; per above, Goni is interested in the Argentine connection, not the escape of any or all war criminals, and as such does not do more than touch on the involvement of governments in Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia or Brazil as it relates to the subject. He touches but little on Skorzeny or Rudel's involvement in the postwar scene, or join the hunt for Martin Bormann or Heinrich 'Gestapo' Mueller. But when it comes to in indictment of his own nation, and of the enthusiastic participation of the Vatican and numerous SS or SD or collaborationist free-lancers, this book is definitive and outstanding in every way."},{"Title":"The Real Odessa - How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina","review":"Great book on the tie of Argentina to Hitlers Germany during WWII.

The Catholic Church certainly had at least onepriest (a Croation) helping the Nazis, but that priest was himself a war criminal, and hardly representative of his church. He was not consideredfavorably by the Pope, but the Pope certainly had no knowledge of what he wasup to. There was obviously no earthly reason why the Catholic Church would have wished to help escaped Nazis. To the extent that Goni falsely extends thebehavior of the priest to include the entire Church, he is dealing in slander, nothing less. What his motives are or whether he is simply incompetent I don'tknow. But on the basis of this, I have to dismiss whatever else he claims as\\"from an unreliable source\\" and leave it at that. We need an independent secondsource - never believe one source when investigating history. There's simply too much incompetence out there and too much of a desire to generate sales bywriting lurid tales.

Uki Goni. New York: Granta Books, 2002, 382 pp. $29.95.Reviewed by Kenneth Maxwell, Foreign Affairs, January/February 2003A chilling, detailed story of one of Argentina's most shameful secrets: the enthusiastic role of dictator Juan Peron in providing cover for major Nazi war criminals as the Third Reich collapsed, allowing them to lead prosperous and protected lives after the war. Few characters get off easily in this passionate account, which untangles the networks and escape mechanisms that made it all possible. Coming to Peron's assistance were numerous institutions and individuals: the Vatican, the Argentinean Catholic Church, the Argentinean government, and the Swiss authorities who cooperated through a secret office set up by Peron's agents in Bern. Operatives from Heinrich Himmler's secret service arrived in Madrid as early as 1944 to prepare an escape route; in 1946, this operation moved to Buenos Aires, establishing its headquarters in the presidential palace. Eventually, this operation's tentacles stretched from Scandinavia to Italy, aiding French and Belgian war criminals and bringing in gold that the Croatian state treasury had stolen from 600,000 Jewish and Serb victims of the Ustasha regime. Ingrained antisemitism, anticommunism, greed, and corruption all fortified these clandestine protection rackets. Today, the stain remains, as does the secrecy. This astonishing book delineates in gripping detail what was long suspected -- and also hints at how much remains to be told."},{"Title":"The Real Odessa - How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina","review":"THE REAL ODESSA is an interesting expose of the escape of Nazi criminals into Argentina during the time of Juan Peron's reign. As a former exchange student to Argentina, an admirer of Eva Peron, and a person in the process of conversion to Judaism, it is understandable why THE REAL ODESSA would hold interest for me.Rumors and accusations of nazism have long circled around the figure of Juan Peron, leading many to think that Peronism was simply the South American extension of the Nazi party. Books like THE REAL ODESSA are now being published to bring the truth forward. Part of that truth is that Juan Peron himself was not a Nazi and did not subscribe to any Nazi ideology. As Lawrence Levine notes in INSIDE ARGENTINA FROM PERON TO MENEM, Peron's own views and his political associations were not anti-Semitic: \\"Peron sought out the Jewish community in Argentina to assist in developing his policies....\\" Levine also notes that one of Peron's most important allies in organizing the industrial sector was Jose Ber Gerbald, a Jewish immigrant from Poland. Perhaps Robert D. Crassweller states it more succinctly in the appropriately titled PERON AND THE ENIGMAS OF ARGENTINA: \\"Peronism was not nazism....\\"So, if Peronism was not nazism, why exactly did Juan Peron, as THE REAL ODESSA points out, help Nazis excape from justice? Because, as Tomas Eloy Martinez, author of SANTA EVITA, says, Peron was hoping to acquire advanced technology developed by the Germans during the war. (Martinez also notes that Evita herself played no part in any dealings with the Nazis, which I find ironic seeing as how her picture is used on the cover of THE REAL ODESSA.) Peron was not a Nazi; but he *was* a politician, and one not opposed to shady dealings at times. (And yet another confounding thing is that, as Joseph Page writes in PERON: A BIOGRAPHY, there were no concentration camps in Peron's Argentina, Peron was at heart a pacifist, and it was the military government that ousted Peron that killed tens of thousands of people.)I recommend all of the above mentioned books in addition to THE REAL ODESSA for understanding the often perplexing and contradictory movement known as Peronism."},{"Title":"The Real Odessa - How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina","review":"I cannot remember what led me to this book but thankfully I did get to read it. And having read it am still suffering the effects. I consider this to be the sign of a great book.While the details are many, Mr. Goni manages to relate them in a cogent and cohesive fashion - no small feat considering the depth of his research.Less a blame game than an outright castigation of idealogues, this book is an absolute must in understanding WW2 and its aftermath.I followed the book with a viewing of \\"Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie\\" which touches on many of the same subjects covered in the book.Greater horror stories have never been written by man."},{"Title":"The Real Odessa - How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina","review":"A solidly researched, well-written piece of work on the Argentine side of the ratlines smuggling Nazi war criminals out of Europe after WWII. After reading Uki Goni's book, you'll never look quite the same way at the Vatican, the Red Cross, the Perons, or British and U.S. intelligence for that matter.Goni, an Argentine journalist and son of a diplomat, was able to write this book despite government displeasure at his work, probably because he was too high profile to \\"disappear.\\"This review is kind of a twofer. I bought The Real Odessa after reading Phillip Kerr's A Quiet Flame. The Real Odessa was his source material. Like all great writers, Kerr bases his Bernie Guenther novels -- fiction -- on well-researched facts and intelligent speculation."},{"Title":"The Real Odessa - How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina","review":"The most damning information that Goni found was that the Vatican had no qualms about helping \\"good, honest, catholics\\" from escaping their fates in Europe for what the did during WW2. Hundreds (maybe thousands) of SS and those who ran the 'concentration camp' system were smuggled out through Italy and Spain with the connivance of the Church and the IRC (International Red Cross). Everyone turned a blind eye to those men (like Mengele and Eichman) who used phony names on passport applications that were signed by 'fellow travelers'.In many cases Argentina would allow five or six jews to immigrate on a ship that carried SS Officers and their families so as to look magnanimous. What's worse is that Pope Pius XII, who never made public statements about the plight of the Jews before and during the war, was complicit in giving protection and succor to the perpetrators of the 'worst genocide' ever committed. In fact, none of those who were later condemned at Nuremburg or escaped, were ever ex-communicated.Monsignor Montini (who was later to be elevated as Paul VI) acted as co- Secretary of State for Pius during this time and met regularly with the groups in the Vatican who were working to help SS and others to emigrate to Argentina. Unfortunately, the Vatican still refuses to open up the Archives from Pope Pius XII and allow scholars to review documentation of correspondence between the Holy See and Buenos Aires during this time.Though many of the Argentine archives relating to those who were smuggled out of Europe were destroyed in 1996, enough is left over in other places that show who help develop the 'ratlines' that allowed these murderers to escape prosecution for their deeds. Sadly in many cases both the governments of the US and UK assisted in helping these people hide in the hope of fomenting unrest back behind the 'Iron Curtain' or using their scientific knowledge.Zeb Kantrowitz"},{"Title":"The Real Odessa - How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina","review":"It is getting dark in the Alps. A night trip begins. The journey starts from the local Church in the town of Vinaders close to Insbruck in Austria. The path is exhausting and steep going through the Alps. First you reach the Italian border, and then descend to Brennerbad and reach the local Church there. This might sound like the kind of adventurous hike organized by a local tourist agency today. In 1945 as the Second World War came to an end, this night hike was undertaken many times by travelers who where in fact Nazi war criminals. They were guided by members of a secret agency soon to be known as the ODESSA. Their aim was to escape from justice and head for freedom in Latin America. Hardcore Nazis, Ustashi, Belgian Raxists and Slovaks were among the many fugitives who, as Uki Goni reveals in his book \\"The Real ODESSA\\", escaped from war-torn Europe for a new life and a new identity in Argentina and, later on, countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay.Since the end of the war, the subject of how Nazi war criminals were smuggled into South America has been speculated over by journalists, historians and even fictional writers, notably Frederick Forsyth in his novel \\"The ODESSA File\\". \\"The Real ODESSA\\" is one of the first books to describe in detail the inner workings of this secret organization, the existence of which has been denied for many years. The night trip mentioned above is one such detail revealed by the Argentine-born author who describes other similar escape routes or \\"ratlines.\\"Perhaps the most revealing aspects of Goni's book are to do with the collaboration of the Argentinian government, led by President Juan Peron, and the fleeing Nazis, who found a safe haven in Argentina and some of the surrounding countries. Goni did an incredible amount of research in the Argentinian national archives, particularly immigration records. He manages to identify about three hundred war criminals who were provided with a safe haven in Argentina, among them Erik Priebke, Gerhard Bohne, Jozef Schwammberger as well as the creams of the crop, Jozef Mengele and Adolf Eichman.After doing six years of research and conducting hundreds of interviews, Goni expertly highlights the complicity of Juan Peron's government, as well as the involvement of Vatican priests, in allowing these mass murderers to escape justice. The ease with which the war criminals were able to emigrate to Argentina contrasts with the difficulties faced by Jews who, when trying to escape persecution in Nazi Germany, were denied entry to Argentina. Goni devotes an entire chapter, titled \\"War Games\\", which describes how Juan Peron and Hitler deliberately made it impossible for Jews to find a safe haven in Argentina by branding them as undesirable.The revelations in Goni's excellent book are explosive and embarrassing, even damaging. In 1996, when officials within the Argentine government became aware of Goni's research, they panicked and tried to burn all the documents in the archives. However, fortunately for historians, researchers and the public, Goni had already discovered much of the truth about Peron's close association with the Nazis and the involvement of anti-communist Vatican officials like Bishop Hudal. Goni reveals that it was Peron's intention, with Hudal's support, to get as many Nazis into Argentina, believing them to be \\"freedom fighters\\" against communism.Compared to the number of war criminals who successfully escaped justice, very few were brought to trial and punished. This book, whilst a work of non-fiction by a journalist, sometimes reads like a novel, proving the old adage that truth is sometimes stranger than fiction. Goni has revealed an incredible amount of detail in his book though there remains much more in the archives. However, whilst it is not always possible to highlight everything it is important, according to Goni in an interview with the History Channel, that \\"we need to get as close to the truth as possible\\"."},{"Title":"The Real Odessa - How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina","review":"This is a very good account of the fleeing to Argentina but readers should keep in mind that this was only one country who offered a safe haven to war criminals. The Real Odessa chronicles how Per&oacute;n's government brought Nazi war criminals to Argentina yet ignores the other countries who did the very same thing for a wide variety of reasons. The five primary hiding places were Syria, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and... ta-da! --the United States. I would like to see a more complete history of the help given to Nazis. Some countries did it for pay, the United States for intelligence information. In either case, murderers were knowingly set free among citizens of five nations."},{"Title":"The Real Odessa - How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina","review":"In 1920 decade,Argentina had a currency even more strong, as british pound.In fact, in 1938 Argentina had a better standard of living than Japan or Italy.Since Peron's times in 1950 decade, Argentina is just a third world country.This book is about the link between Peron and the smuggling of nazists (and fascists) to Argentina.Good work, but I must remeber some failures:1-I found this book weak, about the corrupt Juan Peron's wife, Evita Peron.She was even worse than described in this book.2-About the nazi scientists that went to Argentina, this book is weak.They made too little results for too much spending.3-The Argentina's calamity began in 1930, after a military coup.Its last chapter isn't over until today.Peron is the worsest argentine in all times.Peron wasn't a nazist(and this book shows this fact);but Peron was a corrupt and incompetent leader.More than anyone else, Peron sent Argentina to a third world level of living."},{"Title":"The Real Odessa - How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina","review":"Superb, detailed, readable chroncicle of the Nazi-Argentina escape process, with chilling details and look-'em-in-the-eye realism.Includes lots of \\"behind the robes\\" scoop on the Catholic Church's involvement too.Literally a must-read for anyone with an interest, scholarly or casual, in WW II's aftermath"},{"Title":"The Green Gods","review":"I read this book in the late 70's and it is still vivid in my mind.

Communism has to be one of the ugliest form of governments devised by man and Alexander clearly shows it.

I felt the hand of God in every trial Noble endured.And as God promised in the end he delivered Alexander from the hand of Castro. His story read like a modern day gospel. I loved how he brought most of the Christians together even though they were from different denominations. This is how the true church of God should be, we loving each other, instead of being separated by theology or other ridiculous differences.Noble died later during his freed life.

To my surprise, a friend who reads Swedish undestands the language of the book better than I do. Swedish is apparently closer to old Norwegian than is Bokmaal. What's needed for success: a very good Nynorsk-English or Nynorsk-Bokmaal dictionary. However, the reproductions of paintings by Jarle Rosseland would make the book worthwhile even if you can't read it! The feeling of the saga era is strongly captured and protrayed in those pictures.

Written by two people who are master practitioners of our grandparents' ways of living as well as master gardeners, this book is a gem!It is at once a book on gardening (flowers, herbs, fruits & vegetables) and independent living, a book of recipes and remedies, and an arresting narrative of thirty years of work creating a self-sufficient life (and all manner of wonderful gardens) on the bare bones of an old, abandoned farm on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. It is also a book of considerable visual beauty, being generously illustrated in vibrant watercolors by Champlain Valley artist Elayne Sears.I found Gardens of Use and Delight not only meaningful and enjoyable reading, but also a very useful reference for many aspects of flower, herb, fruit and vegetable gardening, and for all manner of things \\"homemade.\\" The recipes in the chapters, \\"The Kitchen Garden,\\" \\"The Contained Garden,\\" and \\"An Old-Fashioned Fruit Garden\\" are mouth-watering gems often rescued from the cookbooks of yesteryear (the Herb Salt and Apple Ginger recipes to name two favorites!)

This book is one couple's experience trying to live on a remote farm on Cape Breton Island. It has some good information, but is less about homesteading than about growing flowers.The most detailed information was on the different flowers they grew - lots about the many species and cultivars they tried. There is a section with some recipes. There is a bit about how and why they came to homestead. There is some writing about landscape design philosophy. But the thing that holds the book together is flowers.The title invokes both the practical and the aesthetic, but compared to other homesteading books, this one is really about the delight of growing flowers in a challenging maritime climate."},{"Title":"Gardens of Use & Delight: Uniting the Practical and Beautiful in an Integrated Landscape","review":"Jigs Gardner and his wife Jo Ann went off to farm and teach troubled boys in northern Vermont. Next they moved with their four small children to an abandoned farm on Cape Breton Island and lived there for thirty years. With no motor vehicle, they plowed and moved the hay wagon with draft horses. On the thin, poor soil they raised livestock for meat, they grew vegetables and herbs, and everywhere they grew flowers. Their life on Cape Breton is the thread running through this splendid book; but, subtitled, Uniting the Practical and Beautiful in an Integrated Landscape, it is mostly a thoughtful guide to productive farming while living in harmony with one's natural surroundings.Simply reading the table of contents is a treat:Part One: The Whole, Chapter One - The Farm Today, Chapter Two - The Evolving LandscapePart Two: The GardensPart Three: The Integrated Landscape - Practice & PhilosophyThe Gardners are intelligent, well educated, write superbly and, for thirty years supported their family with no institutions to mediate between them and the wolf at the door - remarkable bona fides. For decades they have contributed to small farming journals and literary magazines around the United States. Jo Ann began growing herbs and selling them at Nova Scotia fairs. As her expertise grew, she published Living with Herbs and other well-written and useful books still in print.And Gardens..., besides a pleasure to read, is filled with useful information for and guides about growing.

Although Platt adheres to scholarly procedures, the spirit of his book differs from conventional scholarship. He begins not with a thesis but with a question: Why did Shakespeare write about Rome and the Romans? He begins not in certitude but in wonder, calling his book an \\"inquiry\\".The inquiry leads him to all of Shakespeare's Roman plays, each of which offers us ways of deepening our understanding not only of \`Romanness' but of the character of political life itself. He understands that life in terms of the regimes of Rome--republican and monarchic--but also in terms of the Romans--particularly the Roman statesmen. The arc of Roman regimes begins with the rape of Lucrece and ends, so to speak, with Titus' meatball pie--from tyranny to tyranny. In between we see the flawed nobility of the republic and the grand despotism of Caesarism. We also see the Romans themselves, some of them noble and many of them somehow escaping mere Romanness; \\"something in them lives outside any regime,\\" Platt writes.This means that Shakespeare transcends partisanship; he is never simply a republican or a monarchist. His choice of the genre of drama indicates this from the beginning; he wants to get republicans and monarchists into conversation with one another. Even if they do not understand one another, Shakespeare helps us to understand them.Platt notices that Shakespeare's Rome has no greenness. The only natural thing there is fire (and, of course, men and women who are firy, honor-loving Romans). Greenness comes in only when Rome gets as far as England--that is, in Cymbeline. When Rome goes east, to Egypt, it is going in the wrong direction. But that is what its firy men do when they fall in love. Either that, or they deify themselves, like Julius Caesar, who takes care not to fall in love. But lest we call Shakespeare himself a mere patriot, Platt remarks, in Shakespeare \\"all roads lead to The Tempest,\\" not to Rome or the green and pleasant land of his birth. Prospero, poet-philosopher and king, was \\"well on his way to founding a new Rome\\" by uniting northern and southern Italy. But Shakespeare reminds us that this finally can occur only in speech, not in practice, even when the speeches are magical.Platt's book first appeared more than 25 years ago and has itself undergone a rich metamorphosis or two in follow-on editions. It seems to me the most Shakespearean of the books on Shakespeare's Rome and Romans."},{"Title":"Hysteria in Remission","review":"Robert Williams' comix are amazing. Very violent & vulgar, but amazingly executed. I prefer his black & white comic work over his oil paintings any day. Unforntunately his comic output is pretty small. Nonetheless the several comics presented here are amazing. Extremely detailed and bizarre and they ooze with a feeling of being high.My personal favorite tale is \\"Mentor in the Mentor Jar\\". Insane ideas such as 'Gorilla Women of the Third Reich', Atrillo Trilobite and the fate of 'Mr. Baldpubis' puts Robt. Williams in a class all of his own.Years ago I went and bought all the individual ZAP comics when i learned Mr. Williams did comic work. These issues are great for you can see the work of the other underground greats, but Hysteria in Remission presents Williams' work in a lovely LARGE format (even at the size, the detail boogles my grey matter) and on beautiful glossy paper rather than fading pulpy newsprint grade paper.Get this book for the insane-ness, the fantastic execution in india ink and completeness of Williams' comic work (early days all the way up to model sheets for an animated series, Jack Clum, Dream interpreter done in 2001.a great piece of work from Fantagraphics - THANK YOU.Now i need to save up some cash to purchase MALICIOUS RESPLENDENCE...."},{"Title":"Hysteria in Remission","review":"This book has everything.

It is astounding how provocative and powerful this work is, and that so much of it has been allowed to slip out of print over the last 25 years despite Williams's extraordinary success in the fine art world. His comics bulge (as Jim Woodring says, \\"often literally\\") with greater imagination than even his paintings, what is amazing is how few people are doing comics like this anymore. There may have never been a better pure draughtsman in comics, his work rivals Crumb and even classic strip artists like Hal Foster or illustrators like Howard Pyle, but what truly sets Williams apart is the sheer visceral force of his imagery.

It is very interesting to see these after becoming familiar with his oil paintings. The quality of the various items within varies widely, from very crude, to masterly.Some of his comics are extremely smuttty and raw, much more than most of his paintings even.

They treated her abusively in the rough mountain way as she pleaded to be released.

The district judge is described as a crusty old Southerner who 'ran a tight court' who felt that the younger man should have been found guilty as well because the murder had occurred during the course of the original felony. But the jury of rural Montana didn't see it that way. Dan got the maximum sentence to be served at the hardrock prison at Deerlodge.A new trial ended with Don Nichols receiving guilty on both counts, murder and kidnapping and also got the maximum sentence under law. He must serve 42 years before any chance of parole. For a man his age, that is equivalent to the death sentence.Life goes on at the Mountain Range with hot dry summers and fiercely cold winters.

Wilson lived the experiences in this book. It tells of a pivotal operation during World War II that abruptly ended German-Nazi domination of the European continent. Historically, Operation Varsity was overshadowed by Patton's push across Germany. Wilson and his co-author son give full credit to those courageous ground troops commanded by Patton and Montgomery, but the focus of this book is on the lesser known paratroop action.In December 1942, Robert L. Wilson joined the Army. At that time, Parachute troops were a fledgling group. When approached to join this elite group. Wilson agreed. The training was rigorous, but young Wilson fully ascribed to the Parachutist's creed, which said in part:\\"I realize that a parachutist is not merely a soldier who arrives by parachute to fight, but is an elite shocktrooper and that his country expects him to march farther and faster, to fight harder, to be more self-reliant, and to soldier better than any other soldier.\\"In March 1945, the 464th Parachute Field Artillery Battallion joined several other Paratroop divisions in an unprecedented airborne drop into Germany. No enemy force since Napoleon had effectively crossed the Rhine River but Operation Varsity changed that. The paratroopers had been told to expect a 50% casualty rate because the Germans knew they were coming. That day, 17,122 paratroopers landed en masse to do battle with the Germans for control of their territory.Paratroopers and planes faced heavy artillery flak, anti aircraft cannons, and small arms fire. On the ground, under grueling artillery fire, the 464th swiftly assembled Howitzers airdropped with them. They were the first airborne artillery unit to fire a Howitzer east of the Rhine, and surely earned their place in history that day. Meter by meter the Paratroopers and their Howitzers blasted a path through the Germans dug in along the battle's perimeter. Man to man and hand to hand, for one full day then two, paratroopers who survived hacked their way through the German lines. The paratroopers had been advised to take no prisoners, but hesitated to kill first hundreds, then thousands of surrendering German troops. Instead, they utilized German prisoners to pull cannons and dig foxholes. This continued until all fighting ceased and thousands of Nazi soldiers lay face down at their feet in a posture of surrender.Robert L. Wilson's first hand report of his training stateside and in France, culminating with the Rhineland battle, is a fascinating story. This is a precious history of unsung American heroes from an aging generation of warriors. What truly magnificent men these were! I highly recommend A Paratrooper's Panoramic View to mature readers of all ages."},{"Title":"A Paratrooper's Panoramic View: Training with the 464th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion for Operation Varsity's 'Rhine Jump' with the 17th Airborne Division","review":"I wanted to read this book to learn more about Operation Varsity (larger than D-day and in the daylight)in part because my father jumped with the 507 PIR, and there are not many books out about Varsity or the 17 th Airborne, at least not compared to D-Day. I found the book to be excellent regarding background and organizational information, to the point that I may send it to my Dad. It is particularly informative as it pulls information on Paratroopers from many sources, some of which I had already read, an excellent job in that regard. The reservation on this book is that there is relatively little information on what happens past two days after the jump."},{"Title":"A Paratrooper's Panoramic View: Training with the 464th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion for Operation Varsity's 'Rhine Jump' with the 17th Airborne Division","review":"\`A Paratrooper's Panoramic View' by Robert L. Wilson and Philip K. WilsonSubtitled: Training with the 464th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion for Operation Varsity's Rhine Jump with the 17th Airborne Division. P/back 229 pages.This is a fairly unique, if slight, account from a veteran of an under-recorded unit in an often glossed over battle. Robert is a veteran of the jump with an artillery battalion of the 13th Airborne Div, which is attached to the 17th division for this operation. Philip is his son.There is a lot about the training of an airborne trooper. The author, a young and fit farm boy quite enjoyed this. Fleshing out his recollections are also reproductions of lots of posters, cartoons and pages from manuals about the training process. So in terms of primary source material, this book is quite useful. There are also many quotes from other memoirs and histories - all these being well referenced. But too much is expressed in terms of \`we' and \`us' as opposed to \`I' and \`me', so it read more like a general history at times than a personal account. I was also thrown when the author revealed he became the company cook but he also trained as part of a gun crew and he performed this role for several days in battle.Prior to \`Varsity' there is a reasonable amount of detail and thinking about this first combat jump, though the actual fighting phase is quite brief. Upon landing Wilson assists with finding, assembling and firing his piece. He is under fire on the ground (and in the air beforehand) but this is not delivered in a gripping or minutely detailed way. He sees casualties and dead and captured Germans but the author is a reticent/reserved man so this phase is lacking much in the way of excitement.The author is clearly the real deal in terms of being a combat soldier (and was being shipped to the Pacific for more - back with the 13th Division I think) so full credit to him but this book is an uninspiring read. He just didn't see enough combat. And while there are spots of interest, there is not much in the training phase that stands out either. This book does fill a void in that it deals with a unit and a battle that is not often mentioned. However, it offers very little to change this state of affairs. Not recommended for anyone who is not an airborne obsessive."},{"Title":"A Paratrooper's Panoramic View: Training with the 464th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion for Operation Varsity's 'Rhine Jump' with the 17th Airborne Division","review":"Very interesting book. we know the author and have heard his of his experiences during the war.

And certainly it offers a student of quilt history and/or women's history a rare model and an extraordinarily complex and detailed picture of the life of one woman and her quilts in one time and place.The book is completely belied by the determinedly and obviously biased views of two reviewers who posted to Amazon.com reviews. I cannot help wondering if they read the same book I read. Their criticism is of the South, not of the book. And it is a criticism of a stereotypical South, at that, not a region far too complex to comprehend in one sweep of bias. And certainly not the world captured in its minutae in this book.LEGACY: THE STORY OF TALULA GILBERT BOTTOM AND HER QUILTS is not an apologia for the Confederacy or a condemnation of the Union in the Civil War, though a portion of it describes---one feels accurately and certainly matter-of-factly---the experience of a southern family caught up in the terrible combat of that war. To read it as two critics read it requires a bias so strong it precludes access to the real meaning of this remarkable story that moves from the ante-bellum South through two world wars with equal passion and loss.The title is \\"Legacy: The Story of Talula Gilbert Bottoms and her Quilts,\\" and its writer discovers in the many quilts created in good times and bad the meaning of her legacy from her grandmother. That legacy is most essentially a determined courage to accept life as it comes, without complaint or self-pity, but with a spirit of optimism and endurance that is nurtured by the creation of beauty.The admiration heard in the authorial voice is, therefore, appropriate. And it is not sentimental. With the author, we discover her grandmother. And along with her, through her grandmother's quilts and the little autobiography Talula left, we come to admire this tough little woman who persevered through rheumatism and overwork, wars and contagions, poverty and modest economic security, and all the while continued to turn out meticulously wrought quilts individualized by her devotion to her craft and to her family, for whom she created these quilts.Burdick lets Talula and her quilts speak, and there is not a drop of self-pity in either.For anyone wanting to know what life was like for an ordinary white family in the Deep South from the mid-19th century through, say, WW II, \\"Legacy\\" offers an exceptional gift. There they are--the daily routines, the backbreaking farm and house work, the religious devotion and struggles, the children who die from diseases that left cemeteries full of tiny tombstones. But there also are the joys and devotions of family, the love of place, the achievement in the face of obstacles, and always--always--the quilts that defined one woman's values and meanings of life.In little things--for instance, in the problems created when the young bride Talula spilled into the well some of the milk she was keeping cold there--we come to understand her world and her achievement.In her study, Burdick has relied on techniques common to an approach more recently designated by material historian James Deetz as \\"material behaviors.\\" Deetz expands the means of the material historian beyond the description and identification of artifacts. He suggests the inclusion of cognitive, psychological, spiritual behaviors to discover the fuller meaning of the material objects.That is exactly what Burdick does with her grandmother's quilts. She places them in their natural context in order to make sense of them, to discover what they reveal about their art, their craft, about their maker.And she does it so well, we forget for the reading that we too are not kinsmen of Talula Gilbert Bottoms.The quiltmaking of the backcountry South is insufficiently documented and understood. This book goes a long way to remediating those problems.The existing journals of Southern women in the nineteenth century are most often those of women of considerable means, for they were the ones who could afford education. This book provides balance to those, for it describes and analyzes the life of a woman who had struggled to make herself literate, but whose means and circumstances precluded her achieving the exceptional feats she and her husband made accessible to their children, who achieved acclaim in science. The reader will find no moonlight-and-magnolias version of southern life in LEGACY.But he will find truth.It should be noted that the writer's style is lively and vigorous (She is an English professor in New York state), the photographs of the quilts and of the Bottomses well done and complementary to the text, and the book generally set in an attractive format.I came away from this book with a far better understanding of life for the ordinary family in the hinterland South and of the role quilts played in the lives of such families and of the women who made them. I also acquired a better appreciation for the quilts themselves and a more informed view of the quilts produced in the Southern backcountry. It is, for instance, generally presumed that poverty accounts for most choices of hinterland quilts. Yet Talula Bottoms experienced grave poverty, teetered on the edge of bankruptcy for a long time, but all the while found the means to create well-planned and executed quilts.What a pleasure Ms. Burdick gives in her thoughtful, important book on her grandmother and her grandmother's quilts. I heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys biography, women's or quilt history, cultural history, or who loves quilts. And it is salutary to anyone who needs to see courage in the flesh. A very good read!"},{"Title":"LEGACY: The Story of Talula Gilbert Bottoms and Her Quilts","review":"I took this family history for what it was , , , one account of both the trials and joys in the life of a one woman and her family. That these happened to begin in the south post Civil War era was part of that story. And, the historical view points where that of the south during that time. For those who are disturbed by these and would like a pure factual account of this period in our country's history, I suggest that you watch the PBS series,\\"The Civil War\\" produced by Ken Burns. This book is not the place to look for those facts. This is a book of \\"Remembrances\\". I loved this book. Talula's outlook on life was uniquely her own. Not all women during that period of history could have adjusted to her circumstances. In fact, her older sister had a much more difficult time. The south was totally economically destroyed. And many times it fell on the shoulders of the women to carry on after their husbands left them alone with children to feed and care for.Take note of Talula's personal philosophy: \\"Whatever happens, I will not worry. If a thing can be helped, I will help it: if not, I will make the best of it.\\" She makes mention of her \\"fingers itching to get to her quilting.\\" Her love of her family, of God and of making her quilts sustained her through the most horrible circumstances one could imagine. That she managed to make by hand between 200 - 300 quilts during her lifetime while looking after her family through sickness and death, sorrow and personal loss while maintaining a lifeline in her letters to family members was beyond my comprehension. If only for the pictures of Talula's quilts, I would recommend this book - the story is the icing on the cake! And I would certainly describe it as a love story . . . love between a husband and wife, a woman and her family, and of the quilts she lovingly made for them."},{"Title":"LEGACY: The Story of Talula Gilbert Bottoms and Her Quilts","review":"A great combination of quilts and the lives of the quilters that made them.

I felt maybe ten times, though, while reading it, that there were imposed tones of near-racism from the author. Hers is the classic tone of those from the South who don't want to admit - ever - that there were wrongs committed. The simple, wonderful ancestors of the author taught lessons in their own story, which she told very well, but her attempt to restate all the lessons as defenses of the South in general seemed out of place in the simple environment of her grandmother. Without these few interjections, and an unnecessary afterword to that effect, this is a marvelous book."},{"Title":"LEGACY: The Story of Talula Gilbert Bottoms and Her Quilts","review":"Although I purchased this book to read about the quilts that were made by Talula Gilbert Bottoms, the overtly magnanimous overtures about Mrs. Burdick's grandparents basically overpowered the story. There are beautiful pictures of the quilts so lovingly made by Mrs. Talula Bottoms, but the saga about her life was just too sanctimoniously written, in my humble opinion, especially those of the trials of Mrs. Bottoms' young life. The excerpts taken from the memoirs of Talula G. Bottoms was, in fact, more interesting to me, and I wish that the author - the granddaughter of Mrs. Bottoms - had utilized more of the original papers instead of the overall, overtly gushing writing style that I found indicative of Mrs. Burdick."},{"Title":"Pragmatism and the Political Economy of Cultural Revolution, 1850-1940 (Cultural Studies of the United States)","review":"One of the largest contributions of this book is its effort to combine economic history with cultural analysis. Livingston takes the time to distinguish important structural changes in the US economy during this period (1850-1940). More cultural historians and critics should grapple with this material--Livingston can wean us off of blanket labels (\\"incorporation,\\" \\"Gilded Age\\") that leave no room for thinking through the more dynamic relations of the economic and the cultural.A second virtue of this book is Livingston's provocative, polemic argument. Although his political sympathies are with the left, he offers a strong critique of the tendency among left historians to see the emergence of corporate capitalism as the effective end to any chance for victory on the left. This \\"tragic\\" mode of analysis, Livingston argues, means we can only remain mired in a nostalgic orientation toward the past. Livingston turns to two cultural formations--literary naturalism (especially the fiction of Theodore Dreiser) and pragmatism (especially William James)--to argue for a \\"social self\\" that offers hope for political progress but is not inherently at odds with corporate capitalism. I'm still not sure if I buy Livingston's argument, but his frame of analysis and reflections on history and models of selfhood are tremendously fruitful.Although the book is largely an advanced academic study, it is clearly written and free of jargon. Well read students of American history and culture will be able to follow the analysis."},{"Title":"Pragmatism and the Political Economy of Cultural Revolution, 1850-1940 (Cultural Studies of the United States)","review":"This is a work of conceptual brilliance, in its argument about why pragmatism occurred when it did, its cultural ramifications and its current importance.

I don't know about the newer edition, their 11th as I write this review on August 2010, but in the 9th edition, you're stuck with no companion website, which contained valuable information.I had the fortune to download all I could that was available when the site was up, so i have the material, to an extent. Now Prentice Hall is sided with Pearson and other higher education providers, as they are calling them, to SELL you what was once offered for free. Bottom line, you can't find the free companion website anywhere anymore.Don't get me wrong, the book offers a much more straightforward approach than Waner and Costenoble's Applied Calculus and other titles; their sites are up to my knowledge as far back as the 2nd edition when they're well into their fifth edition, as I write on August, 2010; but give me a break with the money making leeches at Prentice Hall and their said partners. I know education is expensive, but this outright sucks ass.

It makes me want to optimize a beat down to these sophists.Just beware of this practice from Prentice Hall, and if you are buying secondhand, ASK the seller whether or not the companion website is still up and running or check it out for yourself with the publisher, again, Prentice Hall.It'd cost NOTHING for PH to leave the companion website up, but they had to get greedy, greedy, greedy!

I read it all in two sittings, which is not a regular occurrence for me. It's about a young man living in Germany, who struggles with authority and feels that everyone wants to dominate him - his father, the police, even a publican who had him arrested. On leaving School he attends the University of Halle, where he is a divinity student - (his fathers wish), he has no great interest in God. A chance reunion with an old acquaintance eventually leads to his acceptance of Jesus at a prayer meeting.From here he has notions of mission work, meets with a missionary to the Jews, decides thats what he should be doing, learns Hebrew, prays very fervently, tells his dad, dad says it's dumb and cuts his finance, George says \\"go ahead and cut it, I'm not taking any money from you again\\". From here the story develops of George's total dependence on God and no one else. He needs money to get through his studies, and when he prays God miraculously provides for him.He travels to London where he is starts a probationary period with a society that reaches Jews for Jesus. However George is frustrated by the emphasis on study, when people could be getting saved, so he leaves. From there he takes up a position as minister in a small church in Teignmouth, gets married to Mary, and the idea of financial reliance on God develops. The church paid George's salary by renting the best seats in the church to those with cash. George wanted God to finance him, and his conviction was that he would ask no-one else but God for money, the point being to prove that God answers prayer. God did support him, as he prayed.He moves on to Bristol where he starts a chapel with good friend Henry Craik, and they minister to the slums, and endure disease outbreak, which actually takes George's son. On seeing a child caged into a children's home, he decides to start a school for the poor children. Lack of money is always the perceived issue by George's associates, but George proves that by praying and being patient God brings the money. He opens his school. But many students were so poor, they were shipped off to the home, where there are unable to leave to goto school. George believed God wanted him to start an orphanage for these children. He prayed very specifically, with an exact sum of money in mind, and for people to help with the work, and for clothes for the children, and so on. Then he read in the bible in the book of Psalms, and a verse struck him, that confirmed what he was doing was right. It was God's promise to him, and he remembered it when he prayed. God provided people to do the job, and brought finance from nowhere to his doorstep. He opened the orphanage, packed it out, prayed for more, and opened another 3 orphanages over a period of time. There was never an abundance of cash, but day by day, God provided, as George prayed. Eventually, George bought land, and built a huge orphanage out of town, then four more over the years until he provided for over two thousand orphans. As he asked God for more, God gave more, donations went from shillings to pounds, to hundreds of pounds to thousands of pounds at a time - and George only asked God for it.This is a great book about the reality of God and his ability to work, and do more and more than we can imagine"},{"Title":"George Mueller","review":"If you want to learn about a man that truly lived for Jesus.

He lives day to day, and sometimes hour to hour, praying for food and clothing for the children. Throughout the book, George wants people to believe that God answers prayers. That is why he will not ask for anything from anyone, because he relies on God to provide.In this scene from the book, George had just purchased the house that was to be used as the orphanage.

I still love it though!!!"},{"Title":"The Myth of the State","review":"This insightful book marks the end of Ernst Cassirer's career and suggests that his impact upon the social sciences will continue to grow. Perhaps this book's central feature is it's application of Cassirer's philosophy of symbolic forms to 20th century political thought. Beginning with a lean and incisive analysis of myth and culminating with an inspection of modern authoritarianism, Cassirer succeeds in marrying an understanding of culture with an analysis of political phenomena. Readers familiar with the Western tradition of political philosophy will find their background knowledge put to good use here, as the majority of the text centers around considering various mythic conceptions prevalent in Western political theory up to Hitler's Third Reich. Cassirer's approach, consistent with his other works, is to stress synthetic conclusions with comprehensive analysis.The text can be divided into roughly three major section, each of which draws from Cassirer's previous work. The first major section is Cassirer's short exposition of his philosophy of symbolic forms. The reader is provided with several chapters identifying key elements of myth, including language, emotions, and social life. From this domain, Cassirer draws a general theory of culture, and a theory of myth in particular. His orientation to studying culture is largely operative, as he considers how myth functions emotively, cognitively, and socially.In the next section, Cassirer approaches the question of the Western state's origins, particularly in relation to the Greek, medieval, and Renaissance traditions. All through reviewing major political theories (e.g. Machiavelli, Hegel, etc.), Cassirer applies his functional analysis of myth, noting how Western thought developed out of myth, but does not entirely escape its influence. The final section finds Cassirer considering the genesis of modern totalitarianism, once again by working through influential thinkers. Among these include Hegel's formulation of the State, Thomas Carlyle's hero worship, and Joseph A. C. de Gobineau's theory of racism.The last chapter, entitled \\"The Technique of Modern Political Myths\\" will be the most fascinating for reader's familiar with Cassirer's other major works. Here we find Cassirer in high form: An advocate of Kant's Aufklarung in an uncertain world shaped by powerful, misunderstood forces of culture. Sadly, Cassirer passed away suddenly before this section could be completed. Still, the final note is resounding. Writing in an unusually strong tone about how to address the advocates and agents of political myths, Cassirer concludes: \\"We should see the adversary face to face in order to know how to combat him.\\" In this task, Cassirer advocates that philosophy is our chief tool in understanding myth and that this task is necessary to advance self-understanding beyond even contemporary bounds."},{"Title":"The Myth of the State","review":"While Ernst Cassirer provides an illuminating analysis of the nature of myth in The Myth of the State, he never tells his reader what the western myth of the state is. Extrapolating from his analysis of Plato, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, Carlyle, the racist Gobineau, Hegel, et al, what emerges is the unfolding of a theory of the state, not a mythos of it. The passionate and emotive elements of myth, which Cassirer brilliantly explicates about myth in general, are never made explicit in his analysis of the theory (\\"myth\\") of the state (except at the end when he discusses Nazism). If anything, these elements are subsumed in the content of his analysis.Nevertheless, Cassirer masterfully explains much of the development of the western theory of the state through time. He hits on many of the salient thinkers and philosophical movements. Yet, inexplicably, some important thinkers seem to get short shrift comparatively speaking (e.g. Aristotle) and others scarcely manage more than a brief mention (e.g. Marx). Readers might find (what turned out to be) Cassirer's parting shot at Heidegger and the proto-fascist elements of his philosophy fascinating (Cassirer died in 1945 and The Myth of the State was published posthumously). Perhaps most intriguing is how Cassirer reserves most of his ire for Hegel, arguably making his philosophy most responsible for the intellectual underpinnings of the rise of National Socialism in Germany--an analysis not entirely unpredictable for a neo-Kantian like Cassirer to make given how, in the historical estimation of many, Hegel eclipsed Kant as Germany's preeminent philosopher.Notwithstanding these limitations, The Myth of the State is worth reading. Cassirer's analysis of the development of the western theory of the state is evidently too sagacious to be missed."},{"Title":"The Myth of the State","review":"Can a book be both lucidly written, highly erudite and yet completely meaningless?It seems that it can.\\"The Myth of the State\\" by Neo-Kantian philosopher Ernst Cassirer is such a book. The positive reviewers were obviously taken in by Cassirer's unusually lucid style of writing, and by his erudition, which is considerable.And yet, the book never really delivers. It's supposed to be an analysis of the historic and philosophical roots of modern totalitarianism. Instead, it feels like a series of disjointed essays about pretty much everything. Subjects covered include the meaning and function of myth, the exact relationship between Carlyle and Goethe, whether or not Machiavelli really was Old Nicky, the Romantic criticism of the Enlightenment, the racism of Gobineau, and countless other subjects besides. However, Cassirer never manages to weave the strands together. Interestingly, he never mentions Marx, Lenin or Nietzsche, the usual whipping boys in books of this type.Apparently, the book is unfinished and was published posthumously. I don't deny that it may contain this or that interesting reflection, but overall it feels like a non-starter. I suspect it's mostly of interest to scholars of Neo-Kantianism. Curiously, Cassirer (or perhaps his publisher) also expected the American audience to understand Latin and German (!), since all Latin quotations and some German ones are untranslated.Unfortunately, I cannot give \\"The Myth of the State\\" more than two stars."},{"Title":"Pablo Periquito y sus amigos * Pablo Parakeet and His Friends (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is the cutest coloring book I've seen in a long time, and it's bilingual in Spanish and English.

Manga!: World of Japanese Comic Books","review":"Ever wonder about those crazy Japanese comics called manga? So different from American comics. Well, Schodt gives you a very readable historical perspective on them, drawing all the way back to pre-industrial Japan. But he shows that the true flowering of manga arose in post-War Japan. Manga is seen in Japan as a serious literary form. While some manga are indeed trash, others are considered on a par with novels.The book has colour plates and black and white pictures of many manga, with English commentary. Glimpses of quite a different culture.Schodt wrote his study in 1983, when manga was still relatively unknown in the US. Few such comics were available in translated form. Hence the book was very useful in breaking through a formidable langugage barrier. But things have changed. Now US bookstores stock many English versions of manga. In fact, manga in the US possesses a unique trait. It is the only major printed form in English that often has the pages numbered from back to front, as we would term it. This of course follows the Japanese page numbering convention. The English manga retains this, to add to the ambience.The only drawback about the book is that it aches for a second edition. The intervening years have seen an even greater flowering on new manga in Japan. Plus, he could also study the influence of it on the Japanese computer games."},{"Title":"Bulbs","review":"Considering myself to be only an average (although passionate) gardener, I purchased this book because I was looking for a good reference on the topic of bulbs. An amazingly exhaustive volume that was honored by the American Horticulture Society and named one of '75 Great American Garden Books', 'Bulbs' by John E. Bryan is almost overwhelming for the average gardener.The beginning chapters of 'Bulbs' cover the normal gardening topics such as a brief bulb history, nomenclature, propagation, cultivation, forcing, and pests & diseases. The main bulk of the book (and it's real use) is the alphabetical listing of bulbs by genus. Included in each genus listing are general historical and general remarks followed by advice on their culture, pests and diseases, propagation methods and an amazingly complete listing of the species. The 1,171 photographs in the book are compiled alphabetically in three sections of plates, meaning that to see the plant photo referenced in the text you have to flip to the plant photo plate section of the book. These photos are (IMHO) generally of good quality and include flower close-ups, the entire plant, historical flower drawings/plates as well as pictures of some of the bulbs in the wild of mixed quality.What makes this book seem overwhelming to the average gardener (i.e. me) is the sheer amount of information (in comparison to other gardening books). Following the listing of each species is a description of the plant, (possibly) individual cultural information and a list of known cultivars. In the case of very large or extensively hybridized genuses (i.e. tulipa) where there are many different 'families' of plants (i.e. Single early tulips, Darwin hydrid tulips, Lily-flowered tulips, etc), the families of plants are listed and described in detail with a few representative cultivars listed followed by the individual species. Because of this, 'Bulbs' can seem decidedly 'unfriendly' toward the average gardener (i.e. someone who just wants to look up the best red tulip cultivars). Furthermore, because 'Bulbs' lists all of the known species within the genus and not just the common 'garden worthy' varieties, I found it is very easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of entries. However, it is also this completeness that also makes this book an invaluable reference for the more advanced gardeners, collectors and scientists alike. (In the case of the extensively hybridized genuses (i.e. tulips and daffadils), a more specialized reference book would probably be more appropiate than this through bulb survey.)Overall, I believe that 'Bulbs' is an amazingly through book, but perhaps a little too through for the average gardener (I'm still keeping an eye open for a good garden bulb book - and I'm not a big fan of those smaller sized Taylor guides - any suggestions?). For the serious gardener, though, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Bulbs","review":"After reviewing many books on bulbs, this one has risen to the top. It is easily the most thorough and up-to-date reference covering the full range of geophytes.One of the features I like best in this book is the short, easy to read and well-diagrammed Botany and Classification of Bulbs chapter. It is a very well written introduction that includes explanations of the jargon and theories used by taxonomists and horticulturists. This is a great intro for early students of horticulture to grasp the bigger picture.The majority of the book is an A-Z, with accompanying line drawings as well as hundreds of color images. Each entry covers the family, culture, pests and disease, propagation, and all relevant species. The use of the new family classification is appreciated, with a handy reference to the previous family in parenthesis.Speaking of families, there is a great explanation of all the families of bulbous plants in Appendix A. Appendix B has all the bulbs around the world listed by country of habitat. The list of flowering time is not particularly useful though becuase it only breaks down into the 4 seasons. Early, mid, and late season classifications would be nice. There is a short list of plants for specific purposes - fragrance, cutting, etc. There is a very thorough bibliography and a common name index.This is a large and heavy book, but worth every penny. The descriptions are written in an easy to read style and it is the most thorough and complete book on bulbs I have seen."},{"Title":"Bulbs","review":"This is an excellent reference book, listing all types of bulbs, from the common garden variety to the more obscure varieties.

Chiropractic is not about back pain, it is concerned with the removal of interference to the nerve system, thereby allowing the body to function closer to its potential. Chiropractic has never been about &quot;LOW BACK PAIN&quot;---it is this type of misconception which has permeated our society and continues to be spurred on by texts such as this. Dr. Sportelli graduated from Palmer College of Chiropractic in the 1950's. He most certainly was not taught such nonsense at Palmer, for his pigeon-holed concept is not taught there, nor at any other good chiropractic college.

Those hoping for an explanation for the different designs and the concepts behind them should look for other books, though I doubt you'll find one thanks to F1's secrecy, but for those who would like to really view the cars in all their beauty there is nothing to match this book."},{"Title":"Formula 1 '99 Technical Analysis","review":"I've read this book and own the complete following series.It's a good reference for that year, but the sport has moved on FAR beyond this and it's lessons are very dated.If you're interested in current technology, buy an edition from later years/series. If your interested in the technology of the era, look up Peter Wright's \\"Formula 1 Technology\\" and compare prices. Wright's book is FAR superior, especially putting the technology in context and especially if the price is nearly the same.That's even speaking as a Ferrari supporter since the Niki Lauda era..."},{"Title":"Formula 1 '99 Technical Analysis","review":"Actually, with this price, it's the only known I review !I'm realizing scale model kits and this is the best book I found,but the previous year books are pretty dificult to find.I hope each year book, in french for me, but it's rather withoutimportance, because the drawings are so fine ...Unfortunately, there no same books in rallying or so."},{"Title":"Frommer's New York City 2005 (Frommer's Complete)","review":"Bought this book along with Fodor's 05 New York City Guide and New York Eyewitness Travel Guide for our trip to New York in August. Overall this was the least informative book. The biggest problem is that the book mainly focuses on where to eat and where to stay, not what to see. If you want a book that details sights better, I would pick Fodor's 05 New York City Guide. I carried the book with me almost every day in New York, while the Frommer's guide was left in the hotel room to press flowers from the botanical garden."},{"Title":"Frommer's New York City 2005 (Frommer's Complete)","review":"I bought this book while preparing for my trip to NY and liked the Suggested NYC Itineraries section as well as how the subway stations, websites, hours, etc are listed. However, once in NY, I realized that what I really needed was a good subway map and detailed map useful when walking around. The book includes a map but I found it to be quite useless since not all streets are listed. (The map looks detailed enough to navigate yourself but it doesn't have enough detail of areas such as SoHo or Greenwich.) Even if the subway information changes frequently, I wish it had included a basic subway map so that I could navigate the system easier."},{"Title":"Counseling with Choice Theory","review":"There is a certain fascination about reading case studies but these are special. The creator of Reality Therapy, William Glasser, opens his mind to the reader explaining the processes that guide his interventions with the clients. This gives a rare insight into the mind of a great therapist and theorist. The book contains 12 case studies some of which are documented over several sessions. They provide a range of typical counselling scenarios and Glasser explains how he applies Choice Theory through Reality Therapy. Several of the cases bring very modern issues into focus.The book also offers the reader many ideas for dealing with the range of problems represented in its pages. Moreover, it shows clearly just how important a solid guiding theory is in the practice of therapy.One comforting feature for the professional therapist is Glasser's admission of doubts and even mistakes in his process as he sometimes backtracks to change the focus of his counselling. There is a lot to be learned from his exploratory methods.I write as an Instructor in Reality Therapy with an obvious personal interest in having a resource such as this available to my own trainees. However I believe that the practice and theory presented in &lt;&lt;Reality Therapy in Action&gt;&gt; will interest all students of counselling and therapy. Its firm approval by people such as Albert Ellis, Gerald Corey and Peter Breggin is a fair indication that this book will have an appeal beyond the confines of Reality Therapy and Choice Theory.For the lay reader there is the Choice Theory message of personal responsibility, that in all human predicaments we have a choice. This is a message of hope and optimism well suited to a book that greets a new millennium."},{"Title":"Counseling with Choice Theory","review":"I am a believer in many of Glasser's ideas and use his theory within my work. I was so excited to find a new discussion of cases because I had grown so much from &lt;&lt;Reality Therapy In Action&gt;&gt;. I received this book and upon reading the first page realized I was reading something I had read before. This book is the paperback edition of &lt;&lt;Reality Therapy In Action&gt;&gt;. I recommend the book to anyone who desires to be empowered and wants to see where you have more choices than you think. However, if you've read (or like me own) &lt;&lt;Reality Therapy In Action&gt;&gt;, check out something else by Glasser."},{"Title":"Counseling with Choice Theory","review":"This is in my opinion one of the best works by William Glasser, one that clearly illuminates both Dr. Glasser's thought processes as well as the ethical grid from which he makes his peoplehelping decisions. His focus on choice as the central feature of all human difficulties as well as helping efforts clearly puts him inside of a most noble tradition that includes Thomas Szasz, Harold Greenwald and John Narciso. Regardless of whether you come to this book as a professional or as a layperson, I would recommend that you closely read, study and apply what you can from the sterling case studies Dr. Glasser lays out before you in this book."},{"Title":"Counseling with Choice Theory","review":"The next best thing to watching videos of his work! Glasser explains his techniques and concurrent thinking in a clear and concise manner. Great read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Counseling with Choice Theory","review":"If you (choose to) like reality therapy and choice theory, you'll probably (choose to) love this book. It's filled with clinical vignettes that reveal how to work with clients in a range of interpersonal issues from a reality therapy perspective.If I were any of the clients in this book, I would (choose to) throw something at this guy. One woman came in about not being able to get over an affair that her husband will not admit to having. Glasser's \\"solution\\"? \\"Get over it.\\" She says, \\"but what do I do with all my painful feelings?\\" Glasser: \\"Put them in the bottle with the past.\\" She says, \\"you mean just stop what I'm feeling and doing?\\" Glasser: \\"Yeah, just stop doing what you're doing.\\" I think I've summarized most of the book. He works with every client this way. He says at the end of this chapter that he worked with this lady for six more weeks and that he just kept saying the same thing he said in the first session over and over -- \\"Is this how you want to live?....so stop doing what you're doing.\\"I can't help but think of the famous Bob Newhart skit on MadTV called \\"Stop it!\\" (just search \\"Bob Newhart Stop It\\" on Youtube to see it). These vignettes were just as comical.Seriously, I've heard Wubbolding and Glasser speak and it's the same stuff over and over again and I honestly don't know why you would need an entire book, or an entire institute for that matter, to explain it.Don't like what you're doing? Then do something else. You're choosing to be upset, so just stop, bottle up your feelings and throw them away. Haven't heard enough? Come back for 6 more weeks and I'll be happy to say this to you again and again. Good grief.There is a great need for therapists to sometimes to just be simple and straightforward, and for some I'm sure they just want a good kick in the pants and for someone to say to them \\"stop it!\\" But if this is psychotherapy, then shut down all the schools, stop all the research, turn of all the MRI scanners, quit writing in all the journals, because you could teach this to a 3rd grader."},{"Title":"Counseling with Choice Theory","review":"In Counseling with Choice Thoery, William Glasser demonstrates how to communicate with people who are going through difficulty in ways that help them see the power of choice in their lives. Time and time again, Glasser shows people that when they honor the fact that they can only control their own actions, they become liberated from external control. When we stop trying to control others, we can better harness our energies to work with what we can influence: our own thoughts and behaviors.This book is written in an anecdotal style that makes for easy reading. It is geared somewhat to the clinician who works with people undergoing great difficulties. However, anyone who finds Choice Theory a useful paradigm would gain greater understanding through reading this book. By demonstrating how the same perspective can be brought to bear on a wide variety of human suffering, Glasser shows the effectiveness of his theory in a very practical way. I feel far more confident in working in this paradigm after reading this book."},{"Title":"Counseling with Choice Theory","review":"This is one of my favorite theories! I can't wait to read it! I got it 4 days ahead of the initial expected shipping date, which was a really pleasant surprise.

This time I just wanted the book again in my hands to make sure I was doing it correctly."},{"Title":"Counseling with Choice Theory","review":"I picked up this book up to help deal with personal issues following my first deployment. It helped me come to terms with reality and how to deal with it. It presented a new perspective on the way I saw reality. You discover that you cannot control reality, but you can control how to react to reality. This is a tough pill to swallow for a lot of people and I bet some may totally reject the ideas presented in this book.This book is unique in which it doesn't just go on and on about things you need to do to make your life better. It is presented though a series of actual documented counseling sessions the author had with individuals he counseled. Ultimately the decision to accept or reject the effectiveness of using reality theory is left up to the reader. Sometimes I found myself on the side of individual being counseled and thought that the reality theory approach wasn't an appropriate solution to the issue/problem at hand. However by the end of the counseling session, I (as well as the subject counseled) became more aware of the options we have in choosing how we see and react to our own reality.I would recommend this book to anyone that feels like their world is crumbling around them.

She, however, lived under the sea, which made her even more mysterious. The book has a few villains, like the Banksia men and Mr. Snake, but other than that, the Gumnuts always managed to outsmart them!Set in Australia, this book holds a multitude of charms, laughs and fascination. My love for Snugglepot and Cuddlepie will never die, even though i enter my adult years. May Gibbs, the author, does a fantastic job of illustrating and writing this gorgeous book. I recommend it to children 9 - 11 years, or anyone with an interest in nature, and wildlife mixed with fantasy."},{"Title":"The complete adventures of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie (Australian children's classics)","review":"My mom was from Austraila, and I grew up in California. Grandma sent us this book from Austrailia when we were little, and I loved it so much. Snugglepot and Cuddlepie are two gum-nut brothers who go on a quest through the Austrailian bush to see \\"humans\\". Along the way, they have many adventures. All the gum-nut people look like naked pudgy little two-year olds. The boys are either naked, or they have a gum leaf (eucalyptus leaf) for clothes (which really doesn't cover anything). They also all have caps made out of the end of a gum blossom. The girls are naked, but they have a little flower ring around their tummy, which covers as much as a swim ring. (The girls' hats are a gum bloosom with the flower on it, so it looks like they all have fuzzy blond hair.) Don't worry, no one has any \\"private parts\\", no more than Winnie the Pooh, but there are lots of cute backsides. You just want to squeeze and hug all the little gum-nut people. Snugglepot and Cuddlepie meet lots of Austrailian animals like kookaburras, joeys, lizards, ants, and caterpillers, and the wicked Banksea men (which my mom told me were seed pods off of the banksea bush). I get the impression that the author/illustrator had a real love for the outback, because the pictures have the detail of a botinist. The pictures are beautiful ink drawings, with some watercolor color plates. The book not have easy words for a little child to read to itself, it is more for snuggling up with mom or dad to read to you. I am going to get some for my grandkids."},{"Title":"The complete adventures of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie (Australian children's classics)","review":"An Australian children's classic, written and illustrated in the 1930s by May Gibbs, this is the story of two &quot;gumnut babies&quot;, tiny childlike people that live in the Australian bush. We follow their adventures meeting new friends and learning the ways of the bush and its animals, including a foray into the ocean and fish society and occasional encounters with the Bad Banksia Men!This is a beautifully written story with gorgeous illustrations that also subtly teaches the importance of caring for animals and the environment. Bear in mind that being written in the 1930s, there may be occasional moments that could be at odds with modern sensibilities (I don't recall anything blatantly offensive, however), but I don't believe these should be reasons to not read the book, but rather they could be a learning point about how things have changed, etc. I remember being entranced by the adventures of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie as a child, and the book is most suitable for the 5-10 age group, probably with an adult helping the younger ones."},{"Title":"The complete adventures of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie (Australian children's classics)","review":"I was absolutely thrilled when I discovered that this book was available - albeit second hand.

The writing and illustrations are OUTSTANDING!!! Especially if you are a fan of Cicely Mary Barker's flower fairy illustrations, and/or you're an avid hobby botanist/ gardener/ hiker/ naturalist who really loves looking at insects too. This wonderful odyssey takes place entirely 'in the bush' and is flush with suspense and surprises.

It's not just for kids- I seriously loved this book and couldn't help reading it long after my daughter had fallen asleep. This is fantasy writing at it's best!"},{"Title":"The complete adventures of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie (Australian children's classics)","review":"Any survey of Australian children's books would almost certainly rank two early works as the greatest.One of these is Norman Lindsay's \\"The Magic Pudding\\", about a pudding that can be cooked and eaten, slice after slice, day after day, and neer get smaller, AND, importantly, is a different kind of pudding (meat, jam, fruit, ...) depending on how you turn it, and whistle, before slicing. The pudding, known as Albert, lives in, or wears like a helmet, an earthenware pudding bowl. It has legs, and can walk -- or run! The pudding belongs to Barnacle Bill, a whiskery old sailor, and his sidekick, Sam Sawnoff, a large penguin. Both are pretty good in fights, if they meet ruffians, and both have a sizeable repertoire of sea ballads and adventurous tales of their former lives at sea. They are joined by Bunyip Bluegum, a jaunty young bachelor koala. The trio, with impudent Albert to sustain them, wander the back-block roads of inland Australia, around 1900 (the book was published about 1918). Happy days! -- a little like Toad, Mole and Rat setting off in the canary-yellow caravan. Then they meet two rascally puddin' thieves! Aha!The second is May Gibbs' \\"The Complete Adventures of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie\\", which began to be published around the same time as Lindsay's book, and was completed about ten years later, and issued as a single volume.Snugglepot and Cuddlepie are two orphanned gumnuts.Gibbs' two follow-on books, \\"Scotty in Gumnut Land\\" and \\"Prince Dande Lion\\" are possibly even better, but credit is due to Gibbs' first great achievement!In Gibbs' fantasy world based on plants and animals of the Australian bush, tiny (fantasy) creatures live among actual frogs, lizards, birds, snakes, koalas, kangaroos, possums, and insects -- and even fish, later in the adventure.The fantasy creatures are of two kinds. The generally good, human-like \\"nuts\\" and \\"blossoms\\" are cherub or kewpie-like boys and girls. The boys wear a gum-nut cap and a gumleaf \\"apron\\", front and back, for modesty; and the girls wear flower-blossom bonnets and dresses. They live in the bush and also congregate in \\"cities\\", with trams and streets and shops.The persistently wicked fantasy creatures are like the Morlock-version of the gumnut and blossom \\"eloi\\" -- Bad Banksia Men. The banksias are native Australian trees that flower and leave, standing like hairy pine-cones on the branches, knobby gnarled black blobby things like demented dried corn cobs. Their \\"bodies\\" have many \\"eyes\\" (the opened seed-pod of the actual banksia-cone), and equipped with Gibbs' picture of legs and arms, they become wandering tramps, highway robbers, burglars, and villains, generically.Big Bad Banksia Men are aided and abetted by SNAKES, who eat lizards, birds, frogs, and gumnuts and blossoms.Fortunately large lizards (goannas, or lace monitors) are friendly to the otherwise small and relatively weak gumnuts. Fortunately, also, kookaburras (the large species of kingfisher famous for its laughing bird-call) also eat snakes.Snakes and their allies versus snakes' prey -- the inherent conflict throughout \\"Snugglepot and Cuddlepie\\".And there are actual humans -- \\"in the distance\\".Snugglepot, the braver of the two \\"brothers\\" (they are actually from quite different families, at the beginning, but as two male orphans they band together as if they were actual brothers), wants to see humans.Humans are feared by the tiny gumnuts and blossoms, and known to be (often) cruel the the creatures of the bush. (This is also the theme for Dorothy Wall's \\"The Adventures of Blinky Bill\\", about koalas; a third possible \\"great\\" Australian children's illustrated book of this era.)Cuddlepie is willing to go with Snugglepot, but repeatedly says timidly he only wants to see humans \\"in the distance\\".They are befriended by a lizard, and have many adventures, and battle snakes and Big Bad Banksia Men.They also befriend another orphan, a blossom known as Little Ragged Blossom. She has a \\"book\\" of her own, and adventures, within \\"The Complete Adventures of S and C\\".Later, the three main characters tumble into the sea, and, as in Charles Kingsley's \\"The Water-Babies\\", Snugglepot, Cuddlepie and Ragged Blossom are able to walk and talk and live easily among a totally different world of fishes, who also walk and talk and behave rather like Jane Austen era humans, riding sea horses, and living in underwater towns.But some of the fish would like to eat Ragged Blossom.And a fierce octopus wants to eat anything it can, including Bad Banksia Men.Happily a baby fairy princess, Obelia, is miraculously born in a pearl shell, and she has a \\"book\\" of her own within \\"The Complete Adventures\\", in which a kind of magic spell and ancient fish prophecy is brought to a happy end.'And they do all live happily ever after.Children old enough to listen to a long episodic rambling story of adventure, comradeship, bravery, terror, and funny things (old enough to enjoy \\"Noddy\\") will love this.Children old enough to read \\"Noddy\\" or \\"Paddington\\" (both in their original chapter-book versions) will love this.May Gibbs ought to be better known internationally -- she is a world treasure!John Gough -- jagough49@gmail.com"},{"Title":"The complete adventures of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie (Australian children's classics)","review":"A most wonderful adventure for all children and adults, especially of Australian heritage."},{"Title":"Paris, Wyoming","review":"I got the impression that this author has actually read very few pieces of literature.

Second, the author is conservative and doesn't make an effort to hide it. If these facts don't disturb you then I can't recommend this book highly enough. It is a wonderful story of twentieth-century American politics, crammed with polls, stats, and insightful commentary. Why has ethnicity been a more important factor in politics than class? How did the political pendulum shift from conservatism to liberalism to conservatism again? Who are some of the most important statesmen in history that you've never heard of? And much, much more. If Michael Barone's &quot;The Almanac of American Politics&quot; is the Holy Bible of politics, then this work is a book of prayer."},{"Title":"Our Country","review":"Barone knows American political history inside and out. He gives the reader crisp, incisive portraits of individuals from Henry Wallace to Jack Kemp, of legislation from the Taft-Hartley Act to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 -- and he shows the reader how these people and measures fit into and shaped the world as it existed in their time. (The first two chapters, in which he presents brief portraits of Chief Justice William Howard Taft and Tammany Hall politico Charles Murphy, brilliantly illuminate how Republicans and Democrats thought and felt about their country in the early 1920s.) In addition, Barone knows the hard data of politics -- survey results, voting patterns, demographics -- and analyzes them in ways which often produce striking insights. His analysis of the timing and nature of the New Deal realignment, and the patchy and hesitant way in which liberal policies came to be accepted in the three decades or so following 1932, ought to be read by anyone interested in how ideological shifts really take place in American politics. Lastly, Barone (a journalist and former Democratic activist) recognizes and respects the achievements of the United States in the twentieth century -- and doesn't define &quot;achievement&quot; solely as &quot;movement towards the political left&quot; (as many other writers on American history, even sincere admirers like Harold Evans, sometime seem to do.) I cannot recommend this book highly enough to anyone with an interest in twentieth-century political and social change."},{"Title":"Our Country","review":"Michael Barone is the co-creator (with Grant Ujifusa) of the Almanac of American Politics, itself an almost inexhaustible well of the curious and (sometimes) interesting. Our Country is an effort to put the same sensibility to work in a narrative history. Barone has absorbed a lot and forgotten little, and he likes to remind the reader of things others are more likely to forget. Civil rights, for example. One wing of the Republican party had its roots planted firmly in the abolitionist movement, dating back to before the Civil War. You could call it &quot;the Eisenhower wing,&quot; if you were clear that it did not include Eisenhower. As general, and later as president, it seems fair to say that Eisenhower just didn't get it - not so much hostility to blacks as a kind of blank incomprehension - why weren't they willing to keep the place (one is tempted to make comparisons with General Sherman). Lyndon Johnson, by contrast, is one who emphatically did get it. Vulnerable and insecure as he always saw himself, Johnson was able to show real empathy for the plight of American Blacks. So we have the kind of irony so familiar in politics - the soldier-statesman who didn't get it, imposing a civil rights bill on Congress against the best efforts of the cracker politician who did.Barone obviously relishes the irony there, but he likes the story in particular because of an even more consistent enthusiasm. That is: he is fascinated by the hard work of governing, which he comes close to glamorizing in its very unglamorousness. You can see it perhaps best in his appreciative account of a man who he nominates as a forgotten progenitor of modern social legislation - Robert Wagner, the senator and father, inter alia, of the Wagner Labor Relations Act. Without Wagner, as Barone tells it, the New Deal's legislative agenda would have been a lot more insipid. It perhaps explains also his affection for Hubert Humphrey - a name perhaps mostly forgotten today, or remembered if at all only in the sour aftertaste of the 1968 presidential election, which he lost to Richard Nixon.What perhaps gives zest to Barone's account is that for all his skill as a data-miner, he believes at the end that politics is culture and not economics that divides us or draws us together. It impels him to insist that there is a society more important than its contentions and divisions, more than the sum of its parts - in some sense, a res publica, or (back to Barone's title here) &quot;Our Country.&quot; Only one afterthought: this is another book that cries out for an new edition."},{"Title":"Our Country","review":"This is required reading for all those hooked on what the White House derides as &quot;the cable news shows&quot; like Chris Matthews et al. Barone's years of compiling The Almanac of American Politics are manifested in this synthesis of some sixty years of national politics and his conclusion that it really is more than the economy, stupid. Is the Lewinsky Affair just a flash in the pan or will it define the landscape of American Politics at the millenium? Can a president's peccedillos (or other foreign sounding words) affect the national scene like race relations or the Panama canal? Was Dan Quayle onto something when he declared a race in 2000 against our two-term incumbent? While its timeframe doesn't reach Clinton, this book offers great insight into the schizophrenic poll results of late that seem to have pundits on the right and left tied up in knots trying to explain/spin."},{"Title":"Our Country","review":"Barone's history of politics from Roosevelt to Reagan was a very enjoyable read. He included historical polling information throughout the book (presidential popularity, etc.) that really illustrated his theory on political trends. I knocked off one star from my rating because at times I felt the author's own political opinion overshadowed the points he was trying to make.Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Our Country","review":"Sorry, I only read the first 35 or 40 pages. The recounting of legislative actions was too uninteresting. I am interested in tid-bits of human activity. So I put the book down, and will not waste my time with it. People like F.D. R. are boring, whereas the farmer and the housewife, working their way through life, make history."},{"Title":"The Gardener","review":"\\"Please, make me the gardener of your flower garden\\", a lover asks his beloved. He calls himself a servant and his beloved the queen. He dreams to serve her idle days. He wants to keep fresh the grassy path where she walks in the morning; he wants her feet to be greeted with praise at every step by the flowers.And what he wants for his reward? He asks to be allowed to hold her little fists like tender lotus-buds and slip flower chains over her wrists; to tinge the soles of her feet with the red juice of flower petals and kiss away the speck of dust that may chance to linger there.This is the way Rabindranath Tagore, the greatest Indian poet of all times, introduce us to this enchanted collection of poems, poems that touch the most profound strings of our hearts. His poems tell us about love and life - and they are rich with the description of nature and beauty. Anybody that loves or has loved cannot remain indifferent to his poems. Some readers \\"have smiles, sweet and simple, and some a sly twinkle in their eyes. Some have tears that well up in the daylight, and others tears that are hidden in the gloom.\\" But we all have need for him, the poet, who is \\"ever as young or as old as the youngest and the oldest of the village\\".His poems tell us of impossible love - like the love of the free bird and the cage bird: \\"Their love is intense with longing, but they never can fly wing to wing. Through the bars of the cage they look, and vain is their wish to know each other. They flutter their wings in yearning, and sing, 'Come closer, my love!' The free bird cries, 'It cannot be, I fear the closed doors of the cage.' The cage bird whispers, 'Alas, my wings are powerless and dead.' \\"His poems tell us of secret love: \\"The young traveler came along the road in the rosy mist of the morning. He stopped before my door and asked me with an eager cry, 'Where is she?' For very shame I could not say, 'She is I, young traveler, she is I.' \\"His poems tell us of lovers' emotion: \\"When my love comes and sits by my side, when my body trembles and my eyelids droop, the night darkens, the wind blows out the lamp, and the clouds draw veils over the stars. It is the jewel at my own breast that shines and gives light. I do not know how to hide it.\\"His poems tell us of the need for love confidence: \\"Do not keep to yourself the secret of your heart, my friend! Say it to me, only to me, in secret. You who smile so gently, softly whisper, my heart will hear it, not my ears.\\"His poems tell us of a love story: \\"Hands cling to hands and eyes linger on eyes: thus begins the record of our hearts. It is the moonlit night of March; the sweet smell of henna is in the air; my flute lies on the earth neglected and your garland of flowers is unfinished. This love between you and me is simple as a song.\\"His poems tell us of lovers departing: \\"An unbelieving smile flits on your eyes when I come to you to take my leave. I have done it so often that you think I will soon return. To tell you the truth I have the same doubt in my mind. For the spring days come again time after time; the full moon takes leave and comes on another visit, the flowers come again and blush upon their branches year after year, and it is likely that I take my leave only to come to you again. But keep the illusion awhile; do not send it away with ungentle haste. When I say I leave you for all time, accept it as true, and let a mist of tears for one moment deepen the dark rim of your eyes. Then smile as archly as you like when I come again.\\"Reading those poems I felt like visiting a flower garden full of scents and beauty in a magic ancient kingdom."},{"Title":"The Gardener","review":"I've heard of Rabindranath Tagore and his poetry ever since I the fifth grade when my literature teacher used to quote him on an occasion. At the time I didn't understand much of what those poems were about, but was interested in reading eventually reading them on my own. Over the years I had not though much about it, but in recent years my interest in poetry has been rekindled. When I came across several of his poetry collection on Amazon I decided to take a look at them and see what the hype was all about.Tagore was the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize. Unfortunately, Nobel Prize in literature has had a rather checkered history. Many of its early recipients are largely forgotten today, and many of the recent prizes have been given for political, rather than literary, reasons. I approached Tagore's poems with a grain of salt, but my skepticism proved to be unwarranted. His poetry is of the highest caliber, and his literary reputation is well deserved. He is not read much in the English-speaking world any more, which is a shame. He deserves to be rediscovered and his poetry reintroduced to the new generation of readers.\\"The Gardener\\" is a collection of love poems, where the lover compares himself to a gardener and the beloved to his queen. The verses are intricately woven and they explore the depths of love, its anguish as well as the sublime desires. The poems are rich with imagery and allegory. As in many others of Tagore's works, these love poems can be read on many levels, but they are particularly perceptive of our innermost spiritual strivings."},{"Title":"The Gardener","review":"excellent collection of indian poetry. found it accidently while browsing in a huge 6 story library. quite a lucky find."},{"Title":"The Gardener","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance.

With an uncommon verve and uncanny precision, Harrington painstakingly detailed the disgusting and shocking realities of life for those many millions of Americans of both color and ethnicity living lives of desperate poverty in the midst of the affluent society. Millions of readers, myself included, were shocked to discover the extent to which this world coexisted with our own, and many of the social action programs that arose in the 1960s and thereafter used this book as a kind of reference guide to the realities of poverty in contemporary society. Indeed, what is most disturbing about anyone re-reading the book is the discovery of how little conditions have changed for those who through the accident of birth, color, and ethnic origin, find themselves inexorably trapped in the vicious cycle of poverty.Sadly, for all the glad-handing of politicians and the proclamations by global corporations of the new and more widespread prosperity of the 1990s, the sobering truth is that very little progress has been made. Indeed, in more recent books such as William Finnegan's excellent \\"Cold New World\\", Harrington's basic thesis of the co-existence of a starker, poorer, and powerless populace left stranded to live lives of quiet desperation is reconfirmed, putting the lie to the many proclamations of universal opportunity and promise that politicians now ballyhoo. The book, which was first published in the early 1960s, was required reading for most introductory sociology and contemporary history courses, and millions of young academics first learned of the extent of the national problem through a reading of this book. It is, in that sense at least, a modern classic. Harrington's basic thesis is incontrovertible; poverty is extensive and endemic, and is usually hidden from the view of most affluent Americans due to the ways in which the two subcultures coexist in modern society. Through the de-facto residential segregation of the two elements of the society, there is little meaningful contact, and the media tends to ignore the facts of the existence of the underclass, portraying arch-types which conform more to the sensibilities of the more affluent segments of the society that regularly view its programming and enforcing unrealistic images of what exists. As a previous reviewer commented, we no longer habituate the same environments, and we tend to avoid all unnecessary contact with anything to do with this other world of poverty and want. What Harrington originally described in such anguished and inflammatory terms, hoping to purposefully ignite America's slumbering conscience, has instead become a permanent feature of our conscienceless socio-cultural landscape.It is a sad truth that Harrington's book is as timely and as shocking today as it was some forty years ago. His account of the fate of millions of impoverished people of color and ethnicity remains as cogent and as relevant as it was then. Despite the long and tortured history of the social legislation that attempted to rework this problem in the decades since, the reality of the situation seems to be that nothing much has changed in terms of the life-chances and hopes of the members of the underclass. It remains a mainstay of introductory courses in social stratification, providing an excellent overview of the myriad of the sociological, political, and economic issues surrounding the underclass, and is a wonderful example of just how important one man's vision of the truth can be in orienting others meaningfully toward rectifying a social problem. Poverty may remain, as they say, always with us, but the shocking truths found in this book still sheds the light of day into an unappetizing aspect of contemporary society we all should be aware of."},{"Title":"The other America;: Poverty in the United States","review":"The Other America was first published in 1962, before Johnson's &quot;Great Society&quot; and &quot;War on Poverty,&quot; before Vietnam, before the urban riots of the late 60s, before the Civil Rights legislation, and before the formation of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. As such, it may well seem a dinosaur to apply the revelations and ideas proposed by author Michael Harrington to a society that has advanced so far. Or has it? Harrington develops his thesis on the central premise that poverty in America is both there and widespread. More importantly, however, is the fact that it is hidden. People no longer have day-to-day contact with the urban poor. Before the mass exodus of the middle class, the majority of Americans lived in or near areas inhabited by the poor. Even if they did not, they walked through or drove through the rows of tenements on their way to work downtown. They saw the conditions the poor lived in and saw the faces of the poor. When Harrington wrote, as is true today, the &quot;ghetto&quot; is a place to avoid. We have successfully severed all economic use of the poor from our daily lives and are able to drive into downtown from the suburban fringe without even having to stop to see the lives of the poor. Even today's trend toward reconstructing highways below-grade so as to have less impact on the poor neighborhoods they divide further removes the lives of the poor from our daily routine-we don't even have to see the buildings pass by anymore. They are safely beyond the highway wall. Harrington differentiates between the poverty existing today and that of previous urban centers. The old ethnic ghettos were indeed permeated by poverty, had miserable living conditions, and were centers of disease and urban mischief. They did have one thing, however, that is lacking in today's ghettos: aspiration. The ghettos of yesterday melded the old world with the new, and served as stepping-stones toward the American dream. Those who form today's ghettos, primarily African-Americans, do not have an &quot;old world.&quot; They come from within our society but are not part of it. Generations of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination, and despair have disenchanted many, so much so that most of America is foreign to them and they are said to have a &quot;twisted spirit.&quot; Harrington discusses the various classes of poverty, ranging from that of blacks to the elderly to the rural farmer and many in between. Curiously, however, he only mentions poverty of children, a major issue of modern times, in passing. Public housing is discussed in some detail, and looking back from the failures we have witnessed in public housing projects, much could have been avoided had we paid attention to Harrington's thoughts. He condemns the towering projects as instant ghettos, providing poverty with a simple facelift, detached from surrounding neighborhoods. As early as 1962, an argument was being made against the demolition and removal of entire neighborhoods for the construction of high-rise towers and in favor of dispersed public housing. Only recently have HUD programs such as Section 8 vouchers and HOPE VI project grants implemented this ideology. Overall, Harrington's account of poverty in America has, unfortunately, remained a very viable account. Even after Johnson's &quot;War on Poverty,&quot; the civil rights legislation, urban riots, and the longest peacetime economic expansion ever, Harrington's book might as well have been written today. It provides a good summary of the sociological and economic issues concerning poverty, and would be a good introductory book before expanding on specific aspects of poverty by contemporary sociologists such as William Julius Wilson. A reader today may question his persistent call for a federal solution, given the miserable track record of federal programs and the increasing focus on local solutions. Harrington does, however, shed light and provide a realistic picture of a large portion of American's that most never see."},{"Title":"The other America;: Poverty in the United States","review":"This is the seminal work on the poor in America, analyzed within the context of government proffered, anti-poverty programs. It is a scathing critique and analysis of the war on poverty, where bold rhetoric and political grandstanding have often supplanted action. The author in his analysis categorizes poverty as a cultural and often institutional way of life that would require radical innovations, social planning, and long term financial investment, were the government really serious about eradicating poverty in America. What is amazing is that the arguments made by the author, when he wrote this book forty years ago, are still sound today."},{"Title":"The other America;: Poverty in the United States","review":"What is most amazing about Harrington's book is how accurately it describes today's society. The impact of this book, first published in the early 60s, is testament to the power that a single book can have on a nation and its people. It directly affected the thoughts and actions of President Johnson's \\"war on poverty\\". Unfortunately, this \\"war on poverty\\" may never come to a conclusion, even in the richest country in the world.The book itself contains a good introduction by Howe, who puts the impact of Harrington's work in context. Filled with statistics, which are unfortunately not well referenced, the case is made that the scale of poverty in the US is a travesty and an outrage. Harrington himself lived amongst the poor and disenfranchised members of New York's society for a brief period of time and he writes about their general hopelessness and lack of purpose in life. The descriptions and analysis of this book allow you to view the world through the 'lens' of poverty, to know (on a superficial level) the crippling and depressing lives of our society's poorest members. Harrington was perhaps the leading American socialist of his time, so be warned that his views and crituqes have a liberal/leftist stance and that much of the book disparages the efforts of the US government (perhaps, rightly so).As an added bonus, this edition of the book includes some insightful afterwords by Harrington about poverty in the 70s and 80s. Overall, an important and powerful work that is a must-read for anyone concerned with the issue of poverty in the US (which should be everyone, shouldn't it?)."},{"Title":"The other America;: Poverty in the United States","review":"Not being an American, I cannot judge whether the poverty situation described in this book is still as prevalent as it was in the early 1960's.I found the book to be a good and easy read, the author was able to get his point across and made some good suggestions. An important book that I am glad I read."},{"Title":"The other America;: Poverty in the United States","review":"White poor, black poor, urban poor, rural poor are included. This book was one of the driving forces behind the &quot;War on Poverty&quot; of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Now conservatives more than liberals see that we have a culture of poverty with generations of welfare families. Help is needed, but it has to be a workable solution. Liberals, conservatives and radicals seem not to really understand this culture. Perhaps help will come from a revived labor movement."},{"Title":"The other America;: Poverty in the United States","review":"During the 1950s, the poor were invisible; during the 1960s & 70s they were to be pulled up by the Great Society programs; during the 1980s they became the enemy of President Reagan and the middle class; during the 1990s and 2000s the poor have become clowns to laugh at on the \\"Jerry Springer Show\\".This book lends significant and valuable insight into poverty; not just economic poverty but \\"psychological\\" poverty. Although this book was written over forty years ago, much of the main ideas still seem to hold true. Instead of looking at today's poor Americans as \\"lazy welfare bums\\" we must look at the deep psychological and sociological subculture that is their situation. Harrington makes many interesting observations in this regard. The book is also very well written and researched.Please do not dismiss this book because of the author's liberal and socialistic political leanings. Take it for what it is. In any case, it will give you a lot to think about."},{"Title":"The other America;: Poverty in the United States","review":"The Other America has been around for a very long time. I read it when it first came out in 1962, and did not like it at all, because its basic thesis is that poverty is the result of cultural pathology (except in the case of the elderly). At the time I was a radical SDS anti-poverty and anti-war activist, and our ideology was that the poor were exploited and discriminated against, and simply lacked money. We had nothing but contempt for the notion of a \\"culture of poverty,\\" because that implied that the poor were responsible for their own fate.Well, I and my friends were very wrong. There is a culture of poverty and it accounts for much poverty, and this does not mean that we should ignore it because it's the poor's own fault. There but for the Grace of God go I, and you, dear reader, as well.The deep accuracy and sensitivity with which Harrington portrays cultures of poverty ring as true today as a half century ago. The tragedy is that the War on Poverty and other anti-poverty measures of the last third of the Twentieth Century did not understand Harrington's analysis, and treated poverty as the simple lack of material resources. How could the Federal Government have build public housing complexes, true breeding grounds of social pathologies, after reading Harrington's depiction of urban poverty. What an unmitigated tragedy.Many years ago I changed from criticizing the \\"blame the victim\\" mentality to embracing the notion that the victims should always blame themselves, because they are the only one who have the combined power and will to change things. When I am oppressed it is my fault and I better damn well figure out how to change the situation. Poverty in America will only be overcome when the culture of poverty is attacked, with vengeance and steadfastness, by the communities that are exploited by their pathological cultures of apathy and ignorance."},{"Title":"The other America;: Poverty in the United States","review":"This is the seminal work on the poor in America, analyzed within the context of government proffered, anti-poverty programs.

Harrington who understood society better than most of his day shunned such discrimination based on race, class, economic standing, or national origin and these honorable views resound very highly in the pages of \\"The Other America. The book is a study of poverty and its underlying factors in the United States during the fifties and sixties, Harrington who would often move into and work in the neighborhoods and communities he was studying presents a dignified and unbiased case for the inhumanity that existed and still exists in the slums and poor towns of the United States.Harrington takes the gloves off for his analysis of the evolution of poverty. The writer explores the factors of racial discrimination, economic and socioeconomic discrimination, family structural instability, the effect of recessions and hard times on poor communities, and the gap in education that propagates the extension and survival of poverty into the future. One important factor that Harrington continuously brings up in \\"The Other America\\" is the views and feelings of indifference that the middle class and well off feel towards the poor and lower classes of the other America. Harrington exposes the inefficient and dastardly laws, mindsets, and societal norms that ensured the survival of poverty into the twentieth century (and surprisingly they ring true for the present day as well). The writer exposes the stories and faces behind the suffering of the other America but also presents ways in which the suffering could be alleviated or poverty stamped out completely in the United States.The socioeconomic analysis that is \\"The Other America can seem quite statistical to the reader with its constant use of numerical studies and figures to illuminate the problem of poverty, but these bothersome details can be overcome and even appreciated by understanding that \\"The Other America\\" was written during a time of rising economic and sociological disparities, and was brought forth to energize and push the country towards creating solutions to these problems in the course of attempting to create a more equal and humility-minded society. A great read nonetheless for it highlights to those willing to listen the need both then and now for a war on poverty."},{"Title":"The other America;: Poverty in the United States","review":"This is the seminal work on the poor in America, analyzed within the context of government proffered, anti-poverty programs.

It is explained the poor are invisible because they dress as the rest of us do. Staying on interstates does not disclose the impoverished hamlets. The poor inhabit geographical aresa of beauty. The poor are increasingly isolated in specific areas of the cities. They are invisible politically. (Note the discussion in the last election of helping the middle class.) Powerful political organizations not longer focus on the slums.Sometimes poverty is a matter of unintended consequences. For instance, a pension scheme may fetter mobility. In addition to pensions, home-owning and credit outlays may impede mobility, (the ability to move to where the work is). A technological revolution in agriculture produces rural poverty. The alcoholic poor come from every social class. Aged poverty is described. (This is a topic that has changed since the introduction of Medicare.) The prevalence of mental illness among the poor is covered and it is truly telling.This book mobilized public opinion in the sixties to create remedies for poverty and it remains relevant today. Its breadth, its formulations, its visions are remarkable."},{"Title":"The other America;: Poverty in the United States","review":"This book is a subjective analysis of the USA regarding poverty.

Early had a few opportunities to turn events into substantial literary material but passed on them. This resulted in book that is little more than a string of unbelievable annecdotes.I recomend that adult readers try some of the Newbury Award-winning 'young readers' literature if they want well-written, clean, interesting fiction.

They won't be, if we continue to force them to read this incredibly bad book. Basically, Jim the Boy is about Jim, some boring pre-adolescent who lives in North Carolina and does not have a father. Jim was raised in the West. The west of North Carolina. It's pretty close to California. In more ways than Washington, D.C. is close to California. Thus, it is very difficult for Jim to put food on his family. This is an extremely boring premise, and the book sort of shoots itself in the foot with this purposeless setting. However, do not misunderestimate the author's propensity to write a bad book: the setting isn't the only bad thing about this book.For one, the dialogue is simply atrocious. It basically goes, \\"...\\" Uncle Bob said\\"...\\" Jim said\\"...\\" Uncle Al said\\"...\\" Jim saidThe fact that the characters always \\"say\\" something, and the fact that the dialogue is so bloody boring (think of a conversation between two adults about what they're going to have for dinner tomorrow) is horrible. In addition to this, there is hardly any character development at all - all the characters are so mundane, and so indistinguishable from each other, that I really didn't give a damn when something bad happened to one of them. Or when something good happens to them. Thus, when this book was supposed to put a smile on my face, I could only frown, frown from the interminable boredom that is this book.

Electricity is just finding its way to Aliceville, the town where Jim lives, starting with the new school opening up in the fall.Somewhere in the mix of an intriguingly believable account of a young boy's summer nights and anticipation of starting at a new school, Earley moves Jim away from playing ball and listening to his uncles' stories and takes on much deeper issues. Jim has a grandfather, Amos Glass, who he has never met. As mean as he is said to be, he is Jim's last connection to a father he will never know. Jim's mother, while devoted to Jim, maintains a heartbreaking loyalty to her marital vows even though her husband has long since passed. And in Jim's both complex and honest friendship with Penn, a boy from Lynn's mountain, Earley works through prejudice with the innocence of a ten year old boy and the wisdom of Jim's Uncles.There is nothing extraordinary about the characters in this novel. Nor is there any true pivotal turning point in the plot; readers are essentially following the life of a ten-year-old boy. What is extraordinary, however, is the way Earley is able to captivate readers with such a heartwarming, genuine and often intimate glimpse into the thoughts of a ten year old trying to find his place in the world, and grapple with things that are bigger than he can handle. After all, he is just a boy."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim the Boy, by Tony Earley, depicts the life of Jim Glass over the course of a one year period in the farm town of Aliceville, North Carolina. Jim experiences the changes of a young boy during the shifting period of the 1930s. The Great Depression is one of the key backdrops to the story. The small town life Jim is accustomed is gradually expanded by bigger schools, bigger cities, and bigger difficulties in life, forcing Jim to be overwhelmed by the realization that the world is far too big for a boy without a father.This novel is silver-lined with wonderful depictions of the North Carolina landscape and small town life, encompassing the beauty of the southern states while juxtaposing them with the northern states by illustrating the differences between big cities and baseball.This is not the most exciting story ever told, but the descriptive settings and themes are enough to make it an enjoyable read for anyone who wants to remember the excitement and fears in the life of a ten-year-old child. The backdrop of the story puts the focus on the south during the great depression by viewing the country from a perspective other than the inner city. Jim's family is forced to deal with the difficulties of the era (unemployment, polio etc.), while adjusting to the incredible changes of the 20th century. This novel is an easy, uplifting read with many teachable points, and yet also performs on the most basic pleasurable levels."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"As adults, we sometimes get engrossed in the daily grind of our busy lives, and tend to forget the simple things in life that bring us joy..the thoughtful gifts from loved ones, the beginning of a friendship, or tender words of comfort. Jim, the 10 year old main character of \\"Jim the Boy\\", reminds readers that, at any age, we can be brought back to a time when these events can once more be a part of our lives.Tony Earley, author of \\"Jim the Boy\\", does an amazingly beautiful job at bringing his readers into the world where Jim is growing up. The novel is staged during the Great Depression, in a small town in North Carolina. Although Jim appreciates and learns from the smaller events of his life, readers come to understand that Jim is also tackling important adolescent stepping stones - developing relationships outside of the family, coming to terms with the dynamics of one's own family, and the realization that we are only a small part of a bigger world.As a reader, and future educator, I recommend this book to all ages. Adult readers can only benfit by being reminded of how our world used to be...a world of \\"firsts\\" and \\"what ifs\\". Adolescents can relate to Jim on a personel level, realizing that the world is filled with characters like themselves."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Tony Earley's novel, \\"Jim The Boy\\", is both appropriate and inspirational to readers of all ages. Earley drops his reader into Jim's shoes and allows us to experience the significance of every event from the jealousy he feels for his best friend Penn for the first time electricity reaches Aliceville. While Jim grows up without knowing his father, he doesn\`t suffer from a shortage of love. Earley's writing exposes the importance love has on the development of a young adolescent and the lessons and wisedom his uncles, especially uncle Zeno provide. Issues of morality and virtue are addressed realistically without condemning the pitfalls of human nature. Jim's mother, Cissy, faces a very difficult decision and Earley interrupts his narrative with letters that draw the reader into the truths of the matter. Both mother and son have to confront themselves in their own personal evolution.Oral tradition, an idea that is often reserved for discussions about medieval literature and Morrison's Song Of Solomon is carefully preserved in Jim the Boy. Jim's uncle Zeno is a didactic speaker who Jim doesn't mind hearing repetitive stories from. Of course, we as readers are only exposed to these stories once, the fact that they are being repeated to Jim at his current stage suggest that he is re-evaluating or contemplating their initial grandiosity . We can track the growth of Jim as a boy to young man which is presented by Earley in an honest and truthful way.While the story takes place during the depression, the love between members of the Glass / McBride family seem to cope well and the strength of their relationships seem to overcome economic hardships. It is interesting to read this novel now, while we too face the economic crisis. Earley sends an important message out to readers that we can thrive on what we have, not suffer because of what we don't. Jim was happy with a baseball glove and a ball, and was able to achieve happiness without electricity, \\"wii,\\" \\"Playstation\\" or \\"PSP.\\" To live a meaningful worthwhile existence, we shouldn't forget the importance of character education, self-reflection and the strength it takes to face what forebodes our psyche."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"It's hard to explain why this book is so good. It's not about the plot, which is barely existent--Jim simply grows up a little. It's not about the philosophy; it's not a pretentious book in any way, and the thoughts that run through it are neither deep nor shallow. It's not about the characters, who are beautifully portrayed yet nothing unusual. And it's not even the writing, which although flawless, doesn't feel showy or inspired. What makes this book so good is that every part of it comes together like an intricate three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, completing a picture so fulfilling, so total, so lifelike, that you enter a new world in way that few authors allow their readers to do--it's a world as clear and distinct as your own. And when done, you've made friends with a young man whom you won't forget for years."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This book has been done a disservice by being placed on school reading lists. It lacks the hooks of melodrama and humor, and either more contemporary or fantastic setting that would make it acceptable for a classroom of middle or high school students, and a hero too young and unheroic for most high school readers. ( The town scene of sorta gang behavior doesn't cut it.) For those 14 and younger, I'd recommend instead anything by Doris Buchanan Smith, particularly Return to Bitter Creek, for similar setting and development.For adults and older adolescents, it's a book to happen upon and then read for the gently developed extended vignettes of place and character, and the calm of simply stated dialogue."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"I knocked this book out in 2 sittings over the Christmas holiday. It was a fun little book with a few basic life lessons. The style of the book and the era in which it is set reminds me heavily of &quot;The Red Pony&quot; by Steinbeck. Finally, perhaps the best thing about this book is that it's a fun read for folks aged from 5-80, and there are no hidden agendas, political, social, or otherwise. Just a good old-fashioned read."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"I don't think this book is particularly profound, or deeply moving. But, I don't think anyone was shooting for the Great American Novel when it was written, or would claim that title for it. I put this book more in the same category as Gary Paulsen's \\"Harris and Me\\", or Richard Peck's \\"A Long Way From Chicago\\". We follow Jim through a time that no longer exists in a world that no longer exists, (if it ever did), and from our current vantage point maybe feel a little sorry for ourselves as a consequence. Maybe that accounts for the violently disparate reviews.But all of that is more hoity-toity than it needs to be. Suffice to say that Jim is decent, his family is loving, interesting mild things happen, and another year passes. The writing is sometimes a little purple, but it's never slapdash. The book can be overly sentimental, but my impression was the impulse to sentiment was sincere, not calculated or manipulative, (like, say, the syrupy ghost-written celebrity Christmas books that seem to come every year.)So, I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt here. And I do think this would be a good middle school read, and I am curious to find out what my kids think after they've read it. Which, in a way, is the most you can ask of a book."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This is a beautiful book and, sadly, the kind of fiction that fails to resonate when critics pick their \\"best works of the year.\\" The story unfolds beautifully, the characters are richly drawn, and the prose is stunning. Early shows that he is a master here."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This book really isn't a \\"coming of age\\" story although it does tell the story of one's boy's life during one year. This book chronicles how several changes during the year affect Jim's life: going from a one room schoolhouse to a multiple-room school, learning that the \\"mountain\\" boys aren't that different from the \\"town\\" boys, meeting his grandfather for the first time, seeing the ocean for the first time, and finally getting electricity in his hometown after having had his house wired for it for years. (This book takes place during the Depression.) I rank this book up there with The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society and the Mitford books. If you like those, I really think you'll like this one, too. Meanwhile, I'm going to see what other books Earley has written so I can add those to my reading list as well."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Well written and sweet, but rather slow. Some characters were somewhat difficult to relate to, rendering their decisions and actions puzzling."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"JIM THE BOY is a slight, sweet tale, told in a voice as true as childhood itself. Perhaps its most important lesson is that the word \\"father\\" can have countless meanings, all of them important. While this may not exactly be the \\"great American novel,\\" I enjoyed Tony Earley's simple story of a Depression-era southern boyhood immensely. It has an ageless appeal that will span generations. Well done. - Tim Bazzett, author of LOVE, WAR & POLIO and the REED CITY BOY trilogy."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"A really touching story. I have seen criticisms that say there is no plot. However, I really enjoyed the description of this family's life and love for each other. Jim learns many lessons as his mother and uncles support him in their small farm town. My city used this book as a community read. I am glad I had the opportunity to read it. It has stuck with me."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim the Boy is an extremely simple tale of a boy who is \\"coming of age.\\" Earley uses uncomplicated language which paint an effortless depiction of what it would be life to live and work on a farm in North Carolina during the Great Depression. There are many elements in the novel which speak to the times as they were such as, racism, economic depression, and first signs of electricity. These elements, however, were the backdrop to the story and only painted an idea of life during the times.In the Prologue we come across a letter stating that Jim's father has \`passed.' The letter is directed to the boy's grandfather and from this very short letter the entire scene of the novel sets the stage. We learn that there is something dysfunctional about the grandfather and he is unwelcomed in the life of Jim and Jim's mother. Moving along ten years, the novel starts with Jim's tenth birthday where he celebrates with his three uncles and his mother. From this day on Jim is presented as being tried as a \`man' working in the fields and comparing himself to his uncles.The tales Jim's life takes us through are tales of boyhood and growing up without a father. Jim is fortunate enough to have his three uncles as male role models, but his thoughts and actions exemplify to the reader that there are trials and tribulations he is experiencing within as he learns about life through living.This story is a quick read for someone who enjoys a light read about family, pride and coming of age. It is excellent for an adolescent just starting to enjoy reading themselves, for they will breeze through and learn a different perspective about coming of age and recognize how not so different life was, even eighty years ago!"},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Tony Earley's Jim the Boy is a warm hearted coming of age novel. It is set in North Carolina during the Great Depression and follows the life of a young boy named Jim, beginning on his tenth birthday. Readers are able to witness the changes that occur within Jim's life in the short one year span. Earley displays the importance of family and how imperative the simple things in life can be. Although this is not the most engaging novel I have ever read, it is beautifully written. I loved the poetic descriptions, especially of the land and Jim's surroundings, that occured throughout the novel. Even though it is a quick read, some people may find Jim the Boy to be relatively boring. It wasn't the most exciting piece of literature I have ever read, but it was definitely worth reading. I think that many young adolescents could relate to some of the feelings that Jim encounters. This novel would also be a great text to utilize in order to enhance students' reading skills."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"If only for the mere fact that I really enjoyed some of the more corky characters like Whitey and the Uncles, Jim the Boy was a bit of a snoozer. Although it was a fast read, I still wasn't connecting with the main character on any kind of level. A pretty good coming of age story, but Jim is no Holden Caulfield in my opinion.The lessons to be learned throughout the book are typical. Some scenes were very touching and well-written, but because I felt disconnected from Jim, I didn't emotionally react. This is a good book to read for leisure, but as far as teaching it to students, one might have a difficult time coming up with material that's fresh."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"After reading most of the reviews, I feel outnumbered thinking that this was an extremely flat tale of a boy growing up during the Great Depression. And without reading all the reviews and slight hints throughout the story, one might not even know it was the Great Depression, but rather think it's just a small North Carolina farm town during any period in American History.I agree that at times, the story is told very poetically, especially in the descriptions of the beautiful rural environment. But the descriptions seem to fall short in creating the characters. Although the dialog definitely helps create Jim as well as his mother and Uncles', it seemed difficult to get to know the characters or feel any emotion toward them.This is a quick read for one who likes gentle stories, of times when life was simple. But for anyone, especially high school students, that might need a more engaging story, or one with dynamic characters to get them interested in the action of a novel, this isn't the most appropriate book."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"An absolutely lovely story about a ten year old boy becoming aware of the world he lives in and the people around him. Tender and loving, but definitely not overbearingly so. Jim is lucky to have a loving family, but a family that doesn't smother him or overshelter him with that love. A real feel-good book, suitable for young adult readers and up."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim the Boy by Tony Earley is a sweet novel set in North Carolina during the late 1920's. Unlike other books set in the South of recent memory, though, this book doesn't describe an abused young man or a dysfunctional family but rather one of great strength.Although Jim's father dies only a matter of days before he was born, Jim is raised by his mother and three uncles who never married. Throughout the book, it is these men, who earn their livelihood from farming, who teach Jim some of life's greatest lessons. From learning how to hoe a field to confronting a firends devestating illness to seeing the grandfather he never knew as this old man lays dying, we as readers journey along as Jim experiences life between his tenth and eleventh birthday.Reminiscent of the equally lyrical style found in Plainsong by Kent Haruf, this book is a pleasant read for a summer's day."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Tony Earley has written a small gem of a novel. Jim the Boy is a coming-of-age story -- a year in the life of a young boy living in Depression-era rural North Carolina. He is being lovingly but firmly raised by his widowed mother and his three bachelor uncles. This book is remarkable in many ways, among them for what it does NOT have: abuse, dysfunction, and angst are totally missing from this book.Earley, a professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, has been published in several magazines and is also the author of a book of stories, &quot;Here We are in Paradise&quot;.Although the story is told in the voice of a child, it is never cute, just straightforward, honest, and plain. There are no convoluted sentences, no literary \\"tricks\\". Instead, the author has written a universal story, a children's book for adults that tells a complex story in simple language and style.Jim Glass is having his tenth birthday as the book opens. He lives in the small town of Aliceville with his mother, and nearby live his three unmarried uncles whom Jim considers to be his three fathers, his young father having dropped dead in a field the week before Jim was born. These five individuals are a contented family unit, close and committed to each other, with the uncles sharing the paternal responsibilities. The adults do a fine job of guiding Jim and giving him worldly experience in the small doses that he is able to handle. Jim knows that he is a fortunate young man who lives a fairly carefree life, and he never dwells on what could have been.Jim's tenth year is a year of firsts: his first trip to the ocean, his first best friend, his first baseball glove, his first encounter with a bully, and his mother's first suitor. He also has to deal with the anxiety of starting at a new school and the threat of polio. Looming just over the horizon, up on a nearby mountain, is Jim's moonshiner grandfather who will have nothing to do with him-- he became estranged from Jim's father when he left the mountain to marry Jim's mother.Several parts of this book will stay with the reader long after the last page is turned: the letter that opens the book, the description of the trip to the ocean, and the story of how the town was named, among others.This will not be the last that we hear about Jim Glass. Earley has said \\"I'm a long way from finished with Jim and the uncles and Mama. They've already told me that.\\""},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This is a book about the spiritual nourishment of a young soul. It is as patiently and impeccably crafted as a fine piece of simple furniture, made without glue, nails, or embellishment. Smooth and beautiful without a false or unnecessary move. Very few authors today have that restraint, finesse, and wisdom."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim the Boy is simple. Throw away your daily complexities and simply read about a boy discovering the indiscriminate size of a baseball in his uncle's enormous hand. The world was indeed large, and we boys were indeed small. I guess I had simply forgot to remember."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"From what I had read about this book, I expected an instant classic that would live up to its inspiration, Huck Finn. Though I enjoyed the book's leisurely pace and solid writing, I found it somewhat ordinary. The actual events are captivating as we witness the young protagonist who gains an extra digit (turns 10) as the book opens experience his childhood. We learn before the book starts that his father died before he was born, so he lives with his mother and 3 uncles (her brothers) who never married. I enjoyed the opening chapters in which Jim goes out into the field with his uncles to try his hand at hoeing, only to find out that it's much harder than he thought. This, and the other central incident involving his friendship with Penn and a brief encounter with Ty Cobb were the highlights of the novel. It's very readable and does give a well-rendered view of growing up in a small, rural American town. I just felt that there was still too much distance between Jim and the reader to really get inside the character the same way we do while reading a book like Huck Finn. A very good novel, but a few steps short of great."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This is a wonderfully lifelike book about a young boy named Jim, told in letters, prose, and vignette-like chapters. The author's voice is so rich and true, much like that of Harper Lee in To Kill a Mockingbird. The characters are well-drawn and they treat one another like family, with practical jokes and eccentric habits. They take Jim on \\"mystery\\" trips to the ocean, the mountain to visit his dying grandfather, and to see a farmer about buying some Belgian work horses. We see it all from Jim's point of view, and his feelings resemble the feelings we all have of riding in cars with relatives, playing baseball, going to school open houses, etc.The main plot, if there is one, is how Jim gets along day to day without a father, who died at age 23 of a heart attack before Jim was born. We see how Jim forms a mental image of his father from the stories older villagers tell to Jim, who knew Jim's Dad as a boy. Jim's father, or the image Jim creates of his father, is always with Jim and with his mother, who refuses to remarry since she considers herself still married and in love with Jim's father's memory. We feel Jim's sense of differentness because he does not have a Dad; we see how he reaches out to his three uncles, to a local traveling salesman, the local African American farm workers, even his best friend's Dad, who has more new stories to tell Jim about his father. This is just a book about a slice of life during the Depression; not some big epic, and what life was like for a boy in a mountain hamlet. That is what makes this book so special, so intimate, so appealing. It is excellent and I am considering buying it for our church library because most any child can relate to Jim's life--dealing with bullies, making friends, how to treat a friend who gets a life-threatening disease (In this case, polio) and how to deal with school and family. I enjoyed this book very much. It is a quiet little masterpiece. Kind of like a fly in amber --fascinating and timeless."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Highly recommended for anyone who was born in, came from, or has relatives in a small town, particularly a small town in western NC or SC. Extra points if you're from around Rutherford, Gaffney, Shelby, or points thereby.Imagine &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; written from the point of view of a child who actually wants to catch baseballs, and who may be growing up on a farm that COULD be growing rye, and is as Southern rural as you can get without stomping on any politically correct toes.Tony Earley's first &quot;novel&quot; isn't so much a novel as it is a humorous and melancholy episodal remembrance of pre-adolescence in a small Southern town. Since Earley's date of birth comes much later than the setting in the novel (and Earley was born a scant few years before my birth), and since the small town in question is (apparently) about 30 miles from my small town of birth, I have a soft spot for his prose. The reader will NOT find a great novel here; however, the reader will find a tender and nuanced piece of fiction that will bring back memories to anyone born in the South sometime before the 1970's. Indeed, those born in ANY small town with any knowledge of their childhood-town's history will wince and nod knowingly, assuming that Earley was really writing about their town. Jim's coming of age has no rude points, but suggests the pre-adolescent angst.The book is concise--you can easily read it in one sitting, probably in a few hours. If the milieu and memories dredged up resound with you, the reader will probably want to go back and re-read some of the sections, just for the nostalgia. And, all that aside, the last section of the book, indeed, the last 3 or 4 pages of the book, are perhaps the best writing to come out of the South in decades. Earley has pieced together vignettes that border upon &quot;young adult&quot; fiction, along with a style that reminds one of Faulkner at his wittiest and Welty at her tenderest, and topped it off with a heart-wrenching finale that should make you cry.I should reiterate &quot;witty&quot;--there are some belly laughs in this book. The &quot;lights on&quot; section is laugh-out-loud, and the acerbic humor of the uncles deserves more chapters, or at least a re-visitation by Earley. The understated humor, even in the dramatic passages, suggest that Earley is holding back on us--he could become this generation's version of Jean Shepherd, if he chose to.The main drawback to the book is that it's too short. I gave it less than 5 stars mainly because of that, and partly because it sometimes reads as if some of the sections were meant as &quot;young adult&quot; prose but then changed into a &quot;real adult&quot; novel. I've been a fan of Earley even before his short stories were collected in &quot;Here We Are in Paradise&quot;, and had hoped that his first novel would be a massive neo-Faulkner/Percy/Welty revival. I was disappointed with &quot;Jim the Boy&quot; for the first few tens of pages due to that expectation. Then, I got into the flow of the writing, and changed my expectations. The book reads in many places like a &quot;young adult&quot; work, and that's OK--I'd recommend it for teenagers. Then again, the nuances and beauty of the writing are obviously a bit more sophisticated than most &quot;young adult&quot; offerings, so it must be a real adult book.Of course, &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; reads like a &quot;young adult&quot; book, and look what's in there. And, as I suggested earlier, IF you're from a small town and latch onto the protagonists in the first 20 or so pages, you'll bawl like a baby on the last page."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"I have to agree with some of the reviewers. This book is rather simple in style, plot, and texture. I don't think that makes it a bad book at all. On the contrary, I found this book to be a refreshing break from the current genre of flashy, overly-cranial books that try to hide a meaning in every little sentence.This is the BEGINNING of a coming of age story. In the version I read there is an interview with the author. In it he states that he hopes to turn this into a trilogy, or at least continue Jim's story. I personally can't wait.Realistically, to all the negative reviewers, how was your life when you were 10 years old? Were you fighting in a war? Involved in corporate espionage? Saving the world from evil? Didn't think so. This book is about a boy's 10th year on this earth and what he goes through. Nothing more, nothing less, no matter what you try to concoct out of it. For that, this was done very well.The writing style here is simplistic, and it gets the job done. Since the book is geared towards adults and youth I can see where a higher style of writing should not be used. How many people today honestly look for so-and-so \\"retorted\\" or \\"interjected?\\"This book will be a great one to pass along. It has a timeless quality to it. I didn't grow up in NC or in the 30s but I could remember and relate to much of what Jim experiences and I think you can too.Buy the book, enjoy it, and pass it along. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"&quot;Jim the Boy&quot; is one of the most simply, yet beautifully crafted novels I have read in quite a while. One one level it may seem to be somewhat simplistic and a quick and easy read. However, the skilful and artistic author has in fact written a deep and emotionally moving novel about the depression-era childhood of a fatherless boy under the care and guidance of his mother and three uncles. I confess to reading this only because it was the featured novel at my book club this month, but am so very glad that I did. I found it fascinating to see how Jim's uncles guided him through life's sometimes hard-learned lessons with both toughness and compassion. I look forward to my group's discussion later this week."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Earley seems to have combined the painstakingly simple language of Hemingway with a bit of the Southern storyteller a la Ferrol Sams. This book captures the spirit of a real boy in a gentler time. It's as close to my own childhood as I care to revisit. Earley is an important writer whom I will follow with great interest."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This small, spare novel is amazing. It's very stillness is what makes it so powerful. 'Jim,the Boy' evokes emotions and captures the everyday drama of one ten year old boy. A boy with no father but three terrific uncles.

It is for all readers with hearts."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"The first thing I noticed when reading some of the reviews below and above was that the people who reviewed this book so harshly (and cynically) did so with a bit of vitriol that I can guess spills over into their everyday life. I pity their coworkers. I have read Mr. Earley's book and liked--and I am not a schmaltzy, vacuous individual. I may not reread this book again in the two weeks, but I am glad I took time out of my otherwise inane life to spend a moment with Jim. I wish the other readers did not bully the poor young man so much--I wonder what they were like as children? Perhaps they still are?"},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This book will do more to restore the human heart andantimaterialism than all the polemical works in the world. It isabout dignity and faith, sure of hand, deceptively simple. Buy it. Treasure it. Share it..."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"There were moments when reading this lovely book when I couldn't believe the amount of evocative effect and emotion Earley was able to create with a few simple words. I adore Baroque language and bravura writing as much as any reader, but writing like this just amazes me. Here's my analogy: this book reminded me of a Vermeer. A simple moment in time, a quiet domestic scene, a small canvas. But the perfection of the rendering and the precise editing of objects evokes an entire world.If you need a more contemporary analogy, try Sinatra. He wrung extraordinary emotion and effect from deceptively simple song readings, never needing the vocal acrobatics too many singers lean on.I think the reviewers here who hated this book are just too young, whether in age or viewpoint, to see the value in this kind of work. The language is simple, but the emotion is not. Let them try it again in 20 years and see if they've finally lived enough to appreciate its wisdom, honesty and power."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"I read this book after it was recommended by Jan Karon in her &quot;Miford&quot; newsletter. I'm glad I did! I bought it as a Christmas gift for a young friend. I'm sure he can relate to Jim even though the setting is early 20th Century. It's a wonderful story about a young boy growing up in a family with so much love to give. Even though Jim's father died before he was born, his wonderful uncles devote themselves to being a father to young Jim. Spend awhile with this wonderful family. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"I can't begin to figure out how Mr. Early could understand what it was like to live on a farm in the mid-south in the early 1/3 of the Twentieth Century. But, not only did he understand - he understood well enough to tell this compelling story from the point of view of a young boy. Buy this book. You won't reget it. Make sure you put your name on it, because you will want four or five people to read it and it will get passed around. My only comment is that the black characters in this book come off as benevolent and kind and slightly less than real: Almost ghostly. However, that is how a sheltered ten year old might see those who weren't part of his everyday life. The sunny life of this young boy is always edged by the harsh reality of adult life. Illness, death, violence towards people and animals and the reality of winning often isn't really winning in life. I hope Mr. Early continues with his novella output.

It's well written and not too long. Although I'm glad I read it, I found Jim the Boy boring. There is some discussion here of it being appropriate for young readers, and I agree with that. But if one is thinking of it as a book to insprire reading among young readers, this would not be it."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"I flew through the pages; enjoyed every minute of it. I felt like I was there with Jim and his Uncles and Mother."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"The readers who call this 'children's fiction' are missing the point. this novel is an homage to books (like 'the yearling') that remind us why life is good. it counters the trend of life-as-angst. remember reading novels that made you feel GOOD? probably its been since grade school, right? This book isn't for kids; they'd miss all its symbolism and subtlety. it will remond you why you loved reading in the first place. even its cover art made me smile."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Tony Early tells the story of Jim with such straight-forward simplicity that you forget that you are, in fact, just reading a book. You can feel the heat of the sun on the boy's shoulders as he spends a day with his uncles in the corn field; feel his yearning to know the father who died just a week before he was born. I could go on, but I can't top Early. Go read this book! I doubt that I'll read a better one this year."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Ever since &quot;Birthday Boy&quot; was published in Granta's volume &quot;Best of Young American Novelists&quot;, I've been waiting for the rest of the novel. &quot;Jim the Boy&quot; fills out the rest of story, and weaves a beautiful life. So few writers capture the feelings of childhood. Yet, Tony Earley does it so cleanly and powerfully, with no frills. Thank you."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim the character and the &quot;Jim the Boy&quot; the story are both a delight. Earley's writing is a deft combination of simple and lyrical. If, like me, you've got children, this is a book you can share with them and both enjoy.The story follows a year in the life of 10 year old in Depression-era North Carolina. Jim's father died before he was born but his three single uncles serve as wonderful surrogate fathers. There's also a wise old African-American farmhand, (appropriately named Abraham) to give Jim all the father figures he needs. The older men and Jim's mother are are all well-drawn characters. In fact, part of the book's strength is the strong supporting cast for Jim, including a best friend from the mountains.There isn't a single strong enough thread to serve as the book's plot (other than Jim, himself). Though you could argue that point with several fellow readers, with each of you arguing a different aspect of the book as it's primary theme.&quot;Jim the Boy&quot; is a fast read and can serve as a day or two's pleasant distraction, or can be mulled over and examined. I can easily imagine it being adopted by English classes of various age levels.Buy the book and share it with the family."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"i am familiar with tony earley from the new yorker and as soon as i read the chapter that was excerpted for the magazine i recognized it...he writes in a way that is at once touching and real...the emotions of the boy are real and of a much simpler time...but he doesn't lose what is timeless in the growing of a boy...loved the uncles...and passed the book on to my children..."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Recommendations I would recommend this book, Jim The Boy, to ages 13 and up. The reason I chose those ages is because some of the wording is difficult and hard to understand, and because of the length. This book shows a great example of a good friendship. An example is when Penn and Jim get in trouble at the market. Penn stuck up for Jim, and pushed the bully saying, &quot;You leave him alone!&quot; Also when Penn got hurt, he wanted to play ball but couldn't because he didn't have a ball or mitt. So Jim gives him his ball and mitt because he felt that it was his fault for the injury. Uncle Zeno asked, &quot;Where is your ball and mitt?&quot; &quot;I gave it to Penn.&quot; Jim said. That is a great example of a true friend. In conclusion if you like friendship books or books that are set in the past, I really recommend this book for you."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"For some reason I thought this novel was for adults although in retrospect looking at the cover should have told me otherwise. Set in the South, North Carolina, it is the story of Jim who never knew his father. The guy died at 23 of a heart attack, and his widow remained faithful to him, never considering remarriage. However, Jim has the love and support of his three unmarried--bachelor?--uncles. They live on a farm, and this is a sort of coming-of-age story. Quite possibly adolescents might like it. But it is a dull, dull read."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim the Boy is a beautiful, simple work that details the life of a fatherless farm boy in North Carolina during the Great Depression. The simplicity of Earley's prose is what makes it so impacting. He has a way of saying so much with so little.While some adults may find the book morally trite, I think that to do so misses the point. It is important to remember first that the book is written to be accessible to a child. It is also important to keep in mind that moral complexity does not necessarily imply quality. What Jim the Boy lacks in moral breadth, it makes up for amply in depth. The emotional range that Earley taps into is a wonderful accomplishment. I would recommend this to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"\\"Jim the Boy\\" is a clever novel that tells the story of a boy on the verge of adolescence during the Great Depression. His father succumbed to heart problems before he was born, but his mother was fortunate enough to have three brothers to help her raise the newborn son to adulthood. The story is written in language that is fast-moving and easy to understand, but the plotline is very complex- although certainly not unintelligible. This tale features many of the problems that plague children of middle school age: bullying, the sense of feeling estranged from both younger and older boys, and a conflict between a desire for independence, such as when Jim is appalled at the notion of his family accompanying him to school, and a wish to make his parent figures proud, as manifested by his bitter disappointment over having difficulty hoeing a field in the novel's opening chapters.Some of the characters, such as the main character Jim and his friend Penn, are engaging. Their manner of speech is more dialect than what Jim calls school-teacher English. Their friendship is a very interesting one, for Jim lives close to town while Penn hails from the mountains. They have different cliques as well, and started off as rivals. Indeed, elements of jealousy and rivalry emerge even when Penn falls ill. They act just as one would expect two boys of ten to behave throughout the novel, with streaks of recklessness and rebelliousness. Their time together reflects exactly the sorts of things young boys enjoy doing with friends. Avid sports fans will be amused that boys were just as zealous about baseball decades ago.On the flip side, other characters, such as Jim's uncles, seem flat. The only layer of complexity occurs in their relationship with their sister, Jim's mom.One thing I noticed is that Jim's family had it easy compared to many others during the Great Depression... they have some struggles, but they still have a home and a farm. They seem to be a middle-class, or perhaps even upper-middle class, American family in the mid 1930s. Like today's 20-year-olds that watched the world change from the Industrial to Informational age as children, from paper to electronics, Jim saw electricity come to have an immense impact on society.The scene descriptions are very vivid and detailed without too much wordiness common among other authors- a reader can easily form their own image of what is happening.Adolescents that read Jim's story will be able to identify with the characters, particularly males- girls might not enjoy this as much, but the letters and thoughts of Jim's widowed mother will speak to them. The author intermittently includes the internal struggle of Mrs. Glass over whether she ought to remarry since she has been bereft of a husband. She must cope with pressure from her brothers to remarry, highlighting the societal view of women in history. The one criticism I have with this aspect to the novel is that it seems irrelevant to the general plot, and sometimes the book switches to the relations between Whitey and Jim's mother rather abruptly.The biggest criticism I have is that some major ideas, such as women's struggles, the bullies, societal views toward African-Americans, and struggles such as polio, are quickly entertained and abandoned. I also disliked the ending- it seemed abrupt and a sense of closure was lacking.All in all, I would give this 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Tony Earley's novel, Jim the Boy focuses on the simple beauties and challenges that a young man faces as he begins his adolescence. Starting with a note from Jim's uncle predating Jim's birth, Earley fills the reader in on the familial details and drama that led to the life that Jim must grow into. This world is one set in North Carolina during the Great Depression. Jim's family is of meager means and they find comfort in one another and their work. Earley portrays such ideas as family and work as beautiful in their simplicity. He illustrates this through Jim's aspirations on his tenth birthday to work in the fields with his uncle. Throughout the novel, we see through Jim's actions that he truly adores his father-in-three-bodies.While the prose is simple, Earely succeeds in portraying the world as something that Jim must grow and adapt to. Many writers would stick to a limited third person point of view in a novel such as this. They would succumb to showing the world through the rapidly-opening eyes of the protagonist. Earley inverts this idea however, Earely interrupts Jim's adventures with italicized portions of writing -often in the form of letters- meant to show the world viewing Jim. Such a strategy is not uncommonly used but is uncommonly this effective. The reader views Jim as a piece of a larger world even as Jim himself learns this."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim the Boy, by Tony Earley is a straightforward novel, which revolves around 10-year-old protagonist, Jim. Jim's father passed away prior to his birth, and he is left with his mom and her three brothers. In the one-year span of the story, we follow as Jim lives everyday life in Aliceville, North Carolina in 1934, during The Great Depression. Jim and his family have a solid relationship, and they live simple, peaceful lives on the family farm. Once Jim begins school, he experiences three main events that have an impact on his life: the introduction of electricity to Aliceville, a visit to the Atlantic Ocean in South Carolina, and travels up the mountatin to Painter's Creek, to visit with Penn and his grandfather.Altough the plot seems flat, and one-dimensional, Earley has created a novel that depicts the innocence of childhood, and an account of simplier times. The importance of the story then is found in Jim's growth as a young man, and the revelations he makes through life experiences. Despite being slow at times, the novel is well-written, and portrays good-natured, honest, characters."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Probably one of the better short character novels written in recent time.Mr. Early has caught the feelings, time and people of this part of NC in a way that, I think, few have ever done. The wonderful relationships between a boy, his mother and uncles is as close to what a truly caring family could ever be.Read this book."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"What a breath of fresh air - a book of deceptive simplicity that probes deeply into concepts like family loyalty, sacrifice and love. Without ever veering into the overly precious, the author conveys a sense of wonder at life's simple pleasures that we in modern times have all but lost. A distinctive authorial voice, and a life-affirming story that never sets off the Hallmark/Chicken Soup alarm. Nicely done."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"A moving tale of boyhood in Depression-ridden North Carolina, simply written and lovingly told with keen insight and description...Life is not easy and it has many twists, turns, and mysteries that unfold as toddlers become boys and boys become young men. This is the story of one year in the life of Jim Glass, Jr--Jim the Boy--between the ages of 10 and 11, how in that one year, he begins to come to a deeper awareness of himself and the beauty, mystery, majesty, and sometimes ugliness, in the world in which he lives--and his place and responsibilities in that world. This is the year in which he begins his journey to manhood.The beginning of Jim's life journey takes us, the reader, back to simpler times in our own life's journey which, if we are honest, weren't so simple afterall. Wonderful and memorable perhaps, but not simple.You will relive moments in your journey as you read about this young man's journey. That's what this book is all about. A good, warm read, one that makes you smile, remember, and feel good. We need these kind once in a while and this is one of the best."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"The book tells of a time when the primary contact was person to person, with the family of Jim The Boy teaching him what he must learn in life. The era was before television, cell phones, ipods, PC's, texting, etc. Raised by his mother and three uncles they as a unit put their arms this boy to raise him into manhood, which on occasion involved the saying of No and punishment, but always with a point to make. I look forward to reading the sequel of Jim's march into adolescence."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Tony Earley has crafted a novel that is simple, yet complex at the same time. Its not written in overly descriptive, flowery language that seems to plague so many novels that are currently being produced.It hearkens back to a time that was more idyllic and colorful.I havent lived in the south, heck- I havent even visited. So, I couldn't tell you how the novel takes on that particular region and culture, and whether or not it is authentic and all that jazz.But I can tell you this: Reading this book (and the sequel, THE BLUE STAR) reminds me a great deal of the stage production \\"Our Town.\\"For me, it captures brief moments in time that are frozen and almost crystalized. Moments that are written with humanity and that have an underlying sadness to them, but still make you want more.I felt that this book was brilliantly written, the style was easy to get in touch with, I liked the characters and had in my mind pictures of them and the little town of Aliceville. A great read and I am so happy that I was able to stumble across this little gem. Wonderful, simply amazing."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This is a good book to read.

It's one of those book as you get into it you want to read more and more. I would recomend this book to anybody, because it is intresting and it's a good way to realx by reading it."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"In Jim the Boy Tony Earley has created a sweet, lyrical, truly affectionate novel that lovingly conveys the coming of age of a 10 year old boy in Depression Era North Carolina.This is a character driven book and Earley proves himself to be a true artist when is comes to the fine--yet undervalued--art of character development. Jim comes across as a genuine 10 year old boy. All too often, in my opinion, young characters in novels are just like kid characters in a movie, where a 24 year old is playing a 14 year old and comes across exactly like a 24 year old portraying a 12 year old.Jim&#65533;s behavior, thought patterns, emotive responses and relationships are those of a 10 year old. That&#65533;s not to say they are primitive or simplistic-they are in fact the complex, mundane, heartwarming genuine aspects of a kids life.The character of Jim would be a success unto itself but Early brings his artistry also to the other characters in this very fine novel. Jim&#65533;s mother and 3 uncles (who are helping to raise the fatherless boy) are equally well crafted. Even the bit players&#65533;a traveling salesman the uncles know, the overpowering yet absent grandfather who has terrorized the family since kingdom-come, the kids in the school yard, are also lovingly crafted.The other thing that marks this book as special is that it lacks The Great Event&#65533;this is the novel of an ordinary boy growing up. T&#65533;s not that there isn&#65533;t hardship&#65533;the boy&#65533;s father is dead, there&#65533;s the tyrannical grandfather, there&#65533;s the usual skirmishes and close calls and so on, but there is nothing here that any ordinary 10 year old wouldn&#65533;t have experienced and dealt with in the normal course of events.Which brings us to this book&#65533;s ultimate&#65533;and extraordinary&#65533;achievement. Jim the Boy is a story that effectively and lovingly demonstrates the extraordinary beauty, dignity and honor intrinsic to the simple living of the ordinary life. The magnificence of ordinary family love, community life, friendship. The fact that decent human beings can create something out of what appears to be not much of anything.That is, the fact that our own lives are filled with beauty and wonder.This is a truly wonderful book EVERYONE in the family can read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"For reasons I can't express, for I don't know the answer, almost every story I write has a boy of about ten as a central character. Maybe it's because pre-adolescent boys are not tangled up in romances. Maybe the fact that they are often brutally honest is something I admire. They tend to be curious to the point of being a pleasant nuisance.Tony Earley's Jim is my kind of kid. I liked his uncles, too. Their adventures were an adventure for me."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Max C. review of Jim the Boy by Tony Earley, March 19, 2008Jim the Boy is a pretty decent book by Tony Earley set in 1924 in Aliceville, North Carolina. Jim starts the book on his 10th birthday. He is very excited because he finally had a two digit age, just like his three uncles [Coran, Al and Zeno]. Jim was without a mother, since he could remember, and when Jim was ten and a half years old, his father died of a heart attack. That forced Jim to live with his three uncles that raised him to probably be a good man. The times of the great depression were very tough on Jim's town. They had awaited electricity for many years, and when they finally got it on Christmas Eve, 1925, it was a historic moment for the whole town. A funny story after that was when Jim tried to baptize baby chicks, he accidentally drowned them instead. On Jim's eleventh birthday, 1925, he went to the hill where his father grew up, which was a very memorable moment for him, and in some way, taught him how to live his life well and to be respected by other people, just like his father. Overall, Jim the Boy was a pretty decent book and is worth your time."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"So this book took me only a day to read which: Awesome because I didn't have a lot of time this month. It was a simple story so I'm not sure what there is to discuss at the book club, I guess we'll have to see. Worth the read, definately G rated so read it to your kids."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This book was recommended to me by a co-worker. I often love to read the recommendations of others, but after this experience I will be more cautious! This book was quite simply one of the more boring books I've ever read. Its simple-minded prose irritated me to the point of distraction. I was grateful for the distraction though, because the prose itself was mind numbing. The chapters could just as well have been titled: &quot;Jim almost meets Ty Cobb!&quot; &quot;Jim Climbs A Tree!&quot; &quot;Jim Gets A Baseball Bat!&quot; and the titles would sum up every piece of action contained. The characters were lifeless and virtually indistinguishable from each other."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim the Boy is a great, thrilling, and exciting book for all ages. It is a very thrilling book about a young boy and hardships on a farm and a very big hardship towards the end of the book. Young Robert is a boy, 12 years of age, almost a man, which he becomes in the end of the book. Something dramatic happens at the end something that will change his life. Rob is a Shaker boy who likes almost every thing bout his religion besides one thing. He can't go to Sunday baseball games because his religion doesn't let him. I encourage you to read this book, you'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll love every page of this amazing book. I know I did."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"After reading Tony Earley's story collection Here We Are in Paradise, I expected a clever and cleverly written first novel, not terribly deep but entertaining. Instead, Jim the Boy is a bland and episodic and schmaltzy tale that never rings true. The book tries so hard to be heartwarming and simple that only a child could take it at face value, and a child that knows nothing about life--and certainly not life in the depression South. A startlingly unambitious and self-congratulatory book, filled with nostalgia for a place that never existed. I can't think of a supposedly literary book with less in it. The prose is supposed to be understated and poignant, but there's nothing underneath it. Jim the Boy is the literary equivalent of The Emperor's New Clothes, and makes the reader ask: what happened to the guy that wrote &quot;Charlotte&quot;?"},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim the Boy is perhaps the worst book I have ever read, excepting The Man in the High Castle. When I unfortunately and forcedly (I had to read it for school) partook in reading this horrible novel, I was at first puzzled. Is this supposed to be making fun of bad books?...Jim the Boy portrays the depression-era South in an idealistic manner: the protagonist (or antagonist) Jim faces little hardship at all. There is even less action, and even less plot than the vicissitudes that Jim endures..."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim the Boy is terribly overrated, with a cast of cardboard characters and a wooden tone. Apparently many critics don't know how to distinguish between spare, basic prose and dumbed-down bad writing. The author is probably laughing his way to the bank, especially now that a sequel has been published. I'll just let them fall all over themselves and take a pass. God forbid there should be a movie forthcoming."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"I bought this book as part of the BOOK OF THE MONTH CLUB and started to read it and put it down after about 30 pages thinking I could never make it through. Then a few days later I picked it up again and finished it. It is one of the slowest reads I have ever read and has a horrible ending. It just sort of ends when there is so much more to be told. But the reedeming quality is in the relationships between Jim and his relatives. If not for that it would have received 1 star."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This is like my first try at writing - over-used plot, short chapters, small vocabulary, typical charachters. This book shows no writing skills whatsoever. Look at its title. &quot;Jim the Boy&quot;. Very original.Yet the dialogues freaked me out the most:&quot;...&quot; Jim said&quot;...&quot; Uncle Coran said&quot;...&quot; said Jim&quot;...&quot; Uncle Zeno said.The word &quot;said&quot; probably has the greatest number of synonyms, but Earley never used any other word.The plot is an &quot;oh so sweet&quot; typical plot that I have seen so many times. Nothing special. No twists to it. A plain, dull, stupid plot. Just another boy without a parent during Depression.I can't even say much about this book, because there's NOTHING in it. If I didn't have to read this book for my school, I would never have read it beyong the 20th page."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This novel might be OK for children, but for grown-ups it's an overly idealized (to put it mildly) fantasy of depression-era Southern life. I kept expecting Andy and Opie to come walking in, carrying their fishing poles; at least something funny might have happened, that way. But this earnest, plodding book about an unbelievably good world is actually kind of an insult to the way southern people really lived in the 1930s, black and white. What was the author thinking?"},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"A big fan of Tony Earley's short stories, I could hardly wait for his first novel to come out. But I was disappointed. Though it is certainly a fine book, it felt a little thin, more like a stringing together of short stories than a novel. Even so, it is a pleasant read. And I like Tony Earley so much that I feel terrible not giving him a better review! I am sure his next book will be awesome."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This book got great reviews when it first came out and the author was named to some fancy lists, but almost everyone I know considers it a big boondoggle. The gimmick is that Earley's working from the conventions of the serious young-adult novel (the cover art and big, round typeface suggest this, but so does the reductive moral tone); the final product, however, isn't fresh enough to be more than an homage. Perhaps the difficulty is that Earley doesn't try to do anything very ambitious with his source material. One subplot, about a widow who chooses loneliness over remarriage, seems far too psychobabblish for the period, but another, about a child with polio, works well enough.Yes, the prose is mostly lovely, and the short chapters are elliptical enough to invite contemplation, but the conclusions suggested tend toward the commonplace-true but obvious banalities such as \\"childhood is a time of innocence\\" and \\"goodness is its own reward.\\" So though the medium is more elegant than the sanctimonious novels we devoured as kids, the message about what you'd get from a full season of \\"Little House.\\" And when Jim leaves his precious baseball glove in the lap of the sleeping polio boy, it's time to chuck the whole gooey contraption out the window of the jalopy."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Earleys' rendering of a Perfect Past has it's attractions andcharms, and is in many ways endearing, as long as the reader remembersthat there was never a time in either their life or the life of anyone they know when such earnest happiness and satisfyingly extended good- will ruled the day. Suspension of disbelief is the best advice before perusing these pages.Early evokes the simple tale of a boy being raised by his mother and four uncles in such a poetically sustained way--sure language, spare cadences, a sharp ear for knowing when stop a description-- that you forgive the over ripe sentimentality that is at the heart of this book.The success, I think, is in the author's ability to describe Jim's point of view in a straight forward manner, free of seeming authorial intrusion: Jim and the others, particularly the Uncles, emerge as credible characters, each with their particular character ticks and quirks. This set of relationships, balanced and relatively sober, almost makes up for the sheer mysticism that Earley wants to cast on rural South Carolina during the 30s.There is something subtly fake about this beguilingly transparent coming-of-age story, a Disney tale for the the Postmodern period, a reverse Alice Walker, a past that is re-assembled into a more perfect union.Needless to say, I'm ambivilent about the tale and the telling, but it is a tribute to Earley's art that his debut novel resonates as well as it does."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim the Boy by Tony Earley is a wonderful novel...beautifully written, poetic without being overblown or contrived, moral without being preachy. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This was very much an \\"eh\\" read to me. I certainly didn't dislike it, but neither did I fall in love with the characters, the scenery, the plot... anything.I liked some characters, but those characters were the ones who seemed the most glossed over. In all fairness, the character I wanted to know the most about would not have helpful in the \\"lesson\\" of the novel: the world is large, but that no matter how small you feel, you're still a large part of the world to someone. In order to learn that the world is large, characters have to come and go... the character I found the most interesting (Whitey, who proposes to Jim's mother and is rejected) has to move out of the scene... and this teaches Jim a lesson, right?The ending was fairly pat, even for a YA novel. I don't know that I had expected anything else, given the majority of the book, but I think I held out a little bit of hope.All in all, it was a good read for someone interested in coming of age novels set in a specific time frame (Great Depression era) and locale (small North Carolina town). For a reader drawn to powerfully written characters rather than flowery descriptions of surroundings, it likely will do for you what it did for me."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This is a book about a boy growing up on a farm, and near a small town, under difficult circumstances, but with a lot of love surrounding him. Jim is a real boy, not perfect, and sometimes does the wrong thing, but he has his uncles there to help guide him toward adulthood. This is not at all a book just for children; in fact, parents may appreciate it most of all."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"I'll make this short and sweet: buy this book. Buy it for yourself, your child, your parent. There is something here for everyone, not the least of which is the sheer pleasure of reading this story. I would cheerfully give up a limb to be able to write like this man does. A slender book with so much to give - buy this book!!!!"},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"&quot;Jim the Boy&quot; was an alright read however I think that I was expecting something written more for adults and I felt this book was geared towards adolescents over adult readers. It is a really good story-line, however, didn't really make my brain work too much while reading it. What I really liked about the book was the simplistic lifestyle that was described, somewhat similar to that of my late grandfather. So, that was a nice little fictional peak into what it was like for my grandfather growing up in that time period."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim the Boy was so highly recommended that I couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately I felt as if I had gone to a fine restaurant to eat a gourmet meal and discovered fast food on my plate. There were certainly moments that made reading the book worthwhile but I came away hungry."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"After reading Tony Earley's exciting stories in Here We Are in Paradise, I expected a much stronger first novel. In fact, Jim the Boy barely counts as a first adult novel. The book seems to have been written for younger children (its simplistic piety would insult teenage readers.) It's sentimental to the extreme, giving us an idyllic depression South that never existed, comforting as it might feel to some readers. There's no coherent storyline, just a string of events with no tension. The writing is supposed to be luminous and understated but is just painfully plain, with nothing under the surface. It's the literary equivalent of the Emperor's new clothes. A great disappointment."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"A fine little book. Not in the same league as 'To Kill a Mockingbird', not as cerebrally satisfying as Flannery O'Connor, but very well-written and lovingly crafted. As I read, pleasant images from my own rural southern childhood kept intruding - not a criticism, but a commentary on the author's aptitude for capturing the south as it truly was before most of it became a suburb of Atlanta.This should appeal to all ages, and especially to anyone who enjoys watching Andy Griffith re-runs."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This book originally came to my attention when I saw it in Publisher's Weekly. Now that I've read it, I'm stumped by their recommendation. Until I saw (to my shock) so many reviews here, I would have said this book has no life outside of maybe a writer's workshop. Even the publisher seems resigned to not selling the book, based on the horrendous cover they stuck on it. Who would look at that and pick it up?I mention writer's workshops because that's all I can think of when I read this: an author aware of but not absolutely in command of techniques and styles, playing with language like a toy, to the detriment of character and story. In one scene where Jim and his uncle pull into the big city of Charlotte in the middle of the night, he writes, &quot;Streetcars floated all around them. The streetcars were sound asleep, and Jim hoped the truck wouldn't wake them up.&quot; Jim's ten years old. He is too old to believe streetcars might really &quot;wake up,&quot; and too young to think metaphorically/poetically. That's the author's voice. He frequently puts things into his characters minds and mouths that don't belong there, and all it serves to do is distance the reader.The situation did get better once Jim got into school. I suspect playground politics are familiar to all of us, and those parts came more naturally. Also the moments just before Jim figures out that his uncles are only teasing him about one thing or another are always quite nice. There's a lot of potential with this family, and the scenes that do work well only make me wish he'd taken me deeper into them, without the book itself getting in the way.Ultimately it's a not-unpleasant book, with the biggest problem being the constant awareness of the author's hand. He was an extra character in every scene (Like that Visa commercial, I could hear his voice saying, &quot;What I was trying to do here was...&quot;), and he kept me from really getting inside the story. I hadn't thought of it as children's literature until so many reviewers mentioned it, but maybe that's really what it should be."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Childhood memories are some of the strongest sensory feelings anyone will ever have. When we were kids we knew how we felt, we just couldn't always determine why we felt that way and couldn't possibly put our complicated feelings into words.In &quot;Jim the Boy&quot; Tony Earley takes universal childhood emotions of pride, jealousy, greed and companionship and strikes up a story to rummage through his own memory of childhood complexes. It's been done before--&quot;The Wonder Years&quot; TV show comes to mind--but Earley doesn't play for laughs here. Rather he takes a grown-up's understanding and experience of the world and latches it onto the illuminating eye of a child.Earley succeeds in creating a quick, nimble book that, even though it's set in 1924, could have happened yesterday."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"A friend recommended Earley's Jim the Boy to me because I am from North Carolina and I happened to mention to her that the book's sequel was recently reviewed in the Times. I was hoping to like it; even though I have lived in NYC for fifteen years, I still visit NC regularly and love to read novels set there.I can see the charm of the book. Jim is a very likable character, and I definitely cared what happened to him throughout the book. But the other characters are seriously underdeveloped. The three uncles seem interchangeable (my friend says that is the point) and the mother is mostly a cipher. The letter she writes to her dead husband hints at a powerful emotional life, one that Earley doesn't focus on beyond the letter.What I most found objectionable about the book is the smugness of it.There is an unpleasant condescension about how wholesome and clean these characters are. The implication of the book seems to be that the characters are the salt of the earth and anyone who doesn't really care to live this life doesn't understand what is important. Perhaps I am projecting on what is simply a spare coming of age story. Still, it left a bad taste in my mouth.Anyway, I will probably still read the sequel. I do agree with Earley that Willa Cather rocks."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This book is fantastic!! Jim the Boy is a quick, light-hearted and easy read that reminds us all of our youth and of the days when our world was as big as our backyard. This is a sweet story that follows ten-year-old Jim as he discovers the wonderful, confusing and sometimes sad world that exists beyond his uncles' cornfields. No violence, no swearing, just a sweet, entertaining story with a few good lessons woven within. And a bittersweet ending that makes you close the book with a smile and a sigh."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"The only flaw I could find in this wonderful novel of Tony Earley's is that it was too short! Or rather, to phrase it in a way that doesn't sound critical of the author, I liked the place that this novel took me and, especially, the people I met there so much that not only could I not put it down, i didn't want it to end. This is a wonderful story about a young boy growing up among people who, while not perfect, are fundamentally decent and kind. this is a nice change from so many other products of our modern culture, from novels to Hollywood films, which explore all the various permutations of dysfunction. while exploring what is wrong with human nature is certainly a valid literary exercise, Tony Earley has done something wonderful in bringing to life characters whom we like and even admire. Jim's mother and uncles are simple people who work hard, sometimes play hard, and exercise compassion when confronted by the misfortune of others. These are the values they teach to young Jim, who is just beginning to realize that there is a wider world full of things he has yet to experience. Part of me wanted the author to continue Jim's story, but another part of me hopes he never Hollywood-izes his wonderful novel by writing a sequel. At a time when our nation is in the throes of grief about the events of September 11 and anxiety about the future, and in an age where despite recent examples of heroism the worst of human behavior is vividly on display, &quot;Jim the Boy&quot; was good medicine for this reader and I suspect it will be for others as well. I read this as an audiobook, so I must close by praising narrator L. J. Ganser for doing such a great job. To me, this book was just about perfect; I just wish there had been more of it."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This is a pleasant, rather hokey coming-of-age tale that seems addressed to kids of 11 or 12, not to grownups. I don't understand why this isn't being marketed as a children's book, as it really has little to hold an adult reader's interest. The plot is very familiar and sentimental, and the writing is clear, uncluttered, and plain but not interesting in its own right. Buy it for your school-age son, but not for your father."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim The Boy reminds me of nly a hanful of other classic novels -- Dandelion Wine and Boy's Life among them. This is a gem, not to be missed."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"An involving story of a boy growing up in rural America. Jim is not perfect, and sometimes does the wrong thing, but he tries to make up for it, and has his memorable uncles to help guide him to adulthood. Parents are likely to appreciate this book even more than children, although it would be enjoyable (and appropriate) reading for twelve years old and up."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Okay, I admit that nostalgia plays a big role in my enjoyment of this book. The small town innocence is evocative of my own experience growing up, although not in North Carolina. I was lucky enough to have my dad until just recently but I also had three uncles who played similar roles to Jim's uncles. And, there were other parallels too. But, primarily, the craft of storytelling is immediately obvious here and is what made this novel most fulfilling. Development of character, smooth plotting and careful choice of words are evident. Certainly not least, the author likes his characters. Don't let the simplicity of the narrative lead you to think this story is simplistic. Jim experiences some major life lessons along the way and manages to capture just enough from each episode to help him along. We should all be so lucky."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"I've seen many books in my life but not one as good and wholesome as Jim the Boy. After reading the few reviews saying it's suitable only for children I felt I must disagree with them and agree with the majority saying how wonderful it is. Jim the Boy is a heart warming tale for everyone. True, it is suitable for children but it's also a book that you as an adult can read without being disgusted by the language and graphic details most authors use today. What a few would call suitable only for children I feel is calling as an adult. It is a tale so clean and simple that it makes one yearn for more. Jim the boy is a book that is for everyone and will quickly become a classic, rivaling Charlotte's Web and Where the Red Fern Grows. Keep writing Mr. Earley and Thank you for Jim the Boy."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"When I first starting reading this book, I thought the life of these characters was just too wonderful. How can anyone's life be this plain and perfect. But that's the attraction and what makes this story seem like a sweet story from the distant past when things were so much more calmer and families really stayed together. If we could only all show so much innocense and love for each other today.\\"Jim the Boy\\" tells the story of a young boy named Jim, coming of age, in a very remote and peaceful North Carolina town. It's 1934 and during the depression. Jim's father has been dead 10 years now, and his 3 wonderful uncles are now his mentors, who deeply care for Jim and their sister Cissy. The story from this point on tells of Jim's everyday adventures, and feelings while growing up.Tony Earley's beautiful descriptions of this time period, small town life, and everyday surroundings are indeed poetic. It's like a breath of fresh air in the countryside, and I mean rural countryside. It's nice to settle back, relax, and fantazise about an earlier peaceful time when people lived so differently than we do now. A truly wonderful book."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim the Boy follows young Jim Glass throughout the year following his 10th birthday. The son of a man who died before he was born, Jim is living with his mother and under the care of his unmarried uncles. He moves about Aliceville, North Carolina as he begins to expand his world, a new school and new friends,athe first baseball glove and a chance &quot;encounter&quot; with Ty Cobb. He also is more aware of his family, beginning to look at them, seeing the struggle his mother has with raising a son on her own, his uncles gentle understanding (and their lives outside their care of him) and a expanding knowledge of his father's childhood up in the hills. There are also glimpses of the depression, the social strata, and the expansion of technology into small town life. The characters are all well drwan,and believable, true to the small town roots without being cloying or condensending. I think this is a book for all ages, a true treasure."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Tony Earley's novel Jim the Boy is simply the best novel I have read so far this year. Its beautifully shaped chapters, wonderfully spare language, clearly wrought characters, and heart breaking poignancy, show real craft. I can't wait to re-read it, savour it, and share it."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Tony Earley's &quot;Jim the Boy&quot; is a pitch-perfect, marvelously told story of Jim Glass, Jr.'s tenth year of life in remote Aliceville, North Carolina during the early part of the Great Depression. This is an elegant, direct novel, written from the point-of-view of the ten-year old who is just beginning to glimpse at the challenges and perplexing questions with which adults grapple throughout their lives. It is a poignant novel as well, reminding us that simple truths which revolve around family life ring majestically and timelessly. It is a testimonial to the dignity of the human condition, as well, as the novel's protagonist, his mother and her three brothers (who become surrogate fathers to Jim) understand, without ever saying so, that a strong family can withstand poverty, deprivation, and even the most cruel circumstance...the loss of a husband and father.Earley's style is somewhat epigramatic, each chapter containing not only action which advances the plot, but a moral epiphany that encourages Jim's social and personal growth. These growing awarenesses, however, are not pat or false in emotional tone. Jim's three uncles assume their responsibilities to their sister and her son with quiet dignity and resolve; Jim's mother has suffered terribly with the loss of her one love in life, and in a series of remarkable scenes and letters, she shows her commitment to her life's decisions with enormous impact.Jim, too, must confront some of the baser parts of his personality. When competitive drive leads him to become arrogant and at times insensitive to the needs of others, his uncles, by word and action, instruct him to the ways of modesty and interdependence. As well, Jim is forced to confront family ghosts and the spectre of polio directly, but only when his family considers him both ready and required to do so.I think &quot;Jim the Boy&quot; could be read by both children and adults with equal, but incredibly different results. It is a novel with universal appeal and impact."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"&quot;Jim the Boy&quot; is not the deepest or the most technically well-written novel I have ever read. But I still found it hard to put down. I enjoyed it. A lot of other reviewers have commented that it is &quot;only suitable for children&quot; (I suppose because it has no... violence, or 4-letter words?) Actually, I am not sure children would understand Jim's feelings at the end of the novel - I think they are something you have to have passed out of childhood to understand. I have to admit I welcomed a book where I knew no graphic... scenes would &quot;sneak up&quot; on me.... Life is more than that! &quot;Jim the Boy&quot; is very simply and sparely written. The style is almost flat. But I think that is suitable for the subject matter - the story of the life of a boy, a boy for whom seeing the ocean is a big thing, a boy who has never really traveled out of his small town. The sketchiness of the story and the characters in a way work for it. In a way, it is like memories: do you remember every dinner you ate as a child? Every school day? No, and neither does this novel. And the book points out something really very important: our lives, after all, are defined by the apparently-small moments. Eating a piece of apple. Throwing a ball and hitting someone. Climbing a tree. We may think we are better or more sophisticated than Jim, but ultimately, we are not."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim The Boy is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a very exciting and wonderful book. I really wished it never ended. I read Jim the Boy with my mom. Jim the Boy is a novel, fiction. I really enjoyed it. Jim the Boy is about a boy growing up in North Carolina in a town called Aliceville during the depression. His father's name was Jim also, but he died a few days before &quot;Jim the boy&quot; was born. His beloved uncles who helped to raise him were Uncle Coran, Uncle Al and Uncle Zeno, and they were some of the main characters along with Jim's mom and his wicked grandfather. Three situations that I thought were important were when electricity came to his town for the first time, when his best friend got polio, and when the train first made a stop at Aliceville because the towns people named it after the conductor's daughter. I really, really hope that Tony Earley writes another book about Jim the boy as Jim grows older."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"I appreciate Tony Earley's craft, his simple, yet keen prose, masterfully guided. Yet, Jim the Boy is a novel in which lofty, sentimentalized ideals outweigh and ultimately obscure the characters. What resonated with me after reading the book was the unrecognizable face of Jim as a real boy."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Life during the Great Depression was harsh. We see it through the eyes of a ten year old, boy, Jim. Yet the simplistic rigors or farm life lend strength, discipline, and tenacity to this little boy coming of age in Aliceville, North Carolina. His widowed mother and three endearing uncles help Jim face the turning points in his life with courage. The illness of a friend, the coming of electricity, and the marriage proposal his mother receives expands his world, and his adventures in a different local begin anew. Through his eyes, we remember ourselves as children, and easily identify with his perceptions. Touching and engaging."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Tony Earley once told me, &quot;Anyone can use a long, fancy word. I'd rather use simple language and do something fancy with it.&quot; In his debut novel, Jim the Boy, Earley accomplishes this goal. His language is admirably straightforward, yet his metaphors are complex and carefully constructed. The historical and cultural backdrop of the novel, Depression-era North Carolina, is accurately and compassionately portrayed. The characters of the book are richly developed; I hope to hear more of their stories in Earley's future work. Jim the Boy is a breath of fresh air in the literary atmosphere. I reccomend it to readers of all ages and interests."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"With authentic characters that readers can relate to on a number of levels, Jim the Boy speaks speaks to close knit families and friends. Although Jim's biological father passed before he was born, he is in no way deprived of care and guidance through one of the most difficult stages in life: adolescence. Serving as admirable father figures, Jim's uncles pass down morals and values that readers can easily see in themselves. Jim's ambition, kindness, and will to explore life shines all throughout the text, and can easily connect with and influence adolescent readers.Although this text touches readers with it's sentimental, yet comical dialog, I found myself somewhat left hanging and wanting to know more in the end. Did Penn die or are we to assume that he was just ill for a long period of time? Did Jim get polio also? - there's indication that he could have had it. Does his grandfather realize that it is Jim that's visiting him or is he so sick that he has no way of knowing? - the author seems to leave it up for the reader to decide. Aside from these loose ends, I find adolescents would enjoy this text and like myself, won't want to put it down because it's that engaging and relateable!"},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim the Boy is a novel about a ten year old boy coming of age during the great depression. At first, I enjoyed the descriptive language and innocence portrayed by our young protagonist. However, I found the pace of the story moved too slow, there was no suspense in the plot, and the characters had no real depth.The real highlight of the story is the relationship between Jim and his three uncles. There is a true bond between the four characters that is touching and poignant since Jim lost his father before he was born. Jim's world is widening around him after he realizes he is growing up and sees the large world around him; a new school is being built, electricity is being introduced into his small town, and he has begun working on the crops with his uncles. Later in the novel Jim eventually finds out more about his father and there is a moment when he looks down on his hometown of Aliceville and leaves his childhood behind.Although the story does not compare to the classic coming of age story of Huck Finn, it has it's moments of tenderness and endearment."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This book just feels good. Well written with strong characters. Each of the short stories is involved enough to take you away for awhile, but short enough to enjoy when you need a quick reading fix.This book may be suitable for children, but what a shame to classify it as a children's book. It should be on everyone's must read list.It's not a \\"feel good book\\", but everyone I have shared it with says they feel good after reading it."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"In 1930s small-town North Carolina, the story starts on the day Jim turns ten; he is being raised by his widowed mother and her three unmarried brothers, the Uncles, two of whom are twins. Over the course of the next year he makes a good friend and rival; watches unobserved as his mother refuses a suitor; and learns more about his father, another Jim, who died shortly before Jim the Boy's birth.The style is one of unmannered simplicity; the freshness of Jim's perceptions become fresh for us too. As pointed out in an earlier review, one of the story's most striking moments is when he first sees the big city of Charlotte, \\"Two thoughts came to Jim at once, joined by a thread of amazement: he thought,People live here, and he thought, They don't know who I am.\\" Most importantly, none of the situations are from stock. Yes, he encounters danger, but it doesn't turn out as expected; yes, he finally \\"meets\\" his father's estranged father, but the encounter is not what you were expecting.Though it's hackneyed to say so, Jim the Boy really is one of those novels which you might call \\"a book for young readers,\\" if that includes anybody who remembers being young. It is sweet, but not cloying; and, more importantly, and unlike some fiction nowadays, you can believe every word."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"After reading this book all you can say is WOW. Jim the boy is a story of an young boy in his tenth year of life in the 1930's. In story Jim shows bravery, honesty, and you see as a friend. The story captures you in a way that is unexpected. As you read of the Jim's 10th year of his life you feel as if you are Jim. Tony Earley has produced a beautiful, easy to read book that you won't want to put it down. So if you're looking for a good book to read I greatly suggest you read this."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"The style used in this book goes back to a simpler time when books seemed to be more about the story than the language used. The very style lends itself particularly well in this case as it helps in developing the imagery of the characters and their situation"},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"and this book fits that description to a &quot;T&quot;. Jim may have lost his father, but his uncles' love and devotion to him more than fill the gap. A splendid story depicting the value of family and the love that can only be found in a home."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"This is the most thoroughly satisfying and engrossing book I've read for a long time. Writing simply is a difficult task to undertake, and doesn't work every time, the charm being lost in the transition. Some writers do &quot;simple,&quot; self-consciously -- &quot;Look at me, Ma, I'm writing simply and starkly.&quot; Tony Earley invests his best work with the kind of elegance and grace that makes you wish you could write like him. &quot;Jim&quot; is pure pleasure."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"Jim the Boy is a great book. It tells the story of a normal life, not an adventure you will never go on. It is about a boy growing up with his family and having to live with the fact that his father has died. It takes place during the Great Depression. Very important new things are brought to his town, like electricity. One of the things I think Jim learns is that life is not perfect. This book shows that the world is not always nice, but that there are still nice things. I think this book is one of those nice things."},{"Title":"Jim the Boy","review":"The year is 1934. A new school is under construction in Aliceville in order to consolidate five disparate one and two room school houses. Convict crews are manually digging post holes along a state route in advance of electricity coming to this North Carolina community. Polio is still an uncontrolled blight upon the national landscape. The story opens on Jim Glass's tenth birthday and chronicles a full year of Jim's life experiences: those mostly small, ordinary, and subtle developments typical of growing-up. Herein lies the value of Tony Earley's first novel.Most readers of this book will not relate to the Depression-era world of young Jim. New Carpenter, North Carolina is an hour away - 30 miles distant - at the average truck's normal speed. Television is far enough in the future that it's absence does not even register on the reader's consciousness. At the same time, however, Jim Glass shares the same psychological changes and the full range of emotional expression and trauma that children do today. This book reminds us that healthy growth and development depend more on a loving environment than it does on a sophisticated, technologically advantaged one; that boys and girls are not as different in their needs and thoughts as parents and youngsters might imagine if they judged decades by their differences in clothes, hair-styles, cultures, and socio-economic circumstances.Tony Earley's effort is not plot driven, nor is it fueled by literary pyrotechnics. It is episodic; evidencing an understated, yet unambiguous moral sensitivity; and characterized by clear, precise, and concise prose. Readers will find it, curiously enough, a &quot;page-turner.&quot; Such quiet, pastoral works often find themselves, at the end of the day, listed among a reader's all-time favorite books. JIM THE BOY was the &quot;cover story&quot; in a June 2000 edition of THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW. There it was reviewed very favorably in the most adult terms for an adult reading public. The author deliberately aimed this book though at a younger audience: the wide-ranging young-adult market. At the end of his novel, Earley references and recommends a few classic children's works of great import to him. For example, he highlights MY ANTONIA, and THE YEARLING to name just a couple. I think JIM THE BOY is an excellent candidate for many high-school required reading lists and is an ideal choice for many adult reading groups. Whether yesterday, today, or tomorrow: boys will always be boys."},{"Title":"Silver Seeds: A Book Of Nature Poems (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I saw this book displayed in a book store &amp; I was with my kids.

Not only is it beautifully put together, but it served as a reminder of the horrifying, heinous crime committed on all of the innocent people at the WTC and the Pentagon.

No, 5 stars is my thanks for the delicate and tasteful, yet powerful and moving manner in which this most tragic moment in our nations history was recorded. LIFE exceeded its own reputation with the content and speedy publication of this chronicle - so we may never forget."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"The book reviews the events of 9.11 and looks at their impact on the nation primarily through it's impact on the victims and those who responded to the events.The book works on the one hand as, is often the case with the Life books of this genre, the photography is excellent and well scaled. There is enough to convey the impact and scope of the attacks without engendering sensory overload. The use of a news ticker like format in the photo section is effective in that it provides identification and context sufficient to the need without detracting from the power of the photography.The best part of the book, however, is the second half which is basically broken into three parts: A section that concentrates on the victims in the planes and buildings, a section that concentrates on those who responded to the events, and a third sort of Big picture/Summary section.The vignettes in the second half show the wider impact and effect of the events, as well as the national, racial and ethnic diversity of the victims and those who responded. The stories are long enough to get the picture of individual circumstances and numerous enough to communicate the scale of the tragedy without overwhelming the emotional senses to much.My wife gave me this for Christmas and I went through it pretty thoroughly then and have returned to look over it in snippets from time to time since. A lot is going on now with the war on terrorism and the return, somewhat, to politics as normal on a national stage and going back for a peak serves to remind what sacrifices are needed and necessary. This book communicates the big picture and if there is one thing we cannot do at this point, it's lose track of the big picture."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"What has (...) me off the most since September 11 is how people have been exploiting this tragedy for their own purpose -- the make money. From people selling picture or T-shirts with the twin towers displayed to the current slate of books showing the tragedy in grainy photos, it's nice to turn to someone like Time-Life and get a broad panorama of images to put things into perspective while simultaneously giving us gentle reminders of what happened and where we are today."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"LIFE has done a first class job of putting together a book covering this horrific act by such a cowardly enemy.Rather than to make the Americans cower as these fanatics probably thought and probably thought and hoped for;it showed what a good and strong nation it is.History will remember both 9/11 and Pearl Harbor for the terrible and misguided acts of hatred they were.This act conjours up different thoughts for everyone who witnessed it ,in whatever fashion,but no more so than those who had friends and particularly those who lost loved ones.To those who may turn a little soft on the War on Terror a review of this book should remind one of what we are dealing with.A great book TIME and thanks."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"There are scores of books on the shelves attempting to encapsulate the images of our darkest day in history, but LIFE always did have a unique and moving way to capture these events.

I do not agree with a reader from New York, that America should close its borders because of this. Maybe America should exempt some people from entering, but not all, since the beginning of colonization America has welcomed immigrants from all over the world. Unless you are a native American, all other people have once been immigrants. I am from the Netherlands, and it was the Dutch who founded New Amsterdam, as New York was then called. So the Dutch have a strong feeling about New York in general. I have visited New York twice, and I also visited the Twin Towers twice. When I first heard about the attacks, I wanted to check the internet but it was jammed. When it was time to go home, I even got a speeding ticket. I wanted to get home as fast as I could. Last week I have seen a lot of programmes on tv, regarding the aniversary of the attacks. Every time I see the planes hit the towers, or when the buildings come down, or people jump out of the windows, it always makes me cry. So please remember not only Americans are touched by this event, but also other people around the world, and the closing of the borders is not a solution of terrorist attacks. I myself have always wanted to immigrate to the US, and that feeling has even been stronger since 9-11-01. Though it seems America doesn't have many friends at this moment around the world, the only thing I can say for myself is that I am a friend from the USA and I know a lot of people who are also friends from the US.I will always be a friend."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"This publication is absolutely beautiful. The stories, the pictures they all capture the unthinkable events of 9/11. I would recommend this book highly!"},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"This book, (...) really have done a great job with photographs and stories of September 11, 2001. This is mainly a good picture book.

This book deals beautifully with what was a very painful and tragic day for all of us... and it is a must-have for ALL Americans, for ALL time! The imagery is awesome and sometimes disturbing... but we should be disturbed, and we should NEVER forget! To forget the day... is to forget the huge loss of life. This book not only immortalizes the significance of the events of September 11th, but it immortalizes those who were lost and those who lost, those who were heroes and those who continue heroic efforts on a daily basis. LIFE has done a great job of balancing the tragedy of that day, with the hope for the future. So... as we move forward... and you begin to slip back into a sense of complacency... open this book... look at the pictures and read the words... and I am sure that it will once again seal your resolve to treasure every moment and to continue striving to make the world a better place."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"Pictures.

This book will help you to never forget what happened to them and us."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"This book made me cry all over again. This is an important book for all generations. It helps us to never forget the horrific events of September 11, 2001, and we should never be allowed to forget. There were so many souls that were tragically lost that day. We must never forget them or the families they left behind. This act has affected all mankind, and it is a loss we will all feel for a very long time to come.Life, I applaud you for putting out such a wonderful book. I will display it proudly along with my flag. Less, I ever forget."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"It is a beautiful book. Horrific, unforgettable images and a lot of tragic emotions. I would not mind to see a bit less of the American point of view, less sentimentality and more universal view, but that's only my opinion. Overall, it's a keeper."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"The events of 9-11 are still unfolding 8 years later. Scientists from BYU and the University of Copenhagen have recently completed a well-researched and comprehensive analysis of nano-thermite found within numerous samples taken on and shortly after 9-11. NIST only recently completed their investigation of Building 7, and concluded that fire, alone, caused this 47-story building to freefall (in the exact same manner as an engineered implosion) at 5:20 pm on 9-11. NIST refuses to analyze samples for explosive materials (even after the recent confirmation of presence at the scene of this horrific crime). This book, like the media, does not include these uncomfortable facts...but these facts must be known by every caring citizen of this Nation. Our future depends upon the public taking the time to educate themselves."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"This book has the best photos I have seen of the WTC disaster, and as I stood 400 ft. east of the North Tower for much of that morning, I feel I can make this claim with some justification. But I truly offended by the mindnumbing IDIOCY of the title! \\"America Remembers September 11\\" is the kind of title one invents for a book on Pearl Harbor, the Lusitania, or Pickett's Charge! It's as if, despite the fact that the September 11 attacks happened less than 3 months before this book was published, we're to treat these events as golden memories, buffered in nostalgia & already well integrated into our collective unconscious/national psyche: another scary time where, in retrospect, \\"everything turned out all right\\"! I get the impression that, unfortunately, like many other public forums and figures, Life wants us to think that everything is \\"back to normal\\", and we can go back to ignoring the rest of the world. The danger is still very real, and the deeper reasons for the attacks (I.E. \\"why did they do this to us!?!?) have barely even been voiced as yet, and not at all understood. Now is not time for \\"back to normal\\"!I watched at least 4 people fall 1000 ft. to their deaths from the top of the north tower that morning, and that ain't no \\"golden memory\\". Although I'm looking forward to a relief from the pain of my memories, I DO NOT expect and I hope to God I don't feel \\"normal\\" ever again. At least, I don't want meet the profile of \\"normal\\" as conceived by the sleazebags who came up with this title.I've only read a bit of the text, I confess, but it appears to be of the same tenor as the title. I may get a black marker and blot out the title and the text, leaving only the photos, which are really GREAT. Barring this, I'm going to carry the book around with me, and shove it up the \\"nose\\" (this is a substituted word used to get this review in print!) of the first editor of Life I meet!"},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"Wonderful experience. Seller worked out all the details with me and I was so pleased with the purchase. Would definitely refer others to him and also buy from him again. Thanks so much."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"A worthy tribute. Be prepared, however, to open up this book and be taken right back to the shock, grief and pain of September 11. It is hard to believe that we lived through it, and the book is a way to further absorb some of these huge events at whatever pace is right for you. Amazing photos taken inside the World Trade Center during the evacuation, as well as the heroic rescue workers (including the canine heros). Nothing overly graphic. Very well put together, as we would expect from Life Magazine."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"As of now, this book, along with the book &quot;September 11, 2001&quot; by Magnum Photographers are the two standouts (actually, I give the edge to the Magnum book, if only because those photos are closest to what I actually witnessed that day). Further, the Magnum book is filled with accounts from the photographers themselves, which I prefer over half-page &quot;essays&quot; by the literary upper-crust who are always trying to put things &quot;into perspective&quot; for us. If you need Frank Deford and Maya Angelou (or ANYBODY) to put this atrocity into perspective, you're seriously impaired. The writing in One Nation is merely &quot;filler,&quot; something to suggest editorial effort was expended . This is a picture book and, for my taste, I would have appreciated a simple essay in the front, perhaps a reprint of Rudy's address to the United Nations or Bush's address before Congress, followed by nothing but the progression of events. Regardless, if you want want a document of 9-11, this is certainly one of the better ones. As for writing, check out the piece by Christopher Hitchens in the December 2001 Vanity Fair and anything written by Thomas L. Friedman on The NY Times Op-ed page. One thing the Magnum book does that I actually found moving (something this book doesn't do), is include at the end a series of dramatic photos of the Trade Center as they were, in all their majesty. That said, one thing One Nation does that none of the other books do is include a color-coded graphic of ground zero, showing which buildings fell, which buildings were compromised, and which buildings still stand."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"I picked this book up to read now, 9 months after the attacks of September 11th and found myself becoming choked up all over again. The photos are of course of the highest quality of composition and emotion, as you would expect from Life Magazine. The illustrated timeline brings the day back into focus, and now that time has given some distance, allows us to look anew at how the day unfolded. But of course, in any kind of tragedy, it is the human elements that have the most impact - and this book presents that excellently. Stories of heroism, tragedy, chance, determination and sadness brought tears to my eyes. The overwhelming shock of the events have worn off for the most part, but these stories remind us of what the day meant to people. The section of photographs of individuals against a stark white background drives home the smallest human element of an overwhelming tableau. The people focused upon are there for a reason, and even though just being there and taking part in the aftermath should be reason enough, most of the subjects have additional connections that ties them all together in a web of tragedy and redemption. This is a book to treasure and to use to show those that come after us what this day meant to America."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"WHAT MAKES IT SO WONDERFUL IS THAT IT STARTS WITH A TIME LINE IN PICTURES OF THE MINUTES PRIOR TO THE ATTACK AND THE SEQUENCE OF HAPPENINGS ABOUT THE MOST HORRIBLE EVENT ON AMERICAN SOIL IN HISTORY.

End Ave. As survivors of the 9/11 World Trade Center Towers tragedy... From our Gateway Plaza apartment, facing the street and 300 yards from the Towers, we helplessly witnessed all from our apartment windows. The closeness of the Towers viewed from our windows - gave an illusion that one could reach out and touch the Towers; their beauty with night lights reaching toward the sky promoted a contemplative emotion.We viewed the planes entering the Towers, the overwhelming inferno, individuals jumping, the collapse of the Towers, the darkness as debris hit our windows with a fury. What occurred over a period of hours, seemed like a much shorter time span. The darkness was darker than an eclipse, darker than the darkest night; and then a momentary hush after the air cleared. Viewing the roof garden one floor below, with the human reaction of looking out to see if someone might be on that roof garden and in need of help. Debris strewn everywhere, recording tape and paper hung from the trees of the garden and oh, so much ash. The momentary hush, whether real or imagined, then the viewing of debris for a second, fantasized that a parade had just passed by on our short street. I now really understand the expression a &quot;feeling of helplessness&quot;, I couldn't fix what had just happened.We vacated our apartment finally at 5:15 p.m. that day, waiting for someone to knock on our door, with only a battery radio to keep us abreast of happenings. &quot;In a New York minute&quot;, we evacuated via the stairwell touched with ash, the result of a first floor door left open. With a few belongings, gathered with a tad of thought of what was being left behind, we stepped out of the door onto the pavement, seeing and standing in ever so much ash &amp; debris, I wanted to turn around and go back to our home. It was one moment of reality in time, I carry to this day.We planned to walk up the East Side, glimpsed the tired fire, police, volunteers, and med techs in our immediate driveway and street, so instead opted to pass through the building in back of the apartment complex. We gained access to the Esplanade walking the short distance to reach the Hudson River North Cove dock. We were escorted to the New Jersey shore via New York Police boat. From the boat deck, we viewed even more damage to the Manhattan skyline, especially noting the zigzag shape of the side of the American Express building, housed in one of the World Financial Center buildings along with the glorious Winter Garden, as well as the fall of World Trade Center Building 7. We were taken to the Jersey City Hospital, attended to by compassionate staff. Then traveled by National Guard truck to Hoboken, NJ where we were housed by a wonderful family who with great trust welcomed strangers to their home.On Friday 9/14, our eldest son &amp; daughter-in-law drove from New Hampshire via New Jersey routes to Hoboken for transport us to New Hampshire for temporary residence with our daughter, who along with her friend and our youngest son, greeted us with open arms &amp; the overwhelming feeling of not wanting to let go with each hug that followed. Our daughter and son had spent that Friday in New Hampshire collecting items of clothing and necessities which the Concord community generously opened their hearts and donated by churches, stores, individuals, employers, American Red Cross, et al.One of our grandchildren -- he was 8 at that time - arrived home from a few days with his Dad. He hugged us so tight, understanding the depth of 9/11 events for someone so young and yet so wise. He told Grandpa &amp; Babcia that he had something for them... his Mom was not even aware of his gift. He had spoken to his classmates about his grandparents' closeness in location of the World Trade Center Towers. Presented to us was a large envelope full of hand-made cards from each of his classmates. And if that isn't love and caring, I don't know what is - from the hearts and minds of children!Residing now in New Hampshire, not because of 9/11 drove us away, but circumstances just went that way as we continue to put our lives into perspective.We Miss - New York City deeply; events found nowhere else in the USA, the introduction to &amp; interaction with so many wonderful cultures. There isn't a day or night over these years that we do not think of 9/11... the Lady of Liberty &amp; Ellis Island both on the merge of the East and Hudson Rivers. And that Lady of Liberty wept, I just know it, &amp; still stands with pride that the USA is a democracy that will prevail.We Remember - the victims, the survivors, their friends and families, the workers from the public and private sector, the volunteers, our neighbors in Gateway Plaza and staff in the small group of stores on South End Avenue, Battery Park City.We Remember - the places we visited, the book signings attended, the celebrities we met, the concerts and theater plays, the movies, the arts, the parks, the strangers we talked with, on streets, on subway and those while standing in line for an event...We Remember - Always In Our Hearts, Forever In Our Souls, Heroes, Victims, Survivors One and All... We Were There.Painfully, the lump in my throat and the twist in my stomach, the tears in my eyes and the pain in my heart, to the depth of my soul, forever reside."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"This is a fabulous book of pictures and stories of 9/11.

ONE NATION appears to have more pages and a different cover -- due, I'm sure, to the differences in pub dates. The hardcover version, ONE NATION, would/ will last longer than the paperback, as my binder is already showing wear.A must for anyone who wants to teach their children, a friend, a traveler, or remind yourself, what happened this day -- and why it still brings us to tears.As DVD companions, the \\"IN MEMORIAM -- NEW YORK CITY, 9/11/01\\" and \\"9/11 - THE FILMAKERS' COMMEMORATIVE EDITION\\" come with my HIGHEST recommendations. I grew up in Manhattan, and though have not lived there for many years, that old saying goes -- once a New Yorker, always a New Yorker.

Some call it abusing the publishing arena to make bank account rather than the account. First we need a record of this account whether the material is for profit, since we all will profit from this for many reasons and lessons. Our history has been altered, can you imagine if people forgot about Pearl Harbor. I was at Pearl Harbor December 7th 1941, and I was in Manhattan September 11th 2001. The same shock and memories crossed me in the instant. The same pain befell me. Amongst the damage incurred and all the planes in the air, there were some Japanese planes that crashed that day, the memories are easy to bear now. I believe our pain will soon subside, then, when we look at the pictures in this book and the written account, we will be able to decide our direction. I have the original Life Magazines for the entire year of 1942, and many through 1946. When I looked at them when the war was finished, my contentment could not be surpassed. When I look at them now, I feel we can do it again, even better. We need it to remember for many reasons.This Book is the best account I have seen to date and would suggest buying it for your Grand children. Show them when they are old enough to understand. They will be able to decide whats best for America.I want to recommend a very good book that is everything about the events come to us, and gives us some fine direction.

This book is no exception. How could anyone read about the devastating events of September 11, 2001 and not be moved. Throughout &quot;One Nation&quot; the reader will recapture the events as they unfolded, meet both survivors and courageous rescuers, and still be left with that plaguing question, &quot;in this century, in a time of peace and prosperity, how could this horrific event possibly have happened?&quot;One need not be an American to appreciate this book, for the tragic events pictured here could happen anywhere. Where, is only a matter of geography. It is not appropriate to say it is an enjoyable book to read, for it is not. The events revealed here defy description and are so horrific they will stay with you forever. However, the book is a compelling one to read. For those who do not live near New York, it puts the reader in touch with the reality of the events. Life Magazine has produced a moving and impressive account, both in words and photographs, of what will become an unforgettable time in history. &quot;One Nation&quot; shows through the eyes of endless rescue workers, from all walks of life, that the world with all its tragedy, unpredictability and despair is also still a world filled with tremendous compassion and love for one's fellow man."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"Wow.This book will be the definitive collection of first-rate photographs and images of September 11th and its aftermath. &quot;One Nation&quot; is a must have regardless of whether you've been collecting other magazine or newspaper images of September 11th. It's hardbound with thick stock paper, pretty close in design to a coffee-table book. The hundreds of stunning photographs, coupled with the detailed narrative, make it an ideal collector's book and a thoughtful gift. It's sure to be a hand-me-down to children and grandchildren as well.This breathtaking book of pictures is divided into numerous sections, more or less organized by chronology. Let me describe a few highlights, since there are too many images to describe in this short space. One of the first sections, tells (and shows in pictures) the story of how the World Trade Center was designed and built. That section has quotes from the architect and pictures from the Towers' development process. The next major section is devoted exclusively to a minute-by-minute description of the Events of September 11th (what some of us here simply call &quot;ES11&quot;). This section has dozens upon dozens of pages of pictures and text -- all from September 11th. You can't help but be moved by some familiar images from television as well as an array of touching photos that have never been released in this format. The narrative to this incredibly detailed section also includes detailed maps, timelines of key events, and profiles of survivors, those who passed away, and individual heroes. The pictures are powerful, almost all in vivid color, and show the moments of September 11th unfolding in real time.The middle chapters include an essay about the history of New York and the City's importance in our natural and global culture. One of these chapters is a beautiful photo essay of the nation's activities in the month following September 11th. The photos show mourners in various cities, various ways the flag was symbolically displayed, and images of soldiers leaving for battle. One such picture shows a soldier and his wife saying goodbye, while trying to hold back tears and fear. It will move you. Another touching section from the middle of the photo-booktells the moving stories of a variety of heroes who emerged on September 11th. You'll read about (and see touching pictures of) the passengers on Flight 93, an unsung hero on Flight 11, Father Judge, the chaplain of the NYFD, the &quot;Lucky 6&quot; of the NYFD, even the touching story of the search and rescue dogs who made a difference in the rubble. There's also a lengthy collection of photos and profiles developed by legendary Time photographer Joe McNally, for his Ground Zero Portrait Project. The Portrait Project excerpt has pages of photos and profiles of a variety of people who came together for the rescue and recovery mission. The full page pictures and short biographies remind us that New York is the most diverse city in the United States, and that public service knows no bounds of age or race.Sprinkled throughout the book are poetry and essays written just for this collection, including &quot;Bottomless Tuesday&quot; by Gordon Parks, the wonderful filmmaker and photographer, and &quot;Extravagant Spirits&quot; by our legendary poet Maya Angelou.The last sections of the book focus on life in the weeks and months after September 11th. Here, you'll see touching pictures of a recovering New York, including a beautiful shot of children playing by the East River, against a backdrop of where the Towers were formerly visible. There are also somber images of post-September 11th funerals and the war effort.I live and work in Manhattan, and I'm not afraid to admit that despite feeling and seeing the heavy dose of real-life and news coverage up close, the images in this book still brought me to a moment of true reflection and humility. The book also showed me a side of New York that I've seen on the streets here but that much of the rest of the world hasn't begun to fully appreciate.I have only two small quibbles with the book. First, there aren't enough images or narrative about the events in Pennsylvania and Virginia/D.C. Second, there isn't a whole lot of exploration of the people or issues that caused this tragedy. Maybe, in a book entitled &quot;One Nation&quot;, that's how it was meant to be.Taken as a whole, &quot;One Nation&quot; represents a great and triumphant return for LIFE Magazine and its chronicling of the American story. It captures a truly unique and tragic time in American history -- one that made us pause admidst our differences to share a moment of deep reflection about ourselves, our country, and our truly global world."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"I was in search of a book memoralizing September 11. I wanted mainly pictures, with slight descriptions. I wanted to open the cover to see the two tall towers beaming in their prime with pride. And being a New Yorker, I wanted to see the whole truth. People are mortified by the images of people jumpimg from the towers. This is realism. This is what we all went through. I didnt want anything sugar coated for me, or better yet for my childrens children that look upon this tragedy in years to come. These are the unfathomable images that sparked rage and fury against anyone who terrorizes our country. This is what made us truly unite. This book had it all. I will save it until the end of time and pass it along to generations to come to see what I/we lived through and how I am so proud, not only to be an American, but a New Yorker!"},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"I bought this as a gift to my sister, but before I wrapped it, I ended up looking through the photos that told the haunting story of 9-11. Now, granted, I have not seen the other books by other publishers, but I was amazed at the vividness captured on film. My wife is a photographer, and I know how hard she works to capture images that are \\"worth a 1,000 words.\\" The photographers who sold their images to Life have done their job. If you want a keep-sake to remember one of the greatest tragedies in American history, I recommend this book. It helps give perspective as to the true tragedy of the events taking place that day."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"I would like to have known before ordering that 120+ pages of this book were published by Life 2-3 weeks before, page for page, in a commemorative issue available on newstands - though in paper, and with a different title and cover (curiously, though, the lovely cover photo - a firefighter holding the flag was missing from the hardcover version). I felt misled when I first skimmed this hardcover edition. Later, I realized that there were about 50 extra pages, but photos added to the hardcover weren't that much different from what was in the paper version on newsstands; pages with pictures of individuals at the end was overdone filler; and many photos were very familiar already. Having said all that, one can't argue with the quality of &quot;Life&quot; compilations of photographs, and quality of the book overall (paper, format, photo placements) is very good, with several eye-popping pictures. And it certainly beats presentation in the Magnum Press compilation, also about the WTC attacks."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"Life has really outdone itself here. This wonderfully executed book on the 9/11 tragedy is by far the best of the twenty plus that I have viewed. The best thing in this volume is the gripping recapping of the events of that day complete with AMAZING photographs that flow along a timeline. The pictures are of the highest quality, many of them I had not even seen before. The inclusion of photos of 'ordinary' Americans near the end is also quite haunting.I highly recommend this book, rather than some others (Reuters for one) that used the tragedy as a platform to promote various causes."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"I haven't read any other books on Sept.11, but I'm sure this would be one of the best out there. It has 192 color pages of amazing photos and great text. Some photos are disturbing, people jumping to death, but accurately portrays the tragedy. I personally liked the timeline of events. I read that and remember what I was doing and thinking at every heart-breaking moment. Wonderful stories of families and courage, people changed in many ways that day. Photos I never saw on television, or details I just didn't notice, now we will have a lasting tribute in this awesome book."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"We must never forget what happened on September 11, as individuals and as a nation. A book like this is one that our grandchildren will be looking at years from now while we describle the feelings and horror of that time.LIFE magazine, as usual, could be counted upon to chronicle, in photos and text, these sad and devastating events. The photos are exquisitely painful and the text (some by Guiliani, and poems by Maya Angelou and Charles Parks) is achingly appropriate.Reading this today, nine months after our national tragedy, made me realize that while the rawness of grief has somewhat lessened, it will never be gone."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"From the moment I opened this book, I was riveted. Every page was filled with pictures, personal accounts and memories. It was hard to look at the pictures and not cry. That old addage is true...a picture really is worth a thousand words. Every picture put in this book tells a story...From the firefighters, police and EMS personnel who are now being called heroes, to the picture that unfortunately captured a person jumping from one of the towers. I would say definitely pick up a copy of this book. I know that every time I look through the pages of the book I will always remember the events of that day and the days following. I will also remember how proud I feel to not only be an American, but to be one who as an EMT assisted at Ground Zero."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"The September 11 tragedy still haunts us. While we will never forget that horrible day, Life Magazine provides a book that enables us to reflect on the emotions in NYC, DC and PA, while providing outstanding information about the attacks and aftermath. This beautiful coffee table book includes a forward by Mayor Giuliani. Life Magazine meets, and often exceeds, our expectations with images depicting the horror, sadness, heroism and determination of those impacted. I visited Ground Zero, last week, and began to understand for the first time the true emotion, scope and scar of the attack. &quot;One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001&quot; helps all of us do the same."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"This book contains some great photos of 9/11.

It along with another book we believed were the best of what was on offer. Incredible graphics, real pictures; some featuring frame by frame shots, then the personal stories. It's really a must read, and incredible book for the coffee table where everybody picks this book up and flicks through.We ordered the book only the evening we returned to our hotel room (2nd hand) - saving weight in our luggage as it was in the first week of a month holiday along the east coast of US. Was here at home in OZ when we returned, and it looks brand new! Thanks Amazon!"},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"This book is a piece of recent history,and the numerous photographs from that day,together with the minute by minute timeline ,give a good idea of the day as it unfolded. Looking at the large photographs,some double-page,of the twin towers as they were struck,and later as the towers fall,it still feels difficult to believe that this actually did happen.A powerful image is of a group of people gazing upwards, the look of horror on their faces as they witness one of the towers fall says as much as any picture, of the magnitude of the event. Well researched and with eyewitness accounts as well as chapters dealing with the aftermath,the clearing up of the destruction, and how some of those left behind are coping,make this a balanced book.It does not only focus on the drama."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"Ordered same book from three different vendors - one came within a week, one in two weeks, the last in four weeks. All arrived in good shape."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"Manages to be both horrific and beautiful, heart-wrenching and uplifting. A book which must be experienced to be believed. This has to be one of Time-Life's best efforts."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"As vital as this necessary work is for today, its value will increase as the future unfolds. The important element arising from 9-11 in the total perspective is saluting the unfolding legacy developing from those events as they are projected forward toward posterity, never forgetting the sacrifices of those who died and those who risked their lives to assist. It was a day and a period for coming together, for fellowship, for doing for others. This book serves as an important tool in preserving that legacy.Selfish concerns must be forgotten when an event of this magnitude occurs. This is the type of period when Americans must respond to the challenge, to unite. This book captures that unification process in action. These photos are reminiscent for their profound meaning of those taken following the deaths of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Martin Luther King. A great nation reveals its best, and displays its unifying core, in the wake of tragedy."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"i just want to say this is one of the most moveing and inspiring books iv ever read.Its history and its worth every cent and more.i bought 5 books as gifts for christmas. and everyone loved them.every picture is detailed to what happend..and the storys in the book is from the personal lifes of everyone like fireman.police man.ect..you got to buy it ..!!!!Roger."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"I've never been a big fan of Life magazine; it's just a little maudlin for my taste. However, I have always given credit where it is due, and recognized that some of the very best photojournalism to be found is in the pages of Life.As a New Yorker in body and soul, who is currently displaced, I started flipping through this book just to look at the change in the skyline without the World Trade Center Towers.I was hooked. I had to look at every picture, and also read the text. The writers are all of one mind, which I suppose is the point of the book; the book doesn't quite challenge itself, though. Nonetheless, the writers come from many perspectives, and many places: Maya Angelou, James Bradley, Andrei Codrescu, Bob Greene, Melissa Fay Greene, Thomas Keneally, David McCullough, Gordon Parks, and Doug Stanton, to name some. Maya Angelou's piece was especially moving. I was pleased that the contributors weren't all of one political bent, because this tragedy belongs not just to the political coalition that can best exploit it.The pictures are Life magazine in its finest moment. Life magazine contributors and editors excel in photodocumentation, and this is a shining example of their skills. The photos will both move you and fascinate you. Although this book does stir up the painful reality of what New York went through that day, I think New Yorkers will bear up under it, because this book makes what happened not just something that happened in New York, but something that happened in The United States of America.And so the book earns its title."},{"Title":"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","review":"saw this on the chris matthews show and ordered it immediately. when it arrived at thanksgiving time, it took two days before i was able to view it--everyone else was reading it and walking off with it. for those of us who were virtually in a state of shock for the first week after 9-11, it is wonderful to be able to view this collection of work. beautifully done, i was at once both grieving at the event yet so very proud to be an american.enough said."},{"Title":"The woodcutter's house","review":"Here's another charming fable by Robert Nathan - your typical dog (Musket) meets dog (Susan) story: confirmed bachelor Musket gets swept off his feet by newcomer cutie in town Susan, they have a falling out (he thinks she's a flirt and untruthful, she thinks he's conceited), and then there's a reconciliation and all's well that end's well. Although animals are the main characters in the novel, they display all the foibles in human nature. It's a cute story and certainly not the first nor last about a sexy female who gets the best of a stuck-on-himself male. There is a corresponding plot line concerning a young woman and a woodcutter who's in love with her, but it's not nearly as fun or interesting as the lightly satirical doings of the various animals acting out their version of the \\"human comedy.\\" Delightful."},{"Title":"Larry Potter and His Best Friend Lilly","review":"When compared to some of the other wonderful literature that is available for children, this book doesn't have a leg to stand on. It was poorly written and rather boring.

This woman shows less skill than would be expected from the children she claims to be writing for. The writing is clumsy and inept, the concept boring. Save your time and money and find something written by an author with talent."},{"Title":"Larry Potter and His Best Friend Lilly","review":"This was written very poorly and it is not worth your time to buy or read.I wasted 6 days to get this book and then spent 5 minutes reading the book then it took no more than one minute to decide to return the book to get a refund.This story is a complete waste of time!"},{"Title":"Larry Potter and His Best Friend Lilly","review":"This book is boring,terribly written and dryer than a year old cracker. Saying that J.K Rowling plagurised this is a sheer insult to a great writer. My advice to the writer is take a little more time to actually write a good book instead of tring to sue other people! Seriously, I felt like a genuis trying to read Barney's play time! Take my advice and save some innocent tree in a forest somewhere, and don't buy this book! If you want to read this ridiculous excuse for a book visit a library!"},{"Title":"Larry Potter and His Best Friend Lilly","review":"The book not only told a nice story, but also did so like a poem.

I got about half-way through this one before someone else wanted to read it. What can I say? Not bad. Recommended reading if you're trying to introduce a change in the way people work. The stories or case studies are pretty readable. But I'm not sure how much it helps to give little (pattern) names in brackets inside every other sentence. Pick up any book about industrial success like Marriot or The HP Way and you'd probably do just as well. The important thing is to read about others' similar successes and how they did it, and always to get help from lots of other people."},{"Title":"Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas","review":"I heard the authors speak at an event and found them thoroughly engaging, which lead me to try to read Fearless Change, although I really can't find anything to recommend it.The \\"patterns\\" are, with a few exceptions, beyond obvious. Here are a few sections that would lose nothing if you reduced them to the title alone: \\"Ask for help,\\" \\"Brown Bag,\\" \\"Do Food,\\" \\"e-Forum,\\" \\"Involve everyone,\\" \\"Just do it.\\"In the \\"Do Food\\" pattern, you will learn the following: \\"Usually a meeting is just another ordinary, impersonal event.\\" Fascinating, tell me more. \\"Mention the availability of food when you advertise the event.\\" Right-oh. Anything else? \\"Chew the food thoroughly before swallowing, in order to prevent accidental choking death.\\" Okay, I made that last one up, but you get the idea.The organization is also strange. There's kind of a narrative progression of patterns up front, which is relentlessly cross-referenced with the full pattern sections. It's not clear to me if I'm supposed to be jumping back and forth between the patterns, or reading the narrative bit all at first, then onto the full patterns, and the authors don't answer that question. Fearless Change is really cross-referenced to death. Every pattern mentions 5 other patterns to use. \\"Hint: If you're out of food money, have a Brown Bag (113).\\" That's helpful, if you don't know what a brown bag is and need to look it up.Last but not least, a lot of the writing tends toward pointy-haired boss speak. For instance, the authors incessantly refer to people in their examples as \\"change agents\\" instead of their actual roles.You may get something out of this by borrowing someone else's copy and skimming lightly, as I wish I had done."},{"Title":"Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas","review":"The book I had ordered arrived much earlier than I had expected.I very much appreciate this prompt service."},{"Title":"Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas","review":"Change is hard. I've been part of companies that merged, were acquired, acquired others, downsized drastically, changed the CEO, moved corporate headquarters to another state and completely changed their target market. The change was difficult in each of these circumstances. That's not particularly surprising. What is surprising is that change is also difficult when doing something as seemingly simple as changing the company health plan. I wish I'd read this book before going through those changes.A large part of my current work is in helping companies manage the transition from how they currently develop software to developing software with an \\"agile process.\\" The book codified some of the things I've done for years without thinking about why but more importantly it also presented ideas I hadn't thought of. For example, the \\"Champion Skeptic\\" pattern says to designate a skeptical, strong opinion leader to be the \\"official skeptic.\\" I've always made a point of involving these skeptics because they can become your best advocates if you convert them. However, I've experimented with the idea as presented here and it works well.Change will remain hard, even after reading this book. But, you'll be much better prepared and you should find many of the patterns here very helpful."},{"Title":"Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas","review":"Have you ever wondered how to effectively introduce new ideas in your organization and get them to fly? Wonder why some people effortlessly get buy-in on their ideas while you struggle? Mary Lynn Manns, Ph. D. and Linda Rising, Ph. D. reveal some of those secrets in the book Fearless Change - Patterns For Introducing New Ideas (Addison Wesley).Chapter list:Part 1 - Overview: Organizations and Change; Strategies or Patterns; Where Do I Start?; What Do I Do Next?; Meetings and More; Take Action!; It's All About People; A New Role: Now You're Dedicated!; Convince The Masses; More Influence Strategies; Keep It Going; Dealing with ResistancePart 2 - Experiences: Multiple Sclerosis Society Experience Report; UNCA Experience Report; Sun Core J2EE Patterns Experience Report; Customer Training Experience ReportPart 3 - The PatternsAppendix; References; IndexI'd have typed in each of the patterns, but that would have put me over Amazon's word limit on reviews! :-)The concept of \\"patterns\\" involve finding a practice, or a method of doing something that is successful and can be applied to multiple situations. This is similar to the use of patterns in programming, where you use a particular type of program structure to solve a problem, knowing that the architecture and process has been proven to work in multiple settings. Manns and Rising use this pattern concept to show how you can successfully push new ideas through in an organization without making mistakes that will derail you before you even get started.For instance, \\"Location, Location, Location\\" talks about how moving to a off-site area (or a very nice area) can limit distractions and also show the group how important the idea is. \\"Guru On Your Side\\" helps you understand how cultivating a guru who likes your idea can help smooth the path as others in the organization will be more willing and ready to accept the idea from them. A \\"Champion Skeptic\\" pattern is to bring in a person who may be less than thrilled with your idea, but is willing to talk about why and help you make it a better one. There are a total of 49 patterns you can utilize during all phases of an idea or project, but I think you can get the idea where the value in this book lies.As everyone is involved in selling their ideas at some point, this book will be important to just about everyone across an organization. If you want to be more effective in getting people to follow you when things change (or need to), reading this book will get you there."},{"Title":"Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas","review":"While rapid change has always been a fundamental component of the computing field, recent changes have been far more substantial and difficult to deal with. In the past, changes were generally things like the introduction of a new language or a change in the structure of an old language. While these were difficult, experienced IT workers grew to accept them as part of the job.However, the recent changes are far more significant and often differences in kind rather than differences in degree. Previously, collaboration between programmers could usually be handled by a gathering in a meeting room. Now, with the globalization of a project, organizing a collaboration literally is a difference between night and day. While it is daytime for some of the workers, for those on the other side of the world it is nighttime. There are also cultural, social and language differences to be factored into the communication protocols. Writing the source code is constantly shrinking as a relative percentage of the effort needed to create a software package. Developers are being forced to learn more about the business side and need to talk intelligently and persuasively about return on investment, time to market and profit/loss expectations.Manns and Rising describe fundamental methods that can be used to introduce change into an organization without having the cure be worse than the disease. As the presence of the word \\"patterns\\" in the title indicates, these are not specific recommendations for particular types of changes. They are general formulas for smoothly transitioning a social and political structure from one systemic belief to another. Since organizations are group entities where everyone shares some common beliefs and practices and those beliefs and practices cannot be changed by a mere decree, Manns and Rising provide advice that can aid nearly all companies. Generally, the effectiveness of the aid will rise with the size of the company, as clearly small one or two-person companies can probably introduce change easily.The solution to most problems faced by a company is to modify a process within that company. Since the changes in IT organizations have increased in magnitude over the last few years, this has grown more difficult. Manns and Rising show you how to prepare the ground for the change, which is the first step in solving most problems. I ranked it the best book of the year 2004 in my best books of the year column for the online \\"Journal of Object Technology.\\""},{"Title":"Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas","review":"I had found myself moderately successful at introducing new ideas and influencing change in my organizations, but never knew why, or how to improve my ability to influence and sustain the change effort. The lightbulb was illuminated immediately upon getting a few patterns into this book- I had been, in one way or another, using some of these patterns without realizing it. Opportunities I had failed to take advantage of in the past became obvious as well in many patterns that were new to me, and in the past went unrecognized (next time, they will either be easy to spot or part of the plan in the first place!)Once you are able to recognize techniques as patterns, influence becomes something much more controllable. This is a powerful, easy-to-use (and reuse) toolkit for introducing ideas and influencing change. I believe that those experienced in influencing change will find a well thought out set of techniques and those unsure of even how to start will have a great roadmap and set of practices to start with and to invoke as-needed as their change efforts evolve."},{"Title":"Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas","review":"In addition to excellent, well written, patterns that tell you what to do, this books is full of stories that help you to understand how to use the patterns to influence people, overcome roadblocks, and spread new ideas.

This book is one that I will reference frequently and share with others."},{"Title":"Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas","review":"I was in a situation where I couldn't get anyone to listen to my ideas, much less try them out. I used some of these patterns, and lo! my coworkers and managers got interested, and some of my ideas were adopted. If you can see ways your team or organization could work better, but you can't get any traction in getting your ideas across, the information in this book will put you on the right road.This book isn't only for managers. Even if you're a small cog in a big wheel, using the techniques in this book, you can effect change that will benefit your team. With this book as a reference, you won't feel like you're wandering into the wilderness; you'll have proven techniques to guide you.

From the CEO down to each individual, ideas need to be brought to bear that can potentially change and improve the organizations direction and potential.The challenge is in moving (people) forward. In this book, the authors give everyone of us the tools (patterns) and the methods (stories) to successfully influence change in organizations.None of the patterns should come as a surprise. You've probably seen all of them in practice at one time or another. It's the packaging and the sage advice that is worth the price. Having a single source of wisdom for a broad variety of change approaches is, as they say - priceless."},{"Title":"Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas","review":"Fearless Change is a catalogue of patterns for introducing change in a company. Personally I've been in the role of change agent for years and this book provided me many \\"ah-hah\\"s which you get from reading good patterns. Most of the patterns I've applied in the past. Now I realized it and I got a name for them, which makes me more able to reuse the patterns. Some of the patterns were new to me and I've applied them immediately in my work.The book is organized in three parts. The first part tells short stories on the different phases of change. These stories already made me understand the basics of the patterns and how they were related. The second part has a couple of case studies. Personally I found this part rather boring, but it was very short. The third part of the book is the actual pattern catalogue which provided the needed details.The book was easy to read and, except for the case studies, didn't make me feel bored at any time. I've learned an awful lot from the book and it gave me some new tools in my toolbox when trying to introduce change.I've rated this book 4 stars, which should have been 4.5 starts, but I don't have that option. I wouldn't want to give it 5 stars for the small boring parts and since I wouldn't call it perfect yet, but close! The books is an absolute must for anyone introducing change in an organization though!"},{"Title":"Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas","review":"Just like all books on patterns, this gives you the feeling of 'oh, this is soooo obvious' the first reading it. The fact is that a second after reading it you start thinking and talking about brown bags, angles and evangelists and refer to the book all the time. Linda and Mary Lynn give us an idiom, a very very useful idiom.Also, the book is funny. Must read."},{"Title":"Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas","review":"We are in a time of massive change. Most people are under the impression that people hate change and that change is hard. That may be true of boomers, but look out for the millenials. They have grown up with change and change permeates their lives every day. Work for the same company for 30 years? Use the same phone for more than 2 years? Don't think so.Even if the world is more ready for change than it has been in the past, the way folks experience change may remain the same, and that's why this book is relevant. We will always have the Innovators, the Early Adopters, the Early Majority, the Late Majority, and the Laggards even if the change process is significantly accelerated these days. This book describes the process in significant detail and guides the reader through predicable patterns on organizational change. There are several case studies in this book and a list of patterns to look for.The structure of the book is different from most books (such as consistently referring to later parts of the book in the early sections), but it makes sense once you put it all together.

In a way it is France, and France is the Northwest. These stories have a terrific edginess to them. Something wonderfully unsettling keeps the reader less than comfortable and completely at the mercy of the story. After reading these stories, I felt I had woken to something I had done in my life no one must know, the dicey wonder of having gone just a little wrong, having given in to temptation. Weihe's fiction creates this dynamic tension. It is racy in all the right ways; I found it difficult not to finish in a single sitting.The stories in this collection made me want to live again. I imagined dangers lurking behind doors in Paris, in the Northwest. Finally, Weihe's perfectly chosen detail brings its own carefully chosen color to the grainy, dark, rainy quality of the Northwest and Paris. In the end, one thought: where's the next book."},{"Title":"Another Life & Other Stories","review":"Another Life is an incisive collection of stories depicting the contemporary plight encountered in the search for love, for understanding and for a meaning to life. Delving behind the superficialities of daily living and with prophetic insight, Edwin Weihe captures the intense desires that drive his characters to their inescapable and inconclusive ends. Told in a sparse and lean style, the stories brim with a sense of urgency, an urgency that is frightening, as though tomorrow might never come."},{"Title":"Another Life & Other Stories","review":"Edwin Weihe's Another Life and Other Stories is a remarkable first collection of short fiction. Weihe's characters find themselves trapped, suffocating in their various situations, yearning, often unconsciously, to chuck it all. Sometimes, they do just that. Despite the desperation they often feel, the characters are always sympathetic, nuanced, sharply drawn. In his title piece, &quot;Another Life,&quot; which is that unusual form, the novella, the narrator is Jack, an American academic attending a Hemingway conference in Paris. Like the famous novelist and the &quot;Lost Generation&quot; crowd of the \`20s, the narrator is also an expat, lost from himself. It's a wonderful work in which the literary history of Paris in the '20s plays against the narrator's sense being an exile from his earlier life when a love affair in Paris ended abruptly. The writing is spare, funny, satiric in its treatment of the lit.crit./celeb scene, and finally moving in its understanding of what pushes people to the edge. When a powerhouse feminist critic pronounces the central contention of her scholarship on D.H. Lawrence, namely that Lawrence wasn't able to bring his wife Frieda to orgasm, you realize Weihe is making a wry comment about the state of literary criticism as well as the essential impotence of male critics in the face of powerful female scholars. The war between the sexes, Weihe's novella reveals, has its generals and foot soldiers in academia. I highly recommend this fine book for its honesty, understated humor, and for its unwavering gaze at the craziness of our time. When asked by an American newcomer to Paris if he believes in the afterlife, Jack replies, &quot;This is the afterlife.&quot; Yes, it is."},{"Title":"Another Life & Other Stories","review":"In a selflessly honest appreciation for bare life, this book opens to a yearning for that which the modern human is in search of; the straining of life against its inevitable end to recapture innocence, grace before the fall, love, or what is even more mysterious, forever lost, and finally unattainable. The anxiety of these stories is deafening as you hope against hope for your own salvation along with the characters' in their quiet desperation for another life, so exigent as to be a matter of life and death; a struggle too unfathomable to dare come into consciousness, though felt every moment throughout the living flesh. You will find yourself in this book."},{"Title":"Essentials of Business Communication","review":"I am an instructor for a local college. I selected the Essntials of Business Communication as the textbook for my Business Communications course after working with it in a previous class. It is the best organized text I have found with step by step instructions for students to readily grasp the techniques used in modern business documents. The book covers e-mails, memos, a variety of business letters, reports, business proposals, resumes, letters of application and communication skills for oral presentations and interviews.

A complete application is gradually developed through all the chapters, together with smaller applications which illustrate specific points.While the editing of the book leaves something to be desired (e.g., incomplete sentences, punctuation errors, occasional code inaccuracies), this is a very worthwhile book indeed. I highly recommend it for the author's lack of assumptions and obvious understanding of the beginner's needs."},{"Title":"Learning to Program with Visual Basic","review":"I had to buy this book for a class and frankly it is not a good book. Lots of code errors that make it confusing. Every one of my classmates complained about the book. The professor eventually told us to not use the book and he gave handouts he had written instead."},{"Title":"Learning to Program with Visual Basic","review":"This book probably throws more information at you, page for page, than any other Visual Basic book I've seen. It covers everything from programming basics and general theory, all the way up to programming with databases. In that regard, it's an ideal book for the novice who wishes to explore deeper.Unfortunately, what keeps this from being a truly great textbook is some really sloppy editing. Explanations of concepts and tools are thorough to a fault, but they are just way too verbose. Here, a long explanation is used where a short one would have sufficed. And most inexcusably, I have found numerous errors in the project code that is included. I made it a challenge to myself to find out why the code was wrong and correct it, but not everyone has a learning style that allows them to benefit from this. Apparently, some of these problems are corrected in a third edition of the book that is forthcoming. Until that time, proceed with caution."},{"Title":"Learning to Program with Visual Basic","review":"We were given this book for my programming class and the author is very long winded on every topic and a lot of times you read the topic and when finished you are more confused than when you started so you end up going to a different book for better understanding.The code for the projects are broken up into seperate chunks and he doesn't always give you all of the code needed to make the program work or his code is wrong so you spend more time trying to find the problem and get it to work than learning the topic that the code is supposed to teach you.The index of the book tends to be off the majority of the time so when you need to look something up it will not be on the page that it says it's on. I went to the publisher's website for a page with the error corrections but they only correct a few items and I spotted a ton more in the book that I feel is critical to get the code to work.If you are really interested in learning Visual Basic 6 I would suggest going for a different book than this, this book is not worth the money."},{"Title":"Learning to Program with Visual Basic","review":"A book able to explain VB 6 in simple words with simplicity,I just bought the book for a program (VB 98) dated back to 1998, but a good book from the use I am given to it.

Good for everyone interested to learn the basics of VB 98."},{"Title":"Learning to Program with Visual Basic","review":"This book takes great pains to offer several different projects for a student to learn from. Unfortunately the main project, which is the most interesting, has several coding errors that hinder the project's ability to run. I found myself spending more time trying to correct the coding errors than learning from the presented material.This was my first introduction to VB, and the first four chapters were very beneficial. Then I hit a wall, as coding errors prevented me from continuing with the project.Also, the associated trial software has a few glitches. Most notably, and most annoying, was the fact that the utility allowing a VB project to be saved as an EXE was unavailable, for whatever reason. I registered the product correctly, and was well within the 120 day trial period. This limited my ability to bring the project to work to examine it further.Finally, the web site for student help listed in the book was unavailable for the entire month of January. I gave up at the end of January.I do intend to keep this book as a reference tool, and look forward to finding the correct codes to make the entire project work when I learn more about VB.

When Sam and a business associate Marcus come home, bullets fly; Claire is shot and is seemingly dying, Marcus is dead, and Maggie flees with baby Max. Maggie turns to her Uncle Tony for help. He, in turn, brings in his boss to help protect his niece and the infant while they investigate the drug dealing and killings by Sam.THE RUNAWAY DAUGHTER is an intriguing police procedural romance starring two likable protagonists and a strong support cast. Tony is a misfit who knows he can never be as good as his role model, his older brother; while Angie sees how deeply he cares and loves behind his nonchalant faade, but knows she must not pursue a relationship with a direct reports employee. The tension between them as they work the case makes for a strong thriller. Though readers will wonder why the pivotal scene happened where it did as the intelligent Sam would never risk his lucrative business by killing Marcus in his home, fans will enjoy this strong older woman younger man cop romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Runaway Daughter : Count on a Cop (Harlequin Superromance No. 1329)","review":"The Runaway Daughter by Anna DeStefano sensational follow-up to her previous book The Unknown Daughter.For month's coworkers Chief Deputy Angie Carter and deputy Tony Rivers have developed a close friendship.

We learn many answers to the questions Saberhagen has raised in the previous hundreds of pages of text, but we see just as many questions go unanswered. Really a rather shoddy ending to such a grand detailed story. The Armory of Swords (short stories) show more promise, in that they aren't all going to be finished by Saberhagen"},{"Title":"The Last Book of Swords: Shieldbreaker's Story (Swords Series)","review":"If you enjoyed the rest of the series, stop and don't read this book. Yes, you will be left wondering what happens to the rest of the swords, who is the Emperor, what happens to Mark and the rest, but live with the curiosity. This book goes beyond anticlimactic, it is just awful. The ending and the explanation of the Emperor is so...I can't even find words for how disappointing it is.I'm left wondering if Saberhagen didn't outgrow the series and quickly wrote Shieldbreaker's story to bring the series to a close so he could move on to other endeavors. I can not believe that he actually thought that this ending would satisfy his readers.I can not stress enough how thoroughly disappointing and frustrating the ending of this book is. Saberhagen should personally apologize to everyone who read this book"},{"Title":"The Last Book of Swords: Shieldbreaker's Story (Swords Series)","review":"I've been following this series all the way from its beginning with the Empire of the East series and I was extremely disappointed with the seemingly rushed way this one was written. Egad, what a goofy way to explain the Emperor figure. I was hoping for an intelligent tie in back to the Empire of the East premise, but ah well. The rest of the series is great."},{"Title":"The Last Book of Swords: Shieldbreaker's Story (Swords Series)","review":"I bought all paperbacks from the first trio through last book and sat down and read them from beginning to end. I have to conclude that this story was the most disappointing of all of them. Unfortunately for me Sheildbreaker's book was the reason why I force fed some of the other bad ones. This book in paticular is bizzare and inconsistent as far a as plot and environment with respect to the series. In summary, I didn't like the way the other swords played out and I thought the characters were neglected and unengaging. As far as I am concerned this series found a creative niche to add personality and intrigue to all the swords, quite uncommon for this genre surprisingly, however, the plots, stories, chararcters, ideas and action scenes fell well short of a great series let alone good stories. I am sorry, but I cannot recommend this book (or series) to anyone. For what it is worth, Book 2 of swords was the best of them all. In some way, I wish the author could have a do-over with the swords concept. Great ideas, not so good implementation."},{"Title":"The Last Book of Swords: Shieldbreaker's Story (Swords Series)","review":"I have read all of the series and I thought this was definately one of the best ones. I hated to see it end. My favorites though are the first 3 in the series. But this one was good and it had a surprise ending with some sci-fi thrown in. Fred Saberhagen is one of the all-time best in this genre, do yourself a favor and read his books."},{"Title":"The Last Book of Swords: Shieldbreaker's Story (Swords Series)","review":"the only problem i had with the book is the bizarre location towards the end(others who have read it will know what im talking about, but i dont want to ruin it for people who havn't read it).but other than that it was my favorite of the books of lost swords."},{"Title":"The Last Book of Swords: Shieldbreaker's Story (Swords Series)","review":"I was surprised to read that many people didn't like the ending to this book (and the saga)... I rather enjoyed the ending, to be honest. I found the final confrontation, as well as the denouement, to be fitting. Thematically, it goes in somewhat a different direction - but it feels right.At least to me. You may or may not like this book, judging by what some other people thought of it. Just thought it should be mentioned that the ending isn't universally reviled - so if you buy this book, you're essentially throwing dice to see whether you like it or not."},{"Title":"The Last Book of Swords: Shieldbreaker's Story (Swords Series)","review":"I loved all of the swords series leading up to this book. The plots and characters were intrigueing and well woven. The first three are the best with the Lost Swords continueing admirably. The last book Shieldbreakers story is a fizzle of epic proportions. With the tremendous build-up from the rest of the series the ending was trite and hurried. The setting and explaination for the emperor was horrible. From the other books we see a great figure in the emperor, noble and mysterious. The explaination we end up getting is shockingly boring and increadibly disappointing. This book leaves the reader thinking, &quot;What? That's it? Where is the rest of it?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Last Book of Swords: Shieldbreaker's Story (Swords Series)","review":"I just finished a rereading of the entire Swords series, from The First Book of Swords, straight through to Shieldbreaker's Story. I first read these books in high school, and was interested to see how everything would hold up.The answer: not well. While I absolutely LOVE the idea behind these books-- Twelve nigh-invincible, God-forged swords that give their owners specific powers that also come with amazing drawbacks-- the writing throughout the series just doesn't hold up. Often times it feels like one is reading the minutes of some board meeting, rather than an epic fantasy tale set in the far-flung future.But let's get to this particular book, Shieldbreaker's Story. I actually like the ending of this book, I like where it goes, even if it is poorly written and clunky. My main issue with this book is the MASSIVE character and plot mistakes that make me feel as if the author had completely forgotten the previous books.***SPOILERS BELOW***At the end of the third book (the last in the Complete Book of Swords compilation), The Dark King Vilkata is thrust down an anonymous mountainside by the dying god Vulcan, where he ostensibly remains until The Mindsword's Story, when he returns to the Great Game. Meanwhile Baron Amintor, a general of the Dark King's enemy Queen Yambu, has his own series of failed adventures in other books.Then, for some reason, in Shieldbreaker's Story, Fred Saberhagen writes that Amintor and Vilkata had been associates in the past, and that they had worked together previously. As far as I can tell, that is exactly opposite of what has been told in previous books.Secondly, many characters refer to The Emperor as Queen Yambu's husband (even she does this) while in previous books it had been stated that Yambu had turned down the Emperor's proposal of marriage more than once. All of the sudden in the last book this changes.***END SPOILERS***These are just a few of some fairly egregious mistakes and plot holes in the book, which cast a shadow on the series as a whole. For me, they do a lot to ruin the experience of reading the book.While some people suggest skipping this book, I can't advise that... I always like to see things through to the end. Just know that it will not be a completely satisfying end, due chiefly to the author's laziness or confusion regarding his own tales."},{"Title":"The Last Book of Swords: Shieldbreaker's Story (Swords Series)","review":"I followed the Swords series when I was a kid in Jr High and later High School. The concept really is fantastic, one of the best premises I've seen in a genre that generally recycles the same tired old Tolkeinesque tropes over & over. The execution is a bit uneven from book to book, but it almost always stays engaging and entertaining.This final offering, though, is a total disaster. With the exception of the first couple of chapters, the entire tale is a hastily delivered headlong rush to nowhere. Characters that have been mainstays of the previous ten books are dragged onto the stage for a couple of paragraphs for reaction quotes, engage in brief, pointless skirmishes, and then disappear again for several dozen pages.There really is no coherent plot thread to bind all this frantic action together. The entire story is a transparent exercise to both destroy all of the iconic, titular Swords and grope for a plausible connection to Saberhagen's previous \\"Empire of the East\\" books.Fans of previous Swords books will find this a dull & prolonged anticlimax to an previously imaginative and often entertaining series."},{"Title":"The Last Book of Swords: Shieldbreaker's Story (Swords Series)","review":"The last book of lost Swords was a revealing conclusion to a story that left us hanging with many enigmas concerning a world more ancient than the one that the stories are set in. As interesting as it is to find the answers to all of these questions, it seems that Saberhagen does not do his usual excellent job of building suspense. Maybe the problem is that this book follows a pattern which is much to similar to the patterns followed by the other swords books. I still have to give Saberhagen credit, however, for remaining relatively original through eight stories. All in all I was sorry it was over when I put down this book, and I was wishing for more, that is why I will go to a four star rating for this book."},{"Title":"The Last Book of Swords: Shieldbreaker's Story (Swords Series)","review":"I bought it to complete the rest of my series.

I'd read the entire series again and simply leave this one out."},{"Title":"The Last Book of Swords: Shieldbreaker's Story (Swords Series)","review":"Don't read the other reviews of this book and walk away thinking that this series is not worth checking out. I wept when this book ended, but mainly because it ended and I read it long after it was published and thus knew that no other books in the series would be forthcoming.I was a bit disappointed that Saberhagen felt the need to destroy all the swords at the end of the book. I guess he was getting tired of the setting and wanted to slam, not shut the door. I wish that he had left Coinspinner around at the least..... Ah, but life is filled with tragedy.....If you enjoy fantasy, you simply MUST read this book. The world is incredibly detailed and it really is a crime that there never was a role playing game developed based on the novels.I won't go as far as to say that these books are better than the LOTR, but they are comparable. That statement, in it self speaks volumes."},{"Title":"The Last Book of Swords: Shieldbreaker's Story (Swords Series)","review":"I was all set to write a stinging review of the terrible book that killed this great series- but it would just echo what has already been written.

So, I am here just to slam this piece of garbage with 1 star."},{"Title":"The Last Book of Swords: Shieldbreaker's Story (Swords Series)","review":"Most of the book was fine, but the end section was a poor conclusion to the book, and the series. (WARNING! Specific plot details follow!) Just so readers are forewarned, the Emperor is never explained, and he gives a strange quasi-religious statement about himself. Here it is, verbatim: &quot;Some long ago have called me the Sabbath, or the Covenant--Some have called me Wisdom. Some lately have said that I am the Program of Creation.&quot;Has Saberhagen found Christianity, and he's trying to inject it into his fiction? What the heck is he trying to get at, here? Beats me, and the book left me scratching my head and wondering what happened to this gifted writer."},{"Title":"The Last Book of Swords: Shieldbreaker's Story (Swords Series)","review":"If I hadn't already read this book, I probobly wouldn't after reading all but one of these reviews...then again, that hasn't been all that unusual with the reviews I've seen on Amazon. Almost every review that I've bothered to write has been because I felt the need to counterbalance some very over-the-top reviews; this is definitely a case in point...Some of the reviewers here claim to have enjoyed the rest of the series which almost made me stop myself from making this statement, but I'll take a chance and make it anyway: If you enjoyed the rest of the series, chances are good that you'll enjoy this book as much or more. The ending was not what I expected but in most of the books that I have enjoyed, the ending was somewhat of a surprise; frankly, I would have been disappointed if Fred HAD done the most obvious thing (whatever that is!).Is it possible that he wanted to be done with the Swords? Certainly. If that was the reason, I really don't care. It is said that Tchaikovsky's 6th symphony was his way of dealing with his homosexual feelings; when I heard that I gave a little shudder and continued enjoying the music as much as I ever did. Whatever Fred's reason for ending the series the way he did doesn't change the fact that this is a fantastic book by any standard.As a postscript I should point out that if Fred truly was sick of the world of the swords, explain the recent release of \\"Ardneh's Sword\\". This book was truly unnecessary to the series and the questions it answers could have been answered without going to the trouble of adding another 348 pages to the series."},{"Title":"Play Gently, Alfie Bear","review":"I brought this one home for my daughter 2-1/2 yr old daughter from the library.

However, my husband and I both found the responses of the Mother bear toward the oldest cub somewhat intolerant and insensitive. Finally at the end of the book the mother bear is warm and loving toward her eldest cub, but I'm not sure if that makes up for earlier responses.

And it's even harder to find a good one, that has enough information to be useful.This is a VERY nice reference book for transferware pottery. While not every pattern is pictured (an impossible feat considering how many different patterns there are), there are dozens and dozens of example pictures through out. Beautiful patterns - some of which I had never seen before. They also show numerous examples of the original painting or sketch or engraving next to the transferware pattern, which I found very interesting. Many makers/manufacturers marks and date stamps are covered also.This book doesn't even attempt to assign monetary prices to the patterns, but as a reference book you can't beat it. Well worth the money!"},{"Title":"Sesame and Lilies","review":"This is an excellent edition of John Ruskin's Sesame and Lilies, the best I have found. The editors have not gone footnote-crazy; there are fortunately few. Supplementary materials such as the intro, chronology and glossary are well done and interesting, and the critical essays included are varied and very much worth reading. This ed. is part of Yale's \\"Rethinking the Western Tradition\\" series, all of which are well done."},{"Title":"Introduction to Analysis","review":"I believe the author has given students a wonderful text for the beginning of analysis. I disagree with the student who stated that the proofs are unclear. When I took this class last fall, all of the proofs were not clear in the beginning but with a little clarifying by my professor, they quickly became understandable. The problems at the end of the sections are designed to help students fully understand the chapter and while some of the problems require a lot of extra work, they are not impossible. It seems to me if you gave this book a bad review, it was because you were unwilling to put forth the time and effort to fully understand the material. This book was extremely helpful and guided the class in a clear and concise manner."},{"Title":"Introduction to Analysis","review":"At first glance, the book appears too thin. But once you've delved a few pages into it, you immediately recognize that the author has simply mastered the art of brevity - while remainining eminently readable.

The proofs are easy to follow and extremely instructive, so that the book can also be used in a &quot;Bridge to Advanced Mathematics&quot; or &quot;How to do Proofs&quot; that some schools offer to their math majors to ease the transition from problem-based lower-division courses to proof-based upper-division courses."},{"Title":"Introduction to Analysis","review":"The proofs are well structured and easy to follow. The techniques used in the proofs lend themselves for use in other situations. A lot of information is embeded in the exercises which keep the students alert and focused and at the same time saves time and space. A good book for undergraduates in mathematical analysis."},{"Title":"Introduction to Analysis","review":"This book broke me into analysis. It gives the reader a gentle introduction to the subject. The proofs are rigorous and easy to follow. Before embarking upon an analysis class, a person should take an introduction to proof class. Without such a class, the language of analysis will make no sense to the reader. For example, if you do not know how to do proof by induction, then you will struggle in analysis. The negative reviews for this book likely stem from readers who did not take such a class. Thanks to this book and Munkres' topology, I am now able to read and enjoy Baby Rudin. Baby Rudin is good, but I would not have liked it without first using Munkres and Gaughan. Note that Gaughan is not a complete substitute for Rudin. Rudin is general whereas Gaughan focuses mainly on the real line. Albeit, Gaughan is much easier on a reader who is new to the subject. Gaughan's treatment of sequences sets the stage for the book. He then goes into continuity and uniform continuity. The definitions and theorems are lucid. Gaughan then delves into differentiation, integration, and power series. The ordering of the topics allows the reader to move from topic to topic without having to flip back and forth through the book."},{"Title":"Introduction to Analysis","review":"Although this text has quite a few good projects and problems, it is a bit too concise particularly for the student who is new to anaylsis. While all the major theorems are presented with proofs, some of the proofs are quite difficult to follow and many involve \\"hand-waving\\" in the proof. For the new student, this may cause a bit of confusion. Also, when a student goes to complete the homework, they may not be as clear and rigorous as necessary. It could also do a bit more in ways of visual arguments to help clarify the concepts being proved. The projects are probably the best part of the text because they have some of the classic calculus concepts built up by the student. I would have also appreciated a selected solutions or more helpful hints on some of the more difficult homework problems."},{"Title":"Introduction to Analysis","review":"I was introduced to this book in my junior-year analysis course called Adv Calc 1. At the time I found it to be very fun to read, mostly very clear in its presentation, and well-motivated. One drawback of this book is that the material covers only single-variable analysis, and then the reader who wants to learn multivariable calculus has to go to another book where he has to get used to different notation, different emphases, different definitions of continuity, etc. This is unfortunate for someone who wants a unified perspective.(As an aside, for Adv Calc II, my class used Friedman's Advanced Calculus, which I found impenetrable. I would not recommend this book.)Then I discovered Fitzpatrick's text Advanced Calculus, which covers both single- and multi-variable calculus. What's more, it outdoes Gaughan's text in terms of clarity, motivation, simplicity, and everything else. I can't recommend Fitzpatrick's book enough."},{"Title":"Introduction to Analysis","review":"I used this book for an undergraduate course in Analysis and was pleased with it. It is well-organized with poignant examples. The physical construction of the book, however, proved not to be as good as the content and it is quite worn."},{"Title":"Introduction to Analysis","review":"I had to get this book for my advanced calculus class. There are 3 issues I have with this book. First, that the material in any given chapter gives what is needed to work most, BUT NOT ALL, of the problems at the end of the given chapter. Second, having solutions to selected exercises is a good tool to have, and if an instructor disagrees, he or she can just assign problems that don't have solutions given. Not all students would use those solutions, but it's nice to have to verify one is on the right track. Third, the author does not explain things as clearly as other authors do. He (assuming Edward is male) could have explained things much better without adding a single word to the text. I find myself frequently referring to 'How To Prove It' by Velleman, since Velleman explains things much better. In short, this book is not the worst I've seen, and I would give this book 3 stars, were it not for the price."},{"Title":"Introduction to Analysis","review":"I can't believe this is the book my advanced calc 1 class used at university. They sold it to me for $114.50+tax! This is a deal here. This class was the hardest class I took for undergrad. The book was no help. I learned everything I knew from the teacher and from the Internet/study groups. I do like how organized the book is, but the information was impossible for me to learn from the book."},{"Title":"Introduction to Analysis","review":"As a math major, I am of course interested in the subject of Real Analysis. But I cannot agree with the other reviews in that the book is very UNACCESSIBLE to undergraduates! I have poured through the first 3 chapters until I almost have them memorized and the concepts are NOT CLEAR. Instead of explaining what is going on, the author rambles on about the &quot;beauty&quot; of his subject and how &quot;we&quot; as students should &quot;carefully&quot; digest the ideas. The examples and proofs are NOT clear and are NOTHING like the HW problems! In fact the proofs are so incomplete, that proving them in the fashion that the author does, does not convince my professor??? This book is a BIG waste of over $100 and a class that I might have enjoyed if the author could see outside of his ego and stop trying to show off to undergraduates who do not know the subject yet!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Analysis","review":"In my college days ,i found Edward D gaughan's 'Introduction to Analysis',amidst pile of other books.I read the preface countless times.With his words of encouragement and admonishment ,writer makes you more comfortable ,in your long journey of Mathematics which is real and abstract at once!!

Leonard Allen, Richard T. Hughes and Michael R. Weed will only be of interest to \\"Church of Christ\\" lifers. It was written 20 years ago, but remains relevant both to those who have experienced the evolution of the \\"Church of Christ\\" brand of Christianity and to those who find themselves trapped in the mindset of the 1950's brand. Yes, they exist, and not only in Texas. I've encountered them firsthand in California.To paraphrase from a movie line, this book has something for everyone, because it will irritate both those who welcome change and those who want to preserve the past.

Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Messiah of Midtown Park: A Contemporary Comedy-Drama (Screenplay)","review":"I think you'll enjoy the humor and simplicity of this tale. For starters, think of the premise: Even the Messiah is waiting for the Messiah! He has known he is the Messiah for so many years and did not know what to do about it. His waiting is done by the time this story begins, but Shlomo Hirsch still acts as if there's no rush. So how will the world treat him? Another bit of entertainment? Or will they take him seriously? Will they honor him, humiliate him? What!? Surely no one would humiliate the Messiah!? You'll find out in this screenplay.Part of the fun of reading any screenplay is imagining who you would cast in it. You might think this is an odd choice for Shlomo, but I would pick the British actor Ian McKellan. If you saw him on Saturday Night Live a couple of years ago, you know the man has a twinkle in his eye and can appear to be carrying a big secret. I would instantly believe he is the Messiah.

Ten thumbs up!"},{"Title":"The Messiah of Midtown Park: A Contemporary Comedy-Drama (Screenplay)","review":"Gompertz's uproarious tale of a Messiah in our midst is original, witty, and yet inducing serious thought. It is at once cynical and pious, down to earth and wholly implausible. With tongue in cheek, Gompertz can be tender and sardonic, mocking and sincere. His dialogue flows naturally, and he obviously knows the ins and outs of TV show business. It should make a good stage or teleplay."},{"Title":"Wagon West #07: Colorado (Wagons West)","review":"Dana Fuller Ross' panoramic saga of America's great expansion into the western territories is some of the most intelligent, well written historic fiction I have read. &quot;Colorado&quot; is Book 7 in a series of 24 novels which truly bring history to life during one of the United States' most important and fascinating periods.In 1858, some eight years after the beginning of the California Gold Rush, gold was discovered in the Colorado country. Once again, it was boom or bust as hoards of gold-hungry men swarmed to Colorado, bringing with them many of the same problems that had plagued California before it became a US territory. The North and South were drifting further apart, endangering the Union. The issues went far beyond free vs. slave states. The increasingly industrialized North and the predominantly agricultural South had been developing opposing views on almost every aspect of what constituted US society.General Leland Blake, a veteran of the first wagon train to blaze the Oregon Trail, was called to Washington by President Buchanan. The gold, discovered by southerners from Georgia, was found in the wilderness of Colorado, a place claimed by no state or territory. Geological reports favored finding considerable gold within the next year. The President wanted to secure Colorado country for the Union. He also needed to know approximately how much gold was available. If Civil War broke out, the gold would be of great value to finance the conflict and help to secure a Union victory. Buchanan sends Blake to Colorado with a geologist, both men's wives, and a lawyer. Since the southerners are not to know of the presidential mission, it is to be kept absolutely secret. Blake is to pose as a retired General. His group is supposed to be on a financial expedition to assess Colorado's mineral wealth for future investment.Many of the characters from the first six books appear in &quot;Colorado&quot; and new ones, both historical and fictitious, are introduced. The author gives these characters tremendous depth and illustrates how life in the new land, along with new responsibilities, changes them and effects their relationships. Chet Harris, another wagon train veteran, goes to Colorado along with his partner Wong Ke, to see if they can repeat the mining success they had in California, where they made their fortune. They join with newspaper publisher Wade Fulton, of the Colorado Tribune, to form a voluntary citizen's constabulary to provide law and order. Colorado promised to be as bad as California was, in terms of violence, crime and murder. Lovely Susanna Fulton, Wade's daughter and newspaper editor, solves the mystery of the &quot;Grey Ghost bandit.&quot; Lt. Andrew Brandon, son of the Oregon Trail wagon train master Sam Brandon, and many others also have a part to play in &quot;Colorado.&quot;The history, characters, plot and subplots in this novel are some of the most exciting and dynamic so far. I love history, and while I have read and studied this period in America's development, I have learned so much from reading these seven &quot;Wagons West&quot; books. I plan to continue until I read them all. A wonderful reading experience.JANA"},{"Title":"Wagon West #07: Colorado (Wagons West)","review":"I started reading this series last year and even though they were written several years ago, they are more about history (which doesn't change) and I look forward to each one.

The stories are amazingly credible. While the stories are fiction, the framework is firmly anchored on historical facts. While the sequels have varied plots and settings, the stories revolve around the Holts and the pioneers of various enthnicities whose courage, honor, selflessness and industry have carved the great nation of America. The wagons west stories are all very fascinating - adventure, humor, pathos, suspense, romance, and drama are all there, presented by the author with sensitivity and good taste that has made the wagons west book series wholesome and knowledge-enriching. The stories have very positive impact on the reader because the author has successfully kept the virtues highlighted while still realistically showing the dark side of men. The stories are universally inspirational in the sense that wagons west glorifies the good attributes of the characters as human persons regardless of their color and creed. The wagons west stories do not only tell the readers how the West was won (as there are so many stories written on this already), but conveys to readers a message that love and justice has no boundaries and out of these virtues - great men and achievements are made. Dana Fuller Ross is a patriot in writing these books. America should thank him for making people appreciate more the value of the American history and its legacy-one that has shaped America's role as the world's leading champion of freedom and justice. I have actually read at least twenty of the Wagons West volumes and still completing the set. My high recommenation, therefore for this particular volume applies to the rest of the series.

However, it is my understanding that supplemental pages for new figurals that have been since identified may be available from the author along with updated pricing guides.

The book is a detailed diary of Wortis' visits with Freud interspersed with personal correspondences of his regarding these visits. Although it is based on an analysis done by Freud on Wortis, Freud is really the one being analyzed in Fragments. This piece offers a unique and insightful view into the man's personality, his viewpoints, and his pschoanalytic theory.In the beginning of Fragments, the author recounts the circumstances by which he came to be analyzed by Freud. Basically, he wished to learn more about psychoanalysis to assist him in a scientific study he was involved in. Wishing to learn from the best, he contacted Freud, who told him the best way to learn about psychoanalysis was to be psychoanalyzed. And so, having the finances to do so, Wortis hired Freud as his own personal phsychoanalyst.The remainder of the book is comprised primarily of journal entries based on detailed notes Wortis took after his sessions with Freud. Each session consisted of Wortis talking from a couch while Freud sat nearby and listened. He spoke about events of his childhood, his present-day life, and he discussed issues concerning science and psychology. Although Wortis did most of the talking, his diary entries in Fragments focus mainly on the times when Freud would actually conversate with him, and so the book reveals less of the one being analyzed than it does the analyist.From the start, Wortis paints a picture of Freud as the classic, stubborn old man. He is critical, cocky, and close-minded. Wortis is admittedly skeptical of psychoanalytic theory from the get-go, and although he promises to be open-minded about it, his skepticism increases throughout the book as he and Freud debate some of the basic tenets of psychoanalysis. He does not like Freud's focus on the unconscious and his lack of concern for present-day realities and influences. He thinks Freud's dream interpretations are merely conjecture and that some are completely absurd. In the end, he concludes that Freud and his psychoanalytic theory have done some great things for the field of psychology as a whole, but he himself is less than enthusiastic about its useful application."},{"Title":"Safe Sanctuaries: Reducing the Risk of Child Abuse in the Church (Children's Ministries)","review":"SAFE SANCTUARIES is the most helpful and practical resource I have found dealing with reducing the risk of child abuse in the church.In addition to background information which is straightforward but not-threatening to the reader, the book offers policies and sample documents which can be adapted by local congregations.Though this resource is created by Discipleship Resources of the United Methodist Church, ALL denominations and congregations of all faiths will find it helpful."},{"Title":"Safe Sanctuaries: Reducing the Risk of Child Abuse in the Church (Children's Ministries)","review":"I've used this book now in three churches to help them write their own Safe Sanctuary Policy.

If you choose the later, Kushell's The Young Entrepreneur's Edge can help you along that path.The book is basically a \\"how to\\" for starting a business. It presents and answers all of the questions that you might really need to know the answer to, but felt too stupid to ask. It also touches on many things that a first-time entrepreneur may be unaware of or forget (like IRS withholding, etc.).The book is primarily for someone planning to start a business for the first time and will offer little advice to the seasoned business-owner. Of value, though, especially to younger readers (of all levels of business experience) are the sections on dealing with perception of youth in a business context which may get a more thorough treatment here than in any other manuscript. Entrepreneurs of all ages and experience-levels will also enjoy the start-up-stories that pepper the book.The books one real lack, however, may be in the accuracy department. For example, Kushell gets the IRS 1099 and W2 form confused, which may seem like a simple mistake but could inadvertently subject a business to a variety of liability (W2 employees are the traditional salaried/wage employees where the 1099 form is used for reporting income for independent contractors - [website] has extensive information on tax forms). The book, thus, is a good overview and may alert you to things that need to be looked into further, but additional research will be required to verify and understand each topic.Overall, the book is a must-read for anyone under 30 starting a \\"real\\" business for the first time. For others, it may serve as a refresher or provide an amusing read, but will be of limited usefulness."},{"Title":"The Young Entrepreneur's Edge: Using Your Ambition, Independence, and Youth to Launch a Succesful Business (Career Guides)","review":"I recently had the pleasure of reading &quot;The Young Entrepreneur's Edge&quot; by Jennifer Kushell.

Jennifer Kushell offers some practical advice about selecting the right business for you, writing a business plan, getting funded, etc. But what sets the book apart are its sections on not having any credit or not having good credit, using interns instead of full time employees, how to get mentors and advisors, how to present a professional image despite of your youthful looking appearance, dealing with family and friends who don't support your decision, how not to starve, etc. The only complaint that I had about the book was that some sections were not very complete on their advice. It is true that there are lots of other books out there on subjects such as marketing and business plans and so on, but if the author was just going to recommend that we look elsewhere, why did she include a chapter on that topic in the book in the first place? Some of the information is a little dated, but not too bad. I also would have like to have seen more resources to go to in the back of the book as to where to go to get that information that she doesn't cover in the book.

This book definately had an influence on me and I would recommend it to anyone, young or old, that is thinking about starting thier own business venture."},{"Title":"The Young Entrepreneur's Edge: Using Your Ambition, Independence, and Youth to Launch a Succesful Business (Career Guides)","review":"I dont really think that this is a good book.

Very vague and broad examples and not a lot of the nuts and bolts of success. Jennifer Kushell is the self crowned princess of the young entrepreneurial spirit. She claims to have launched successfull business ventures but never elaborates anywhere in her books or websites and instead offers page after page of fluff and filler on how to get ahead. After wasting my time with this book and two of her other books, I'd be skeptical of allowing her to run a lemonade stand. Please save your time and money. There are many better choices by PROVEN success stories. Multiple streams of Income by Robert Allen and How to Buy a Business: Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition by Richard A.

It is also very accurate as to what the Catholic Church professes to believe and why. This makes it a good book for non-Catholics to read who just want to know what Catholics really believe and function in their church.But it no easy read. This book is for serious study and not recreational reading."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"This is a wonderful book. I am new to the Catholic faith and had many questions. This book answered them all. It is very informative without being too long. I could not put it down. Now that I have finished reading, if I need to answer a quick question, I can look it up in this book. There are many misconceptions about the Catholic faith and this book set them all straight. It is wonderful for someone who is a cradle Catholic, a new Catholic, or protestant who wants to learn the truth about Catholicism."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"I thought it was a very general book. It did not talk about the more detailed customs and traditions that intrigue me about Catholicism. However, I was very impressed about the detail of what was discussed.

It doesn't answer everything and so you are left with the FAITH that the Holy Spirit leads you to."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"The explanation of many of the more common controversial (as deemed by the Protestant community) aspects of the Catholic church were well explained in this book.

I would recommend this book to all Catholics especially in this Year Of Faith. Too many of us Catholic do not have a deep understanding of our catholic teachings. This book is a good starting point for reading more books on /about Catholic Teachings."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to understand what the Catholic Church teaches and the reasoning behind its teaching. It is \\"gentle apologetic's\\" and doesn't insult someone who believes differently. It is easy reading and, as its title says, focuses on explaining the aspects of the Catholic faith that people question: The Eucharist, Mary, The Saints, The Pope etc. The author uses a lot of scriptural references to support his explanations.I first discovered this book shortly after it was published when I was involved in an ecumenical ministry almost 25 years ago. It was a huge hit as it helped us all understand one another better. Since then I have given it to both Catholics who want to be able to better explain their faith to others and to non-Catholics who are seeking a better understanding of a friend or family member's faith.If you can find it, the bible study guide that goes with the book is very helpful too."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"When I was considering converting to the Roman Catholic faith in 1999, this book really helped clear up many misconceptions I had about the Catholic faith tradition. Alan Schreck, Ph.D., (no relation to the cartoon character) is a convert to Catholicism too and he writes in an everyday, conversational style that's easy to understand. Since becoming a Roman Catholic at the Easter Vigil in 2000, I've personally bought over 50 copies of this book to give to family and friends. It's simply one of the best Catholic Apologetics books available today."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"We selected this book for our apologetics class and could not be more pleased. The book is easy to read, full of scripture references, and written in a non-confrontational (vs evangelicals) manner. The book has many references to offical Church documents, and covers most of the big areas the Catholic Church differs from Protestantism. This book is great for those wanting to know more about the Catholic faith or for Catholics who want to be better prepared for dialogue with our separated Protestant brethern."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"I have to say that this book is magnificant. This is one of many books of this nature that I read while searching for spiritual truth, and it is probably the one easiest to comprehend. This book was certainly an influence in my decision to enter the Catholic Church from the Assemblies of God Church (after a three year pit-stop in Paganism and witchcraft). I am so happy, I am home. This book truly IS a Godsend.**I originaly wrote this review over four years ago, shortly after I became a believing Catholic. Since then I have noticed how people are quick to stress that this book is meant to inform and not convert, I even recieved emails about that fact, not all of them polite. I never intended for this review to make it sound like the book was about converting people to Catholicism because it certainly is not. I do believe however, that this book is a decent introduction to Catholicism for any Christian, especially non-Catholic ones, because it was written so that non-Catholics would not be offended while at the same time, getting accurate information about Catholicism. And I do not apologize for the fact that it helped me (along with several other books) in my decision to BE a Catholic. God bless you all."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"I still don't knowq what to make of the Catholic Church. This book, however, presented the Catholic Church doctrine from a Catholic perspective and it did so wuthout baggering the Protestant movement. This was improtant for me, because I wanted to understand the Catholic position without doctrinal distractions.This is unlike many of Keating's books where he defends the Catholic church by attacking Protetsants. This probably has a place for teh Ctaholic who is trying to learn hpow to defend his faith, but to someone like me - trying to just learn about the Catholic Church, it is distarcting. This book, gets way beyond the polemics. The author presents the evidence and his poistion and allows one to decide for him/herself.I am still not sold by the Catholic Church's positions on many doctrines, but it was nice to get their view instead of many ax to grind Protestant views. I say this as an active Southern Baprists conservative."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"I am in the process of converting to Catholicism after being raised Presbyterian. I found this book not only to be an easy-to-read and understand explanation of the basics of Catholic catechism, but an outstanding reminder of what Christianity means, should stand for and should strive to be.The topics are in depth, and there are subtle references to refute fundamentalist arguments often heard in 21st century America.I enjoyed this book and would recommend it!"},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"This book was very helpful during my classes to become Catholic. It is very readable. The language is not so scholarly as to be confusing to an average person. Yet it does explain the similarities and differences between Protestant and Catholic very well. I use it as a reference guide even today. It is much easier to find a quick answer here than digging through the Catechism. You can follow up with the Catechism if you need a more complete answer."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"I first read the 1984 version when I was in RCIA in 2002. I am so glad it was republished! This author is a joy to read--his writing style and clarity and down-to-earthness is refreshing! This is a KIND book--very loving and not offensive at all. If I had the money I would buy a few cases of this book and just pass them out to anyone who has any questions (especially being a Catholic in the US South)! I recently started reading my old copy again and fell in love with being a Catholic all over again. A friend asked some questions on FB and I searched here to see if I could find any other copies--was I pleasantly surprised to see it is being published in a new version once again!

Even though, I am aware of most of the issues that are covered in these books, I find Alan Schreck to be an interesting writer on these topics.

His writings are highly readable and thoroughly convincing."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"A wonderful collection of responses to common misunderstandings about the Catholic faith. Dr. Schreck does a wonderful job from scripture and history sharing the faith in a clear and concise manner without partisan rhetoric or polemic.

It may just challenge what you think you already know and open your eyes to truth. Follow it where it leads, you will not be disappointed.

If you're not proud of being Catholic, please don't ever apologize for being one.This constipated read looks to be written for mainstream Protestants and tries to explain commonly misunderstood Catholic doctrines with scriptural quotes and reason. To the author's credit, he is able to succinctly explain Catholic doctrines concerning the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Communion of Saints. Sadly, however, at every turn of a new chapter, it looks like this author is ashamed of being Catholic! He presents his points like a Liberal Universalist, making this book a painful read. Everything goes, everything that has a label of \\"Christian\\" being slapped on it seems to be OK as long as one hold to some vague notion of a faint belief in \\"Jesus\\". Whatever \\"Jesus\\" this author wants to present, it sure doesn't sound like the Jesus who founded the Catholic Church!Jesus did NOT command his disciples to become Bible peddlers or go out and write or print Bibles. Go read Galatians Chapter 1. There is only ONE original \\"Gospel\\", NOT 30,000+ competing \\"gospels\\" and interpretations of Christianity and divisive paths to salvation. There is only ONE visible Church that has existed for over 2000 years on this earthly planet that has stood the test of time, and that is the one and only Catholic Church. Prof. Alan seems to think otherwise with his Universalist attitude. Until Vatican 2 came about, the Church is defined plainly as the one and only Roman Catholic Church. No loose Liberal talk before Vatican 2.Prof. Alan makes some good points but I won't recommend this book to a Protestant because the author presents the Catholic Faith in a self-defeating manner. He defeats himself by writing that the aim of ecumenism is not to covert another person. Too much loose, Liberal talk all throughout the book, typical of supporters of that Liberal Vatican 2 Council!Why write this book, Prof. Alan?Why should anyone become Catholic if one can be saved outside the Catholic Church?Why correct error if one can still be saved in error and live one's life with false beliefs that don't lead to the one and only Jesus who founded the Catholic Church? Prof. Alan states that Jesuit priest Fr. Lenoard Feeney was \\"excommunicated\\" for holding the strict interpretation of \\"No salvation outside the Church\\". This is inaccurate. Please check your facts with the St. Benedict Center, Professor Alan, as to the circumstances surrounding the case of Fr. Feeney. The Church has always held the strict interpretation of that dogma \\"Extra ecclesiam nulla salus\\" till the pro-Protestant, Liberal Vatican 2 Council officially fanned the smoke of satan into the Church, resulting in all the rampant confusion, liturgical abuses and scandals of all sorts in the Catholic Church today.To be Catholic is to be Christian.To be called Catholic is to be synonymously be called Christian.They're one and the same.No Protestant existed before the 16th century.All non-Catholic positions and belief systems were never recognized as being Christian, before, during and after the Protestant Revolt in the 16th century.If you don't know that, you don't know your own history.Protestants may have hijacked the name of \\"Christian\\" in recent times to appear cool, but what kind of \\"Jesus\\" are they preaching? Certainly not one who loves his own mother, certainly not one who can agree even with \\"himself\\".Recommended reading:Radio Replies: Three Volume SetCatholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"A Protestant Pastor Looks at MaryBorn Fundamentalist, Born Again CatholicCrossing the Tiber: Evangelical Protestants Discover the Historical ChurchAa-1025: The Memoirs of a Communist's infiltration in to the Church.Liberalism Is a SinCatechism of the Council of Trent (Saint Benedict Press Classics)Canons and Decrees of the Council of TrentDogmatic Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent, Vatican Council I, Plus the Decree on the Immaculate Conception and the Syllabus of Errors"},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"On almost any catholic belief, this book takes you to the major scriptural references.

The Catholic faith is being questioned and challenged by Catholics and non-Catholics and I find that this book gives me easy to read explanations to questions that I might have about being a Catholic. I feel confident that I can explain and clarify misconceptions that others may have about Catholicism.

It helped me to understand that we have more incommon (ie the person of Jesus Christ) than I ever expected. It gave us great hope and strengthened both of our faiths. I have recommended this book to many contemplating marriage or who are frustrated and looking for answers in this area. It is clearly written in language that on catholics and catholics can both understand."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"I am not a Catholic but enjoyed this book very much when I first read it sometime ago. Dr. Schreck has written a book that goes beyond the usual Catholic apologist rhetoric and simply explains his position without resulting to silly arguments and questenable tactics.His writing style is easy and likeable. He is not so bent on trying to prove, in my opinion, as much as he is trying to share the essence of Catholic beliefs to outsiders. The book is probably, though not necessarily, directed to protestants. I say this because he addresses many protetsant objections to Catholism, without seeking to enrage those on the other side. It is a sharpe way of presenting one's faith, without causing more flame to the fire.The book is not the most detialed or academic of its kind, but this again is a strength. The layperson, who most needs to read and better understand the Catholic faith and practice, will find this book most appealling (at least I hope so). I think this was the author's intent. A great little book."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"This is an excellent book for all Christians and non-Christians alike. It offers a brilliant and clear explanation of Catholic beliefs and how they are commonly misunderstood... if you're a Catholic questioning your faith or a Protestant who wants to know the truth about Catholic beliefs, READ THIS BOOK! Schreck is a godsend."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"Like no other book, Dr. Schreck explains the truths of the Catholic Faith in a very readable fashion. Personally, I am a convert to the Catholic Church from Protestantism, and I cannot say enough on how this book helped me understand the so-called &quot;deceptions and lies&quot; of the Catholic Church. Dr. Schreck also uses copious amounts of Scripture, which ought to be a welcomed sight for those who thought the Catholic Church &quot;ditched&quot; Scripture. I have since used this book in an Adult Education setting in our parish, and it was well received! This book is a MUST for anyone who is grappling with the Catholic Faith!"},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"Though it is sometimes a little bit too theological for the average non-Catholic, \\"Catholic and Christian\\" is a nice beginning book for those interested in the Church and her members. I converted to Catholicism in 2000, and I accepted the majority of the Church's beliefs on a Biblical and rational basis. Some of the beliefs, however, had to be accepted based on Catholic Tradition and faith. This is where things get tricky.Schreck attempts to explain the major aspects of Catholicism to his readers using solid Biblical references. Most Protestants should find this very helpful in digesting some of the beliefs of the Church since I'm assuming that many of them attend Bible-based churches. Schreck makes a strong case for the belief in the Pope, quoting and referencing scriptures that many Protestants(as I once did) used against the Church. His argument for the Eucharist and the transubstantiation of it is brilliant, as he adds Biblical strength to an already strong, though tough to understand for most Protestants, argument.When Schreck tackles touchier subjects such as the Communion of Saints and, the literal Mother of them all, Mary, he has to rely heavier on Catholic Tradition. This does make it a little easier for non-Catholics to refute these beliefs, but Schreck delivers his stance with ease and care. In other words, he states that his faith and reliance on the wisdom of the Church's elders kicks in. That's hard to argue with, and in the end, Schreck makes it clear that he isn't trying to convert anyone into becoming Catholic. Instead, he is merely stating his beliefs and the general beliefs of the Church as a whole in order to make non-Catholics a little more accepting of Catholics.This is a good, inoffensive book to give to your non-Catholic friends and anyone who is interested in the Church in general. All of the facts of faith are laid out in a wonderful way that won't turn away even the staunchest Protestant. Another wonderful description of the Church's belief system can be found in \\"Why Do Catholics Do That?\\" It has an even looser delivery that is easy to take in, though it isn't quite as stacked reference-wise."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"Lacking the obvious strident cavalier attitude of some Catholic apologists, Alan Scheck sets forth a good case for his Catholic beliefs. While this Evangelical reviewer was not persuaded to convert as result of this book (indeed, it would appear that the work is meant more to explain Catholic dogma to Catholics than to underscore to &quot;separated bretheren&quot; the &quot;error&quot; of our ways), its explanations are well written, and the author has clearly done his homework. His treatment of both Protestants, and the beliefs of Protestants, is fair, Christ-like, and diplomatic- albeit not error free- although, the man clearly stands his ground. For any Evangelical Protestant who wants a fair, concise counterpoint to his own views in this area, I recommend this work. My only criticism of the work is that it omits a discussion of the issue of the inclusion of the deuterocanonical books of the Apocrypha by the Roman Catholic church. This is an important topic, and it would have been beneficial to see Schreck deal with it."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"For my money, Schreck's book is by far the best book of its kind that I've seen. He examines the issues that sometimes come between Catholics and Protestants with clarity and with charity to both sides. Unlike some apologetics works, Schreck's book promotes understanding and respect rather than divisiveness among Christians."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"This is a wonderful apolgoetics text, a &quot;must&quot; for every serious Catholic. It is broken into basic categories, and contains references from Scripture, the early Church Fathers, and Church Councils, defending the core tenets of the Catholic Church.

Irenic and respectful, Schreck's style will not offend anyone of a nonCatholic persuasion.One reviewer mentioned that he regretted that Schreck didn't go into a detailed explanation of the Catholic Church's inclusion of the Deuterocanonical books into our Catholic bibles. Good observation, but there was really no need to. All Christians prior to the 16th century ACCEPTED the deuterocanonical works (the Alexandrian Canon) which Luther, on no authority whatsoever other than his own whim, threw OUT of the established canon (as he also tried to throw out Revelation, Hebrews, 2nd Peter, James, and the Letter of Jude, an unpleasantry often kept carefully hidden from protestants by their Sunday School teachers!!).I would heartily recommend Catholic and Christian to any and all who would like an accurate understanding of Catholic belief. God's blessings to you all!"},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"In the preface to this new, revised 20th anniversary edition of Catholic and Christian, author Alan Schreck reflects upon the centrality of the Eucharist at the core of the Catholic tradition as John Paul II calls us to enter the \\"Year of the Eucharist\\". This book covers all of the topics we Catholics are frequently asked about in conversation by our non-Catholic friends: Mary, the Communion of Saints, the Pope and more. The book is not only of value for its apologetic purposes, but also for any Catholic (or for individuals wanting to inform themselves about the Faith) who wants to learn more about the traditions at the core of our Church. The topics covered remain timely in an era when many are striving to understand the true teachings of the Church."},{"Title":"Catholic and Christian: An Explanation of Commonly Misunderstood Catholic Beliefs","review":"As a non-denominational Christian who has not held a bias against Catholicism, I was interested in learning more about the doctrines that disturbed me within the Catholic faith. The approach of this book is to go topically, completely addressing through Scripture and Tradition, the \`commonly misunderstood Catholic beliefs.'I personally found myself challenged and strengthened through the reading of Schreck's explanations. I felt an outpouring of warmth, grace and community as he gently dealt with issues that set off firestorms elsewhere. I highly recommend this book both as a handbook for misunderstood Catholic concepts, and a starting point of dialogue between Protestants and Catholics.The ten chapters include: Salvation, Where Do Catholic Beliefs Come From?, The Church, Leadership and Authority, The Pope, The Work of the Holy Spirit, The Sacraments, The Communion of Saints, Mary, and Man's Destiny in Christ.

Schreck describes his work as an effort \\"to contribute to a better understanding of the teaching and tradition of the Catholic Church so that Catholics and other Christians may grow together in unity in our Christian life and in our common proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\\" We must band together, he writes, to defend the faith against \\"the relativism and unbelief that are rampant in the post-Christian West. Thus begins a wonderful reference book for Catholics and others regarding Church teaching on salvation, the origin of Catholic beliefs, the Church and her authority, the work of the Holy Spirit, the sacraments, the Communion of Saints, Mary, and Man's Destiny in Christ.
