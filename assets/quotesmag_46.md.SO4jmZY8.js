This intriguing novel kept me involved and transported to the streets with the main character, Eddie Dunne, and his gritty search for his kidnapped daughter. As the events unfold, I felt the rumbling of the el overhead, Eddie's exasperation, the twists and turns of dealing with his past links with the New York Police and the Russian mob. I tried to guess the results and was still surprised by the ending! Neatly tied sequences and lots of drama kept the pages turning. The action in this story would be a great movie!"},{"Title":"The Con Man's Daughter","review":"To date, The Con Man's Daughter, is my most favorite ED Dee Novel.

Well, maybe another book from ED Dee soon!!"},{"Title":"The Con Man's Daughter","review":"This was a pretty good read. It's a fairly effective combination: hard-edged ex-cop with a checkered past has to find his kidnapped daughter. Good stuff. Sort of like Dan Simmons' protagonist, Joe Kurtz, although not as misanthropic. If you like detective or cop stories you'll probably enjoy it. So why 3 stars and not 4? One complaint: our hero keeps losing his gun. Literally. He keeps getting clobbered (despite being armed) then disarmed, then pummeled. Once, okay. 2 or 3 times is too many. So, 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Con Man's Daughter","review":"When his daughter is kidnapped, ex-cop Eddie Dunne resolves to bring her back, not matter what it takes. He hears a rumor that a Russian mobster is involved and firebombs his Rolls Royce--and is completely unfazed when the FBI tells him that human remains were found in the car. For Eddie, his daughter matters and nobody else amounts to anything. Eddie thrashes around, beating up people, shooting them in the feet, and getting beat up himself, but doesn't seem to be getting anywhere. Until he comes across evidence of a Lesbian affair involving the Russian mobster's wife. That's when things really get nasty.Author Ed Dee writes with a noire style. New York is gritty, dangerous, and filled with criminals--and the cops are worse. Although a kidnapped daughter is a potentially emotional event, Dee's writing holds the reader back from emotionally identifying with the character. None of the characters in the story are truly innocent and none engage the reader in anything other than horror.Dee is a retired New York police lieutenant and clearly knows his law enforcement. The police procedural details make the story feel real. THE CON MAN'S DAUGHTER is an interesting story. Dee's writing makes you want to find out what is going to happen next--it just doen't make you care much about whether it happens to Eddie, his daughter, or anyone else."},{"Title":"The Con Man's Daughter","review":"The Con Man's DaughterByEd DeeHe's back...Been missing noted police author Ed Dee's style and gritty realism?

Richard Stevens published the ever-popular Unix Network Programming [UNP] back in 1990, followed the second edition in 1998. With a dedication to the memory of R. Stevens, the UNP book found itself two new authors, Bill Fenner and Andrew M. Rudoff, who would write the third edition of this book. The third edition has many updates, a new look and feel and many of new chapters that cover the topics more applicable these days. In my opinion, it is still the most valuable and profound text in the context of Network Programming.For those of us who have the first two editions of this book, the third edition has the following changes in effect:IPv6 updates. In the second version of the book, IPv6 was merely a draft and the sections covering IPv6 has been updated to take these changes into effect.POSIX updates. The functions/APIs and examples have been updated to reflect the changes to the latest version of the POSIX specification (1003.1-2001)SCTP coverage. 3 new chapters that cover this new reliable, message-based transport protocol have been added.Key Management Sockets coverage. Network security and its applicability and use with IPsec.Updated Operating Systems and machines that are used to run the examples in the book.Some topics such as Transaction TCP and X/Open Transport Interface have been dropped.Many topics and sections have been updated with the authors' comments. These comments even though simple for someone new to the profession, are extremely useful as they are like hints and tips from one developer to the next to help you out in your next programming assignment.If this is the only edition of the book that you are reading, you are in for a treat. Topics in Network Programming are covered in detail and using concrete programming examples that all of us can relate to - all Unix, but what else is there?! All kidding aside, the topics are covered well enough that they are useful information under any Operating System. The concepts don't change; sockets are sockets under any Operating System. The function call is different, but one needs to go thru the same steps under any environment.Being the most popular networking protocol, TCP/IP is covered in Part I of the book. One needs to have prior understanding of the TCP/IP protocol and the OSI model, however. If this is the first time you are looking at the programming aspects of networking protocols, Part I of this book will cover the basics. It starts you off with a couple of simple examples such as daytime client and a daytime server and it builds on that as the reader reads along. TCP, UDP and SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) are covered in brief in Part I, and basic concepts such as the three-way handshake of TCP and the four-way handshake of SCTP are depicted.Part II of the book covers sockets and socket programming. Topics such as the socket Address Structure in IPv4 and IPv6 for TCP, UDP and SCTP are covered and examples (the same daytime client/server) are given to convey the point to the reader. It is important to mention here that all the topics and concepts are depicted for the three transport protocols: TCP, UDP and SCTP. Every single socket API under the Unix programming environment is covered and examples are given for each function call to show the reader how the function can be utilized. An entire chapter has been dedicated to Socket Options and how they are used/can be used for best results. Hints are given throughout the chapter to tell the user about the pitfalls and best practices of each option.After the basics have been covered, various I/O models are depicted in detail and examples are shown to convey the pro's and con's of each I/O model. The five I/O models used thru the book and available under the Unix environment are:Blocking I/ONon-blocking I/OI/O Multiplexing (using select and poll)Signal driven I/OAsynchronous I/OSCTP - Stream Control Transmission Protocol, a new IEFT standard are covered in later chapters of 9 and 10 and again in chapter 23. The two interface models of SCTP (one-to-one and one-to-many) are covered in detail, and their differences with TCP are also explained in full. The client/server example that has been used throughout the book is ported to use the new SCTP protocol. The authors then go into great detail explaining the problems that SCTP solves over TCP and where and how it would be useful to use SCTP.Advanced topics such as IPv4 and IPv6 portability, Unix Domain Protocols, Multicasting and advanced Socket programming for UDP, TCP and SCTP cover the rest of the chapters in this book.Various options for interoperability between IPv4 and IPv6 start off the last section of the book. A chapter on Advanced I/O functions brings the reader a new perspective of how complicated Network Programming can become. Non-blocking I/O, befits and examples are covered in chapter 16. The topics on Multicasting, and adding reliability to UDP are probably my favorite chapters in this book. The Time Server that has been used throughout the book is re-coded to become a multicast application. Some issues that arise when designing multicast applications such as multicast on a WAN are also discussed.The third edition of the UNP book is as good as ever. The updates truly reflect solutions to today's challenges in Network Programming. Bill Fenner and Andrew Rudoff did an amazing job continuing the work a true legend in the field of Computer Science."},{"Title":"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API (3rd Edition)","review":"This book, as with all other Stevens books, can be used as either a tutorial or reference. The depth of information here is unparalleled. I continue to be impressed with the detail in this book. Fenner and Rudoff have done an outstanding job of maintaining quality and tradition this invaluable reference. Avid Stevens fans will not be disappointed.3rd edition updates include:*IPv6 added*POSIX 1003.1-2001 added*XTI dropped*T/TCP dropped*SCTP added*Key Management Sockets for use with IPSec Added*Machines used for examples updated*Other material updated where appropriate (including new functions)I bought this book a year ago along with Stevens \\"Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment\\" I read most of this book as a tutorial on network programming. I continue to use it as reference. I also read all of APUE. Since then I've added TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1 and UNIX Network Programming, Volume 2 to my collection. I've come to apprecaite the painstaking detail, pure clarity, and conciseness that are the hallmarks of all Stevens books.I'm thankful that Rudoff and Fenner updated this classic. This book is all most will need for the sockets API. I don't have the second edition, but I'm quite happy with the third. It's good to have something that speaks to IPv6. This is the best of the old and new. I wouldn't mind seeing an updated version of TCP/IP Illustrated volumes 1 and 2 either if Fenner and Rudoff are up to it.All of the Stevens books compliment each other really well. Truth be told, the more Stevens books you read the better off you are."},{"Title":"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API (3rd Edition)","review":"While not a C programmer by any means, I decided to take some time and tackle the UNIX Network Programming book. I found that lots of early college classes came back to me as I forged a few pages in. It was clear from the very beginning that this book was going to be a very detailed study on all aspects of IP networking as it relates to UNIX programmers. Even for someone who isn't initiated in the topic or really even interested, it was quite an experience to read through the hundreds of flow charts and detailed examples of C code showing how to perform all kinds of interesting network tasks.From a simple HTTP GET to detailed network file and connectivity operations, including TCP and UDP packets, ports, sockets and so on, there is a place in the book for each kind of network programming service. There is also a fair amount of text dealing with debugging techniques, allowing even those programmers who are experienced in their craft to find new ways to ferret out the problems in their code. The book also promotes good stylistics in programming, engendering the idea that readable and understandable code is better code than that which simply works.There are also examples and explanations for IPv6?, for any programmer who is going to be making the leap into next generation networks. There are also instructions on how to deal with wireless networks, security models and other topics for anyone who plans on designing network applications or specialized network configurations.It's probably not accurate to rate a book on a topic that holds little interest to the reader, but even a modest script programmer can tell when a book hits a subject just right and brings out all the details in a concise, easy-to-understand way. If you're a hard-core network programmer, this book is definitely for you. If not, you may find you learn something anyway."},{"Title":"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API (3rd Edition)","review":"I was required to use this book for my networking programming class. I'm in my senior year of college and having quite a bit of experience with textbook, I can say with confidence that this is one of the better textbooks out there. You can definately teach yourself network programming with this book and the accompanied source examples.... makes a handy reference guide as well. Worth the investment for Computer Science Engineers."},{"Title":"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API (3rd Edition)","review":"Im an Australian final year undergrad CS student, we used this as the text for a course 'Network Programming'. This book is very well written and explains not only the process of writing networked applications using C, but also how the actual protocols such as TCP, UDP etc work. This gives you a solid understanding of the 'whys' of network programming and not just the 'hows'. Overall this is a great book for those wanting to learn about network programming in Unix systems or those wanting a refresher. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API (3rd Edition)","review":"This will become the new classic of Unix Network Programming. When I first heard that there was a new edition, I was afraid that the classic would be destroyed. Although it is quite different and much of it has been done by &quot;et al&quot;, it turns out to be quite good.Initially I did a quick scan and immediately saw some things missing (like FTP). However, after reading the book and realizing how infrequently I had referenced the missing parts in the first book, I was much happier. With the additional IPv6 information and newer technologies, this more than made up for the deletions (from volume one).The text is easy to read and flows logically. What really impressed me was the depth of the expertise. For me, there had been some stumbling blocks in TCP and UDP development early on (especially nuances of UDP) that took a fair amount of time to figure out. I was pleasantly surprised to see many of those difficulties laid out cleanly for anyone to figure out in a matter of minutes. That alone is worth the price of the book.The index is extensive and helpful. The questions at the end of each chapter are limited, but enough to be useful in a college course.The printing is high quality. The paper is high quality (thin, but strong so that the 1000 page book is not huge or heavy). The printing takes up much of the page (i.e., not two-inch borders like some books). The binding lies flat without separating the pages. Definitely a quality printing.Yes, a new classic."},{"Title":"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API (3rd Edition)","review":"The book contains everything that I want to know about the Unix Sockets API. The book is well structured, and the explanations are generally good. I would give it 4 stars if it was possible.I do have a few minor gripes though. The text can be a bit dull compared to other books. I bought \\"Programming with POSIX(R) Threads\\" by David R. Butenhof at the same time, and this book is much more entertaining while still factual and correct.I dislike that all the examples in the book uses a special header defined in the Appendix. That makes it impossible to use snippets of code from the examples to make your own applications."},{"Title":"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API (3rd Edition)","review":"This book is a must have for anyone who writes networking code in C or C++ for UNIX/POSIX systems. It is complete, easy to understand, and stands up well both to skimming and to use as a reference.Surprisingly, it includes both multithreaded I/O concepts, raw sockets, routing sockets, and even IPv6 (in amazing detail) and SCTP.This book is worth its weight in gold to anyone from a student to a professional."},{"Title":"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API (3rd Edition)","review":"The book is really great. Most if not all serious UNIX programmers out there have a copy of Stevens books that they hold close to their hearts as well as to their UNIX/Linux machine. This new edition continues the tradition of presenting excellent content and adds on the original Stevens edition with new topics.There is a number of changes in this new edition that are very important. First the ccoverage of the new SCTP protocol in chapters 9 and 10. Then the coverage of the new IP protocol, IPv6 and its interoperability with IPv4 in chapter 12 and Appendix A.In addition, the coverage of an important feature: POSIX standards which is a single UNIX specification. Plus the extensive coverage of whatever API that exist!All owners of the previous edition realize the value of this book and the excellent quality of the material it presents. This new edition continues in the same direction with new additional contents. For people who are new to this book, this is a great book on Unix programming, a very well known and respected classic that is a must to have.A definite recommendation."},{"Title":"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API (3rd Edition)","review":"With the updated third edition, this book keeps getting better and better with age. I've been using this book since 1991 when I was a green programmer who got assigned to his first real Unix project. I'm not one to give out praises lightly but let me say that this is the BEST network programming book around. Stevens had a way of taking a complex subject and in a few pages--if you follow the examples--making it crystal clear. The new authors, I believe, are continuing this fine tradition.Practically everything about network programming is here. There are many examples on how to use socket(), bind(), listen(), select(), accept(), connect(), read(), write(), you name it. There are lots of sample code on how to write robust TCP/UDP clients and servers. The programming style is clear and easy to understand. This new edition updates the original text to conform to the POSIX standard.This book will not make you an expert overnight, but it will help you become an expert. There are other network programming books out there, to be sure, but this one tops the list."},{"Title":"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API (3rd Edition)","review":"I learned both network programming and threaded programming (pthreads) from this book (the 1998 2nd edition), and it was a great teacher. I used it to design and implement a client server protocol for a research project involving 10 machines and about 15 communicating processes. One of the things I really appreciate about the book is the detailed examples.After the concepts (a server 'listens' for a connection; a client initiates a connection) and basics of packets and sockets, the book presents a simple tcp server and client -- the server simply echos back whatever the client sends. Next, it discusses what can go wrong with the simple version, and presents an improved echo server that behave better when the client crashes (and likewise an improved client).The book continues to improve on the basic client/server, including address resolution, and servers that handle multiple clients using forks, threads, non-blocking I/O. This is all I needed to learn from the book, and it's all in the first half of the book.Particularly useful is Chapter 27, Client-Server Design Alternatives. To me it alone was worth the price of the book. Here the book discusses concurrent servers with three basic architectures:(1) non-blocking I/O, no threads or forks (advantage: full control of resource allocation; disadvantag: complexity);(2) spawn a thread or fork for each client (simplest implementation; potential problem of too many children);(3) servers that pre-allocate a pool of threads or forks (a happy medium; faster).Other chapters discuss broadcasting, multicasting, out of band data, routing sockets, and raw sockets; all topics I hope to learn some day. Again, this is a great book. The 3rd edition brings it up to date for IPV6 and numerous small improvements."},{"Title":"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API (3rd Edition)","review":"The book was great. It covers both the basics for the TCP/IP API in Unix and some advanced techniques of Network Programming. The book was a very easy read and flowed great. There were plenty of code examples so you could read and see how the functionality would work. Besides this being a great reference tool for any Unix Programmer, it is a great tool for anyone looking to develop Unix apps with the new IPV6 standard. The book thouroughly covers both IPV4 and IPV6. When using it as a reference tool, the index is amazingly detailed. It makes finding the information your looking for quick and easy. This is one book that a Unix Programmer can't do without."},{"Title":"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API (3rd Edition)","review":"This is by far the most comprehensive, easy to understand book regarding Unix Network Programming I have come across. Professors in most major university treat teaching unix network programming like brain surgery, they make it as difficult as possible. The book explain every concept in an easy to understand language, TCP, UDP,SCTP, etc, you name it is all here. There is so much to learn from this book for all users novice and advanced and it also makes an excellent reference book. Every unix network programmer should have this book by their side, this is the unix networking programming bible. Like we say in wall street, a great investment, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API (3rd Edition)","review":"This book consists of \\"in the trenches\\" information Mr. Stevens learned over the years by reading source, testing thoroughly, documenting extensively, and assembling carefully all this data into one heck of a book on Unix programming. I feel certain in declaring that many who've developed code on Unix know instantly of Stevens' works. This update to his book appears just as thorough.I do agree with a previous reviewer who was unhappy with the code samples' dependency on a header file in the back of the book. It's a clumsy technique, but it's difficult to imagine another way to accomplish the goals of including the header."},{"Title":"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API (3rd Edition)","review":"This book is excellent.

The book is well organized and has a lot more information than I expected (Raw sockets, Packet capture, IPv6 etc). Everything is explained clearly and with a lot of examples. It's a shame that the author passed away because I would buy any other book he wrote.

Appendix A manages to give a fairly thoroughintroduction to both IPv4 and IPv6 in less than 20 pages.This will be very popular in universities.The book also continues to be a living history of UNIX,where many given API calls are not only defined and explained,but documented as to how the API call came into being, howmany different versions of the function existed, why it gotchanged and when, along with recommended do's and dont's...All around, a must buy for developers and evennon-developers who want to understand a bit of thethe true nature of the 'plumbing' that underliesthe Internet."},{"Title":"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API (3rd Edition)","review":"I bought this book for work.

What more can I say?! Oh yea, it was reasonably priced too."},{"Title":"Strategies for Asia Pacific","review":"A fair view on Asian markets and management from the perspective of frequent travel to Asia, but without actual managing experiences. For the novice to the region it sketches out the fundamentals. However, the book has a tendency to portray the characteristics of an early entrepreneurial Asia and past experiences of early market penetration by Western companies as an actual situation, but which is outlived in the meantime. The authors don't deliver much of an update, and fail to deliver a thorough overhaul of their views from the first edition. They don't cover much of what has changed in Asia actually. They still need to postulate fundamental differences in Asian business to build on a myth, where others have already a much more differentiated view. Philip Kotler's new 'Marketing management - an Asian perspective' has a much better grasp of reality in Asian business management, although covering only marketing. While giving helpful insights for managers new to Asia, this book by Lasserre/Schutte doesn't reflect the actual trends and changes in Asian business management triggered by the crisis! The chapter'Managing human resources'builds on outdated(1994)considerations, that don't reflect the actual drive for performance-based HR management for higher productivity. Other chapters 'Asian business logic, Cooperating.., Organising' do also not reflect too much of the modern business realities in Asia in favor of keeping a more 'mythical' view of what was a perceived reality in the early days of contacts with Asian markets and business."},{"Title":"Strategies for Asia Pacific","review":"Overall I think this is a good book, especially for giving one an overview behind the growth of Asia prior to the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997. I've spent a lot of time in the region both before, during and after the crisis, interacting with the region's business and government leaders. It's a daunting task for anyone to talk, let alone write a book, about such a dynamic and ever changing region. This book has done the job well."},{"Title":"Strategies for Asia Pacific","review":"I did not see much difference between this and the previous edition written several years previously and before the crisis. Over this book, I strongly recommend Haley, Tan and Haley's &quot;New Asian Emperors: the Overseas Chinese, their Strategies and Competitive Advantages&quot; as an expert account of how to do business in Asia."},{"Title":"The Woodbook","review":"Anybody taking this book to hand will be impressed. The publisher went all out to make this as luxurious an edition as possible, even providing a plywood box to keep the book in. The printing quality is beautiful and the woods are presented in close to (glorious) natural color. For every wood a separate picture is presented, as is proper, of a transverse, a radial and a tangential surface (ie a cross, a quartersawn and a flatsawn surface).However, lots of quibbles are possible. Firstly the book is misnamed: the title 'The_Woodbook' suggests rather more than is actually covered. It is a reprint (sort of) of 'The_American_Woods' which also was misnamed, presenting only woods grown in the US. It is safe to say that better than 95% of the important woods of the world are not present in 'The_Woodbook'. Secondly it is not an actual reprint. It would be more acurate to say that it is a facsimile reproduction of the woods in one of the copies of 'The_American_Woods' accompanied by modern text. This modern text is an amalgamation of that in 'The_American_Woods' and of that in Sargent's masterpiece. More troublesome in my opinion is the 'artsy' approach with the black background of all the pages (except those which are golden): this blackness is not only on the verge of being depressing, but also is hindering easy reading of the text and outright blocks being able to view the line-drawings of tree morphology on every page (actually I must admit that after browsing through the book several times I only discovered these drawings after having read in the introduction that a drawing was presented on every page. A search then turned them up quickly). The printing quality of these drawings is fairly good but it is very hard to make them out against the background (tilting the book to catch a favorable gleam of light does help). The supporting text is of course quite brief, due to the fact that it must be repeated on the same page in german and french, and still leave room for artistic black (or golden) 'white' space. On the upside, errors in botanical names are actually quite few, at least when disregarding the offences against author names.All in all, this is a very creditable effort, which will be treasured by many who love wood (and especially so in the US)."},{"Title":"The Woodbook","review":"A facsimile of a rare masterpiece: a 14-volume treasury of American woods that appeared a century ago.

If you already know something about the subject, you will probably find that it is long on history and short on culture. The author goes out of his way to keep the political context in the forefront and always maintains the chronological order of his story, even when the development of some cultural features (e.g., Japanese Buddhism) may not be well-served by that approach. Most of the major features we associate with Japanese culture are mentioned. Too many of them are only mentioned in passing, and could have merited more in-depth treatment.Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to denigrate the book too much; when it appeared, most western readers knew little enough on the subject, and most of what they could obtain was either fanciful, biased or just plain unreadable. The tide has turned, and there is so much material available on Japanese culture nowadays that it's hard for the beginner to figure out where to start. If he or she starts with this book, they could do far worse."},{"Title":"Japan;: A short cultural history, (The Cresset historical series)","review":"It would probably not be much of a stretch to claim that as late as the decade following the end of the Pacific War in 1945, the popular take in the States on things Japanese, even among the more knowledgeable, was shaped largely by three classics: Sir George Sansom's Japan: A Short Cultural History (1931) and Ruth Benedict's The Chrysanthemum and the Sword (1946) against the background strains of Puccini's Madama Butterfly (1904). All three have had their critics and all three have survived comfortably into the 21st century.But the Cultural History is not just curious relic. It often describes, in clear and straightforward terms, items of cultural behavior which contemporary scholars are often tempted to dispute contentiously, present in technical jargon, or ignore completely. Take, for example, this introduction to the crucial distinction in Shinto between \\"ritual purity\\" and \\"moral guilt\\":. . . . . . . . The outstanding feature of Shinto observances is the attention paid to ritual purity. Things which are offensive to the gods were called by the early Japanese TSUMI, a word which is now rendered by dictionaries as \\"guilt\\" or \\"sin.\\" Avoidance of these things was called IMI, a word meaning taboo. The Imibe, as we have seen, were a class of professional \\"abstainers,\\" whose duty it was to keep free from pollution so that they might approach the gods without offence. Chief among the offences to be avoided was uncleanness. It might arise in many ways, none of which in other religions would be moral guilt. . . (p. 32ff.)Those with a bigger appetite for historical detail might consider starting, or continuing, with Sansom's later 3-volume narrative history: A History of Japan to 1334 (1958), A History of Japan 1334-1615 (1961), and A History of Japan 1615-1867 (1963). Sansom's stated reason for not continuing his history beyond 1867 is that he had lived too close to events of the Meiji Restoration (1868) for him to develop a perspective that only distance could supply.For readers interested in later events, The Making of Modern Japan (2000; 2002), by Marius B. Jansen, another outstanding scholar of Japanese history, would be a good choice. Since this history begins at 1600, there are overlapping accounts of the Edo period, but from two quite different perspectives."},{"Title":"Japan;: A short cultural history, (The Cresset historical series)","review":"While interested in culture, I have come to realize I am not very interested in cultural history. For one thing, it is difficult to convey a history of art or architecture or literature to a reader unless the reader is already conversant with historical examples of all of these. It is also true, for me at least, that a discussion of religious and philosophical ideas from a modern perspective, with reference to historical changes, is more enlightening than an attempt at a chronological history. On the other hand, cultural histories, such as Sansom's can provide political histories of just the right amount of detail, and this book does; and Sansom is generally able to convey the flavor of a Japanese cultural epoch. The book lacks a proper emphasis on economic and technical history. Possibly, this is due to gaps in the historical record, at least at the time this book was written (1931), since Sansom does pay attention to economics in the late stages of this book. The book does successfully stress morality and character. A Short Cultural History ends just before the Restoration in mid-19th century. The book's style is pleasantly informal, more in the style of an essayist than an academic. And despite the reservations I have expressed, I found that with a certain amount of skimming, it provides a very good introduction, one that encourages more reading. I give it 5 stars because of the challenge of writing a book such as this."},{"Title":"Japan;: A short cultural history, (The Cresset historical series)","review":"I purchased this book at great cost but it has been worthwhile.

Each match in this series explains how rivalries among scientists developed and what long-term effects the conflicts had for science and for the rest of us. Some of these issues remain almost solely personality clashes, such as the priority question over calculus between Newton and Leibnitz. Others, the choice of AC over DC for electrical power distribution and which nation would be the first to build a nuclear bomb, are meaningful to us all. Offering brief descriptions of the issues and personalities, each of the essays is a good synopsis of the science. The personality sketches are given with a strong emphasis on the contender's childhood where it can be derived. Although the relevance of the childhood foundations seems contrived in most cases, the information provides a \\"human\\" background of people who often seem remote from us.The topics and personalities are so disparate that a general assessment is difficult, if not impossible for this work. To his credit, White has focussed on fundamental questions and not been distracted by side issues. He is at pains to be \\"fair\\", avoiding judgmental approaches and emphasising long-term impact of the conflict's resolution. If the personality involved is too obtuse, stubborn or devious to withstand White's scrutiny, he makes it clear that the problem lies with that individual. However, as he admits, he's not the only one doing the judging. Aristotle's views of nature inexplicably dominated Western European thinking for two millennia because his proposed \\"four basic elements\\" could be merged with nearly any philosophy. Only reason backed by empirical evidence would overcome this long tradition.The variety of topics forces some selectivity in evaluating White's effort, but one essay may be exemplary. In describing the Monkeys and Men debate as a clash between Charles Darwin and Robert Owen, White stumbles badly. There was little \\"rivalry\\" in this so-called debate, since Owen simply flatly refused to accept species \\"transmutation\\". Since this concept was held by many educated people, Owen was already out of his time. White notes Owen's strategy of remaining anonymous, but doesn't criticise it. Since that was Darwin's chief objection to Owen, this is an amazing omission. Darwin's real problem, natural selection applied to humanity, was the major stumbling block to universal acceptance to his concept. White deals with that issue only in passing, and that incorrectly [Darwin mentioned \\"man and his beginnings\\" but once in Origin, not White's \\"few\\"]. He lauds Owen as England's \\"leading biologist\\", a questionable claim at best. Yet in his description of the clashes between Owen and Huxley, he avoids their confrontation over the hippocampus in ape brains, in which Huxley demonstrated his superior research abilities in Owen's own field. In dealing with Darwin's community of supporters, White mis-names Joseph Hooker as \\"John Hooker\\", even in the Index. How a biographer of Darwin could make this gaffe remains an enigma. Why, when Daniel C. Dennett has published the finest analysis of Darwin's Idea, White turns to an obscure work on science ideas for a quote from this eminent scholar is almost a greater mystery.White's collection targets a few direct confrontations since the Enlightenment to show how important of science has become to us. The \\"current wars\\", \\"reaching for the moon\\" and \\"the race for the prize\\" which revealed how DNA is structured [not \\"discovered\\" as White puts it] have impacted how meaningful science is to us. Except for some terrible editorial sloppiness [\\"prevarication and \\"procrastination\\" are not synonyms] the book is a readable and important work in that regard. White demonstrates how clashes over how natural forces work doesn't invalidate science. Instead, it is the root of the scientific method - postulation, examination and refutation or acceptance. He shows well the struggle science must engage in to reveal nature's secrets.

In fact, I was disappointed when I reached the end; I wanted more such stories. The author discusses eight rivalries peppered over the past three and a half centuries - from the mid-seventeenth to the dawn of the twenty-first. The author's writing style is very captivating. It is also friendly, clear, lively and highly accessible.The only criticism that I have pertains to Chapter 5 (concerning the Manhattan Project). I have read a great many books on this topic - both technical and historical. Based on their content, I found a few statements made in this chapter to be misleading if not simply wrong. But despite this shortcoming, this book does contain a wealth of highly fascinating information; I learned quite a bit from it.

It may be a little hard for completely non-technical people to follow. However, the \\"scientific rivalries\\" theory is more of an organizing principal than a well-developed theory. That's okay. The matching of rivals keeps it interesting and memorable."},{"Title":"The Trojan War (Webster everyreaders)","review":"It can be said with justification that the Iliad is the first \\"publication\\" in the literature of Western Civilization. Long passed verbally from generation to generation, it tells the story of a great war between the two mighty powers of the northeastern Mediterranean. It is also significant in that it describes the independent kingdoms of Greece managing to put aside their differences in order to defeat a common foe. As an initial element of literature, all students should be exposed to the Trojan War before they graduate from high school and this book will provide that exposure.Written at the level of the middle school student, the text is easily understandable and imparts reasonably complete knowledge of the war. It is also an excellent tie-in to the mythology of the Greeks and how they viewed their gods. In Greek lore, the gods were humanoids with super powers, but fraught with petty emotions which were also exaggerated. They were capable of jealousy, rage, unhappiness and favoritism, their fickleness was often considered the reason for plans going awry or success, especially on the battlefield. This is an excellent book for the study of the Greek view of the world."},{"Title":"Heart of the Problem: When You're Tired of 'Just Coping' with Your Struggles and Want to Find a Cure, You're Ready to Face the...","review":"This book is totally based on Scripture that God will use to change your life if you let Him.

To create success for oneself, one's organisation, community or nation, one needs to identify the primary forces that work in today's turbulent environment: the drivers of change in the private and public market place as well as within the workplaces. That, precisely, is what After Atlantis is about.In a sense, After Atlantis has not invented anything new. It is not old wine in a new bottle, either. The book leads the reader from the known to the to-be-known: Acknowledging and re-establishing the well-known fact that no one off-the-shelf solution can meet the challenges of organisations today, the authors seem to have succeeded in extracting a synergistic approach from the various disparate approaches that most of us are already familiar with. The book, however, does not (and it does not want to) offer a fish, but provides the wherewithal to fish in troubled waters.Starting with a clarification of the meaning of turbulence, After Atlantis proceeds to identify the basic drivers of change and turbulence and show how to set about managing them through the four phases of discontinuous innovation, continuous improvement, breakthrough improvement and another discontinuous innovation. These phases are dealt with in good detail.The recommendations of After Atlantis (for working, managing and leading in turbulent times) are extracted from the authors' own research of field-tested practices, which are well recounted in the book. The extracted process has been christened as The Shared Learning Process, which subsumes the approaches of Search Conference, Participative Design and TQM.Besides presenting a concise and practice-based process, the book also provides a tested architecture with which one can understand how to launch and sustain a quality management and continuous improvement process in an organisation. The logic of where, when and how to start is a specialty of this even otherwise special book.M.Joseph Arul, Ph.D., Professor at IRMA, Anand, India."},{"Title":"Romantic Music: A History of Musical Style in Nineteenth-Century Europe (The Norton Introduction to Music History)","review":"This was the book chosen by my professor for an undergraduate music history course, and I can safely say that it is an excellent textbook.

It's a collection of essays by different authors, all on the topic of exploitation of garment industry workers. There's a decent amount of information in this book, and it's related in an entertaining style, but I have two complaints: the information is not very organized, and the book is one-sided and does not even try to explain the arguments business leaders use to defend their practices. Even if you are fervently anti-sweatshop, you need to know the pro-sweatshop arguments so that you can refute them.&quot;No Sweat&quot; is a good start if you're interested in learning about the abuses of sweatshop labor, but if you want a more thorough, organized and balanced treatment of the subject, read &quot;The Sweatshop Quandary&quot;, edited by Pamela Varley."},{"Title":"No Sweat: Fashion, Free Trade and the Rights of Workers","review":"No one LIKES sweatshops...we know they're bad, & all hiss convincingly when the latest human rights violation in the garment industry is read off on the evening news. We shake our heads & swear we'll boycott, and we DO...until the story fades from the top of the hour & the remembrance of those that suffered is forgotten. Because in truth, we'd all just as soon pretend that all our garments are made by shining, happy people sitting in front of gently humming sewing machines, joyously making a living wage which allows for a movie every Friday night so that we can go on buying our clothes for cheap. NO SWEAT takes that gentle complacency, that warm cocoon of apathy & shatters it, laying the garment industry bare for all to see in every last bit of its infamy.Constructed out of the voices of a few, NO SWEAT speaks for millions. Including testimony from sweatshop workers themselves, along with activists, trade union organizers, journalists, academics & industry insiders, NO SWEAT covers the entire spectrum of the labor movement as it stands today, & gives us a not entirely promising glimpse into a future beset by our own apathy. Offering harrowing firsthand accounts from workers & ground level testimony from activists, NO SWEAT paints a very vivid picture of the immense dichotomy of the industry, which begins in the squalor of the sweatshop, but emerges on the catwalks. Some of the testimony seems hardly believable in this day and age, but the accounts are real & true, a sad testament to how far the movement has yet to go. Such is terribly affective, a powerful remonstration of our own apathy. Unfortunately, though the book does not attempt to appear objective, it does make a token effort to allow the other side a forum. While a great idea, ultimately, NO SWEAT doesn't go far enough in this vein, lending the preponderance of its pages to the labor movement, & only a few, always negative pages to industry insiders. This weakens the integrity of the piece as a whole. If the editors of NO SWEAT were not prepared to go all the way, then they should have never have made even the slightest pretension towards giving the other side a say. Such is only a small cavil however, among a great many strengths. NO SWEAT should occupy a place of prominence in every library."},{"Title":"Weapons: Designing the Tools of War (Innovators Series)","review":"Jason Richie's Weapons: Designing The Tools Of War covers the history of weapons design and weapons use in war, examining how early weaponry paved the way for weapons of the future.

It's a terrific text because it has both theory and applications (with emphasis on the former, though). The best thing about it at the time of its publication was it was very complete, covering almost everything that was known in econometrics at the time.Unfortunately, the book was never updated, and now nobody uses it; instead, people use the poorly written one by William Greene, which contributes to the poor education in grad-level econometrics these days. (Have you noticed that today's econometrics students, even the Ph.D. ones and even some assistant professors, don't even understand the relationship between R-squared and t-statistic? I get asked \\"why am I getting super-high t-statistics while my R^2 is so low?\\" all the time. If they had read Judge et al., they would have known the answer.)Even though I loved this book in teh early 90s, I cannot recommend it as a reference book because it is pretty much out of date. Sure, most of the basic stuff (OLS, 2SLS, limited dependent, etc.) is the same, but people who buy a thick book like this want an up-to-date volume, and this book unfortunately does not fit the bill.

Hamilton on the other hand focuses strictly on time series, and forecasting. If you want a solid reference for econometrics this is the most complete and well thought out book available."},{"Title":"The Theory and Practice of Econometrics (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)","review":"I received exactly the product I ordered.

Thus, it may not be relevant to study modern topics but lays the foundation exceptionally well. Does not cover modern topics,that's the only negative I found with this book.Otherwise, it's an excellent book for conceptual clarity. The book covers both frequentist and Bayesian approach to econometrics, and the coverage is crystal clear. It also has chapters on time series models and other topics, again exceptionally well written. To my understanding (and some of my professors/colleagues, who are stalwarts in Econometrics) this book is a must have for conceptual clarity and to students of theoretical econometrics."},{"Title":"The Theory and Practice of Econometrics (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)","review":"I don't want to say too much about this book. I use it a lot. But I think what is in this book has been said so much more clearly elsewhere.

But unless you need it for a class, I think there are better references out there."},{"Title":"The Treasury of Clean Church Jokes","review":"I work with senior citizens in a retirement center and I have learned over the years how important it is to be able to laugh. We have a Bible Study that is both serious and fun. We start off like the old Carson shows with humor, some political but mostly about the funny side of church, religion and the Bible. And one who thinks that humor was not used by Jesus Christ, Paul (who was a master of irony) and certain Old Testament characters needs to read the Bible anew. Forget what may be humor today, but read the stories with a view of people who lived during Biblical times. Of course we all have plenty to laugh about within our own churches and society today. This book has proven a valuable tool in our studies."},{"Title":"Air Bridge","review":"'Air Bridge' is one of Hammond Innes' best books. The plot is one of his cleverest and most audacious, and in Saeton he has created one of his most memorable antagonists.Former WW2 pilot and aircraft engineer Neil Fraser has found it difficult to adjust to civilian life, and has been reduced to stealing planes and flying them overseas to make a living. On the run in England, Fraser stumbles across Saeton at a deserted former RAF airfield, and Saeton offers to keep him hidden from the authorities in exchange for Fraser building a new aircraft engine. The aim is to install the engine on an aircraft bound for the Berlin Airlift, with a view to showing off in the most public fashion the engine's superior performance and economy. But the plans for this new engine have allegedly been stolen from the Germans, and Saeton will stop at nothing to prevent this becoming public knowledge. Seaton's increasingly ruthless drive to both complete the engine and keep the secret result in his transformation from a flawed protagonist at the beginning of the story to a genuine villain at the end, and Fraser's attempts to escape the tightening net Saeton draws around him forms the centrepiece of the novel. Innes does an outstanding job of charting this battle of wills; Saeton's enthusiasm is infectious despite his maniacal obsession, and Fraser's criminal past means he has nowhere to turn when Saeton goes over the edge.As always with Hammond Innes, the characters and setting make the book. The Berlin Airlift is realistically described and has an important place in events, and he does an excellent job in conveying the cold lonliness and claustrophobia of the abandoned wartime airfield. And the characters are some of his best; in addition to Fraser and Saeton, we have Tubby Carter as the naive-but-stubborn engineer, who works solidly at building the engine while blissfully unaware of the growing tension between the two main characters. There is Carter's wife, who uneasily balances romantic feelings for Saeton with her loyalty to Tubby. And then there is Else, the German girl whose father produced the plans Saeton allegedly stole. Innes traps all five characters at the deserted airfield early on, setting up an almost unbearable tension that results in the explosive events of the second half of the book. Saeton and his engines seem to dominate everyone and everything, and you always have the sense that the other characters are mere pawns in his hands, even if they don't know it.For those new to Hammond Innes, I would strongly recommend 'Air Bridge' as a good place to start. All the Innes elements are in place; \\"everyman\\" protagonist, a memorable antagonist who is the most well-drawn character, strong and capable female characters, and realistic settings. 'Air Bridge' is one of Innes' best ever books, and I highly recommend it not only as a thriller, but also as an outstanding character study and piece of descriptive writing.Five stars."},{"Title":"How They Found Christ: In Their Own Words","review":"Extracts of autobiographical writings by notable Christians, with a focus on the moment of conversion in their lives.

Spurgeon's \\"Look and Live!\\" is one of my favorites. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"How They Found Christ: In Their Own Words","review":"I cannot recommend any books or literature by the editor of this book. Once members of his congregation found Christ, he and his wife have to misled them away from Christ.Although Bill Freeman claims to be well versed in church history, he never mentioned that his wife, Patsy, derived her foremost playbook practices from our country's colonial history. U.S. Historians tell us that the practice of slavery was abolished in 1865. But, human trafficking and slavery are flourishing today. It had been perpetuated by Egyptians, Arab Muslims, Israelites, and Roman Christians. Muslim slavery preceded Christian slavery. The term \\"lynch\\" was derived from Willie Lynch of the West Indies. He was a British slave owner. The slave owners in the colony of Virginia were having trouble controlling their slaves. So, in 1712 they sent for Mr. Lynch to teach them his methods. He, basically, advised the slave owners to stop hanging, or \\"lynching\\" their troublesome slaves, and instead, start the process of breaking them down. Break them down to the point where all they knew to do is work and work themselves to death for you.Lynch's methods were very simple but they were diabolical: \\"Keep the slaves physically strong but psychologically weak and dependent upon the slave master. ... Keep the body, take the mind. In other words, break the will to resist. ... I use fear, distrust, and envy for control purposes. ... I shall assure you that distrust is stronger than trust and envy stronger than adulation, respect or admiration. Psychological and physical instruction of CONTAINMENT must be created... \\"Lynch's control methods are included among Patsy's playbook practices. She has employed versions of these as her basic template to retain loyal female followers for over 4 decades. See:[...] [...] [...]Christianity is not a weak and passive religion or merely a spectator sport. Jesus Christ came to set the captives free. According to history, most of the slave revolts were led by Christian ministers. John Newton penned the words to his Hymn, Amazing Grace, in his later life. In his early years, John had been pressed into the Royal Navy and served as a sailor in the slave trade. He later studied theology. Genuine Christian leaders should NEVER regress into making slaves out of their own congregations.In American cultural history, the Sixties was all about freedom. That's when the Freemans had their start. But, the Freemans may have subtly taken away our freedom in Christ and turned it into slavery to themselves. They've coerced followers with false promises of a better life. Many former Freeman followers will confirm that their lives actually shrunk after becoming involved with Patsy and Bill. If any of you are present Freeman followers and still consider yourselves to be \\"free,\\" then why not step away from your involvement with Patsy for a season? You owe it to yourself to see the big picture. The following was compiled from personal accounts of multiple people after decades of involvement with Patsy and Bill Freeman.A COMMON STORY--At an opportune time, often after one of us had been unrighteously treated by Patsy and we (perhaps mistakenly) opened our mouth to speak, Patsy would viciously target one of us to make an example and provide a \\"teachable moment\\" to impress her followers (slaves) to yield, keep their mouths shut, and remain dependent upon her every word and direction. (Remember Mr. Lynch's letter: slaves were to be kept \\"psychologically weak and dependent on the slave master.\\")No matter what we had done (or had not done), Patsy took intentional steps to attack us and employed her loyal disciples to carry out her lynchings and bullwhippings. Sound familiar? She further hardened her heart: banning us from Bill's church meetings and alienating our many close friends from us.What was this man's crime that his wife and children would be moved from their home under Patsy's direct supervision? Was he a thief? Was he a killer, or just a husband and father? What was his crime?Didn't he regularly attended their \\"church\\" meetings and volunteer his time? Didn't he donate money to Patsy and Bill? Didn't he help construct Freeman \\"church\\" buildings and remodel their upscale homes? Didn't he help in the preparation and printing of Bill's books? Didn't he help lead their singing and compose many of their songs? Hadn't he been loyal to the Freemans? Wasn't he a good slave?No matter what we did or didn't do, Patsy and her mob were the criminals. Our only crime had been to allow our wives to get too close to Patsy. Bill preached Biblical laws and principles that did nothing to protect us from Patsy's attacks. They just left us wondering \\"Why?\\" Some say nothing that erodes the rule of law can be moral. But, there are simply no rules of law or moral restraints present among Patsy's playbook practices. Entrusted to the Freemans, human salvation became twisted into human slavery.So, who are we to sit and do nothing while Patsy and her lies inflict further damage upon our friends and their marriages? Doing nothing is no longer an option.Not when the institution of marriage is being interfered in, and broken. Not when the growing number of divorces attributed to Patsy's meddlesome practices far outnumber the few intact marriage bonds remaining among Bill's present congregation. Not when she endorses and promotes the physical and emotional abuse of children among Christian households. Not when Patsy had denied many of her own female followers the personal joys of marriage and bearing children, simply because their practical and financial usefulness to her would be diminished thereafter. Not when we were forbidden from speaking up for ourselves in their \\"church\\" or speaking what we knew to be true about Patsy and Bill. Not when dozens of other Christian friends have been shamed, shunned, and excommunicated for speaking the truth about the Freemans. And, not when other born-again believers in Bill's \\"congregation\\" are still being set up and targeted by Patsy and her mob. I Tim 6:3-10.OBEDIENCE VS SUBMISSION--Thoreau wrote that you serve your country poorly if you do so by suppressing your conscience in favor of the law because your country needs consciences more than it needs conscienceless robots. He argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences. Likewise, for us to serve God, we must not suppress our conscience in favor of the Freeman agenda. A genuine church needs a congregation full of people with consciences. Not conscienceless robots following the Freeman doctrine of submission to \\"delegated authorities.\\"Martin Luther King wrote: \\"I became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. No other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than Henry David Thoreau.\\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a brilliant German Lutheran pastor and theologian, participated in the German resistance movement against Nazism during WWII. He adds: \\"Silence in the face of evil is itself evil: God will not hold us guiltless. Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.\\" Luke 19:39-46St. Augustine wrote that \\"an unjust law is no law at all.\\" This means that we have a right, even a duty to resist the Freeman's present practice of psychological slavery. Their abusive and immoral practices are not rooted in eternal law or natural law. We should resist their unjust laws and code of ethics that are out of harmony with our present moral laws and God's laws, including the Ten Commandments. Resist with violence or resist with civil disobedience. You should pray that we continue to choose the latter.What Patsy has refused to acknowledge is that she could never break many of us. Yes, she has broken and destroyed many marriages. Yes, she has fooled many of her women followers. Yes, she has brought shame and misery upon her own extended family and her deceived disciples. And, yes, she is proud of what she has done. But, her efforts have only strengthened our resolve, making us stronger and firmer in our convictions. More recently, her skittish behavior and frequent travels, her use of unlisted phone numbers, and the multiple homes maintained for her as hideaways and safe houses all reflect her growing paranoia and fear. Patsy has even directed the relocation of herself and her troops across state lines three times since 1998. Every five years she has intentionally moved to a different state, distancing herself and her remaining followers from growing opposition and renewed challenges from \\"former slaves.\\"BILL'S ROLE--Many of us have turned to Bill in anticipation of a righteous response. After all, Bill often boasted of being a \\"man of God.\\" Was Bill part of the problem or part of the solution? But, instead of a righteous response, Bill's repeated strategy has been to take the Fifth. He has done nothing and said nothing to atone for Patsy's actions and their aftermath. Even in 1999, when confronted during his last Scottsdale church meeting, Bill redirected blame back upon his former congregation for \\"giving Patsy too much control,\\" rather than acknowledge his own impotence. Hadn't he refused to respond to open letters from other churches in 1993 and again in 2004 denouncing Patsy's destructive actions? Hadn't Bill walked out on a 1986 Elder's Meeting that focused on Patsy's destructive influence upon marriages within his Seattle congregation? Hadn't Patsy and Bill removed themselves from the local churches shortly thereafter, rather than comply with local church leadership accountability? Bill's euphemisms and silence are both lies. The former is a lie of commission; the latter a lie of omission. Bill might be a man of many words, but he is certainly is not a \\"man of his word.\\" Benjamin Franklin adds several appropriate quotes: \\"There is a difference between imitating a good man and counterfeiting him. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.\\" 2 Tim 3:1-9, Matt 5:13-26So, without a trial and without an opportunity to speak or tell all you fine people what Patsy had done to us, Patsy let fly rumors and lies to close your ears and turn you away from anything we might say. After our original epiphany and our painfully enlightening encounter with Patsy's \\"lone wolf personality,\\" our eyes were now opened to see that the Freemans were certainly not who they pretended to be. They were not sincere \\"church leaders\\" and certainly not members of \\"God's house,\\" or even Bill's home grown version of \\"the pillar and base of the truth.\\" Rather, our struggle was between a truth powerless to act and a power that has become the enemy of truth. Meanwhile, Patsy busied herself further in her staged and closed courtroom as she selfishly controlled all outcomes while playing the role of our prosecuting attorney, judge, and jury. Do any consider this appropriate behavior of a \\"pastor's wife?\\"CONTROL VS COMMUNICATION--Would we be respectfully allowed to speak our mind? No. Would we be allowed to tell our \\"church friends\\" what Patsy has done? No. She would simply pronounce us \\"guilty as charged,\\" without allowing us to utter a single word in our own defense. Patsy continued to \\"play church\\" and further her exploits into character assassination by spreading slanderous lies that each of us in exile had succumbed to human vices and were now all drug addicts, alcoholics, addicted to pornography, or homeless. All were lies. She may have even convinced herself that her words could seal our fate. But remember, each of us had not been the aggressor; each was merely a slave. A slave lynched and bullwhipped to teach Patsy's other followers (slaves) an important lesson to remain psychologically weak and dependent upon the slave master (Patsy). Meanwhile, Patsy continued to follow Lynch's letter to keep the body and take the mind of her remaining followers (slaves). 1 Tim 3:15Presenting every man full-grown in Christ?--Since 1986, rather than training a young congregation of leaders to eventually shepherd other congregations and counsel other believers, Patsy and Bill have intentionally clipped the wings of many believers within Bill's congregation. The Freemans' selfish quest has been to retain their own following as a source of free \\"slave labor\\" and, more importantly, to maintain a sizeable financial stream in support of their extravagant lifestyles. Thus, instead of properly focusing on training-up members of Bill's congregation to become well-grounded with a balanced knowledge of the Bible, the Freemans have focused selfishly on themselves and manipulating followers into serving them as slaves to remodel their upscale properties and donate money to fuel their inflated self images. Some among us even turned over their entire paychecks to Patsy. Yet, none could become pastors in their own rite while remaining subservient to the Freemans. Only upon departure from their ingrown confines could we rediscover and regain the independent use of our right minds. Col 1:24-28Some among us are gifted speakers and well-educated men skilled in counseling others. But, the Freemans had tried to selfishly bottle up all our potential energies. None of us fully realized who we could become until Jesus broke each and every psychological fetter that Patsy had craftily constructed.Mary Alice Chrnalogar adds \\"Abusive discipleship is a prison of the mind which can imprison the body to accept the will of the group.\\"But look, Jesus has set us free again! We're now employing our own talents in full measure. Many of our genuinely happy faces and restored relationships with friends and relatives can even be found on Facebook. The Patsy imposed walls that formerly imprisoned, confined and defined us have come tumbling down. Enslaved and imprisoned are we no more. Wouldn't it be wonderful for each of us to have a new beginning?

Just hold tight...I bought it through Amazons used book program, getting a copy from a librarian which was in pretty good shape considering that the novel was published sometime in the 1960s. The pages were crisp and clean, though a little yellowed. The binding was good. The cover had a coffee mug shaped stain on it. It seemed like a dubious purchase on my part.But the writing. Oh man, the writing.Guy De Maupassant is called the master of the short story for good reason. This book contains numerous reasons to back this claim, all of which, taken as a whole, constitute crowning this man as the undisputed champion of short literature. His writing is succinct, tightly focusing on the story that he is telling you, playing with the French language so as to construct a near third dimension into the fabric of the story. Each story is a pleasure to read; it starts and ends in a satisfying way, never leaving you with any hanging expectations or feeling deprived for having had the experience. EVERY one of the stories is like that too, meaning that this entire book is well worth double this price. Bantam should consider giving a new run on this printing.Take, for example, the short story \`Mouche'. This is the story of a boat of young men who row up and down the river, living out a life of pleasure amid the people of the who live around and on it. When they take onboard a woman who beds with one of the young men, trouble begins to brew. The woman, Mouche, becomes a surrogate to all of the men of the row-boat, Feuille.If you're going to discuss a book that has been translated, you should touch on the translator's ability. Lowell Bair translated this version and the original writing shines through, surviving the transition. For those of you who know a bit of French, you will get the built-in joke that Maupassant has made with \`Mouche'; for those of you who do not or barely remember it from high school (me!) Lowell Bair helps you along with in-text notes in brackets, something that does not, in any way, detract from the experience of the story. In fact, without this notation the text would have lost something in the telling.This fact, along with the quality of the stories themselves, makes me recommend this book very highly to anyone whom appreciates a well-told short story. Again, these writings are well-crafted examples of a literary short. The fact that Maupassant studied with Flaubert really shows through- he is making a deliberate effort in his writing and it shows.This brings me to the final reason that I can recommend this book to you: Pierre et Jean. This novella is very well crafted, bringing together the intelligent anticipation of the reader (though you'll see the plot early on, this is intended; it pats you on the back for doing so, then yanks the story along in a new direction) along with the taut structure of the situation that it speaks of. Pierre and Jean and brothers. One of them inherits a fortune from a family friend who has died. The novel is about love and pain and how they often intertwine themselves into our lives. It is very beautiful and very sad, all at once.Bottom line: If you've managed to find your way to this page do yourself the big favor of buying a used copy of this book. It is well worth the price. The fact that someone bought it used and thought enough of it to still review it should speak volumes for the appreciation they had for it.-LP"},{"Title":"The Wind at My Back: The Life of St. Patrick","review":"This book for children on about the 4th grade reading level is a very human account of Saint Patrick.

After all, it's not the cheapest, for its size.However, I've had the chance to look at a couple of dozen pages, & I think that this one stands out. On one hand, it's far cheaper & more approachable than any truly definitive text I've seen; on the other, it's far better than the vast majority of fluff being produced to cash in on the \\"CSI\\" phenomenon.It also stands out from the latter because it's heavily illustrated, varying from serviceable to quite useful. The fact that it's more a highschool text & workbook didn't get in the way.According to my notes, it's divided into Units: forensic psychology; fingerprints; homicide; crash-site analysis; crime-scene analysis; firearms; exercises. I also noted that at least one set of illustrations is from the excellent software \\"Faces,\\" an electronic \\"sketch artist\\" used by many law enforcement professionals.All in all, the author's done a very good job of showing the reality of forensic science without getting bogged down in the minutiae, & also without giving the TV impression that a CSI walks into a scene, flings fingerprint powder around for a few minutes, threatens some suspects, & arrests the criminal (for starters, many CSIs aren't cops, & many of the procedures you see on the tube take hours or days or even weeks to accomplish, not seconds).

On a topic which remains a familiar concern for me, &quot;that prolonged agony of continual war,&quot; (p. 637) I suggest reading the story &quot;Billy Budd, Foretopman&quot; as a model for what can be expected in the war on drugs. Anything might be considered more important if it can be rightly compared to a story with a first sentence which, as it says, &quot;belongs to a period which, as every thinker now feels, involved a crisis for Christendom not exceeded in its undetermined momentousness at the time by any other era whereof there is record.&quot; (p. 637) I had to buy this book because it contains the story &quot;Bartleby.&quot; The relentless element in the story is the phrase &quot;I would prefer not to,&quot; surprisingly used by a scrivener when he was requested to do something which seemed perfectly reasonable to the rest of the world. The level of the philosophical questions raised by this strange behavior, &quot;What do you mean? Are you moon-struck?&quot; (p. 476) bring about a strange admission: &quot;Had there been the least uneasiness, anger, impatience or impertinence in his manner; in other words, had there been anything ordinarily human about him, doubtless I should have violently dismissed him from the premises.&quot; (p. 477) This might not make a very exciting movie, but I suggest it as a guide to real life."},{"Title":"THE TEDDY BEARS' DICTIONARY","review":"The Teddy Bear's Dictionary is a true learning experience for a child.

Alfred McBride has written a stellar catechism for teens based on the first edition of the Universal Catechism, published in 1994. It is very effective in its style. Offering a wide group of quotations from saints and prominent Catholics of the past, Fr. McBride gives the reader a connection to the history of his faith and helps him to recognize his membership in the communion of saints. Also, in style, the book smells of scholastic argumentation. A problem or inadequate explanation of an article of faith is posed, then the question is answered by the Catechism, and then the problem is addressed directly. A wonderful tool."},{"Title":"Father McBride's Teen Catechism","review":"I agree that this is designed with teens in mind, but also with adults who may be hesitant to pick up the thicker volume of the most recent Catechism. This is real life, with real life examples of partial truths being clarified by precise, yet down to earth answers and quotes. We love this book and recommend it for after Confirmation, along with Theology of the Body and for Post RCIA or for an ongoing adult education. Don't let the title \\"for Teens\\" mislead you. This is a catechism like no other and a small, quick to read, hard to put down little book. There's a helpful teacher's manual as well and NO, you don't have to add other sources to the program but it's always a good idea to have prayer and praise during one's class.

I really liked the secular history and Catholic history that is provided, for instance, the beliefs of Karl Marx and Sigmond Freud, the acts of courage by Catholics during WWII, the conversion of CS Lewis, the life of the prophet Isiah, and the history of some of the saints. The only trouble is that it doesn't seem to be written with teenagers in mind. I think it is more suited for adults. Also, I was surprised to find that in some chapters the same questions were asked as in earlier chapters, which makes me think there is room for improvement."},{"Title":"Father McBride's Teen Catechism","review":"This book is very well done for the most part.

Dr. Asperger for whom Asperger's Syndrome was named recognized similar behaviors in 1944. Those who specialized in treating people with autism more often than not relied on Kanner's, or Infantile Autism models. Scant attention was given to Asperger's Syndrome, which is also considered to be a form of High Functioning Autism. Sean, however was diagnosed at 4 with autism in 1965.Sean's behavior was indicative of autism from infancy. He loved to drop things down the vent holes; self stim; throw toys up into trees because, as he later explained, he \\"liked to see things going up.\\" Sean's mother developed a punitive relationship / response to Sean and, by her own admission was conditioned to respond negatively to him. Sean later said he would not have been able to pick her out of a group of women until he was 5.Sean's sister Megan, born some 2 years later sounded like a really good influence on Sean. I loved her aversion for dolls and displeasure over how too many books with female characters relegated them to gender biased activities. Extraordinarily bright and verbal, Megan was Sean's biggest ally.Nonverbal until he was nearly 5, Sean's rigid eating habits and love for routine all pointed him closer towards the autistic end of the autism/Asperger's (a/A) scale. Diagnosed at 4 and already medicated and in therapy, Sean's progress remained uneven. One doctor actually spanked Sean after being told about how the boy screamed at restaurants whenever a glass of water was placed on the table. I was thoroughly disgusted with the man and wondered why he was not brought up on charges. He had no authority to so much as lay a finger on that child! The boy's mother felt he was making some progress and continued with Dr. Rossi, which I just could not understand. I was glad that Sean tuned him out. I also loved it when Sean shook off his father and mother after he broke his arm in 1964-1965 so he could engage in his brand of play.Sean also tuned his own father out because, as he would explain later, he had a severe communication disorder. Luckily for Sean, his father taught in their home district, so he was mainstreamed for the first few years. His 4th grade year was traumatically interrupted when in February he was enrolled in an unsatisfactory boarding school. He served 9 months there and was miserable. I just loved it when Megan said she hoped Sean would forgive them for putting him that school.Once back in his home district, Sean continued to make acceptable progress in the class, but had trouble on the homefront. In 1975-76, Sean's father, irate over the boy's seeming lack of responsiveness, snubbed him for 8 whole days. Sean made every effort to get back into his good graces and it was so heartwarming when he succeeded.It was interesting that Sean knew he was autistic since he was 10. He was lucky to have had this information. Even so, social nuances remained a challenge; another setback occurred in February of 1976 when his beloved maternal grandmother died.Since autism and Asperger's are on the same neurosensory spectrum, there tends to be overlapping behaviors. As Sean got older and cognitively learned social expectations, his behavior moved him closer toward the Asperger's end of the spectrum. His poignant wish to \\"get a sense of humor\\" when he was in middle school was indicative of how subtleties, including humor are often learned \\"cognitively\\" by people on the spectrum. He also had to be taught why jokes worked; how; and why timing and delivery were important. Inane sitcoms such as his beloved \\"Gilligan's Island\\" was a very limited and restrictive portrayal of one type of humor. Still, Sean made strides.More changes were on the way; he suffered through a megavitamin regimine and was luckily withdrawn from it. A group of bullies were called in on their cruelty to Sean; they were told that Sean had autism and one boy even apologized and never once harassed him after that.In 1978 the Barrons left Ohio for Los Angeles; it was there that Sean, largely thanks to his sister navigated through the tricky social terrain of his new high school. He still had routines he had to follow; he often misread responses and had trouble understanding interactions. In early 1979, the movie \\"Son-Rise,\\" based on the life of Raun Kauffman aired on television. Sean instantly \\"recognized\\" himself in some of Raun's early behaviors; at the end of the movie he discloses that he is autistic and for the first time in his life had a heart-to-heart talk about autism and why he behaved the way he did. Although the movie was overly maudlin and paled considerably next to the book, \\"Son-Rise,\\" the best thing about it was that it proved Sean a chance to speak for himself.The Barrons remained in California until 1984 when they moved across country to Manhattan. Sean insisted on returning to Ohio because he felt he had to prove himself on his old home turf. He graduated from college; worked in a nursing home and did more than just prove himself. He soared like the proverbial falcon.I recommend \\"Fighting for Tony\\" along with this book. Tony, like Sean had autism and both young men were blessed with younger sisters who were extraordinary teachers who loved them unconditionally."},{"Title":"The New Option Secret - Volatility: The Weapon of the Professional Trader and the Most Important Indicator in Option Trading","review":"Mr.Caplan has put a great spin on option investing.

The 6 stratagies include buying, selling and spreading using options. It deals primarily with the futures markets but much of what is suggested can be adapted to stocks. My 10+ years of trading experience tells me that much of what is written in this book is correct and useful. He also spends time discussing what doesn't work and why. The importance of volitility is discussed throughout the book. The only problem i have with this book and others like it is that I still don't know where to look for those volitility numbers.

Seguin (The Fred H. and Ella Mae Moore Texas History Reprint Series)","review":"Name the 3 most honorable men involved with the Texas Revolution and you might get: Sam Houston (an American), Lorenzo de Zavala (a Mexcian) and Juan Seguin, a Texian/Tejano. Seguin was invaluable to Houston before the Battle of San Jacinto and he carried messages for Travis from the Alamo. His only failing was that he was a Tejano in a land being overrun with Anglos who were hungry for land and power. Seguin's service during the revolution was quickly forgotten and he was abused by the Johnny-Come-Latelies who filled Texas and San Antonio after all the fighting was over. This volume tells his story and sheds light on his contributions to the Revolution, his abuse by the Anglos and later the Mexicans. He may have been a man without a country but never without honor."},{"Title":"A Revolution Remembered: The Memoirs and Selected Correspondence of Juan N.

The appended letters to and from Juan Seguin show that he was apparently left by the Anglo revolutionaries to hold San Antonio following the fall of the Alamo, with insufficient support from the new Texas Government, forcing Seguin to fend for himself in recruiting volunteers from the not-so-willing San Antonio population, forcing him to frequently retreat with his small army to the outskirts of San Antonio in the face of pending threats by the Mexican Army to return to San Antonio, and ultimately, sadly, to align with the Mexicans for a time. He claims he was forced into this latter action under threat of death or imprisonment by the Mexican Government. He may have also been forced to the Mexican side, temporarily at least, by the actions of new Anglo settlers and by neglect from the Texas Republic. His closeness to Sam Houston and other Texian leaders at San Jacinto would earn him the slack he needed to come back to live in Texas. He seems to have harbored no resentments toward either side in the conflict.

It took me a bit to really get into it (about 50 pages) but after that it was pretty smooth sailing. I didn't find it hilariously funny like some readers, but I did find it hugely entertaining. It's a pretty fast-paced read (there are 127 short chapters). The themes covered (religion, meaning of life, end of world, government, war) were right up my alley and I found myself agreeing with the author's observations. The style of the writing is very modern and it feels like it could have been written today. Overall, I found Cat's Cradle to be a pretty good read, and would recommend it to anyone who might be interested in reading something from this author.I'm definitely looking forward to reading more Vonnegut in the future."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The book \\"Cat's Cradle\\" by Kurt Vonnegut is a story of tragedy, deceit, and confusion. You follow a character named Jonah. He follows a scientist, Dr. Hoenikker, who creates the atomic bomb and Ice 9. You move to multiple locations following multiple story lines. You move to an island called San Lorenzo. In San Lorenzo there is not much money and everyone is starving. The only people that are not starving are the people that are not locals. The profiteers that come from America are the people that are not starving. One example of one of these people is H. Lowe Crosby, a bicycle maker. This book is a story of many things, it has many lessons to learn from it. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"A brilliant novel capitalizing on that hidden layer of life in which the Creator has subtly and mysteriously connected everyone to someone else. It begins with the writer of a story and culminates in the end of all life on Earth. I wasn't enraptured with the text so much as I was driven to greater depths of curiosity for what came next, two-pages at a time."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Before I say anything about the book, I have to say that I chose to read this book from a rather short list for a school project in Essay Writing. That being said, I loved the book.Almost every single book that I have needed to read for school rubbed me the wrong way for one reason or another. The most common is that it was too boring. Cat's Cradle defies that and was instantly put near the top of my book list that I recommend to people.I was hooked after reading the first two chapters in the book, which for Cat's Cradle total four or five pages. The chapter were amazingly short, some only a few pages in length. To me, this made to book feel like it was going by really fast. I read through the book in only a few days (books usually take me a few weeks in contrast).Vonnegut's use of sarcasm and satire is made me laugh out loud and question the stability of our government. He dives into the tangled nature of science and religion and embeds doubt into the reader.I am a total science fiction and a science geek and when I heard from my teacher this had a sci-fi aspect, I jumped on it. I am pleased with how the sci-fi part of the novel and the regular part of the novel are balanced and mixed with each other.Overall I rate this book very high, hence the five stars. I recommend this book to everybody that I meet, even total strangers because of the awesome factor of the book."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut, chronicles John, a man searching for answers about the atomic bomb dropping on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. Throughout the book John meets a variety of people from scientists to the children of the creator of the atomic bomb. Vonnegut pokes fun at aspects of human nature such as religion, greed, and sin all in a manner that will keep the reader laughing throughout the novel. Vonnegut makes accurate satirical comments about many groups and institutions that Americans follow blindly. For example, John claims he was once a Bokonon, and throughout the book he searches for the members of his karass. In the end, he finds Lionel Johnson, the final member of his karass and the creator of Bokononism, only to find out that Johnson thinks religion is a complete waste of time! Vonnegut's dry humor makes the decisions of humans seem almost idiotic and the ridiculous scenarios he creates cause the reader to truly question human nature. The use of ice-nine at the end of the book displayed the greedy nature of human beings to simply do whatever best suits them without worrying about the greater good of a population.Cat's Cradle is definitely an interesting and fun read. It can be finished quickly and it definitely has a lot to enjoy. If you get the chance I would absolutely recommend reading this hilarious, satirical novel."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is a wonderful story craftily told. Vonnegut's writing style is simple and straightforward. There are surprises in every chapter, laughs, and a type of bravado only dreamed of in lesser writers. Cat's Cradle has inspired me to seek out other Vonnegut titles."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I read this book years ago and reread it recently. It is excellent. In truth, Vonnegut was sporadically a very good writer, but not a great writer. This is his very best book, and the only one that has stuck with me over the expanse of time. He himself gave it an A+, while being objectively hard on most of his other books.Its fun, its thoughtful, its a fast read. And it stuck with me over 30 years to be one of the very few books that I wanted read a second time. That proved to be a good choice.I recommend it to the many others out there who read Vonnegut years ago, and to the young readers who never did."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Ah, Cat's Cradle. A heartwarming tale of petty family rivalries, a calypso-based religion openly full of lies, an absurd arms race over ice, and the end of all life on the planet. Cat's Cradle is the book that really put Vonnegut on the map, and it's not hard to see why; even all these years later, it's a marvelous mix of storytelling and barbed satire, one all the more remarkable for how light the whole thing seems on a cursory reading. I don't think Cat's Cradle holds a candle to Vonnegut's later work - it's more conventional, in its own strange way, and more bound to a story than to Vonnegut's more rambling works, which is what I love most about him. What's more, Cat's Cradle is a little sprawling - it ends up handling so much that the points aren't as sharp as you might like. But those are faint complaints for a book that packs so much into so few pages, and the fact that it still can pack an unironic emotional wallop in moments (I'm thinking here particularly of the speech before the ceremony at the end) is just more testament to Vonnegut's amazing mind and writing. And as for people who say the book is nothing but hopelessness and bitterness - I don't see how you can read Cat's Cradle and not see that Vonnegut may be a cynic, but he's one who finds it all funny, not depressing, and his bemused laughter at all the insanity is what made him such a joy."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"My fifth Kurt Vonnegut novel in two weeks now, i began with Breakfast of Champions and have not been able to put down his books since, another truly great novel for fans of the author, and for newcomers alike"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Before Cat's Cradle, I had read Slaughterhouse Five and Breakfast of Champions, both of which had a more humorous tone to them, so when I bought this, I thought it was going to be more of the same. In that sense, I was disappointed with the book, since it turned out to have a mostly serious tone to it.Cat's Cradle, in my experience, is Vonnegut's most lauded novel, but I did not enjoy it as much as the other two I've read. It seemed like the story never moved--like every major plot point was just the precursor to something that never happened. It felt like just the opening chapters to a much longer novel.However, with all that said, it is very readable. Any fan of Vonnegut will love this book. Perhaps my assumptions about the book soured the experience for me (and for this reason I will eventually reread it), but in any case, I'd recommend it to any fans of literature."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book is one of those rare gems that you stumble across by accident and end up loving for your entire life! I was 14 when I first read this and now its practically an annual event.I love the standard Vonngeut canon (which is, in order of \\"must read\\"ness: Slaughter House 5, Breakfast of Champions and Bluebeard), but none of those titles had quite the effect on me that Cats Cradle did. I won't spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that this apocolyptic satire of religion and science; predestination and free will; ice and ice 9; is brilliant throughout. There's a reason that this book holds cult status with Vonnegut fans around the world; read it, you'll get it!Reading the rest of the Vonnegut catalogue now just crushes me, because nothing lives up to his big three titles. It was as though he spent himself on his masterpiece and then there was nothing left. Nothing except this one diamond in the rough.All I want to know is: who are the reviewers giving this book less than 5 stars??

An excellent reflection on our society, while still an entertaining read. Go on and read it already."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and believe it is one of Vonnegut's best. He displays the folly of human nature and all around stupidity of our race perfectly, and in a very humorous way. My favorite part of this book deals with the religion of \\"Bokonism\\". The first line presented to us regarding this hypocritical and ironic religion (presented to us through the writings of Bokonon hismels) is, \\"All of the true things I am about to tell you are shameless lies\\" (Vonnegut 5). Vonnegut again utilizes minimalism and modernism to create a wonderful blend of relatively upbeat and humorous literature."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book is amazing, it's really easy to read, very difficult to put down, and it still manages to convey great meaning, probably Kurt Vonnegut's best book, next to The Sirens of Titan"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's CAT'S CRADLE is one of the three books I simply could not live without (the other two are CATCH 22 and BARK OF THE DOGWOOD).

My second favorite book of his would have to be BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"It took some patience in the beginning; but with such an acclaimed author, I had to keep reading and was well rewarded in the end. This book has everything : humor, love, mystery, sci-fi, and religion. The protagonist of the story starts out on a mission to write a book about the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan and the father of the atomic bomb, Dr. Hoenikker. He becomes completely immersed in the lives of the Hoenikker family and joins a religious cult, whose fundamental beliefs are based on lies. Vonnegut is so obscure; thus rather than clearly stating facts, many important points of this story are magically dispersed throughout the background. Despite the fantastic chain of events that lead to the conclusion of this tale, Vonnegut's insightful revelations concerning the nature of humanity may be enough to convince the reader that quite possibly fate has already determined the destiny of the world. Well done."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Wow, I must say it has now become one of my fav. books. In just the opening page I was hooked.

A strange religion, exotic environments, politics, Vonnegut's seminal work mixes all up stimulating at a same time entertainment and reflection."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This was the first Vonnegut book I ever read, and it's still perhaps my favorite. His unique genius truly shines in this novel as you are pulled along most willingly through the realm of both the impossible and unthinkable. Each character is vivid and lives on in your mind well after you've put the book down. Of course, actually putting the book down is a challenge. Even when you've finished, you'll want to read it again from end to beginning and look for hidden messages, because you know your own imagination is not nearly vast enough to have captured the seemingly endless facets of this story.

Brief chapters describe the survivor's pre-apocalyptic encounters with folks he is interviewing for facts for a biography he is preparing to write.

It is a well-written story about the narrator Jonah (a journalist) and it opens with him writing a story call The Day The World Ended and he based it reactions of Felix Hoenikker (the father of the atomic bomb) on the day the bomb was dropped. Jonah meets Felix's three bizarre children and he becomes mixed up with the inhabitant from the island of San Lorenzo. He learns about ice-nine, a small chemical that could bring around the end of the world. Once created for the soldiers to solidify mud so it is easier to travel on. However he really made a weapon more dangerous the atomic bomb. There are many high points skillfully twisted into the story. Vonnegot is a very skillful writer and I want to read more of his novels. The high point that sticks out the most is when Jonah and the others bring about the end of the world by using ice-nine. This however was a mistake they had to pay for. I think the book has no low points because it was written so well nothing makes you lose you attention. Yes, I would recommend this book to anyone of any age. It is good at any age because you can see things at a different view. The one reason one shouldn't read this book is if they are easily distracted because if you miss one thing you are in trouble.

Cat's Cradle forefronts two main themes: (1) humanity has an insurmountable tendency to destroy itself and (2) nothing really matters anyway. Telling the story of a random set of characters thrown together by an inexorable sense of chance, chaos ensues and we laugh all the way to the end of the world. Science, in this book, is not your friend (scientists even less so) and religion, though a heap of lies, is a little more friendly when taken with a healthy grain of salt.in all, the book is good. great even. worth a read and certainly enlightening. but, like Salinger, Vonnegut embraces an incredible cynicism. the sarcasm makes it a bit more fun, but there is little redeemable at the end of the narrative. just take you poison and bid goodnight."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"While I perhaps understood the overall point of the novel (i.e. that science may be truth but it can and will destroy man; whereas, a system of bliefs such as Bokonism allows man to live in harmony even if this peace and harmony is built on harmless untruths), I think Vonnegut could have done a better job at telling the story. The story \\"bounced around\\" a bit too much for me and as a reader, I did not know what to focus on, and after a while, did not care. Unlike Slaughterhouse Five, I did not find this book at all funny (was it supposed to be?) although I suspect that Vonnegut intended the reader to take humor in the medical condition known as midgetism.

That being said, I did have a few problems with this - one of the core lessons that it teaches is one of pointlessness, and that gets applied somewhat to aspects within the plot line; certain events take place that could be seen as deus ex machinas, but at times some of them are pointed out, how they are unexplained, and their explanations dismissed as unnecessary. It can come off as either smart, funny and very honest, or as somewhat lazy. I didn't feel like I gained as much from this as I did Slaughterhouse-Five, but that's not to say that I didn't gain anything at all - on the contrary, I found it to be very enriching, in the most ironic way possible.

Blending his patented wry humor with acute social insight presented in an absurd fantasy world, Vonnegut has written an exceptional novel of love, lies, and the self destruction of mankind. The story centers around the narrator, Jonah, who is called by name once in the entire book. We are told in the beginning that he is writing a book on the events of the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan. His research leads him to a correspondence with Newt Hoenikker, the midget son of Doctor Felix Hoenikker, father of the atomic bomb. After meeting with Newt, destiny leads our protagonist to the impoverished island republic of San Lorenzo, where among other adventures, he finds religion, falls in love, and becomes president. All of this by itself would make for a very entertaining book, but it is not in the story line that Vonnegut's genius lies. Cat's Cradle is rife with painfully accurate insights into the institutions that our society holds so dear, such as, religion, politics, and science. Vonnegut invents for the inhabitants of San Lorenzo a brand new religion based completely and admittedly on &quot;foma&quot;, or lies. This wouldn't be so shocking, except for the fact that this &quot;bokonism&quot; seems to make perfect sense. Other Vonnegut ironies pervade the book and are too elaborate to go into. Kurt Vonnegut is my favorite author of all time. Cat's Cradle is one of his funniest, most absurd, and frightening novels. This book truly causes one to stop and think about the things that one holds as unquestionably true. All of the incredible people, places, things, and ideas in Cat's Cradle are intricately woven into a perfect tapestry that sums up and spells out many of mankind's self-created problems in 191 pages."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I don't like sci-fi, but I loved this. This is the first Vonnegut I've read (I took a chance after reading so much praise for it) and it definitely won't be the last. It's one of those rare and wonderful books in the same vein as Animal Farm: simple prose, easy to read, yet with ironic tinges and thought-provoking depths; a novel that can be read and enjoyed at many different levels.Cat's Cradle is narrated through Jonah, an author who aims to write a book on the single day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. On investigating the atomic bomb's main founding father (and his three children) he is told about a *non-existant* substance with the capacity to provide all water on earth with a different molecular structure, turning it into Ice 9 (ie, a substance that could bring about the end of the world) A different assignment takes Jonah to the small island of San Lorenzo where he encounters Felix Hoenikker's three children and a society where the religion of choice (a religion that everyone knows is based on lies, yet still has utter faith in) is punishable by death, for the simple fact that it adds excitement to the dull lives of the inhabitants. I won't go any further...The thing that delighted me most about this book was the way in which it was written. A lot of great and influential books are ones that (on the whole) you enjoy, but take a while to get into, and at times you feel like giving up on: you know the book in question is good literature, but the style and plot make finishing it seem a chore.Similarly, a lot of fast-paced books hold little impact, don't challenge the mind and are forgotten the instant you read them.Kurt Vonnegut has managed to write a powerful and memorable novel in a short, snappy style: this book has everything that makes a compelling, challenging read. Vonnegut lets you get a feel for the characters without going into lengthy descriptions, he manages to make sharp, subtle criticisms of religion, human nature and society without rambling or whining, his plot is exciting yet not unrealistic, he creates a hellish world that plays on everyone's fear of obliteration in precious few words. I thought the ending was too abrupt, but it fitted well with the rest of the story (and it would have been even more disappointing if he'd created a satisfying, everything-tied-up-nicely ending)I found this impossible to put down, and highly recommend it to any fan of literature."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut writes the book with the question that &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot; plays with on a different level, all the while throwing in philosophies, wit, and things to ponder on and about during the COLD WAR.The narrator (first-person incompetent) is somewhat vacant, and being so, maneuvers the story the best way possible.The narrator is writing a book on the atomic bomb and he travels about meeting strange people who know the creators of the bomb. The characters he meets are funny and strange (You would have to be an oddball to be toying with doomsday.). In his journey he finds the sons and daughter of the inventor of the A-bomb. He finds that these three are an eccentric and foolish trio. The daughter and sons hold with them ice-nine, a weapon that makes the a-bomb seem infantile. Ice-nine was an attempt by their father to make battlefields (mud) solidify, making battle easier on soldiers. It winds up making any moisture it touches solid and blue, but its one flaw is, once put into the atmosphere it regenerates without stopping, freezing everything in its path(including human beings).Vonnegut throws in the element of Bokononism, a quirky, weird religion spawned by an eccentric, self-made prophet named Bokonon. This angle plays in the mind of the reader as it debases the relevancy of all religions, thus, for example, making Catholicism or Islam just as strange as Bokononism. Bokononists chant about man being born of the &quot;mud.&quot;Symbolically the three children holding ice-nine, a single flake of which will end mankind as we know it, stand for three world superpowers. It shows that anyone, no matter how high in power, can be foolish, and should have no access to such an element of destruction. The ice-nine is just a symbol of the end of mankind through the folly of science, for the ice-nine turns things bluish white, like ice--putting man in another ice-age, destroying all &quot;mud&quot;. The island of San Lorenzo is like Cuba--through its history no one really cared about anyone else ceasing it, but since there is an odd belief there(Bokononism/Communism),people poke around there now. It shows how such a small place, like Cuba, in the Cold War, could be ground-zero for the end of humanity, and warns against intervention there.Being that the Cold War is over, this is an era piece that some may think is stagnate. Yet the tools to end civilization are still out there, so this book is relevant as long as science and government have and look for a greater means of destruction.Though this book is funny and eccentric on surface, it is ultimately found to be a political warning. This humorous look at what could be the end, parallels Orwell's &quot;Nineteen-Eighty-Four&quot; in the field of political writing for the sake of warning (Orwell warns about the threat of Totalitarianism, Vonnegut warns about man's acute closeness to his own demise). This book is not as hard-nosed as &quot;Nineteen-Eighty-Four.&quot; It is funny, but this is done to show the folly and incompetence that mankind's demise is handled with: Vonnegut's use of juxtaposition is without flaw.Bokonon adds a religious facet to this novel. He ultimately shows folly and incompetence in the creation of something other than doomsday devices--religion. After the reader drops the hypocrisy of thinking their religion is &quot;the one,&quot; Vonnegut brings up the question: Were people like Jesus or Mohammed just fools out spreading nonsense for the sake of an ego-trip?This book touches on so many intense questions. It puts forth a vehicle for such deep introspection, yet it is hilarious. I only wish I were to have read this in the mind set of the world in the early sixties, when this book was first published. Vonnegut was way ahead of his time with this one. His writing, when dissected, makes me think he is one of the great thinkers of the twentieth-century into the twenty-first..."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If you've never read Kurt Vonnegut before, then you face a slight dilemma. You have two options available to you (well, really you've got more than two, but as long as you're reading this, I'm running the show and I say you've only got two):1) You can read a slew of other Vonnegut books and build up to reading &quot;Cat's Cradle,&quot; or2) You can read &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; and be so entirely blown away that no Vonnegut book will ever again live up to your newly inflated expectations.That said, &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is an absolute must read for anyone and everyone over the age of birth. To summarize Vonnegut's crazy, whacked out plot would be an exercise in futility: it's got something to do with the father of the atomic bomb and his three bizarre children and the narrator who will chronicle their story as they get mixed up with the inhabitants of the island of San Lorenzo, all of whom are Bokononists. Confused yet? You should be. Throw in a little bit of ice-nine, a chemical that can feasibly bring about the end of the world, and you might have a slight inkling of the pieces of Vonnegut's puzzle.Still, for all of the crazy characters and situations in &quot;Cat's Cradle,&quot; it's ultimately a brilliant satire of the Cold War; at one particular moment a character realizes the importance of dichotomies, why we must believe the other is &quot;evil&quot; for us to be able to see ourselves as &quot;good&quot; and how absurd such things are, how phony and constructed they are. At the heart of all this is Vonnegut's brilliant metaphor for the cat's cradle, and it's a beauty.Even if all this political satire doesn't grab you, just the way in which Vonnegut manages to throw a dozen ridiculous balls in the air and keep them well juggled and catch them all with grace by the final page is testament to his skill. &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is a book that'll make you sit up and think, but will also make you laugh out loud and maybe even touch you emotionally, particularly during the American ambassador to San Lorenzo's speech. It's so gut wrenching and absurd and oh so wonderfully written that you'll be hooked before you even realize it. Read it; this is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This was my first time reading Vonnegut, and I bought this novel largely based on his reputation as an author and the reviews I read here. The premise of the novel also sounded interesting. The narrator, Jonah, is writing a book about the events that took place on the day the atomic bomb was dropped, and focuses on the \\"father\\" of the atomic bomb, Felix Hoenikker, and his children. He eventually finds himself on the fictional island of San Lorenzo amid the backdrop of political and religious instability.I could tell right away that Vonnegut was an excellent author. That is clear from his writing, which is very elegant and well organized. The book is a short read at 300 pages, and with chapters at 1-2 pages long, most people will be through it in a few hours. The chapters all flow into each other and there is no \\"jumping around\\" between other characters, as Jonah narrates the story through the first person.Those are the positives and the reason I gave Cat's Cradle three stars. I believe this is a good book and likely an intellectual commentary on society and the arms race, etc etc, however all of this must have gone completely over my head because I didn't see any of it. Maybe this book is \\"too\\" intellectual for me, since I am not used to having to think so much while reading. What's more, the satire also went over my head and I do not recall any humorous moments in the entire book, and kept looking for the plot.I do not mean for this review to turn people off of Cat's Cradle, just to let them know what they are getting into. If your usual fare is Tom Clancy, Stephen King, J.K. Rowling, etc, and you are not used to writers like Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, Chuck Palahniuk (this book reminded me a LOT ofSurvivor: A Novel), you may find you are missing out on most of the actual book. I was not disappointed when I finished Cat's Cradle, but I certainly wasn't as satiated as I usually am when I finish a good novel. Caveat emptor."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is completely amazing. One of Vonnegut's best. Plenty of other reviews will tell you that, though. Just make sure you buy the right edition. As you may have noticed, there are two editions available in the Kindle store- one published by \\"Rosetta Books\\" for $7.19 (the first search result for \\"Cat's Cradle\\" in the store with an orange and white cover) and one for $5.59 (the third result with a blue cover and a picture of a bird cage). While I'm sure any sane person would buy the cheaper edition anyway, if you accidentally buy the more expensive edition like I did you will be thoroughly annoyed. For some reason, when a quotation mark appears mid-line the space before it is deleted and a space after it is added. For example:We had locked \\"Papa's\\" doorappears asWe had locked\\" Papa's\\" doorWhile it's easy to figure out most of the time, if you're not paying terribly close attention or if a line is continued from a previous page, it can be hard to tell whether a quote is beginning or ending.I called customer service and they sorted it out immediately, refunding my money and allowing me to purchase the cheaper, less flawed edition. Service was great, but I didn't realize there was another edition until I was 87% through the book. It wasn't the end of the world, but watch out. I wouldn't download anything else from Rosetta Books either.In conclusion, buy the cheaper version. You won't be disappointed. Cat's Cradle is great, especially if you're a Vonnegut enthusiast already."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Don't be a fool! Close this book at once! It is nothing but foma! [lies]\\"In \\"The Cat's Cradle,\\" Vonnegut provides an ironic and satiric look at religion, science, and ethics. The storyline consists of John and his attempts at researching Felix Hoenikker, one of the fathers of the atomic bomb, as he attempts to write a book about Hiroshima. Although Vonnegut's novel is intended as humorous, a powerful message lies beneath the surface. Vonnegut explores the purpose and role of religion, and delves into the philosophical debate on science and ethics.Bokononism, the religion of a tiny banana republic, San Lorenzo, is the central focus in Vonnegut's expose on religion. Bokonon, its founder, was shipwrecked onto this tiny island and, with the help of McCabe, attempts to transform the backward and exploited island into a utopia. When this proves impossible, Bokonon invents his religion. Although admitting that Bokononism is \\"nothing but lies,\\" it provides a distraction to the San Lorenzoans and inspires meaning and fulfillment in their lives of misery. Although the Books of Bokonon are predicated on blatant falsehoods, its devotion and practice provide the reason for existence for the impoverished San Lorenzoans, even with the specter of capital punishment to those who practice it. Even their dictator is an adamant follower. The essence of Vonnegut's philosophy is best illustrated in the Bokononist tale of creation, in which a playful God tells man that his purpose in life is to figure out what that purpose is, for the implicit message is that there is no grand purpose or plan for life.The symbolism of the \\"Cat's Cradle\\" further illustrates this point. A game played with string by children, this was the game played by Felix Hoenikker on the day the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. This had such an impact on Newt, his youngest son, that he later creates an abstract painting of the cat's cradle, then laments how maddening this game is, for it nothing but a \\"bunch of X's\\": \\"No d--n cat, no d--n cradle.\\" This illusory game symbolizes that life has no true purpose, much like the X-shaped strings that form nothing tangible.In John's pursuit of Felix, he discovers that, although he may have had a brilliant scientific mind, he failed to take responsibility or to see any danger in his work. Although Felix had no malicious or odious intents when he worked on the bomb, he also exhibited no remorse at its implications. He was far from innocent. His lack of ill intent was not enough, as it was his responsibility to restrain what he unleashed on the world. He viewed his work as pure research and nothing more. Indeed, his very last invention, Ice-9, which has the frightening implications of destroying all earthly life, was worked on as a hobby. He took no moral view of the implications of his work and selfishly failed to see beyond his own self-fulfillment. Through Felix, Vonnegut sends a powerful message that it is the moral obligations of scientists and engineers to be accountable for the potentially destructive nature of their work.Penned in the early 1960s, \\"The Cat's Cradle\\" does contain some campy sci-fi elements. The scientific explanation of Ice-9 seems quite a stretch, even for a 1960s sci-fi novel parody. Furthermore, most of the characters are one-dimensional caricatures of an abstract group. There is no real character development. However, this was not Vonnegut's main purpose, which was to illustrate the inherent evil of irresponsible scientists and the fallacy of religion. In these respects, Vonnegut delivers.Overall, this is an easy read, but is entertaining and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I once heard Kurt Vonnegut speak at a commencement ceremony at a Bennington College in Vermont in 1970, when his daughter was graduating with a bachelor's degree. He spoke quite eloquently about what graduates should do with their lives, and I remember parts of that wonderful speech as if it were yesterday. Indeed, Kurt Vonnegut is a writer of prodigious talents, a visionary seer disguised as an ordinary man, a contemporary wise man who speaks to us in amusing yet frightening allegories about the nature of contemporary man and the absurd technological culture he lives in today. This book, \\"Cat's Cradle\\", is among his finest novels, like most of his others, a work combining a wry sensibility with an amusing ability to confect sweet sounding yet bitter-tasting tales of mayhem and woe.The plot of Cats Cradle is pure science fiction, and revolves around work to create a way to help American tanks more mobile in rain soaked and muddy circumstances, when such an ability to transverse the impossible terrain would give our guys in their tanks an overwhelming advantage over their evil foes. Our protagonist is a scientist working on isotope of water (called Ice -9) that has the ability to crystallize water into a unique form of ice that does not need freezing temperatures to crystallize. With such a capability, the Army could solidify the water in the mud, making it firm and allowing our tanks to roll over it with impunity. The problem is that once introduced into the ground, the compound has untoward effects no one had considered. And the basis for the cautionary tale is spun.All of this is just the premise that allows Vonnegut to explore the far reaches of human behavior and the insane ways in which our culture is operating. It is a brilliant work, one that delves into the deep recesses of what we are, why we are that way, and where we seem to be going. It is at once a satire, a running commentary on the nature of our institutions, and the way in which we lie, cheat, and pretend to be people we are not, and as in his wild and wacky novel \\"Mother Night\\", shows why you should be afraid of who it is you are pretending to be, for it may come back to haunt you. This book literally explodes with a plethora of stinging insights into contemporary society, and constitutes a brilliant, albeit ironic, diagnosis of what a contradiction it is to be a human being trying to live a sane life in an insane world. This really is magical mystery tour, and one that will take your breath away. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is nothing short of a magician. Call him a writer if you must, but it seems unfitting for a man who weaves yarns about new religions, Ukranian midget dancers, apocalyptic chemical inventions, and feet-rubbing fornication. Writer just doesn't do justice.Regardless, Cat's Cradle is a wonderful read and a heck of a time. Plot, character, and setting, as always in Vonnegut's work, take a back seat to the infectuos humor and unconventional writing style of its author.The narrator is named Jonah, a writer who wishes to conduct a non-fiction story revolving the lives of people surrounding the Atom Bomb titled \\"The Day The World Ended\\". From this moment, our wild ride begins as we are introduced to the great cast of characters, including Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the so-called \\"Fathers\\" of the Atom Bomb, who may or may not have created a chemical capable of turning all the worlds water supply into ice, his family, the president(dictator)of a small Pacific Island San Marcos, Papa Manzano, and his lovely daughter, all the way down to Bokonon himself, founder of the Bokonon faith which is based in foma (lies). The journey through Vonnegut's mind is a worthwile one, if nothing else for his startling creativity, and hilariously bleak view at humanity. I will leave you with this quote from the great books of Bokonon:\\"Beware of the man who works hard to learn something, learns it, and finds himself no wiser than before. He is full of murderous resentment of people who are ignorant without having come by their ignorance the hard way.\\"Well said."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is by far the best Vonnegut novel that I have yet read.

You're easily halfway through before the realisation seeps in that this is a HELL of a ride you're going on, you have no clue what'll happen next, but look back and all you see is perfect necessity. You're in a maelstrom of whirling bits of dazzling colour, apparently unrelated, and before your very eyes they start to fit together in ways unimaginable and faster than you can grasp. The beauty and the terror just keep building up until your eyes start to tear with the unbearableness of it all. God, how it all fits together! The laughter strangled in my throat again and again because it was beyond funny. You can't even call it tragic any more. There are no words in the English language with enough of their original intensity left to describe what Vonnegut achieves with this book, at least for me. He does it perfectly, inimitably. Your vision is stretched so severely, your heart so laden with emotions with no name, you find yourself mute. Which is frustrating, because the first thing you want to do is evangelise about your newfound belief in humanity and great things like that, to deaf people eagerly armed with sharp, sharp pins."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Being an avid Vonnegut head, I hold this as one of my personal favorites.

I e-mailed them about the problems but got no reply."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book isn't for everyone, that's for sure. The central theme is a fictional religion based around the principal that everything is a lie. The first line makes that clear. Characters include a midget, an introverted modelmaker who forced bugs to fight one another in his younger years, a man who is forced to make bicycles for blind people in Afghanistan, an insane elevator operator, a maniacal dictator, a sex symbol from a fictional island, the man who helped invent the atomic bomb (and has an odd fascination with turtles), a particularly destructive nihilist, and a doctor named \\"Breed\\", believed to have an affair. Some of the most memorable scenes involve all possible meanings of the term \\"Mayonnaise\\", fun with indexing, and a twenty-foot phallus used as a gravestone. Oh, and there are 127 chapters, each of them a page long on average.If all that just strikes you as weird, then Vonnegut really isn't the guy for you. The fact that this is normal in comparison to my favorite Vonnegut book, Breakfast of Champions, should say a lot about him. After all, this guy has one of the strangest senses of humor in literary history. His work really is inaccessible.I think he's great, though. He's got the same absurdist sense of humor as I do, and he's a social critic to rival the best of them. Especially here, where he mocks both science and religion, two very different fields. It's a hilarious book, but there's more to it than just the humor. There's also the underlying social and political implications, which is really what makes it fly.This isn't a good book in the traditional, \\"descriptive setting, fleshed-out characters\\" sense. I don't think it was meant to be. Instead, it's a wild, fast-paced ride, which moves from one biting indictment of society (he takes on everything from patriotism to nihilism). It's hilarious, it's enlightening, it's distinctive... it's pure Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut's dark comedy masterpiece is one of the best books I've ever read. He successfully blends philosophy, science fiction, and humor to create an interesting and hilarious novel. In my opinion, this is the best book Vonnegut wrote, which is saying a lot considering his other triumphs. Anyone looking for a plot heavy book should probably look elsewhere. Vonnegut's novels focus much more on the characters and their traits (flaws, many times). This is a wonderful story about the nature of man and his tendencies towards destruction. The ending (while trashed by many other reviewers - perhaps they didn't get it) is one of the funniest and most chilling things I have ever read. This book is wonderful for its ability to make the reader look at oneself and laugh. A must read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I wound up writing this review because recently, in a flight of fancy, someone conjectured that perhaps in other parts of the universe silicon forms four bonds, making ring structures - similar to the carbon-based benzene ring that is the basis of all organic materials - possible. My question was whether silicon-based amino-acid analogues would \\"teach\\" the silicon in this part of the universe to form the same kind of rings. Carbon-based DNA teaches raw amino acids how to make more DNA, so that begs the question of whether such structures would propagate.Ice-9 does just that.Cat's Cradle isn't quite as absurd as it seems.Ice-9 is a form of ice with a different structure than regular ice. It is frozen solid at room temperature. Further, when it comes into contact with regular water, it causes the water to freeze into more Ice-9. Given that 4/5ths of the earth's surface is covered by ocean, and that our bodies are mostly made of water, you can probably deduce that keeping the Ice-9 in a thermos where it can't come in contact with other water is an important plot element.A seed crystal is often necessary to initiate a phase change or precipitation, so it is conceivable that Ice-9 could initiate a catastrophe. The science fiction part is that we haven't discovered a form of water that is solid at room temperature.Incidentally, there's not much danger from oxygen-breathing silicon creatures because instead of exhaling carbon dioxide they'd exhale glass. They won't be bothering us here on earth when they show up.However, electricity-breathing silicon creatures like the semiconductor nodes that make up the Internet could be a threat. Google's server network has almost - not quite, but almost - reached a level of complexity where consciousness and intention are possible.Some reviewers on amazon.com thought that ice-9 was a metaphor for the atom bomb. Since the possibility of thermonuclear armageddon was so over-arching in real life at the time I first read the book, I didn't place any emtional emphasis on that subtext. I viewed Ice-9 as yet another technology to keep out of the hands of the military-industrial complex.You didn't need to know that Godzilla was a metaphor for the atom bomb and the damaging effects of residual radiation in order to enjoy it. Cat's Cradle was a fun social commentary that didn't benefit at all from atomic metaphor. Ice-9 was merely a plot device, a Deus-Ex-Machina that brought about the natural consequences of great social granfalloons.Bokononism isn't the first religion founded by a science-fiction author, either.Like all of Vonnegut's books, Cat's Cradle looks at society and personalities and relationships with a new, slightly mad perspective. It is hard to walk away from Cat's Cradle without re-evaluating the Granfalloon that is organized religion, or any other carefully-crafted social institutions."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Despite having read \\"Cat's Cradle\\" years ago, I recently found myself drawing a blank over the novel. I recalled that it was a 1960s doomsday satire (like Dr. Strangelove), a religious satire about a fake religion called Bokononism, and a political satire about a U.S. backed Caribbean dictatorship, San Lorenzo. Yet I couldn't quite recall what exactly Vonnegut was trying to say in this one, so I decided to reread it.The first theme of this book consists of Vonnegut's warnings about the awesome destructive force of science, and the abdication of moral responsibility by scientists. The plot centers around the deceased scientist Felix Hoenniker, a researcher at the General Forge and Foundry Company of Ilium, New York (modeled on Vonnegut's experiences at General Electric in Schenedtady), and winner of the Nobel Prize (\\"dynamite money\\"). Hoenniker was the father of the atomic bomb, and as if that isn't enough guilt for one man's soul (\\"how the hell innocent is a man who helps make a thing like an atomic bomb?\\"), he was also the developer of 'Ice-9', a form of ice with an elevated melting point. As Ice-9 has the potential to freeze the world's oceans, it is an even greater threat to humanity than the atom bomb. To Vonnegut, Hoenikker, and modern science and industry \\"receive honors and creature comforts while escaping human responsibilities.\\"The second major theme of Cat's Cradle is an exploration of false ideology. This is signified with the title string-trick, in which there is \\"no damn cat, no damn cradle\\". The book centers around a fabricated religion designed to give the impoverished people sustenance - one might say the opium of the masses, based around useful lies, or \\"foma'. Bokononism is itself sharply critical of the meaningless \\"granfaloons\\" that we use to divide and categorize people, including \\"the Communist Party, the Daughers of the American Revolution, the General Electric Company... and any nation, anytime, anywhere\\". Cornell University is another such granfaloon, as are \\"Hoosiers\\". Vonnegut is, as always, particularly derisive of American nationalism and militarism (e.g. \\"Fort Jesus\\"). Much of this criticism is conveyed through the unusual American Ambassador to San Lorenzo, Horlick Minton (\\"Perhaps when we remember wars we should take off all our clothes and... go on all fours all day long and grunt like pigs. That would surely be more appropriate than noble oratory and shows of flags and well-oiled guns\\"). And, as usual for Vonnegut, there are a number of jabs at capitalist ideology, mainly through the character of H. Lowe Crosby, who is in the process of relocating his bicycle factory to San Lorenzo, whose workers are impoverished and sufficiently terrified of the capital punishment doled out by dictator \\"Papa\\" Monzano, courtesy of \\"the hook\\". \\"No Communists here,\\" said Papa. \\"They fear the hook too much.\\" Bokononism is also a hook-worthy offense. Or more accurately, \\"Hy-u-ook-kuh!\\"I suppose the third major theme is Vonnegut's absurdist outlook on human existence. Says Bokonon: \\"Dyot meet mat\\", or \\"God made mud\\", \\"So God said to some of the mud, 'Sit up!'\\", \\"What interesting other kinds of sitting up mud I met!\\" Yet Vonnegut's humanism occasionally shines through the bleak outlook: \\"Think of what a paradise this world would be if men were kind or wise.\\""},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This was the book that turned me on to Kurt Vonnegut. I've read all this novels since, but Cat's Cradle remains in many ways my favourite. Along with the humour and the invention, there's a genuine heart to this book, and it touches me again every time I read it."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is one of those nutty books that at times you think is barely held together, but by the end you appreciate the brilliance. As far as I am concerned, this is Kurt Vonnegut's best book - way better than Slaughterhouse Five which seems to garner most of the attention. Very loosely put, this is the story of a man, a powerful doomsday invention, and the circle of people whose lives and fate are interconnected because of this invention. There is alot of made up terminology in the book - alot of fictitious mumbo jumbo - yet i find years later, i still find words like granfalloon and karass very relevant to my daily living. Trust me, there are alot of granfalloons out there!! Vonnegut very nicely satirizes society, especially in cold war era - but still relevant today - through a fictional almost farcical setting - that is brilliantly woven together through the seeming incoherence of it all! Loved it!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I first read this book when I was 12. My father gave it to me. He is a man of science and always quoted from it or praised it's subtlety and lifelong lessons that dwelt within. I didn't really understand it when I first read it. I picked it up a few weeks ago after my semester ended and blew through it in a single night. It isn't very long and can be conquered in a single sitting. I actually recommend reading it in one shot because the voices of each character will resonate more if they remain fresh.The sly humor and unique language of the book is it's greatest reward. Vonnegut has the rare gift of allowing the reader to engage in the subject matter even if it is heavily scientific or partially obscured by an intellectual layer that might be harder to penetrate if not for Vonnegut's expert hands.It's really impossible to describe any part of the plot without spoiling anything for a future reader. I'll just say this: you'll comprehend the limits of the human mind, heart, and the intricacies of the scientific stratum long after you turn the final page. A modern classic."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Among the many Kurt Vonnegut books I have read, this was the first one and today still remains to be my favorite book by him and perhaps of all time. While I believe \\"Cat's Cradle\\" to be Vonnegut's best piece of literature he has many other great stories and \\"Cat's Cradle\\" works as a great introduction to his style and humor. What separates Vonnegut's satire from those of lesser authors is the wit and black humor that is embedded in every page. With the eccentric and eclectic cast of characters, notably a midget, Vonnegut is able to comment on all of the faults of the modern man while still maintaining the humor which makes the book very easy to pick up and even harder to put down once started. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" can be read in two ways: as a humorous warning apocalpytic tale of a man at the end of the world, or as an in depth look at the plight of man and the many pitfalls of our society. Neither way is wrong because the book fits both instances so well that it's hard to find any fault with it; it's neither too serious or too goofy. In fact it's this balance of seriousness and humor that makes Vonnegut's writing so enticing and enjoyable. If you enjoy apocalyptic stories, social commentaries, and clever and subtle humor then you will find \\"Cat's Cradle\\" to be highly enjoyable journey and will re-visit it many times throughout the years."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book was pure comic genius using dark ironic humor. One of the greatest books ever. I love it so much all of you should read it!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Length:: 1:54 Mins"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The end of the world has always been a difficult topic for discussion, probably because there is no saying when or how it will take place. In 'Cat's Cradle\\" by Kurt Vonnegut, it is a topic that keeps coming up. And if you are at all familiar with Vonnegut's dark humor, you would not be surprised. The cause? Religion verses science. It starts when the main character, John Hoosier (who is telling this story in the first person) is researching for a book to be called \\"The Day the World Ended,\\" about Dr. Felix Hoenikker, the man behind the atomic bomb. This sparks a fascination, and leads him to contact this late scientist's children.This book is full or random coincidences that seem to make no sense when you are reading it, but they all come together in the end. All the characters, seeming slightly exaggerated, are not at all what you would expect. There is a radical religious figure, Bokonon, and a Minister of science, Frank, who are all thrown together with ICE-NINE, a chemical that freezes everything upon contact. The world ends when they are all on San Lorenzo, a made up island with a murderous dictator. It is very fun and also interesting."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Fascinating story that puts forth some very interesting ideas on the purpose of religious belief. Highly Recommended. Quotes from the text: \\"All of the true things that I am about to tell you are shameless lies.\\" \\"Anyone who cannot understand how useful a religion based on lies can be will not understand this book either.\\" \\"Live by the harmless untruths that make you brave and kind and healthy and happy.\\""},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut weaves a darkly funny web of simultaneously tragic and quirky events. I loved the characters, who not only echo the implications of the themes presented in the novel (notably the lies people tell themselves and others to remain happy) but feel human and not just literary tools. The ending still has me thinking, and yes, as others have mentioned, it does end quite abruptly, however, I think that is appropriate. Read it - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut's novel takes the reader into the myriad faces of human emotions--from disenchantment to awe, skepticism to empathy, from horror and madness to succor and redemption. This dryly humorous and unforgivingly scathing story of the seemingly inevitable tendency of humans to think up of ways to destroy themselves, or, simply, to make complete wretches of their lives, is at times too incredulous to be taken seriously, and yet the author has managed to slip in some amazingly straightforward insights people nowadays would probably hardly acknowledge readily, too preoccupied we are with the superfluous things in life.I certainly enjoyed Cat's Cradle with its memorable zany characters, unashamed views on tolerance, hypocrisy, and even religion. It takes a jab at the senselessness of war, the farcical stage that is politics, and ponders the possibility that life can be lived so simply but it seems that that idea for us nowadays is too complex to grasp.Makes the reader sit back and think while still helplessly embroiled in the world of \\"Bokononism\\" and the twists and turns of fate the narrator was dealt with. A veritable tour de force."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The cat's cradle is an extraordinary tale about the extent of human limitations when incompatibilities exist between the goals of science and humanity. Vonnegut created another masterpiece that describes the dangers of human science when mixed with their desires and lewdness.John, the narrator, is writing a book about the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and in the process of his research discovers the life of Felix Hoenikker, the Nobel prize-winning physicist and one of the creators of the atomic bomb.Similar to walking through a hilarious human maze, we are taken to San Lorenzo; a town were Hoenikker's two sons and daughter live and ignorantly use their father's last invention causing another world wide human disaster.Vonnegut brilliantly shows human limitations and foolishness with his description of an imaginary religion called Bokononism, which originated and blossomed in San Lorenzo.Vonnegut, who survived the cruelty of war and faced life's emptiness, is one of the few writers who can laugh at the human inability to reconcile the inherent conflict of science's power and capabilities with the needs and limitations of humanity."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Enough zaniness and dark humor permeate Cat's Cradle to keep a reader entertained, but there's still a point to Vonnegut's odd comedy--the destruction and danger of nuclear-type weapons, the criticism of society and their motives, and the general stupidity of mankind. To say Vonnegut takes a pessimistic viewpoint might be an understatement, but at least he can have fun doing it. In many respects, I actually found Cat's Cradle to be a little more enjoyable than Slaughter House Five, which seemed to be a little darker in nature.The story begins with Jonah studying and researching the late Felix Hoenikker, a renown scientist responsible for producing the atom bomb and a dangerous liquid substance called ice-nine. To do this, he interviews various people and colleagues of the late doctor, finding out, while Hoenikker had innocent intentions, he was careless with both his family and his inventions. In his quest, Jonah comes to identify Dr. Hoenikker's three children--Newt, Angela and Frank--a very odd group of kids. Angela is very tall and lanky and has to play the role of parent because of her father's neglect. Newt is a midget, who comes to find love with a midget Russian performer. And Frank leaves the family, disappears, and later emerges in San Lorenzo, being the supposed architect of San Lorenzo's \\"master plan.\\" Eventually Jonah and a group (including Angela and Newt) embark on a trip to San Lorenzo to see the island of San Lorenzo, it's population \\"all fiercely dedicated to the ideals of the Free World\\" (Jonah learns from the pamphlet on the plane). The irony of much of what is discovered on this island is that the people's religion--Bokonon--is mostly based on lies (as it says in its introduction). From here, Jonah becomes adjusted to the people and their customs, meets the island's dictator, \\"Papa\\", hears more rumors about the mysterious Bokonon, falls in love with a goddess-like woman Mona, and becomes president of San Lorenzo (he learns from Frank that this is his ultimate destiny, or his \\"zah-mah-ki-bo\\"). Eventually, there is a major event that Jonah must deal with, and this happens at the book's conclusion. Wacky as it is, the plot seems to be just a vehicle to get across much of Vonnegut's satirical points about human existence.Much of the fun of this book is the exceptional comic voice by Vonnegut. He can seemingly take the most serious issues, like religion, politics, nuclear threats, and turn them upside down. One bizarre part is when Julian Castle looks at Newt's \\"Cat's Cradle\\" painting (which Newt professes should hold a message for everyone), regards it as \\"garbage\\" and throws it out into the waterfall. A moment prior to this Jonah had been musing over the painting's meaning, and this act by Castle seems to fit right into the nonsensical mentality of the island. There is also the \\"last rites\\" scene with \\"Papa\\" and Jonah, where \\"Papa\\" leans over and whispers to Jonah to tell Bokonon that he is sorry he didn't kill him and his philosophy of lies.If you can take all of the author's jabs in a light way then this will be an enjoyable read; if not, then you might want to pass, or at least sample the book before purchasing. I wished I would have read this one before reading Slaughter House Five (as Cat's Cradle works better for an introduction to the author)."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book is full of whimsical humor. It's one of the few books that made me laugh out loud. Ironically, it's also incredibly pessimistic. Humanity is doomed by its own depraved nature to a farcical apocalypse. For Vonnegut, the main culprits are scientists who show no concern for the destructive applications of their inventions. Their scientific method is the only road to knowledge but (more pessimism) cannot yield moral knowledge or wisdom. Nothing can, including religion, which is 'all lies'."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The book was to replace a school library book that my son lost.

Displays his trademark cynicism without the gimmicky touches that characterize his later works. Must read!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Upon reading the opening single-paged chapters, the book seemed to be a plotless synopsis. As I progressed however, the satire became evident. The fun poked at the details of the characters was simplistic, yet genius. I often felt like I misunderstood the novel's overall message with the gibberish terminology & the religious gimmicks, though I understood it well enough. Although I would have loved to see what happened after the end, the conclusion left me in shock. It was however one of the best endings I've ever read in a book. Everything I didn't catch on to at the origin of my experience seemed to connect. Vonnegut's criticism of society & their beliefs is evident. The characterization of some of his characters is somewhat questionable, but suitable for the novel's nature.In terms of plot, the novel narrates a journalist's quest to document what important Americans did the day Hiroshima was bombed, leading to an involvement with the fictional Dr. Hoenikker's controversial children which tangle the narrator into a ridiculous culture that circulates around themes like religious myths, false hope & the possible destruction of the world. The book is an overall fast & simple read definitely worth the time of anyone interested in a society-mocking volume."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I wish I had known it was paperback, but still happy I ordered.

And I did speed thru this book. It's so funny, I laughed all the way, especially during the scene in the bar with the bartender and the secretary, and even with its scary premise of an existence of Ice-9. But hey, not a bad way to check out of this world. This is a book I'll read again and again!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book, with the possible exception of Slaughterhouse Five, is Vonnegut's masterpiece. Vonnegut was deeply disturbed by the fire-bombing of Dresden during the second world war (he was there as a POW) and by the atom bombing of Hiroshima/Nagasaki.To him God died in the fireball and the mushroom cloud. What disturbed him even more than the incidents themselves, terrible though they were, was the general apathy which prevailed among so may people at the time and subsequently. This book is therefore a satire on both science gone mad and deep religious belief. Written in his inimitable flippant style, the story is apparently ridiculous but on a deeper level it hits home with the force of a sledgehammer. Short chapters, some of only a few pages,and masterful writing keep the pages turning. To me it is five stars, or six if possible, but if you are a believer in the fundamental goodness of man or of any religious conviction do NOT read Cat's Cradle."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book is one of my favorite books of all time. I recently because a huge fan of Kurt Vonnegut, after Slaughterhouse Five and Breakfast of Champions, I read Cat's Cradle.I don't want to make comparisons, but once I started this book I just couldn't put it down. There are so many good and insightful lines that really makes you think.A good look at the role of science, technology, and religion.I'm not quite sure why this is counted in the Humor, while it has plenty of funny parts in the book, it's definitely not as much of a comedy as Breakfast of Champions."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"A number of cultural institutions are in Kurt Vonnegut's crosshairs as he pens \\"Cat's Cradle,\\" and it's science, religion, and, to a lesser extent, basic social group identifications that come away bruised and beaten. Even the childhood string game of Cat's Cradle is exposed by Vonnegut, which explains the title of the book.The story's main character sets off to write a book detailing the day of the bombing of Hiroshima and how the family of the bomb's maker spent the day the world was introduced to nuclear weaponry. What transpires is a wild ride where religion is mocked (San Lorenzan Bokononism is a seemingly logical religion that is closely followed despite its own admission that it's based solely on lies) and science is displayed as its own world that detaches its inhabitants from real society (Felix Hoenniker, the man behind the bomb, is lost in terms of raising his children and has never heard of \\"sin\\"). As far as Cat's Cradle -- the string game -- goes, Vonnegut uses the expression \\"See the cat? See the cradle?\\" often throughout the book to emphasize the natural human tendency to see things that aren't really there, just as the array of strings in one's hands in no way resemble a cat or a cradle.I'm not a big reader of this type of fiction but I definitely enjoyed this book. For those who enjoy the eternal debate of science vs. religion and the investigation of these powerful institutions, I certainly recommend it."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Like most of Vonnegut's works, \\"Cat's Cradle\\" proves incredibly hard to explain or review. To sum up, if you like books that make you think, keep you on your toes and off balance, and challenge your assumptions about the way things are or should be, you'll like \\"Cat's Cradle.\\"In this book, Vonnegut explores some familiar themes like the interconnectedness of peoples' lives and how, even from distances of time and space, unexpected and seemingly trivial interactions between people can have huge consequences. Vonnegut makes it clear to us all that sometimes matters of huge importance hang on tragically small details.So if you like a book that will challenge you and make you pleasantly uncomfortable (whatever that means), give this one a read. It won't take you long and you'll have experienced the world from an entirely different perspective - not a bad bargain."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"In style and reader engagement \\"Cat's Cradle\\" has held up very well over the last 5 decades. Vonnegut was undoubtedly an original writer with a sharp wit. He manages to constrain the characters (narrator excepted) within the two-dimensional paper dolls expected of satire while running a thread of mystery through each. Even the awkwardly shallow Mrs. Crosby has a line or two that give us pause.Nevertheless, both Vonnegut and the mysterious Caribbean guru of his creation preface their words repeatedly with an explicit warning not to take any of it seriously. This clouds the book's foggy voyage to deep meaning. Typical Vonnegut fans seem to brush aside the self-effacement as sardonically clever when granting high accolades, but accept a paradox when taking his deconstructionist ideas to heart . Does anyone really \\"get\\" Vonnegut's message, or is he inwardly laughing at those gullible enough to ignore it? Does the emperor have no clothes?Someone else's comparison between Bokononism and Scientology struck an agreeable chord. Both are obviously the figment of a modern mind and seek to reorder human psychology across cultural boundaries, alluding only to vague cosmological bases. Of course Hubbard was real and institutionalized, but either belief system could fill a spiritual longing unmet by the weekly grind of the church routine when the clergy loses touch with people or rebellion seeks an outlet. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" might capture the hearts of an audience in that delicate stage of personal growth when one begins to question the beliefs of their parents and community, but hasn't the knowledge or courage to study the more robust and well-established alternatives closely. It is a fine book with amusingly honest observations on the plight of humanity, but I sincerely hope people come to understand that satirical pop philosophy and the serious masterworks of world literature have distinct literary forms and ends."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This was a totaly entertaining book. I think I first read it 15 years ago and I didn't pick up on the humor. The stuff about religion is great.I thought Breakfast was better, but this is still a great read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"An apocalyptic satire of some of the institutions most easily satired-government, religion, military. But Vonnegut is wholly original, as always. His satire holds up today, and there is nothing expected about this book, which involves, among other things: the midget offspring of one of the inventors of the atomic bomb, a form of dangerous ice with the power to freeze people, a tropical island with natives exploited by Americans, and a made-up religion that is just weird enough to be believable. My only criticism, if any, is that although I found the characters interesting, hilarious at times, I wasn't emotionally attached to any of them. I didn't enjoy it as much as Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions, but it was a good read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I speak such powerful words of the author in the title above because I am a tremendously devoted fan of his. His thought process and ability to write such imaginative and complex fiction baffles me.In Cat's Cradle, the main character named Jonah, begins to write a book aptly titled The Day The World Ended. He begins researching the book, and as he travels on his journey to complete the book (or perhaps to find answers to himself or life), he becomes a convert to a thought-provoking religion that proudly proclames its falsity and was written entirely by a calypso singer. He also expericences love, death, the drawback to power, and the erradication of mankind by a small substance known as Ice-9.I reccommend that everybody read this novel! It may just change your perspective on things!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I first read this book in Jr. High, and have read it several times since. It has been one of the most influencial books in my life. It's a great read, fascinating in many respects, and blends politics and religion, which makes it still as relevant today, if nor more so."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle (I'm still trying to figure out why he chose that title instead of \\"Ice 9\\" which would have been more descriptive) is a very interesting book. It opens up multiple avenues for discussion on all manner of topics both social and scientific and would be a fine choice for a discussion book or a book club book.Unlike L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology, Vonnegut's Bokononism, created in this book, never caught on as an actual religion. I would say Vonnegut's religion has much more potential among Christians of weak faith than Scientology, so I'm not sure why it never caught on. Perhaps because Vonnegut didn't set up his own church and start believing his own stories like Hubbard did.Anyway, from the character sketches to the fleshing out of fictional locations, sciences and religions, Vonnegut has a fine eye for detail. He has created a world we recognize and he wields the power to destroy it well."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I know everyone tends to claim that Slaughterhouse-Five is Kurt Vonnegut's pinnacle work. I would suggest, however, that Cat's Cradle is instead his peak, quite possibly the best thing he has written to date. Being a huge Vonnegut fan, I believe there is some truth to this opinion. His main character begins by claiming he is writing his masterpiece, a book entitled &quot;The Day the World Ended,&quot; a story about the atomic bomb being dropped on Japan. Instead, it is a whimsical foreshadowing of events to come and indeed events do unfold.Vonnegut is even rather Tolkien-ish in his writings by creating a new culture along with its own language of sorts, really a dialect of extremely bastardized English. It really proves the intelligence and total command over the language that he possesses. Along with said culture comes a new religion, Bokononism, which emphasizes the pharsical and absurd. After reading the book, you might want to convert to Bokononism yourself! I know I was ready to.Without giving away too much of the plot, let me summarize briefly. What if a scientist, say one who worked on the a-bomb, devised a way to make things different, namely a new way to freeze water? What kind of a man would do that? What could his family possibly be like? How about a midget, a model-builder, and a freakishly tall woman? Now imagine you are a writer trying to track down the mystery behind the man and the stories from his family. Follow then the trail of Jonah, the protaganist, through a wild chase that takes him to the heartland of America all the way to a remote island nation with a large hook as the punishment for any offense. Truly a tale of the mad and the absurd. Vonnegut fans eat this one up. Laugh, wonder, be amazed, and enjoy the tale as told as only the master himself could tell it. Worth every penny and on a personal note one of the few books I still find myself re-reading at regular intervals. I still can't put it down!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I just read the entire book a couple of evenings ago. It's a school assignment that's not due to be finished for weeks, but once I started reading I couldn't stop. I suppose that's because there isn't a single facet of this book that isn't at least somewhat intriguing.I'll outline the plot without giving much away:John or Jonah (it doesn't matter, since his name isn't used beyond the first paragraph anyway) is a devout Bokononist (religion founded by a normal guy, based on obvious and plainly admitted lies), writing from some unspecified time, trying to relate the story of his writing of a book about the day the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. He begins by contacting Newton Hoenikker, son of scientist Felix Hoenikker, main creator of the atom bomb. Newt's response offers some insight into who his father was, but the author needs more, so he heads off the the elder Hoenikker's former stomping grounds, a laboratory in Illium, NY. An anecdote told by Felix's main partner about a hypothetical &quot;ice-nine,&quot; which could freeze all water on earth below 115 degrees F, is what really gets the story going.The thread of Bokononism seems to tie the main themes together, and it's this clever satire on religion that I appreciated the most.This book also has a great ending, so you have that to look forward to. This book is brilliant and very accessible, so read it already."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Lately I've been very much into postmodern novels, so I knew I would eventually come across Kurt Vonnegut's work. This is the first book I've read by him and I'm sure it won't be the last -- yet while I enjoyed CAT'S CRADLE and the laughter it brought me, I think it is far from perfect.The writing itself is simple and direct, yet sophisticated and well crafted. It reads very comfortably and is quite cheeky at times. The prose suits the nature of its narrator (first person) very well, a man who is sparse with his words and quick with his wit (which often goes unnoticed by the other oblivious characters).Speaking of characters: the ones in this book all have their own idiosyncratic quirkiness. They're as eccentric as they come, and some are just outright bizarre and absurd in a laugh-out-loud (but also head-scratching) way. None of them are particularly deep or interesting, but they're fun to watch.Now, the main thing that gets me about this book is the plot. It starts out modestly enough: our narrator explains that he once set out to write a book titled \\"The Day the World Ended,\\" but then he became a Bokononist (I'll leave the pleasure of finding out what that is to you). I'm not going give a synopsis of the whole plot, but suffice it to say that the protagonist stumbles through a series of unlikely events and lands himself on an island full of crazy people. As interesting as that sounds, I never really got the sense that anything was really happening. What events do happen never seem to have any real consequence. I never felt any suspense or shock -- only curiosity, confusion and suspicious awe. And then the story just ends. It cuts off without any real resolution, and I'm left thinking, \\"Huh. That's it?\\"I think that CAT'S CRADLE is carried mostly by its characters, its comedy and the interrelation between the two. I wouldn't call it a profound or impressive novel, but I don't think that's what it is trying to be. I think it's a quirky and fun novel that's a riot to read, but I can't help but feel let down by its conclusion (or lack thereof). Maybe there is a larger point that I'm missing; this book certainly has the potential to exist on many levels. However, as it stands, I can only give it three stars. Maybe I will reconsider when I inevitably reread this in a few months or years (I always end up rereading books I enjoy).Until then, CAT'S CRADLE is just okay in my opinion."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is the story of a reporter chasing down the family and friends of a one of the \\"fathers\\" of the nuclear bomb.

I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a quick read (especially on an airplane, since some of the best parts take place in the friendly skies). Though it isn't his best, Vonnegut doesn't provide the social commentary that something likeGod Bless You, Mr. Rosewater."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The reason I chose Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut is because my friend Matt Burke recommended it to me. The protagonist of the story is John and he wishes to investigate how the day the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was in the house of its inventor, Felix Hoenikker. He intends to write a book on the topic. He writes a letter to Newt, the youngest son of Felix, and with that as a starting point, he becomes even more intrigued by the issue. He decides to travel to Illium, where Felix worked, to investigate his workplace and speak with former co-workers. After visiting Illium he determines that the best way for him to get the most accurate information is to speak with Felix's other children. He tracks down Felix's oldest son, Frank, on the island of San Lorenzo and coincidentally on the way there he meets Angela and Newt (Felix's other two children). San Lorenzo is a poor island ruled by \\"Papa Monzano\\" on a variety of peculiar paradigms. Monzano is very isck and eventually commits suicide with the aid of Felix's last great scientific invention, ice-nice, an isotope of water that can instnatly freeze things. You will have to read the novel to be able to find out the thrilling twist with which it ends.Cat's Cradle was an extremely interesting novel and I am really glad I read it. Through the telling of this somewhat bizzare story Vonnegut is able to convey some social commentary that i found to be both interesting and true. The title was very appropriate becuase it seemed to embody the overarching theme of the novel, whcih was that oftentimes humans see things and make things that simply aren't true. It seemed as if the book was written with a satiric tone, yet it was not intended to be entirely funny. It highlighted the existance of certain paradoxes that people never take the time to actually think of. For example, we readily dichotomize between good/evil but what really constitutes each? Does the man who created the greatest killing mechanism in history constitute being awarded a Noble Peace Prize? Cat's Cradle invoked critical thought and lead me to explore angles that I otherwise wouldnt have, and thus it was a good choice."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If you're not a devoted fan of Vonnegut who picks up everything he's read including his short stories, then this is not the one I would suggest. Cat's Cradle is the book that made the world notice Vonnegut, and compared to numerous other authors it's still a great yarn. Compared to his own works, I feel it's not his best.There is still much to be lauded: his engaging prose style, a plethora of imaginative tangents such as a fascinating and hilarious religion. The reason I'd say a book like Slaughterhouse Five is far better is that all the pieces of Cat's Cradle do not fit together perfectly. The book is almost schitzophrenic with hundreds of fascinating tangents, but when one tries to put it together, it's frustrating.I guess that's not the point. The book itself frequently speaks on the meaningless of life, so maybe Vonnegut intentionally made certain of the books tangents lead nowhere. Still, as a reader, one cannot help but wish for a greater cohesiveness. The ending of the book left me highly underwhelmed.Still, this is a very loved book, and for good reason. If I hadn't read eleven other books by Vonnegut I'd be singing it's praises. So, to summarise, I think some of the books he wrote later on in his career are far stronger, but this book is still a worthy read and the first in which hints of Vonnegut's genius are visible."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut uses a fast-paced chapter and sentance structure, combined with dark humor to litterily propell you through his works.\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is no exception. His style of writing and the books compelling theme drag the reader from cover to cover in the blink of an eye (no small task for a 287-page book) while delivering a vivid picture of the world contained within those pages.As I said, \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is 287-pages in length and has 127 chapters. Each chapter is barely more then 2-3 pages in length, making it quite easy to read this book on a busy schedule. Vonnegut's briskly paced style means you can read a chapter here and there at your leasure and still enjoy the book.On a side note, Vonnegut's short story; &lt;u>\\"Harrison Bergeron\\"&lt;/u> is featured in one of the textbooks for an English class I'm taking at this time. The same story is also avalible in Vonnegut's 1968 short story collection; \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\".I also highly reccomend Vonnegut's other novel; \\"Slaughterhouse-5, or the Children's Crusade\\", which is, for those who don't already know, a fictional tale based off of Vonnegut's own experiences after having been captured by the Germans and sent to work at an underground slaughterhouse in Dresden durring World War II."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The theme of Cat's Cradle is simple: Never underestimate the stupidity of the human race. In Vonnegut's book, the destructive juggernaut we call idiocy ultimately leads to the destruction of the world. This is accomplished via ice-nine. Ice-nine is an isotope of water that is solid at room temperature. It is especially dangerous because one crystal could, if dropped into a large body of water, turn all of the water on earth into this undrinkable substance. What's worse is that if ice-nine somehow gets into the mouth of any animal, humans included, their body will solidify like a statue. This substance was created, coincidentally, by the same man who developed the atomic bomb. That man was Felix Hoenikker. One day while vacationing, Felix's three children found him dead. He had apparently put a crystal of ice-nine into his mouth and killed himself. His children then divided up the ice-nine and each carried their piece in a small thermos. Eventually the ice-nine was pawned for money, love, or power. One of Felix's children gave his piece up so he could get a powerful position on a Caribbean island. Another child gave his piece to a midget Russian dancer/spy. After a very interesting series of events, the world was destroyed by ice-nine. Stupidity is what created the substance, and stupidity is what destroyed the world. Vonnegut was obviously very much against the atomic bomb and other weapons designed to maim or kill other humans. So, don't be stupid: Read Cat's Cradle."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"My first Vonnegut read, but it will not be my last.

I definitely recommend."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I picked this up because I LOVED Slaughterhouse Five quite a bit. While this book shares a lot of the style, the narration is a little off to me. Vonnegut doesn't write characters who are good or evil and he does a lot of foreshadowing. In this book, it almost seemed like some of the foreshadowing fell a little flat and the people were not as likeable. The book is still a fascinating read, more correctly classified as a Vonnegut but not poorly placed as sci-fi.

Anyone who questions religion (from my point of view the main focus of the book)will find solace and understanding in these pages, while at the same time attain a good perspective into those who are religious. The humor is wickedly true (my favorite being the culmination of a father's love to a young midget: a string game of the book's title with &quot;no damn cat, no damn cradle&quot;).

This and &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; are two of the best books that I've read in a long long time. Vonnegut's fertile imagination and his totally original way of presenting his stories, along with meaningful and witty and thought provoking content really elevates him to a pedestal few authors have had the honor of climbing. I loved the idea of Bokononism, and strangely, found myself agreeing with most of 'the fomas' that Bokonon sang! One realizes how narrow and petty the human race has become, with all its greed and 'granfalloonism', and if freedom from that necessitates listening to a pack of lies, so be it!!

I found myself smiling openly as I turned each page, not necessarily because it was funny, but because it was that good. You don't see anything coming, but when it does, it somehow makes all the sense in the world. To say that this book is simply an apocalyptic novel is to sell it short. It contains within it snippets of dialogue and random encounters with quirky individuals that we've all experienced at one time in our lives. Although only a very short novel, it's as dense as they come. Every sentence has its own significance, every chapter is a story in itself. I never thought that such zany and zealous prose could manage to create such a structurally sound story. You'll probably finish it in one sitting, and you'll be angry that it's over."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I picked up this book because I hadn't read Vonnegut since high school. The best way I can think of to describe reading this is to compare it to train-hopping, destination unknown. It's a bit quirky, but definitely most entertaining and illustrates man's inability to control technology. I found the beginning slightly slow, but the story picks up momentum. By the end, you're flipping the pages faster and faster trying to figure out where you're going to land."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is the first Vonnegut novel I have ever read and still my favorite novel of all time. Never before have I read an author that is so dark, fatalistic and twisted, yet funny and optimistic at the same time. Vonnegut writes like nobody else. &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; makes you think. It makes you laugh at notions you normally wouldn't. Vonnegut's very &quot;matter of fact&quot; style of writing is genius. I'm sorry but, If anyone tells you that this book is no good its because they're just not intelligent enough to appreciate it.! I have read ALL of his works and I always eagerly await his next."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"One of Vonnegut's best works. He truly makes you think! It's based upon a substance called Ice-9 powerful enough to freeze over the entire world at room temperature. It provides us with a man's thought of how the world will end, and gives us a look at the future, that some would find very believable, while others would find it very entertaining. It is definitely the type of book that you must follow from the beginning, and think things through at times, but overall a great book. Most Students, whether in High School or Collage, if you ask them have probably read the book. Definitely a peoples choice!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I do not, by any means, consider myself a literary critic, but I do know what I like. Cat's Cradle led me to Kurt Vonnegut, and I find no other author that can stimulate such thoughts. He introduces his audience to old ideas with a new way of interpretting them. I would recommend Kurt Vonnegut to anyone mature and intelligent enough to respect his humor and creativity.

But, the book is nothing about the atom bomb, in fact the atom bomb is rarely mentioned. The book then went on to tell us about how he went to the lab where the bomb was created, and talked to the late Dr. Felix Hoenikker's family and friends. Then John started telling us about this weird made up religion called Bokonon. This is where the book starts to become horrible... Crazy things start happening and none of them make any sense at all. The reason I chose to read this book was that I had read Slaughter House 5, and loved it. But this book wasn't written anything like SL5. I absolutely hated this book because of the fact there was abosolutely no point to it. Every book I've read has had a theme to it, but not this one. No important stories were told, no messages were expressed, and no action occurred. The book was extremely dark and hadn't even the slightest bit of happiness in it.

I have far better things to do with my time than to wait for this old man to get a sense of humor that he can put down on paper. If you would like to laugh, read &quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot;...

I just finished reading it in school and am now very frustrated.Cat's Cradle is pointless and so ridiculous that by the first page, I lost interest.First off, there are WAY too many chapters and for me and my studies, I had to write a chapter summary for each one. Very annoying.Kurt Vonnegut is trying to be funny during the whole book and because of that, his book is about nothing. He just randomly throws whatever is on his mind on paper and gets it published and famous. He tries to be funny. I say again TRIES. He is not though, his attempts are horrible and all of his ironic passages were idiotic.On top of it for a student, he made my life a living hell. We would spent the whole class analysing the first line.\\"Call Me Jonah.\\" Why?!Or: \\"So we had a night to kill in Ilium.\\"None of this is ironic or funny, it's absolutely ridiculous. This isn't a book, it has no plot, nothing. Its characters aren't developed and well...it's so ridiculous it's stupid.The title of the book has to do with a very minor incident and it should have been called ice-nine.The ending is absurd, the whole religion invented is absurd...EVERYTHING IS ABSURD. It's not funny and is painful to endure Vonnegut's billions of attempts at trying to be funny. And then on top it, to have to analyze it and do a final on it...well right now..I'm not liking Vonnegut and I might as well burn the copy of Slaughterhouse Five that I have sitting on my already big book collection.So, unless you are forced to read this trash in school, I would stay far away from it as it's boring, lame, ridiculous, not funny and very painful to endure.Vonnegut doesn't develop any of his characters so by the end, I really didn't give a rat's a#$ what happened to any of them. And the ending...just dreadful. This book manages to bash religion, not develop its characters, not have any plot, be too long, and not funny. Now that's not a very good book."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is a decent sci-fi escape, but nowhere near as good an escape as Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, or Star Wars: A New Hope. This isn't very challenging, and you may feel compelled to read it because of the almost too simple story, and easy going language. This is basically a book about a mad scientist who tries to take over the world by freezing it over with a substance called Ice-Nine, and at the end he succeeds because of his children's greed to control it. Again, not very complex or deep, a basic fable, but still entertaining. But as entertaining as Star Wars? NO. I recommend renting the star war movies or getting the star war books, especially the ones with Jabba the Hut. Cat's Cradle has no point or meaning to it, unlike Lucas's prophetic, amazing vision. Vonnegut is funny, but not very intelligent."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I've never read a Vonnegut book before, and now I know why. He died and so I saw him on the news and figured I should give him a shot. Cat's Cradle kind of sounded dumb and it turns out it doesn't mean anything, but I don't judge books by their covers because that can't tell you anything, so I decided to read it anyway.After the first sentence I knew the book was stupid. \\"Call me Jonah?\\" I mean, why call him anything? What kind of crappy book starts like that? Is that some kind of in joke or something where all the Vonnegutians are laughing SO HARD because he is SO FUNNY again. It only took three words for me to know the book was dumb, but I kept reading it because I didn't want to give up and figured it may grow on me, but it didn't, unless you mean grow on you like athlete's foot does, by which I mean in a bad way, not like it grows on you a whole lot, because it doesn't except in a bad way."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"At the opening of the book, the narrator describes a time when he was planning to write a book about what important Americans did on the day Hiroshima was bombed. While researching this topic, the narrator becomes involved with the children of Felix Hoenikker, a fictional Nobel laureate physicist who helped develop the atomic bomb.Vonnegut uses his wit and humor to demonstrate the absurdities of religion and makes many other useful social commentaries on the human race. The narrator describes his search for a mysterious substance called ice-9 that has mystical properties, and may have incredible benefit(or harm) to civilization, depending on how it used. It is hard to fully describe this book, as one isn't sure what it really is until the last page, but it is a book worth reading for fans of Vonnegut in any event.Relic113"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I'm an avid Vonnegut reader. Though I have not read all of his novels, I've read many- I would say roughly half, give or take one or two.As you may already know, the premise for the book is that the author is writing a book on the father of the atomic bomb, Dr. Felix Hoeniker. He ends up learning about a more devastating weapon (if you will call it), Ice-9. Ice-9 is by far more devastating because it freezes all water immediately upon touch, with the ability to freeze the world if ever exposed to great bodies of water.The book's main focus is on the ugly side of science- Developing new things that create more harm than good, without realizing the consequences. Another focus of the book is on religion's role in society and in persons' lives and how it affects both.Anyways, I do not wish to give too much away. To do so would 1) Spoil your read, and 2) Take up too much time.The book is a good read, though not among my favorite Vonnegut books. However, I attribute this to personal preference, rather than Cat's Cradle being an inferior book. Indeed, any Vonnegut book is heads and shoulders above much of the rest. Many people may disagree, but I did not find the many characters to be fleshed out very well in comparison to some of his other works (Bluebeard comes to mind). Also, comparatively speaking and consistent with my previous statement, I felt that the main characters didn't grow as much as I would've liked (but this is not to say that they didn't grow). Again, these are my opinions and I'm sure that some, if not many, would disagree.In conclusion, Cat's Cradle is a solid read with clever insight into religion and technology's affect on society, for both good and bad. If you're new to Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle isn't a bad start, though I would suggest Breakfast of Champions (arguably Vonnegut's most accessible book), Slaughter House Five (his most renowned), Welcome to the Monkey's House (not extra spectacular, but short stories are a good way to see if you like his style), or Sirens of Titan (his most underrated book and tied with another one of his as my favorite). If you're familiar with Vonnegut, then Cat's Cradle is a very reasonable book to pick up. Either way, there's a good chance there's something you'll keep with you when you finish Cat's Cradle."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"surprises galore. many strange characters fit together in unexpected ways. important concept as to how easily we can end the world."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Brilliant.

He is the Mark Twain of the 1900's. I recomend EVERYONE read this novel."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut wrote a number of extremely good novels. Two of them are truly great. Cat's Cradle is one. (Slaughterhouse Five is the other)Cat's Cradle treads on some of the same ground as Orwell's 1984, but where Orwell delivers his message with a heavy hand, Vonnegut delivers his message with sardonic wit and sharp insight. In Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut directs his considerable wit and insight at the institutions of religion, politics, and science.Cat's Cradle is arguably Vonnegut's funniest and most imaginative novel, and also one of his most profound. It manages to be both absurd and frightening. If you haven't read anything by Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle is a great place to start.

A truly entertaining, and somewhat frightening book. I don't like to write long reviews, so I'll get right to it. If you enjoyed Slaughterhouse-Five, you'll most certainly enjoy this novel. Cat's Cradle is more accessible, and not as outrageous as Slaughterhouse (which I enjoyed a little more). What can be said about Vonnegut that hasn't already been said.

They come away depressed! This is a brilliant satire of so much of the human condition. The charactors are great, and the story line, although fantastic suits as a perfect vehicle for the myriad of points made in a book of less than 200 pages. It is a story to be read every 10 years of so and to compare to the current state of the world. In a way, only the names change and the irrationality continues."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"At the nagging of a friend I finally broke down and read a novel by an author unknown to me at the time, Kurt Vonnegut. Although a relatively popular novelist you must understand I am merely a fifteen year old. When I picked up Cat's Cradle and started reading it I instantly began an obsession with the book. I flew through it in the matter of a day. Vonnegut's portrayl of a lonely soul that gets lost on a trail that leads him to foreign lands, but more importantly, leads him to discover a part of himself that relays back to man's most primitive instincts. The way Vonnegut portrays the main character is a direct and personal satire of the attention span of the average person. The main character starts off on a seemingly simple task, and get's caught up in something greater than all of mankind. Personally, my favorite part of the book came with the main character's obsession with the island princess. Vonnegut spent the whole book building up an empire of personality, and personal traits, only to bring it down with the stroke of his fingers. All I can say is, I can't wait to read another."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Since I first read this book as a sophmore in highschool, I have reread it at least 5 times. If you have ever questioned how society is impacted by science and religion, you must read this book. I have loaned my copy of the book to numerous friends, and every person has gotten something different out of the book. Every time I read it, a different aspect of Vonnegut's social commentary becomes apparent to me. Unlike many other books by Vonnegut, you do not have to read any of his other books to understand the plot"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book makes the reader ponder just what technology is doing to the human condition. Vonnegut makes us think about the &quot;clear and present&quot; dangers of nuclear weapons but also about the fictious danger of &quot;Ice-9.&quot;Ice-9 is a substance which can make water freeze at room temperature. It is thus the most fretful creation ever. It seems funny that Vonnegut has both the nuclear bomb and the Ice-9 created by the same scientist. It'seven funnier that this scientist doesn't appear to have realized what he was doing. (If this interests you, you might want to read the real life testements of Richard Feynman in &quot;Surely you must be joking, Mr. Feynman.&quot;)One of the most amazing parts of &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is the philosphy which is intermingled with the technology. Vonnegut creates a character named Bokonon who has an illegal religion which everyone practices. The main characterof the book slowly converts to this hopeless religion which somehow accurately portrays how life occurs for our present society.

It shows, in a hilarious style,how the weaknesses and foibles of real people are whatreally drive the development of technology.Ice-9, the doomsday crystal that turns water into ice athigh temperatures, reminded me of the button on the copymachine that Dennis the Menace couldn't resist pressingat the end of that film.

The adventure Jonah, the main character, goes through in the story is hilarious and entertaining. Jonah wants to find information for a book he intends to write about the day the Americans dropped the atomic bomb on Japan when he comes across a doomsday device called ice-nine. This sends him on a rather unique journey to rather unique places. Jonah discovers a new religion, Bokononism, that is supposed to be outrageous but seems to make perfect sense. As it happened, or as Bokonon would say it, \\"As it was supposed to happen\\", Jonah journeyed to an island called San Lorenzo, of which he becomes president. I cannot explain the entire plot of the book, but you wouldn't want me to anyway, would you?Among the many characters in Cat's Cradle are the Hoenikkers. First there's Felix Hoenikker, the father of the A-bomb. Jonah wants to research him for his book when he met his children. Newton Hoenikker is the midget-son of Felix who Jonah befriends. Frank Hoenikker is mysterious; he has not been seen for awhile. Angela Hoenikker, the only woman in the family, was like a mother to the boys. She did not have much of a life of her own. The three Hoenikkers have the world's supply of the doomsday device, ice-nine. All Jonah wants is to get his hands on it. What role will ice-nine play in the book? That one you will have to find out for yourself. If you read this book, you will enjoy it for sure.Other books I reccommend are Slaughterhouse-Five by Vonnegut and 1984 by George Orwell. I am a seventh-grader in North Carolina who loves sports."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is the only K.V. book I've read, but I've read it three times in the past five years. I'm scrounging around at Amazon now looking for other books from the man.Cat's Cradle is not funny, not to me. It's scary and repulsive, it's deep and it's incredibly poetic. Good poetry is only as long as it needs to be; it crams as much sense and meaning into as few words as possible; it's ambiguous/open to interpretation, and it's timeless. This book does all that stuff. I hope all of K.V.'s books are as good.The plot is actually quite simple, and also irrelevant. I think V. could have said what he wanted to say 100 different ways and all of them would have had the same effect.In the hands of a lesser writer, it could have become a top mystery/thriller, perfect, really perfect, material for a bestseller, to be made into a Summer Action Blockbuster. But the man chose substance over sales, social commentary over salary, which I supose is his MO, and we all profit therefrom.With the U.S. in dire need of a smack in the public face from a big mirror, Cat's Cradle is as relevant today as it was yesterday."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is one of my five favorite books ever. I keep trying to find something else from Vonnegut that exudes the same energy and necessity of that book. Cat's Cradle didn't do it for me. At the end of the day, the novel felt naked and didactic, like an excuse to shout a world-view. It felt self-indulgent to me.There are a few areas in which a novel can excel in order to spark interest: plot, character, setting, and language/style. The Greatest Novel of All Time probably excels at all of those -- but I don't think that novel's been written yet. If a writer can nail two or three, it's probably worth reading. Heck, if you completely kill on one of those four, the novel will probably do well. For me, Cat's Cradle doesn't excel at any of the above.The plot is thin -- and given that it's intended as comedy, that's to be expected. Still, there's no point at which the main character faces a Problem, battles with Complications, and then either succeeds or fails. Instead, the book's tension is based on withholding a mystery from the reader -- what's the deal with the ice and why does the author keep hinting at how important it is? It's not a very gripping source of tension and, from the standpoint of plot alone, there's no reason not to turn to the last ten pages of the book and see how it turns out. I don't feel like I would've missed out on key plot points by doing so.Characters in this novel are thin and two-dimensional (if that). Again, this is meant to be a comedy, or a parable maybe, so stock characters may be called for. But by not having any actual depth or texture in the characters, character does not provide a reason to care about the novel. The characters come off as so subservient to the Message and are so devoid of reality, that their idiosyncrasies feel arbitrary and manipulative rather than interesting.I'm guessing Cat's Cradle defenders would argue this point with me, but I found that the novel's setting was practically non-existent. At least, I didn't come away from the book feeling like I Was There. The eventual San Lorenzo is sparsely described and, as with the characters, seems entirely subservient to the Message. I don't feel like I get the sense of another actual place -- it felt like it was all happening on a sound stage. To a certain extent, the same could probably be said for Slaughterhouse Five -- except that with Slaughterhouse Five, well, first off there was, in fact, more attention to setting details, but also SH5 builds a landscape out of the minds of its author and protagonist. In Cat's Cradle, we get so little from the narrator in terms of his way of thinking, this doesn't happen. Maybe it should have.Finally the writing and style of the novel -- well, it's the trademark Kurt Vonnegut style, except that he did it better elsewhere. There are no coy self-references like occurred in SH5, no cunning self-deprecation, no fierceness of joy in the absurdity of language and the novel format. It's just sort of jaunty and tossed-off and having read SH5 previously, the writing in CC felt like a weak and unremarkable shadow of what Vonnegut eventually accomplished.As a result, I come away from Cat's Cradle feeling like I'd just read a thinly masked agenda story. And unless you already cling (heh) *religiously* to its message, there's not much fun to be had. In terms of communicative efficiency, it would've been more profound for Vonnegut to have simply written the sentence \\"People believe in and do stupid things, which is especially problematic when they have access to nuclear arsenals.\\" I didn't find anything in the novel that conveyed any other idea of any significance. And frankly, that message itself seems pretty dull in the modern world, especially without a fresher lens through which to view it.All that said, while I didn't enjoy the book overall, I appreciated its brevity (that's not meant entirely back-handedly -- short novels rarely overstay their welcomes). Also, it's a very easy read, and there's a lot to be said for a writing style that allows for that. Unfortunately, I didn't find enough else in this one to make me care.(PS, I've read some of the negative reviews of the book that knock it for being cynical and pessimistic. Er -- it's *Kurt Vonnegut*, it's *supposed* to be cynical and pessimistic. Cynicism in a novel can be done very well and its presence doesn't degrade the work any more than optimism necessarily would.)"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut is by far one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. Vonnegut brings this fictional story to life with great detail at every turn. From the creation of ice nine to Bokonism, Vonnegut weaves a complex but entirely believable story. The novel begins with the main character John who is writing a book on the day the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima called The Day the World Ended. His writing this book leads him to his destiny as he travels to the laboratory where the bomb was created and then to San Lorenzo where he becomes president. San Lorenzo's founder, Bokonon, created a religion for the people. This is an average idea except for the fact that Bokonism seems uncannily real, with it's own terms and practices all created by Vonnegut. This novel is a masterpiece.Cat's Cradle is fast passed, deeply detailed, and very interesting. The novel is very ironic and a must read for everyone. Kurt Vonnegut weaves a great story that never lets you down. Through its outlandish turns and twists Vonnegut makes it seem so very real. This novel is definitely a 5 out of 5."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is one of the funniest, thought-provoking books I have ever read--funny from the first line, thought-provoking weeks after reading it. Vonnegut is very deceptive in his writing. Just when you think you know what's going on, he turns the story in a completely new direction. I was kept off-balance throughout the entire book.The book puts you in a strange quandry: you want others to read the book, but as you read it you want to share outloud almost every scene. It would be easy for me to post here my many favorite lines, memorable moments, and insights drawn from this work. It would also ruin it for every one of you who have not yet read the book. I would not do that you should experience this story first hand.There is a stanza from a poem by Lucille Clifton that is strangely appropriate to &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; even though it deals with an entirely different subject matter. In this altered paraphrase of Clifton's words, Cat's Cradle &quot;is a political story is a war story is a universal story but it is not about these things this story is about one human heart this story is the story at the end of the world.&quot;"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"A classic example of Vonnegut's views of human morality and nature in the face of determinism, Cat's Cradle entices you with a beautiful combination of science fiction and philosophical exploration."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle was one of the first novels I read of Kurt Vonnegut, back in an era where his books were sold as paperbacks with distinctly bright colored covers and a signature logo of title and author, when the author still tacked on \`Jr.' to his name. Vonnegut was adopted by a generation of people his children's age and always seemed hipper and cooler than most others of his generation. He was one of the generation that lived through the Great Depression to fight in World War II and lived to tell the tale, only his tale was not full of gratitude and patriotism. He was one of the \`greatest generation' to actually have the audacity to question whether they really were the greatest generation.That skeptic questioning of authority made him ripe fodder for admiration from the counterculture of the sixties and seventies. Even at the age of nineteen I felt ambivalent about jumping on the bandwagon to read and \`follow' him. Nevertheless, after seeing the bizarre and impressive movie of Slaughterhouse-Five I read that and, at the urging of my best friend, followed it up with Cat's Cradle. In short, it was unlike anything I'd ever read and I wasn't sure how to react to it.After two subsequent readings and at least one reading of all of his other novels and almost forty more years of living under my belt I can more fully appreciate the artistry of this wild novel. In a sense, it is the book that established the template upon which the typical \`Kurt Vonnegut' novel was based. It contains almost all of the standard elements of his fiction. From the opening line \`Call me Jonah' to the final cosmic nose-thumbing it is what they called in the sixties a \`put on.' It takes disaster for its subject matter, in this case the dropping of the atom bomb and the echoes of all potential future doomsday scenarios and laughs at it with a wry, fatalistic serenity. The narrator could have just as easily have concluded with the repeated refrain from Slaughterhouse-Five, \`and so it goes.'Not only does the novel offer a convoluted convergence of fates and paths leading to a doomsday scenario, he filters it through a fictional religious philosophy, Bokononism. The novel introduces us to an entire collection of terms and concepts such as foma, wampeters, granfalloons, karasses and many others. A karass, for example, is a group of people who, often unknowingly, are working together to do God's will. A wampeter is the central theme or purpose of a karass.The novel also includes the fascinating concept of ice-nine. Vonnegut heard about it while working at General Electric. Irving Langmuir, at one time a public relations officer for GE, entertaining visiting author H.G. Wells, told him about the idea. Wells was not impressed enough to include it in a story or a novel so what Wells neglected to use, Vonnegut considered fair game and it becomes the wampeter of Jonah's karass and, by extension, the enforcer of the zah-mah-ki-bo, or inevitable destiny, of mankind, an element that trumps the atom bomb for destruction.A summary of the plot of the novel would be pointless and almost nonsensical without explanations of at least some of these concepts. Suffice it to say, it is a doomsday tale in which a group of individuals, some involved in the same karass and some adhering to one of many granfalloons, are intertwined by various wampeters into a common zah-mah-ki-bo. If that last sentence struck you as gibberish Bokonon would agree and concede that it was one of many foma, harmless untruths.The geographical destination is the island of San Lorenzo, a small island nation located in the Caribbean, on which a structure of \`dynamic tension' was imposed between a fictional religion and a fictional dictatorship by two survivors of a sunken ship, a Marine deserter and an African rover. Lionel Johnson, the African, becomes Bokonon and founds a religion outlawed by the dictatorship by his fellow survivor, Earl McCabe, by mutual agreement. Religions and nations are granfalloons that are dispensers of foma.This novel even includes a practice similar to Heinlein's grokking from Stranger in a Strange Land, published a couple of years earlier--boko-maru, the Bokononist ritual for a merging of souls, enacted by two participants pressing the soles of their feet together and kneading them. Practices such as this may strike modern readers as elements from a quaint artifact of an earlier, more nave time. One must remember, however, that this was an era in which science fiction writers really did create their own religions i.e. L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology. Novelists such as Heinlein and Vonnegut were quoted as modern prophets by people young enough to be their children. Vonnegut possesses the talent of the entertaining satirist and dilutes his sobering revelations with large doses of sardonic humor. Cat's Cradle, like many of his best novels, is not only deceptively easy to read but possesses prescience that casts a shadow on a contemporary society that many in the sixties would have viewed with skepticism and horror. For that, along with many other reasons, it transcends its status as \`relic of the sixties.'"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is obvious since any religion that calls all religions lies, including itself, is probably the correct on to belong to.I'm surprised it took me this long to finally read it.

It expanded my mind sufficiently until I gave up smuggling, eventually gained a PhD and opened my eyes to the inanity of what most agree is reality. Not to be missed by anyone."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vintage Vonnegut in that this is his most cynical book.The book is organized into about 120 chapters, each not much more than a page or two long, so the effect is like being shot by a fully automatic machine gun. With all the crazy ideas packed into such little space, this also surely makes it Vonnegut's densest book.How often can an author invent a religion, a country, and a doomsday weapon all in one book? And he also manages to criticize the use of science without considering the consequences, the lies that parents tell their children, and the futility of most religions. Then he wraps it all up quite conveniently by ending the world.In my opinion, this is his second best book, a more bizarre and warped version of an anti-war story than Slaughterhouse-Five was, with a twinge of his earlier science-fiction wrapped in.I wouldn't call it depressing...at least as end-of-the-world novels go. This isn't a warning about how dangerous our pursuit of war is, but rather how absurd it is. Vonnegut doesn't end the world and expect his readers to shed a tear. He'd rather you shake your head in bewilderment, shrug your shoulders, and give a little laugh. After all, like the cat and the cradle...its all an illusion."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I was listening to a friend of mine talk with our Language teacher one day about Kurt Vonnegut. From all I heard before, he was a sick, psychopath who couldn't write. On advice from my friend and teacher, I went out and bought Cat's Cradle. This book was terrific! It's Absolut Vonnegut! 120-Proof, people! My only criticism is it was too short! When reading it the first time, I kept imagining that it would be terrible, but by the end I thought it was just what I needed to get over a terrible book I had just read for school, The Egypt Game. There is NO reason NOT to buy this masterpice of modern literature! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"'Cat's Cradle' may be the most Vonnegut book he has ever written. A typical page-turner that moves you along with the mix of science, religion and revolution delivered in his sly fashion. I hit my Vonnegut jag as a high school senior, devouring one after the other in a 2-month period. I went through that with Jerzy Kosinski, too, an author I would recommend to any Vonnegut fan. As with all of the Vonnegut books I rate a '9,' the weak link was the ending. Not as good as the rest of the book. The Vonnegut books that rate a '10' are 'Sirens of Titan' and 'God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater.' Those are books that after I finished, I went back and read the last chapters again -- that good. 'Cat's Cradle' is great, but not penultimate Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut uses his novels to explore human nature: in this wonderful book he examines religion, human nature, and the morality of science. Read it as you will, but please look into the web that holds this work together. Reading the surface is a good tale, but pointless. Reading into the novel the true exploration of religion comes out. He calls it a joke, yet points it out as being good. Read between the lines and the true magic of this typical Vonnegut piece comes out."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"One of his best. Cat's Cradle seems rather simple to the eyes, but is a visionary masterpiece to the mind. In the beginning Vonegut informs the reader that what he is about to tell you is a bunch of lies, and what ingenious lies they are. A true eye opener."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut understands the link between science and religion as being the search for truth. In our desire as humans to superimpose order on our lives, we work to uncover the secrets of the universe. The real secret, however, is that the pursuit of truth it futile. In addition to being unknowable, the truth is, ultimately, irrelevant. Let's not destroy the world trying to find it. Vonnegut understands just enough chemistry to be dangerous. Even though the book's ending is a little weak, the journey is immensely enjoyable. For those who truly understand the message, this is Vonnegut's most coherent and most clever work."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"&quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is a great introduction to the world and style of Kurt Vonnegut.

The people are ignorantly content with their lot, nobody wants to rule, and it is not technology that makes people happy, but basic physical contact. Vonnegut leads us into this miniverse of men, and through his eyes we appreciate the folly of being, the indifference of science, religion and man himself to the fate of the world. We become uncaring Bokononists, happy with the optimistic lies we daily tell ourselves. The destruction of this world is, of course, in a whisper, not in a bang.

I consider him to be my favorite writer and it is through this work that I was first introduced to American Pop writing. To me, then it was a very special little book. That's why it makes me a little sad when I reflect over it now a few years later and realise that its not really as fantastic as I once thought. Vonnegut betrays his science fiction background in a book that sprawls out of control. In places Cat's cradle reverts to a 'then this happened, then this as well' style that is immature and unappealing to the reader. This book does have its moments. An excellent introductary correspondence with the son of Dr Hoenikker, the invention of Bokononism; a religion based purely on untruths, which serve to show the creativity which Vonnegut is capable of anyone considering reading this might do better to read 'Slapstick(or lonesome no more)' which to my mind is a far superior book."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is the first Vonnegut I have ever read and it is defintely one of the best books I have ever read as well.

I then saw CAT'S CRADLE, and thought it would be a sufficent substitute. I'm glad i picked it up. It's a funny satire regarding the end of the world and the family of the man who invented the nuclear bomb.

The writer wishes to document the day the atom bombs fell on Japan, and finds his way into the lives of the bomb's late inventor and his family. What follows is a tale of twisted beliefs, self-destructive tendencies, and of seemingly mundane events that will one day transform the world.Multiple people with related histories collide (through more than luck if you believe in the book's religion of Bokononism) in a darkly comedic way on the mythical island of San Lorenzo, and the fate of all mankind is in the balance.It is no wonder that Vonnegut has been a staple on the bookshelves of student everywhere, as he is a masterful writer that engages, entertains, and challenges notions of normality.

How everything goes down will leave you reading this whole book in one sitting."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Worth the read, particularly if you want to \\"try\\" Vonnegut. I did this for a book club and it worked quite well since there are infinite interpretations to pretty much every word of Vonnegut. It's hard to say what it's about other than it's a great outlook on apocalypse."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This was my first Vonnegut book, and I had really high expectations for this book. I was not disappointed, not in the least. The irony, the strangeness (especially in the dialogue), the characters, the suspense, the ending, and most importantly, the humor, were superb. I found myself laughing out loud on several occasions. Vonnegut's irreverent take on religion, government, sex, war, and every other topic he takes on in the novel is refreshing, and the history and principles of Bokonon (the fictitious religion featured in the book) he derives through the course of the story added a lot of comic relief as well as interesting perspective on common religious thinking. Tis a shame I never enjoyed the man's work while he was still with us. I certainly intend to read more of his work in the future."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Call me Jonah,\\" CAT'S CRADLE begins, referencing the unfortunate soul who got stuck in a whale. This Jonah is a journalist who has decided to write a book about the architect of the bomb that \\"resolved\\" World War II. It is not a spoiler to say that he learns after tracking the deceased scientist's post-war life and work that on the day the bomb was dropped, Dr. Newton Hoenikker was playing with a piece of string and as one of his now adult children observes of the children's game of the book's title, there was no cat, there was no cradle. Much of the book becomes a chase down to a Caribbean island republic with a colorful bunch of characters, some accidentally and others not quite so accidentally caught up with the scientist's next big thing after the bomb.Vonnegut uses this absurd comic tale to comment seriously about the problem of unchecked power, whether it is scientific or political. He gets in some views on religion, too, and invents an entire new one out of whole cloth, \\"Bokononism,\\" which is rife with its founder's sayings. Rereading this 1963 book again in 2007 after thirty odd years, I am astounded at the number of prophetic passages that suggest things that later became a part of our cultural language, including napalm, nuclear winter, Jonestown, Katrina, and politicians who don't \\"get it\\" about how America is regarded by the outside world.There is a warm, sad smile in Vonnegut's voice that makes his stuff compelling. His is an inventive vision that melds the comic and fantastic with a shrewd, philosophical look below the surface of human dealings. I especially like the passage in which he puts in his two cents on the value of writers, that they compare to firefighters and emergency personnel, and even college professors, because they all perform essential services to humanity."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is the purest voice of creativity of the modern era, perhaps all time. I have read and reread everything that he's written that is available in print. Each rereading brings into focus some nuance or framing heretofore overlooked or unappreciated. He never insults his readers, even shares the often painful creative process with them. \\"Player Piano\\" is my personal favorite, although \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is popularly considered his masterpiece. When asked to name the guests for my perfect imaginary dinner party, my list always begins with the iron pairing of Jesus Christ and Kurt Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If you are a Vonnegut fan, you'll love the book. The author employs his typical, hyper-aware social commentary while using sometimes silly, often times sardonic, cynical humor. If you are the type of reader who is able to easily extract the deeper meaning of what Vonnegut is saying from his light and fanciful narrative, you will enjoy the book. Otherwise, you will find it simply a whimsical story. If your brain has a hard time wrapping around the absurd, you will not enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is truly an amazing book, if your interested in reading anything by Kurt Vonnegut I would recomend this being your first, I swear it, if you read Cats Cradle you will be hooked on Vonegut!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Of all Vonnegut books, I'd have to say Cat's Cradle is his greatest achievement (despite a few short pieces of his that are brilliant).

You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"With the exception perhaps of Douglas Adams, who else can make the end of the world so entertaining.

As soon as i opened the first page and read the line : \\"Nothing in this book is true\\" i knew it was going to be amazing. However, not all people would enjoy this book. If you like plain, simple, books that don't make you think or use imagination this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I guess it's considered a modern classic by some, but it seemed kind of lazily written to me. Full of intriguing ideas and well-drawn characters, the book starts out strong enough. Once the action reaches San Lorenzo and begins to build toward its apocalyptic climax, however, it gradually becomes less and less coherent. While the story ends with the ultimate bang, it sort of whimpers its way there -- Maybe it's some sort of literary device that I just didn't get -- And is it just me, or does Vonnegut's slightly self-righteous cynicism, doubtless refreshing in the early 1960's when the book was published, now seem just a little tired? The Vonnegut true believers would probably call this so much \\"foma,\\" but, in my opinion, if you're looking for one of the Great Man's books to read, stick withSlaughterhouse-Five"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The best book on anthropology ever. Easily his best book (and sadly, he knows that)"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"There is much less humor in this Vonnegut novel than in many of his others. The characters are also less interesting than those that apppear in his other novels and plays, though there are some that reappear such as the God-guru Bokonon. I just found this novel kind of wierd, and then the apocalypse was sudden, etc. There are many of Vonnegut's typical themes: socially inept people (&quot;losers&quot; in the glitzy American sense) who gain positions of influence/power in obscure places and try to do good, banal science that started out inadvertantly and became very deadly, and speculations about how people should treat eachother. It is an odd conglomeration.Tepidly recommended."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I remember reading this book 20 years ago and it sorta stuck in the back of my mind. Then about 3 months ago I was reading about the prion theory of the transmission of mad cow disease in a popular science magazine, and it struck me as sounding very familiar....then I remembered Vonnegut's Ice9.The prion theory goes like this. There is a protein in your brain which normally folds itself into a particular shape in order to perform it's function. Along comes a prion, which is the same protein, except that it has folded itself into a new shape. This single mishapen protein molecule teaches the normal protein molecules in your brain how to fold into this dangerous, new, non-functional form. Soon afterwards, your brain begins to crystallize into something resembling swiss cheese.Twenty years ago, it bothered me that the central scientific premise of an otherwise fine novel was so implausible....obviously, I no longer feel that way."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Why do people write reviews that are 5 paragraphs long? I dont get it....Anyway, this is a wonderful book. A quick read and suspensful all the way up to the last sentence. Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I don't normally read contemporary fiction, except for Don Delillo, but I figured I would read Vonnegut because I think I confused him with Updike and because there was a Graham Greene blurb on the back. In any case, Vonnegut's black humour is mixed with a little too much knowing misanthropy for my taste. There are no sympathetic figures in the novel, which is roughly based on Shakespeare's Tempest, or at least set on the same island, San Lorenzo, but I could be mistaken. Official ceremonies, scientists, Indiana, and ambassadors all get the superior treatment from our narrator, Noah. The only sympathetic figure may be the scientist who built the bomb, but of course his childlike scientific play will ultimately destroy the world one way or another. Cat's Cradle would be a much better movie than novel, but only if it starred OJ Simpson and was turned into a slapstick comedy, because otherwise the black humour is just humourless misanthropy and the fantasy a tired device."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I love Vonnegut's books. Few, if any, American writers display such imagination and wit. Or depth of conviction. However, in most of the five books by him that I have read, the endings are disappointingly weak. This is definitely the case in &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot;. The book progresses with near Huxlian vision (and much more humor) until Vonnegut appears to run out of resources. His ending, the apocalyptic suffocation of the world with the cancerous &quot;ice-nine&quot;, is far too abrupt and cartoonish. It hits the reader like, well, a dose of &quot;ice nine&quot;. This is a major shame, as his magnificently creative tale deserves a better thought out -- perhaps more subtle -- ending, something that lingers on the brain for a long, long time. The problem with most of his books is their unfortunate diffusion from one's conciousness, more than likely due to their relatively poor endings. I suggest that any readers buying this book bail out about 20 or 30 pages before the end. In fact, I would advise this to readers of most Vonnegut books. Perhaps then, the words of the Master of Black Humor would enjoy a longer half-life, and deserve a much better rating."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Perhaps it's my age. I'm 22. I've heard that this book is supposed to be a \\"must read.\\" So I decided to sit down and actually read this thing.I don't get the hype. Seriously. It's too scattered and too random. It may have started off interesting, when the main character first began his interviews...but it all did not mesh well for me and it was VERY boring.It seems like a very poor attempt to try to appear intellectual. I did not find this book intellectually stimulating at all or find it \\"mind boggling\\" or full of \\"wisdom.\\"I didn't get the satire or find the satire at all amusing.It was a waste of time for me to read this book.I would have liked to see more ice-9, and to go more in depth with ice-9.

As the book progressed, it grew darker. It left you with a sense that all is futile. While the book was well written, it was almost as if there were two separate books, the beginning and the end. I wish it was all like the beginning. Such is life."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Like a lot of Vonnegut's works, the religious/scientific concepts and the fictional society of Cat's Cradle are more interesting than the story itself. However, this does not make the book in any way laborious to get through. You will chuckle to yourself many times, and probably even laugh out loud a couple of times. Vonnegut's talent for writing comical satire is certainly up there with Joseph Heller and the other greats; and Cat's Cradle lives up to what you'd expect from a master in his field. This book is a quick read (I read it all during a cross-country plane trip) and will both amuse you and also plant some wacky, but nonetheless ingenius, ideas into your head. Another good one by Vonnegut, it's worth it if you're a fan of his style or are just interested in getting acquainted with his work."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I was told to read this over summer for an Advanced Placement high school course, and got a great surprise. I could talk about social satire and other philosophical, metaphoric ideas, but nobody cares.

Don't be frightened off by Vonnegut's reputation, give Cat's Cradle a shot. The book is just plain excellent."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is no Slaughter-House Five. But what novel can possibly compare to that one? Though not as staggering as that book, Cat's Cradle is still can unbelievably well done novel that manages to be both hysterical and profound in a way that only Vonnegut can seem to pull off. It is a short book, but this slim volume contains a mountain of insight on religion, war, human nature, sex, well-being, and the limited nature of human comprehension. It broaches all these subjects with humbleness; it brings no pretensions to the table and is throughly honest--it never feels like it is being preachy. Bokonon is one of the best characters I have encountered in all of literature, and the philosphy he promulgatges is so obvious that it is hard to believe that it sounds so fresh. I guess that sometimes obvious things are hard to see. This book states the obvious that maybe we would never notice on our own. Cat's Cradle is vintage Vonnegut. Bokonon says: \\"History, read it and weep.\\" I say, read Cat's Cradle and have your mind blown."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I've read all Vonnegut's books. This was the first one I read, and it's still my fav. Breakfast of Champions comes close, but this book is still his masterpiece in my mind.Anyone who sees this world from the half glass empty principle will love this book. I laughed out loud repeatedly - Kurt just cuts through the crap and writes the most basic concepts of life at point blank range - he really knows how to make us see things for what they truly are.I'm not going to bore you with what I got from the book or what you're supposed to think. I think that what makes this book great is that you'll get something out of it no matter what your belief structures are or what your background is. Read this book and decide for yourselves."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was funny, scandlous, and very interesting.e"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle, a novel be Kurt Vonnegut, is a science fiction novel. In this story, the main character (who is also the narrator), Jonah, meets many interesting people on his journey to successfully write a book. He encounters many new things, such as a new religion, and a new way of living. Jonah's book, along with an article he needs to write for the magazine he works for, leads him to San Lorenzo. There, his life takes a very interesting turn, and because of this, his life will never be the same again. Kurt Vonnegut has many highlighted points in his writing. In the novel, he writes as thought he was thinking. He doesn't always write in perfect English. This makes reading, for the most part, easy. However, at times, it can be difficult to understand. Vonnegut also uses an extensive vocabulary. There are words that he uses that I could not define without a dictionary. He also makes his chapters very short, which I find makes for much easier reading. I believe this novel was very good and I enjoyed it very much. As I read Cat's Cradle. some very vivid pictures were painted in my head which, added to the overall effect of the book. I would recommend this to anyone in the reading level of a fourteen to sixteen year old. However, this would provide as entertaining reading to anyone over the age of sixteen as well."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The novel Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut is an entertaining story of a man who gets tied up while writing a book. It features an interesting cast of characters and tells a story of the end of the world.One of the positive aspects of this novel is its humor. Although the humor is mostly dry, Vonnegut gives a comical twist to his characters as well as his ideas of the future. One of the negative aspects is within the content. For some people the religion of Bokonism may be hard to understand because it is so odd.Cat's Cradle would be most interesting to either teenagers or adults. If you're in search of an enjoyable novel with great characters and plot then this is the story for you."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"A friend gave me a copy of this book and assured me that I'd love it. Frankly, I was a bit sceptical, because the premise just sounded weird to me, and I never expected to get around to reading it. However, one night I picked it up, and I didn't get to sleep until I had finished it. What a ride! I think this novel could be enjoyed by just about anyone, even if you think it's not to your &quot;taste&quot;. Give it a try, I'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Having read many of Kurt Vonnegut's novels, both the sublime (MOTHER NIGHT) and the ridiculous (TIMEQUAKE), I felt I was prepared for CAT'S CRADLE. And, as usual for Vonnegut, all his usual elements are here: the purposefully simple prose, the distrust of established dogma, sex, religion, science, et al. But upon finishing CRADLE, I was awestruck at my unpreparedness for the true mobilizing force behind the plot. Rage.CAT'S CRADLE is an angry book, full of loathing and despair for the construct we call humanity. Vonnegut has always been one of the world's best moralists, but CRADLE finds him almost unhinged to the point of mania. And yet, it is quite likely Vonnegut's greatest and most entertaining achievement.The narrator, Jonah (or so he informs us), is an author bent on penning a novel which will encompass the day the hydrogen bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. His research leads him to the family of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, a scientist involved in the invention of the bomb. As he talks to the family, and other scientists, he becomes faintly aware of a fictional substance called \`ice-nine', which had befuddled Dr. Hoenikker for some time. In true Vonnegut fashion, this subplot is dropped until needed, as several years later Jonah meets up with the Hoenikker family in San Lorenzo, a tiny third world country with a bizarre origin and an unusual religion.I don't want to give too much of the plot away. Unlike several of Vonnegut's more recent works, the plot does play a large part of the novel's progression. Suffice to say, the fictitious religion of Bokononism plays a large part in the story, as do insanity, death, power, Armageddon, clarinets, stone angels, and love. And it all proceeds logically, especially in the context of the teachings of Bokonon.Like the best of Vonnegut, the deeper themes only come to the reader after they are replayed in the mind. Vonnegut's distrust of religion is evident as always, as Bokononism is based on the premise that all religions are lies, including Bokononism. But Vonnegut doesn't simply slam religion; Science, as the alternative, is equally a cause for distress, as power-mad generals demand new methods of destruction from their scientists, and the scientists don't consider the possibility that perhaps some problems should never be solved. Vonnegut finds no happiness in ignorance, but he finds none in knowledge, either.Why, then, is CAT'S CRADLE such a funny book? Any other author might have well been crushed under the weight of manic depression. But not Vonnegut. He revels in man's insanity, in man's arrogance. Vonnegut cannot provide an answer; neither should he be expected to provide one. He realizes that by delivering a soliloquy on a method to save us, he would become that which he despises the most: a preacher. Vonnegut knows there are no easy answers. All he can do is provide examples of where our current behaviour will take us.CAT'S CRADLE is simultaneously hysterical and horrifying, a morality tale that remains as relevant in the 21st century as the day Vonnegut published it. Anyone who believes they have the answer to mankind's problems should read it at once."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I liked the imagery and the ideas of the book, like ice-nine. The parts I had trouble with are how he jumps around and sometimes gets strange and loses the reader."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This apocalyptic novel by one of America's greatest satirical writers is an interesting view of what the end of the world may be like. The hero, John (Johah, as he calls himself), begins work on a book about the bombing of Hiroshima, and ends up getting mixed up in the lives of the A-bomb's principal inventor's children. Interestingly enough, the man who was most responsible for the atomic bomb is also largely to blame for the final destruction of human life.Vonnegut may be a fatalist, and he certainly is a pessimist. His bleak view of mankind, of science, of religion (as exemplified by the outrageous theology he creates) is nothing short of a wake-up call. Vonnegut is immensely entertaining, and anyone who enjoyed Slaughterhouse Five or any of his other novels is sure to be pleased with this book. Dark it may be, but this was, for me, one of Vonnegut's most enjoyable works of fiction."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"(this review contains no spoilers)CAT'S CRADLE was the first thing by Kurt Vonnegut that I ever read, and honestly, I would probably recommend this novel above all others as the best place to start reading Vonnegut's work. It's relatively short, and chapters are only a page or two long. The book moves at such an incredible pace that it's hard to put it down. Beyond that, the book contains messages and themes that I still think about today (it's been about 5-6 years since I've read it).The crux of the book involves a hopeful author that tries to make sense of the Hiroshima bombing. He stumbles across the story of a mad-scientist involved in the making of the atomic bomb. While searching for information concerning this scientist, he stumbles across the scientist's children and a strange creation only known as \\"Ice-Nine.\\"The essence of Vonnegut's writing concerns the underbelly of humanity: war, greed, anger, stupidity. This book particularly was written in response to the Cold War and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Instead of his books being dark, dreary affairs, they are actually pretty funny and full of wit. Vonnegut's philosophy is that, when faced with something horrible, you can cry or laugh; he prefers to laugh, as it involves less tears. Laughing at these truths are the only things that stop us from crying. Much of the plot of CAT'S CRADLE would, in any other context, be pretty disturbing, but given the author's knack for humor and pacing, it becomes a satirical farce.Kurt Vonnegut is often considered to be a science-fiction author (probably due to the alien presence inSLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE), but CAT'S CRADLE is largely devoid of any kind of scientific-mumbo-jumbo. Sometimes this novel is dinged for its flat characters, but as long as readers keep in mind that these are less of characters and more of symbolic representations of humanity's various faces, this probably won't be an issue.I would recommend CAT'S CRADLE to most people I know. In fact, I would recommend it to anyone interested in the plot's premise, but I would especially suggest this novel to anyone who is looking for a good gateway to begin reading Kurt Vonnegut. CAT'S CRADLE or SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE are both good places to start, but due to CAT'S CRADLE's more brief nature and absurd themes, I'd recommend it first."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is probably the epitome of insane. And I mean that in the best of ways. Vonnegut's use of prose weaves the zany, the quirky, the tragic, and the realistic all into one beautiful quilt, a pattern of images that sticks with you forever.Cat's Cradle was the first novel I ever read by Kurt Vonnegut, but it has encouraged me to continue through his work.The plot concerns itself with Jonah, our loyal narrator who is researching the family of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, and his connection to the development of the atomic bomb. Through this link, Jonah, and the reader, is introduced to his children, who are all unique in their own way. Saying anymore than this might spoil the story, which is very interesting.Vonnegut's prose is very frank and efficient. This does not necesarily mean it's austere, however. Often time Vonnegut uses metaphors or seemingly unrelated topics/imagery to convey his ideas and/or theme. The end product is fantastic.This book is fit for almost anyone. If you are here, reading this review, thinking about reading this book, then it has already piqued your interests. Read on! And read quick!The First time I read this novel was in 8th Grade. I thought I understood it then. I was very wrong. I have since returned to it, even if just for a few pages of light perusal. This has remained one of the best books I've ever read. I urge you to try it out!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Since I was a child, this book has been dear to me. It taught me morals and values that I still hold close today. But what morals would that be? It certainly didn't teach me to think that all new military technology is evil, that religion is all lies, or even that all \\"midgets are, after all, diversions for silly or quiet times.\\"I love this book because it reminds us that one of humanity's greatest gifts is an ability to create new things out of nothing, and at the same time it warns us that unbridled arrogance in this creation - lying, approximating, assuming we can predict everything - is a danger which should always be kept in the back of our minds.Vonnegut disapproved of the atom bomb and all of the new, despicable, creative technologies that Cold War scientists were developing. MADD made him mad because he believed the theory was quite mad in itself. I don't share these beliefs, but I certainly agree that worrying about nuclear destruction, chemical weapons, and biological agents is vital to the health of the modern world. Worrying about these things is what makes us human; it is what keeps the world sane in the advent of nuclear weapons. Vonnegut's book definitely taught me to be wary of consequences, averse to arrogance, and suspicious of others' creations. These things are in the back of the minds of any one who has read this book and as these people create for themselves, this story's morals will stick with them. That is the brilliance of this book. I think it has served its purpose."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Wow! What an amazing piece of writing. If you've read my previous two Vonnegut reviews for The Sirens of Titan and Slaughterhouse Five you'll know that I was not impressed with Mr. Vonnegut after my first read and he slowly grew on me with Slaughterhouse. I enjoyed S5 and Cat's Cradle may have just become my favorite book of all time (for now). After my first two Vonnegut novels I found myself with a pretty decent understanding of Vonneguts writing style and it seems to grow on me more with each.What I liked most about Cat's Cradle is that it can be whatever you're looking for in a book.It certainly holds it's own if you're looking for pure entertainment.Vonnegut's wit and the story shine through here by themselves. I never felt like I had to search for greater meaning to the words in order to appreciate them.As an example there is an exchange between Miss Francine Pefko and Dr. Asa Breed early on in the novel that I found so hilarious I reread it about 8 times.Another that stands out in my mind is the chapter titled \\"Bicycles For Afghanistan\\" in which H. Lowe Crosby describes the current state of the American Bicycle industry.It just goes to show how politics can screw up the simplest of business models and although written in 1963, could very well have been penned yesterday.That being said, it would be hard for anyone with an average intelligence not to pick up what Vonnegut was trying to get across with Cat's Cradle.This is a wonderful book that has serious, yet comical, political,anthropological and religious messages.It's not hard to see why Vonnegut was awarded his M.A. for Cat's Cradle from the University of Chicago in the abscence of a formal thesis.I recommend this book to just about anyone.It's very clear why Cat's Cradle is cemented into literary history as one of the all-time greats."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's cradle has the unique prose of Vonnegut. I'm talking about the perfect blend of humor, irony and truth that can summarize the most trascendental aspects of our existence. In this book - which to some people is the best of Vonnegut's novels- religion, science and politics converge in the stories of an imaginary inventor of the atomic bomb, a sustance capable of freezing the planet, a prophet, a banana republic and many other characters that reflect the contradictions of modern society. With memorable passages and new words of the \\"bookonist\\" faith, this book will undoubtedly leave a footprint in every reader."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This author made me fall in love with literature.

This is a very interesting and well written novel by one of my favorite authors. I won't spoil anything, but expect more of Vonnegut's wry and dark wit.

A few years ago I picked up one of his books and found it kind of dated. Then on a whim I reread Cat's Cradle. It is so Vonnegut. For fans, that is probably enough description. He presents his view of the human condition in a way that will make you like the characters, most of whom are bumblers. He does present strong views, but never in a way that make you feel preached at, but in a way that leaves you laughing at first, and then rechewing the ideas later. This book is definately not dated, and now I am in love with the author all over again. I am thinking he is an author that should be required high school reading, a lot more entertaining than being forced to read Beowulf!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I became an instant fan of Vonnegut when I read this book. This is certainly the best of all his novels. His imagination is astounding; not only does he write better science fiction than most &quot;real&quot; science fiction writers, but he also invents a believable new religion (with a whole new vocabulary) and peppers the book with dark comedy so black it makes the movie &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; look cheerful. This is not a book to read when you're depressed. However, it is the perfect statement of Vonnegut's manic-depressive genius."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book is a strange prayer for peace. Written in 1963, at the height of a country in the throes of nuclear paranoia, Russian Fear, Kennedy's assassination and increasing American interest in the land of Vietnam, it is easy to see why Vonnegut felt compelled to write this book.He writes, \\" Perhaps when we remember wars, we should take off our clothes and paint ourselves blue and go on all fours all day long and grunt like pigs. That would surely be more appropriate than noble oratory and shows of flags and well oiled guns.\\"This book is anti-war, anti-religion and anti- science, for it too, in the form of nuclear bombs and \\"Ice-9\\" will destroy the world as we know it.From the books of Bokonon, a satirical send-up of Religious writings treated as the all-knowing word of god:\\" Man blinked. 'What is the purpose of all this?''Everything must have a purpose?' asked god.'Certainly,' said man.'Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this,' said God.And he went away.\\"I would recommend this to anyone who loved Slaughterhouse-Five, for this is how the author arrived at that great story. An evolution of sorts, dealing with the same subject matter.(Sidenote: Ice-Nine is the name The Grateful Dead chose as it's lyrical publishing company name. Obviously this was a book on the shelves of many far-out kids throughout the 1960's. Just thought I'd mention it.)"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I discovered Vonnegut in high school and fell madly in love. Besides being a wonderful writer, he's a perfect transition point for someone just beginning to tackle literary fiction, because while his style is accessible, his ideas are complex.I've read all of his stuff, and CAT'S CRADLE was always one of my favorites, along with BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS and MOTHER NIGHT. But this is the one I've returned to most often, probably three or four times, so the day after he died, I picked it up again as a personal farewell. Like all of his stuff, it's deeply human, mingling a sincere love for our best with a wry acknowledgment of our ever-present worst. Summarizing this book takes the joy out of it, so I'll just say that it's about a new religion, a nuclear scientist, a midget, a failed writer, and the end of the world. If you've never read Vonnegut, you could do worse than to start here."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Cat's cradle\\" is written in very Vonnegut style, in the midst of fiction and realism. The book starts describing the narrator's intention of writing a book about what important Americans did on the day Hiroshima was bombed with major attention on the \\"father of atomic bomb\\" fictional Nobel laureate physicist Felix Hoenikker. During his research the narrator gets acquainted with the scientist's childern though several letters, and finally ends up in the plane with them flying to an island where Frank Hoenikker suppose to become the next president.Bokononism as a new religion defined by Vonnegut, created in the fictional island of San Lorenzo, one of the poorest countries in the world that was yield by each government to the next without any resistance during last several centuries. None of the islanders cares about anything except fishing, bokonizm and sex (defined as \\"boko-maru\\" in unpublished Bokonist books). All the intrigues are about a powerful material called Ice-9, the last discovery of great scientist, the only existing piece of which was shared among his children.Narrator fells in love with beautiful Mona, who as well as all other native Bokonists make suiside by Bokonon's order. At the end he appears alone with four Americans on San Lorenzo as a \\"new Robinson family\\" and finally meets Bokonon, the creator of Boknist religion. The book leave reader guessing what will happen next and is absurd and fantastic."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book is a classic. I read this book during college, and I have proceeded to read it at least 4 more times. The entire story highlights the depth of Vonnegut's genius. It also shows how carried away that man can get with things. The Ice 9, in my opinion, is a metaphor for the nuclear arms race and MAD. The characters are sharp, each with their own duty and importance to the story. I believe that Cat's Cradle is a good as other Vonnegut classics such as Slaughterhouse 5. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking to read something a little different than what they are used to. Vonnegut is a genius, and you need to discover why that is so."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is the story of a man, Jonah, who is writing about the \\"end of the world,\\" or the day when the atom bomb was dropped. His work on the book encourages him to go on many journeys which ultimately leave him in a somewhat ironic yet very comedic position. The story features an imaginative religion, a scientific potion, and a far off society as part of Vonnegut's many bizarre episodes. Jonah, researches the \\"father of the atom bomb\\" and his children in order to determine what they were doing on the day the atom bomb was dropped. Seemingly against his will, Jonah gets pulled into a plethora of discoveries about the children and their father which he never could have imagined to be true. His journeys ultimately land him, along with the children, on a secluded island with a radically different society from their own.I did in fact enjoy reading this book because of the absurdity and the unbelievable voyages which the main character undergoes. However, it is in fact Vonnegut's style that makes the book so enjoyable. He is able to bring the reader into this world where virtually anything can happen which then leaves the reader totally unaware and clueless as to what comes next. The world allows him to describe such things as the discovery of the island of San Lorenzo in a two page account where six different countries claim and forget about the nation before escaping African slaves finally claims the land for good. It is through Vonnegut's voice and style that the reader may not stop to consider such oddities as this one.Originally, I chose to read this book after finishing Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" and was absolutely taken away by the combination of absurdity and hilariousness through which he expresses himself in this book. Though I did not expect this book to be as far out as the alien adventure in \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" it did seem like a pleasant offbeat satire about modern man. In the end I enjoyed this book more than \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" because of the comedic voice that I found more visible in \\"Cat's Cradle.\\" Though the first was rather ridiculous and interesting, for me it did nothing more than provoke thoughts about where such an idea would come from, rather than make me laugh.I would recommend this book to anyone who is seeking an imaginative and far off satirical story that is sure to create a smile. While many may think the story to be boring and pointless, it is partly this hollowness that makes it so enjoyable. The reader is baffled and unable to understand why things happen the way they do creating a randomness that I have found to be attractive. For those readers that were bored by part of the book and decided to put it down forever, I would encourage you to fight through the beginning. After all, I did in fact at first believe that this would be a serious account of the day the atom bomb was dropped, until the Bokonon religion was further explained and glorified."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Let Vonnegut plunge you into the dark realm of scientific progress. Meet Felix Hoenikker, a scientist who cares little for the consequences of his breakthrough research on humanity. Discover how his creation, ice-nine, affects those around him. Imagine the impact of merely a single drop of ice-nine that can cause oceans of water molecules to freeze irreversibly.Through Vonnegut's often aberrant and whimsical text, he manages to depict humankind's search for happiness, while using humor, wit, and cynicism to explore morality, the absurd, religion and mortality. This is a story about creativity and the power of science; and at the same time it is a pessimistic look at the fate of humankind, a stupid and vicious race.You will adore Vonnegut's catchy chapter titles and quirky characters, but may grapple with trying to relate seemingly disconnected chapters. References to oblivion and abyss emphasize the idea of emptiness and remind us that we are all wanderers, with regrets and lost questions, clinging to our souls."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book was amazing. I read Slaughterhouse-5 and Bluebeard before reading this book and this is my favourite of the three. He's a genius. You have to read it."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is another brilliant novel by Kurt Vonnegut. A science fiction satire/tragedy/love story/dysfunctional family saga, \\"Cradle\\" is narrated by a writer who had set out to write a book about the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. Ultimately he gets involved with the colorfully warped family of scientist Dr. Felix Hoenikker, a weapons technology researcher. The narrator's quest takes him to the Caribbean island republic of San Lorenzo and to an encounter with Bokononism, the remarkable religion that has been outlawed on San Lorenzo. And driving much of the story is the secret of Ice-Nine, a scientific discovery with horrific destructive power.Above is the bare-bones outline for a richly-peopled, tremendously imaginative exploration of human arrogance and frailty. \\"Cradle\\" is filled with brilliant motifs and details. From the San Lorenzan dialect to the details of Hoenikker family history, the book is a wonder. But possibly the best part of the book is Vonnegut's rich realization of Bokononism: its scriptures, rituals, and lexicon are intriguingly revealed throughout the book.\\"Cradle\\" is full of unforgettable scenes of both horror and whimsy, all brilliantly capture by Vonnegut's amazing prose. For a compelling companion text, try Octavia Butler's \\"Parable of the Sower,\\" another sci-fi novel about a fictional religion."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is a heavy-handed satire about the military-industrial complex using brilliant scientific minds to create weapons of mass destruction, but because it's written by the inimitable Kurt Vonnegut, you get a cleverly conceived tale of science fiction delivered with the comical madness of a Marx Brothers movie. This novel is pure fun even at its apocalyptic extreme.The narrator (\\"Jonah,\\" as in trapped in the belly of a whale) is a journalist who plans to write a book about August 6, 1945, the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Particularly he is interested in the life of the late Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the principal scientists who worked on the bomb. After corresponding with Hoenikker's midget son Newt, he interviews fellow scientists at Hoenikker's place of employment, a think tank called the General Forge and Foundry Company. Jonah learns that one of the last things Hoenikker was working on was something called \\"ice-nine,\\" a substance which freezes water at temperatures much higher than 32F.Then Jonah gets an assignment to interview a philanthropist named Julian Castle who runs a charity hospital on a Caribbean island called San Lorenzo. On the plane to San Lorenzo, Jonah happens to meet Newt and his horse-faced sister Angela who are on their way to the same destination to attend the wedding of their brother Frank, who happens to be a high-ranking official on the island, to a beautiful native girl named Mona, the adopted daughter of \\"Papa\\" Monzano, the island's dictator.Arriving at San Lorenzo, Jonah finds out that all the islanders practice an outlawed religion called Bokononism, started by a calypso singer named Bokonon. Bokononism is in a constant state of development as its founder thinks of new things to write about, but its main attribute seems to be a sort of shoulder-shrugging fatalism supported by well-meaning but useless aphorisms, a playful lexicon, and a bizarre foot ritual. Frank offers Jonah the Presidency of San Lorenzo upon Monzano's imminent death, simply because no one else wants the job. Unfortunately, a few stray samples of ice-nine and an ill-fated air show spell disaster for not only Jonah's lucrative new position, but the world.Note the modern implications of what the defense industry today calls \\"technology transfer\\" -- sure, ice-nine kills every living thing that touches it, but it has practical uses like solidifying muddy roads for military operations. As Vonnegut feels that writers are society's canaries in a coal mine, this novel is like a big red flashing warning signal to the powers that be, not that they'd heed it, and besides, it's too late already. What else is there to do but laugh?"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"You either like Vonnegut or not. This is my second novel of his that I've read, and again, he comes across as misanthropic, plotless, and pseudo-philosophical. His characters are wooden and unlikeable. His chapters are usually one page long. His prose and dialogue are generally quite bad. He is not a comedian. If this is the published novel, one wonders what the first draft or brainstorm was like.What drug was Vonnegut doing, when the Cold War made him think up \\"ice-nine?\\"If Vonnegut wrote to get some message across, why didn't he write an essay or a short story? If he wrote a novel so that he could flesh out characters or tell some compelling story, then this is a utter failure.If you want funny, read P.G. Wodehouse. If you want an anti-nuclear message, there are at least a dozen better short stories or novels by other authors. Some of them are near-masterpieces like Bradbury's \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\", Clarke's \\"The Curse\\", and Miller's \\"A Canticle for Liebowitz.\\" If atheism is what floats your boat, read some atheistic philosopher because Vonnegut can't even go toe to toe with Elijah and the bears."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"My father is a Vonnegut fanatic so this book came highly recommended to me. Having finished it a few days ago I feel that I can make a fair assessment of the book.I have read one of Vonnegut's other works before Breakfast of Champions having read that and now this I notice a trend of Vonnegut's style of writing. You almost get a feeling that he is stalling, not inserting any action. In Cats Cradle nothing exciting happened until there were 30 pages left in a 200 page book. It wasn't even as if he had built up the anticipation for something to happen either. Vonnegut just keeps reintroducing more and more information for you to swallow. He even goes so far as to make up words for his Bokonism religion. The words were often times hard to remember which was which, presenting discontent. However the book was not all bad. The book provides a very radical insight of the world and makes one truly question their beliefs. However it's a very pessimistic view, as is common in most of Vonnegut's work. After finishing the book I felt very depressed and didn't enjoy my reaction to the conclusion to the book. Vonnegut depicts how the human race will inevitably destroy itself. All and all this book is okay if you're on vacation and get to read it everyday. Otherwise you forget some details on the religious words and what have you. That is why I give this book 3 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is my first Vonnegut read. Considering his Nobel prize for literature, I was disappointed. Cat's Cradle creates a handful of new words; bokonon, boko-maru, wampeter, and etc. The apparent purpose of this tome is to poke fun at religion in general, in a very gentle and inconsequential way.Generally, I was bored through the bulk of the story, with only the slightest uptick in the way Vonnegut tied up loose ends together at the conclusion.My next Vonnegut read will be \\"Slaughter House Five\\". If what little I've read about that story prove to be even half accurate, it should prove to be a better reading investment.Paul"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Ive read through Cat's Cradle twice and I'm convinced that Mr Vonnegut was either insane or is good at convincing the reader that he is. The characters in the story are certifiable. And the leadup to the climax is a trip through the rediculous and surreal. That may very well was his intention, however the result is a book this is every much jarring to try and get through."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I wanted to read some more of Kurt Vonnegut. I was disappounted with this book and never finished it. The book did arrive in good shape and on time. It semed like a loose story with some of his comments about life, but witout much of a plot."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I was begged to read Vonnegut. Bland mysticism; dozens of convenient chance meetings, storylines which drop off the face of the earth; this was cheep! Please don't compare to Heller."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I read this book almost a year ago. So my memory is a little rusty, but at the same time, the really good parts and the really not so good parts stick out.While I was reading this book, it kind of bored me. It takes a great amount of action to really keep me interested in stuff, though. I think I may have a light case of ADD. Anyway, the religious words that Vonnegut made up kind of jumbled together in my mind, and I just pretty much confused one for another. I don't know. I just felt kind of bored throughout the book.It was good, though. I'm glad I read it. It's kind of like 1984, it kind of sucks as you're reading it because it's so damn boring, but when you get through it, you think to yourself, &quot;Damn it, that was a good book! I'm really glad I read it! Everything was just great!&quot; Cat's Cradle is kind of like this. 1984 was better, though. And then again, I like chemistry, and the whole ice-9 thing is chemistry related. Haha, I'm a dork.Read Slaughter House Five first, if you've never read Vonnegut before.

I also read Sirens of Titan and Wampeters, Foma, and Grandfalloons, his Autobio. Look, he's witty, but not deep. He is a cynic. If anything, his writing displays the fragility of human existence, and the fact that not a lot of people know what the point of everything is, including him. You will most likely reach a point, about half way into the book, where vonnegut is absentmindedly continuing the exposition while your saying to yourself, &quot;get to the point already.&quot; The other thing is that he is never uplifting. Nothing revolutionary here."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is my first Vonnegut book, and I absolutely loved it. I began reading it 3 days ago and I finished it last night. i wasn't able to put it down for more than a few minutes at a time.

Vonnegut won't let you down."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut has been my favorite author since high school, when I first picked up one of his books. I have been an avid reader of his since then. Vonnegut uses many metaphors for the concept of organized religion, and at some points actually comes out and states his point. Many interesting concepts and points about religion and out ideas of a God are expressed in this book. I hesitate to say too much about it, this book really speaks for itself, and is best saved as a &quot;treasure&quot; to discover for yourself. I HIGHLY reccomend it to anyone- from high school age on up, it makes a great read. By far one of the best books I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I haven't read any of Vonnegut's other books (yet), but I certainly will!

I can't say that I'd recommend this one over any of his others, since I haven't read them yet, but I definitely recommend it, period!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"It was my first experience with Vonnegut. It was great. Not so hard and not so easy. He basically satires religion and science. Religion is nothing but lies, and science is truth. But even though science is based on proof, so it seems right to us,some bad sciencists don't care about the rest of us. There are two type of scientist--good guys and bad guys. Good scientists are doing their work for human beings just like the way Castle does his jobs. Bad scientists have no moral sense what they are doing. It seems to me he doesn't like religion and science at all.However, he still gives us a good path that science need to follow -- Take care of people rather than kill them. Religion is nothing but lies. But we need religion because we need to lean on that whenever we encounter problems. He also gives us an example of that when papa is dying he does boko-maru which is bokononism ! ritual to feel comfortable. Anyway, this book is great and make think a lot about two basic elements of our life.P.S.-His background would help to understand this book. He majored chemisty at Cornell, and later he attended U. of chicago to study antropology. So he has a balanced background of science and religion."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is a well-known excellent writer. He wrote several great books that incorporate human life and emotions. One of his best works was A Cat's Cradle. This book talked about the contradiction between illusion and reality and how people valued it in their societies. It also showed the topic of science vs. religion in modern society. Vonnegut's creative style of writing made this book an interesting read. All of these reasons make A Cat's Cradle an excellent book to read and a beginning for the understanding of the world portrayed in Vonnegut's many writings. The plot of A Cat's Cradle involves humanity and the contradictions that exist in modern society. Vonnegut focuses on the theme of illusion and reality in this book which were also explored in his previous novels, Mother Night. He came to the conclusion that illusion becomes reality in people's lives. A gloomy world is depicted in this novel to show the reality of life. This book is basically about one man who wants to write a book about World War two. It leads to his investigation between the topics of science and religion. The science part of this novel discusses an atomic bomb and a fanciful \\"ice nine\\" poison. The religion part of this novel discusses the widely followed religion of Bokonism that said that God is \\"utterly indifferent.\\" The topics this novel discussed were written very humorously. Every chapter had a joke at the end. It was an easy and very interesting read. The characters were exciting and easy to follow. A Cat's Cradle questioned topics of humanity and life in a very interesting and joyful way. Kurt Vonnegut's book A Cat's Cradle was an excellent read. Its theme was creative and questioned certain topics that really never discussed. Like all of Kurt Vonnegut's books the chapters are short and discuss short segments of the main character's life. After the reading the book, it makes the reader question their own life and humanity in general. The way the book is written keeps the reader consistently involved in the book. I truly enjoyed this book especially since I have read other books by Kurt Vonnegut. I hope you decide to read it and then read other selections by Kurt Vonnegut, an acclaimed and highly recommended author."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is clearly one of KV's best books. He has a way of writing a science fiction book without it seeming like science fiction. The focus seems to be more on the characters than the plot idea. The description on the book jacket emphasizes all the wrong parts, so don't let that turn you off."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"What is society? Why does society leave behind those who influence it most? Why are some of the firmest establishments religion? Kurt Vonnegut dared to answer these ever-pondered questions in Cat's Cradle, a novel daring to talk about things that most men do not. Vonnegut satirically and facetiously explains and defines society, through a story about a bomb, a midget, a clarinet player, a mad scientist, and a man who just wanted some answers.How could Vonnegut have used these tools to explain such a large and vital factor? That is the magic of the novel as well as his unique and intense art. Vonnegut picked apart society's aspects and analyzed them, and then he proceeded to put them all back together, allowing one to look at the whole in a new light. The narrator does this through meeting people and describing their place in society effectively. However, when those characters were introduced, the author did not simply just bring them in and begin his descriptions, both physical and intellectual. All the descriptions of the vital characters were researched and unveiled to the reader beforehand, and of course Vonnegut always had a way of slipping them into the scene. By the time they were in the picture, the reader already knew them or knew of them. This factor made the novel enjoyable to exponential amounts. Vonnegut also challenged Christianity, and wondered why it was the firmest leaning post people have, especially American people. Why wouldn't a religion like Bokonon, the religion of the narrator, with its bittersweet lies aimed only at pleasing society, surpass this main stream religion, with its harsh truthfulness. The author's approach to this fact made the story fascinating because of the brightness and boldness of the idea.The structure of the novel, with small, neat 1 or 2 page chapters, depicts how thought is broken up into thought, just like the recollection that regular thinkers go through every day. The chapters do refer to each other interchangeably to make the story comprehensible. The titles of each of the chapters pertain to small details included in the text that stuck out in the narrator's mind. Any person can relate to this type of thought, since it is involved in any recalling of any story. The reader then flies through the novel and digests the story as any other would their own. This novel was incredible in the fact that Vonnegut dared to challenge so that in the end, the reader could do nothing but relate to his conjectures."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"What is the purpose of mankind?As usual, Vonnegut has done the unthinkable. He's turned an absurd, worse case scenario into a very possible future. In the future mankinds fight against his own nature has escalated to a point that they no longer have a point. Machines and a few elite run absolutely everything. The I.Q. rules supreme and loyalty is unquestionable. The U.S.A. has fallen away from there onetime belief in the people. Usefullness and happiness has been replaced by convenience. The management of the country can not understand how someone without an electronic dust reducer in their home could possibly be happy. One time daily survival chores have been reduced via machines into a ten minute daily routine. What do you do now. How about head to work for the Recks and Reeks to pointlessly beautify a city that has already been made perfect so you can bring home your thirty dollar a week check. Or maybe you belong to the army and will therefore spend twenty five years cleaning your barracks and marching in parades with your wooden toy gun. The machines do everything so proficiently that the every day man is turned into little more than a show room slave. Modeling to other countries how good we have it over here. Government gives everyone a meaningless job and a prefab house. There is no hunger, no homelessness, no problems to overcome. Besides, maybe, what to do with your spare time besides sit in a bar and talk about your lack of realistic plans for the future."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I picked up CC after a friend recommended SH5, which I read and enjoyed. Vonnegut's sly, subtle wit will probably strike many at first as just cynicism, but the character's all have heart. Ironically in all of the absurdity of Vonnegut's characters and stories, he manages to capture more of humanity than any author I've read in quite some time."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I had heard of Kurt Vonnegut for some time, and decided to subjectively decide upon his brilliance. I chose Cat's Cradle as my introduction to the crazy world of Vonnegut, and I must say that I was impressed. His writing is witty, funny, and unique. His cast of characters were unbelievable and hilarious. His comments on religion, politics, science, etc. were profound and thought provoking. Vonnegut's genius only takes precedence in your mind days after you have finsihed this work, as you constantly anaylze his statements and beliefs. It has been a long time since I have had to anaylze a novel, but Cat's Cradle serves as an interesting piece to dwell upon."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Ice-nine is a substance that will freeze anything it touches. Invented by Felix Hoenikker, one of the scientists who created the atomic bomb, it has the potential to bring the world to an end by turning the planet into a freezing ball.&quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is a novel full of sharp satire and irony. The narrator, who is writing a book about the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, meets in the course of his research a variety of weird and wonderful characters who recount their experiences of the late Dr. Hoenikker. This leads him on a quest to find Hoeniker's three children, who each possess &quot;chips&quot; of Ice-nine...A novel that has been compared a number of times to &quot;Dr Strangelove&quot;, &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is a witty, dry-humored approach to the apocalypse. Although Hoenikker's three children are weird, I could relate to these characters more than any of the others in the book.The way in which the world comes to an end is so ironic and offbeat.

While the book remains an important work, I think a bit of the urgency and vitality wore off. I remembered that it had some cool ice-stuff and a frozen dog from being a teen. Upon this reading, I was amazed how spiritual the essence of the story seemed under the layers of obvious satire. Jonah, the reporter, is attracted to the exotic Mona, not because of her beauty (but being the typical male, that's what he thinks) but because, ultimately through the simple act of touching his feet to hers, he finds God. Vonnegut seems a very anti-religious man.....hating the organized religions of the world, but still facing up to the fact that God can be found anywhere and everywhere, even if one dosen't know what one seeks. The book, due to it's anti nuclear theme, was perhaps more urgent in the 1970's, but it is still a laugh-out-loud enjoyable read. I also admire the layers of storytelling. It is one of my favorite Vonnegut offerings."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"End-of-the-world fiction is probably my favorite fiction genre, and I found Vonnegut's &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; to be by far the most bizzare addition to my library in this area. My interpretation is that it is suppose to be taken in the same vein as Stanley Kubrick's black comedy film &quot;Dr. Strangeglove.&quot; Not only was it written around the same time at the height of the Cold War, it has the same high farce tone about it. Vonnegut's ultimate fate for the world is sheer genius, though when it finally happens, it seems almost like an afterthought. Vonnegut's book is a challenging read and one that is not for everybody. Nevertheless, you'll find yourself thinking about it long after you've put it down."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Who but Vonnegut could hum and bum his way to the end of the world? Cat's Cradle is for anyone who wants irony without obvious sarcasm. Superbly written. A triumph of a busy, busy mind. (Added Plus: Find out what James Taylor means in his mumbled line on &quot;Steam-Roller&quot;"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Actually the three stars I am giving it are in my opinion a gift. I am assuming it is supposed to be satire but is too outlandish to take seriously and not funny enough or outrageous enough to be good satire. Overall it was mildly amusing but I was expecting much more based on all the great reviews.It is too lightweight to be put in the category of great books it is rated alongside!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Did I read the same book as other reviewers who thought this was narrated by 'a scientist', that John was in a world-wide search of ice-nine? That think his name was Jonah? It's like these people reviewed this book and didn't even notice the basic facts yet felt the need to comment on the satire, ironies, etc. I sometimes wonder if these people read half the books they review. By the way, his name was *almost* Jonah because unlike the bible character who defied God's will and was punished for it he decided to embrace God's will for his life and 'go with the flow' of wherever 'coincidences' took him.This was written during a time when you didn't have to dig deep into a book to look for a possible hidden message - tv has caused us all to look at everything through 'LOST' eyeglasses. You don't have to look for clues or hidden meanings - they are clearly stated. This is a simple satiric view at religion, politics, relationships and the good old USA. I also think it was a tad prophetic in dealing with Bokonoism - the total acceptance of a religion whose own creator admitted it was a made-up religion based on lies smacks of today's Scientology movement.Characters not too deep but this is typical of Vonnegaut - their reactions are more important than their depth. I thought it was a good story and I laughed at obvious satires his characters missed. I wanted to see how it ended.This reminds me of the movie 'Back to School' where Rodney Dangerfield paid Kurt Vonnegaut to write his book report on Kurt Vonnegaut's work: the teacher gave the paper an 'F' and said, \\"Whoever wrote this paper doesn't have the slightest clue about Kurt Vonnegaut\\". Ha! Ha! he's just one of those authors we'll probably never really ever get."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is a wacky, swift, many charactered Vonn book, wrapped around his frequent theme of human ridiculousness.Jonah is the narrator, a man fascinated by the day the Hiroshima bomb was dropped, who sets off to investigate one Feliz Hoenikker, noted scientist and possible \\"father\\" of the bomb. What ensues is a funky, quirky, Vonnegutian swirl of synchronicity, and faux Taosit/Existential philosophy, born as Bokononism.Cat's Cradle is a quick read, featuring 127 chapters, some a page long, few beyond three pages long. Including Jonah there is Newt, a midget, Mona, the most beautiful woman in the world, the mysterious Bokonon, gruff, crude American's, scientifically bizarre ice-water, a statue lover, a Ukrainian spy, an ex-pat ex-convict major domo, a frozen dog, and the possible end of the world, among others.Truly a trip through Vonnegut. Through it all though, the essential foolishness and gullability of man is turned up to light.\\"Of all the words of mice and men, the saddest are 'It Might Have Been.'\\""},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"As a graduate of Catholic high school and UCLA, I read Cat's Cradle on my own in 10th Grade, and it changed/saved my life. Vonnegut's perspective is one of truth, and this fantastic fictional tale is a wonderful vehicle to enhance positive objectivity in the world. It resonates with the wholeness of the world, the role of a society and it's members, and the quirkyness of genius."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"There is a great deal of very witty satire in this short novel that resonates with anyone who lived through the sixties. Vonnegut is dead-on in lampooning the child-like idiocy of twentieth century science in playing with forces that it neither understands nor can hope to control. Also effective is Vonnegut's critique of religion. He imagines a deal struck between the founder of \\"Bakononism\\" and the head of state to keep his religion illegal. Somehow the unholy alliance between the state and religion has a way of corrupting the latter. This is quite well done and amusing.As for the principles of Bokononism itself, on one level Vonnegut seems to be preaching a \\"free love\\" philosophy and hostility toward organized religion that were so much in fashion 50 years ago. But on a deeper level, Bokonon seems to be making the age-old challenge to how God can tolerate so much stupidity and evil in His universe.On the down-side, I thought much of the book could be pared down -- including an interminable plane ride to the fictional island of San Lorenzo and endless discussions/letters between Newt and the narrator that do little to advance the plot or ideas of the book. Also, the book lacks the true depth of feeling that later made Slaughterhouse Five a masterpiece.So, I'd recommend Slaughterhouse Five to anyone who wants to read Vonnegut now. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is good, but not great.In the audiobook version of this novel there is a ridiculous interview of Vonnegut where Vonnegut posits that his German heritage somehow kept him from being accepted by the literary establishment. I suppose Vonnegut did not get the literary acclaim he desired. This was probably more the result of snobbery toward best selling authors than any hostility to German Americans. Or it could be that Vonnegut had a habit of saying a lot of silly, eccentric things. But his writing is generally good and his books, particularly Slaughterhouse Five, are worth reading 50 years after the fact."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is Kurt Vonnegut's fourth novel and was perhaps his most autobiographical one when it was released. Published in 1963 it features the Hoenikker family, and specifically the three kids, an elder son, a tall middle daughter, and a younger son are similar to Vonnegut's family. This novel also helped turn Vonnegut into a popular author, when Graham Green said it was \\"one of the three best novels of the year.\\" As with his other novels, Cat's Cradle is a satire, and while there is a science fiction element to it, that is not the strength of the work.The narrator is a writer who is working on a book called \\"The Day the World Ended\\", which initially is about the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima, and in particular the father of the atomic bomb, the late Dr. Felix Hoenikker, and in particular his three unusual kids and what they remember about the day the bomb was dropped. However, like the title suggests, things are not always what they appear to be (\\"See the Cat? See the Cradle?\\").Vonnegut changes the focus of perception throughout the book. The end of the world originally focused on the atomic bomb, changes to a new and different threat also created by Dr. Felix Hoenikker. Bokonoism goes from a spoof of a religion to a religion of its own. Perceptions also change with regards to San Lorenzo, the relationship between the government and religion, and the attitude of the narrator to writing. Even the perception of the titles of the chapters changes as the reader progresses through the story.The science element of this story is actually rather weak, although there is an intriguing concept; there is also a key point which Vonnegut doesn't address at all. Nevertheless, the strength of the novel is in the insights, as well as the counter-culture elements, and the unusual style makes this an interesting read, to say the least. When Vonnegut is discussed, often this novel is left out when it comes to what was his best. However, his dark humor and social satire are well in evidence here, and this is not one to be missed."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I had to read this book for my ethics class, and it was chalked full of metaphors and symbolism in regards to society and what people tend to believe is important. The story is a fast-paced page turner, and even though it has been decades since its publication, the issues it brings up are still very relevant today."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Who else could combine a newspaper journalist, the apocolypse, a midget, an invented religion complete with its own tennents, terms, and texts, and the father of the atom bomb into a fun and thoughtful novel. NO ONE! A fun a thrilling novel that you will need to read twice!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"All of the true things I am about to tell you are shameless lies..\\"As with other Vonnegut books (like the Sirens of Titan), a far-fetched plot takes the reader through what may, at a first and distanced glance, be a fun science fiction story. But the use of a surreal and fanciful story is for the purpose of perspective and comment on what we as people tend toward in life. Through satire, we can see man's self-destructive tendencies and our desire for purpose to the extent that we are happier believing in lies than accepting what may be a truth of meaninglessness. Thus, the cat's cradle - a meaningless game with no cat and no cradle - just a bunch of X's in string. The characters and story line are entertaining, even if you wish to ignore the social, religious and political comment. Though to me, the message laced in the story is what makes this book outstanding. For those unfamiliar with Vonnegut, the Cat's Cradle and Sirens of Titans are were I recommend you begin..."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is a completely unique novel in that Vonnegut uses his saterical touch to mock the creators and user of weapons of mass destruction. It damns the scientific community for creating these weapons without thinking of the impact that they have on the world. The weapons of chioce in this story is an element called Ice-9, which intantly freezes everything it comes in contact with. When it is used it freezes the entire world slowly. This novel makes one question the use, creation as well has the wisdom of thse weaons. But does so with a sarcastic smirk."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is a strangely written book. It is a tale of discovery, a quest for knowledge, and also the end of the world. I feel that Cat's Cradle is a great book, although I am not familiar with the rest of Vonnegut's work, I have the need to read more of his work after reading Cat's Cradle. The characters in the book have a varying depth to each other, and at times it seems like some characters are constructed in a somewhat shallow manor (Angela), some are deeply based and have a lot of back-story behind them (Frank). I really enjoyed the plot as well, this book truly takes the reader on a ride, where they have no idea where the ride will end. It was a great feeling, after reading this book, to look back to the beginning and remember that the main character (Jonah/John) had originally set out to write a book.The book begins with our main character (Jonah/John) setting out to write a book about the day in which the nuclear bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Jonah's task is to gather as much information as he can about the so-called father of the atom bomb (Dr. Felix Hoenikker). Hoenikker, however, has passed on, so it is up to Jonah to obtain information on the doctor, through his three children (Newton, Franklin, and Angela). After correspondence with Newt, Jonah travels to the research lab where Dr.Hoenikker previously worked, and we are introduced to Dr. Asa Breed. Breed talks with Jonah about Hoenikker's work habits and his behaviors. And then, the topic of Ice-Nine comes up. Without giving away too much, Ice-Nine is capable of causing the end of the world. In a quest to find yet even more information about Dr.Hoenikker, Jonah attempts to track down Frank Hoenikker, who is believed dead. The search for Frank leads Jonah to a small remote island. The rest I will not spoil.Perhaps the most prevalent theme in the book is Bokononism, a fictional religion. Bokononism really is the backbone of this book, especially the elements leading up to the climax of the book. I will give away this much about the book, Bokonon teaches that all religion is lies, and that there is no way to truly know what God wants or what his will is. The purpose of the whole Bokonon angle is irony. I will give away no more.Cat's Cradle could very well be considered a masterpiece. Plain and simple."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is Vonnegut's commentary on the 20th century - from overreliance on science and its callousness to religion and how political mismanagement makes spiritual revivals necessary. Best of all, Vonnegut is clever and thought-provoking chapter after chapter. His ideas, while they may not seem seminal today, are ever-important.The story is based on a writer's research for a book cocnerning the dropping of the atom bomb. Vonnegut's roots in scientific curioisity are everywhere in his writings, and crucial here. He creates his comical cast of characters around the story of the atom bomb's fictional father - his midgit son, a 3rd world dictator, American imperialist, a former Nazi physician trying to expiate his sins, and a number of scientists, each defective in his own way and each unwilling to embrace moral responsibility to society.Vonnegut's narrative flows like a biblical text that is seemingly frivolous, yet seems to tackle serious subjects with the utmost gravity. This is vintage Vonnegut - tackling human weakness and tragedy with satire."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle was the first book by Vonnegut I'd read, and I was definitely not disappointed. Unlike a real, \\"empty\\" cat's cradle, this book was filled with irony, wit, and hard truths about society that ring true even (especially?) today. If Cat's Cradle wasn't so damn funny, it would be chilling ... his end-of-the-world scenerio is devastatingly simple enough to be real. Amidst this tale of impending doom, Vonnegut makes the reader think about religion, politics, and science with an increasingly cynical outlook.This is an amazing book and a fast read. Give Cat's Cradle a shot if you have the chance: you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If you're interested in learning about the stupidity of man and why religion is useful as an art form, this book is for you. Vonnegut entertains us with an apocalyptic tale about three kids with a dangerous new form of ice invented by their father who helped build the atomic bomb. Through their shortsightedness, the world is frozen and almost everything dies. Of course, no apocalyptic tale can exist without some commentary on religion and Vonnegut doesn't disappoint. He introduces us to a new religion built on top of \\"foma\\" a.k.a. lies. Which makes humans just actors in a play about the struggle of good and evil; how entertaining!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"&quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut received my vote in the MENSA BULLETIN poll of the best fiction books of the 20th century. I still remember the November 1972 day I came across it in the Wichita, Kansas Public Library. It was a green cover hardback misfiled at the end of the sports books with the games and crafts books. I surmise that someone filing books thought &quot;cat's cradle is a string game, therefore, Vonnegut's 'Cat's Cradle' must belong here.&quot; I am glad that it serendipitously came to my attention. It was and is an eye opening and thought provoking book. It remains one of those books that I enjoy revisiting every few years just for the pleasure of becoming lost in the joyous meditation of reading. Harlan Ellison thought Vonnegut's &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; should have won the HUGO AWARD as best science fiction novel of 1963. I agree. More than science fiction, it transcends the genre and moves into literature. Bravo, Kurt Vonnegut. Job well done."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Regarded by many critics as the book that put Vonnegut on the map, it tells the tale of a man and the obserdity of religion. Vonnegut makes up his own religion (if L Ron Hubbard can do it) and his own vocabulary to illustrate that the world is the way it is because of the way we persive it and if you were to alter your perception maybe you might change the world. This book is a must for any Vonnegut fan and an easy, insightful, mesmurizing, thrill ride that will make you laugh and cry at its truth and at its absurdity."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"My dad told me to read this book and I looked at him like he was crazy. I hadn't read a book any harder than Harry Potter and MAD magazine for the last few years, why would he expect me to read this mumble jumble. I agreed to give it a try and sat down and read the back. It sounded like a intersting book so I decided to read the first chapter or so. After about an hour of reading I realized that I could not put the book down. One thing about Cat's Cradle is that it is very well written but it doesn't have a high diffuculty of reading, so a boy like me could read and enjoy it. Cat's Cradle is a very fun and a feel good book, but it has suspence and drama that keeps tou on the edge of your seat. The book features a whole made up religion, started on a crazy made up island and crazy characters on the island and even a crazy substance that could end the world, all this coming from the mind of Kurt Vonnegut, who wrote the wonderful tale. I think that if there is 5 books that everybody should read in their lives, this should be one of them. Cat's Cradle is just so imaganitive it just makes you want to be inside the book. So if you haven't read this book, I suggest you jump out of your seat right now and go to the library and read Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle. It is a great book."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Killer Kurt once more had me chuckling and thinking--the loveliest of combinations for any time and any place.

It's a gentler introduction to Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I wanted to kill myself after reading this book. Kurt laughed laugh, pissed on love, and destroyed the nerves in my mind. I absolutely like this book. If you love riding a roller coaster, you'll love this book even more."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"In 1963, when the fear of nuclear annihilation was foremost on the minds of Americans, Kurt Vonnegut wrote Cat's Cradle. The novel was written just after Khrushchev and Kennedy resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis. Cat's Cradle is loosely based on a father of the Manhattan Project, the scientific thrust of America to design and build the nuclear bomb that was eventually denoted on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. The narrator set out to write a book called \\"The Day the World Died\\" by interviewing the surviving members of the scientist's family, but a push into Bokononism changed his frame of reference.Many consider Robert Oppenheimer the father of the nuclear bomb, but here, the man is Felix Hoenikker, a scientist at the General Forge and Foundry Company in Ilion, NY. There are elements of Oppenheimer in the fictional scientist of Vonnegut's novel, but Vonnegut based Hoenikker on a scientist he knew from his job at General Electric. Hoenikker is survived by his three children: Newt, a dwarf, Angela, a thin, horse-faced woman, and Frank, a drifter. The narrator also learns that an even more dangerous invention of Felix Hoeniker may exist, a substance called Ice-Nine.The 'vin-dit,' a sudden shove in the direction of Bokononism, occurred in the shop of a maker of tombstones in Ilion. The town of Ilion in Cat's Cradle is based on Schenectady, NY - one of the tri-cities in Eastern New York State, along with Troy and Albany. The proprietor of the shop was Avram Breed, quite a coincidence because the narrator just finished visiting the foundry operated by Asa Breed. Both Breeds were brothers. Even more coincidental was the story of a gaudy tombstone ordered by an immigrant generations ago. The name of that immigrant is a sensational detail in the story.Foma is the cornerstone of Bokononism, something that the author believes is true of religion, politics, and maybe even science. Bokononism is also forbidden in the country of San Lorenzo, yet it is also the national religion of the country. San Lorenzo is a fictional country in the Caribbean Sea which serves as the location for the second half of the novel. The national leaders of San Lorenzo secretly practice Bokononism, as do most of the people.There was probably a time, before I was born, when people used these made-up words from Cat's Cradle in everyday conversation. Using them today will get you a lot of blank looks, but the philosophy behind the novel is timeless. Cat's Cradle is vintage Vonnegut, capturing the concern of the student protest movement about the direction of post-war society, with a slight twist of dark humor that makes the novel a Vonnegut classic. Along with Slaughterhouse-Five, Cat's Cradle is easily one of the decade's most influential books, and one of the century's most thought-provoking novels."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"A great book with an original voice and unlike most books, it actually has something to say.

A timeless book."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is Vonnegut at his best. The irreverence, flippancy and zaniness of his characters (and writing) mask deeper questions of religion and the nature of human faults.In answer to Christianity and all religions one of Vonnegut's characters creates his own and falls prey to it. Bokononism is one of the great and funny creations of late 20th century literature. It's founder is one of the main characters within Cat's Cradle and never makes a real appearance until the last page and only then to deliver a message to &quot;Jonah&quot;.Vonnegut risked getting out of control in this novel, but somehow he's able to balance everthing, keep the reader involved and make a statement. Unlike other &quot;hip&quot; novels of the '60s, Cat's Cradle holds up well in our decade."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is a FANTASTIC read!... A heartbreakingly dramatic yet hilariously funny satire on the simple ... ideas of scientists. It's just as good as Slaughterhouse-five, if not better! Jonah, the protagonist, and every other character in the book is not only memorable but realistic. And you actually feel for them. Bokonon is a brilliant religion! It seriously makes you stop and think about the world around you. Believe me, at the end of Cat's Cradle you'll be begging for more!!! It's probably my favourite book. And I guarantee you'll love it!!!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I thought Vonnegut was good when I read Slaughterhouse Five, but then I picked up Cat's Cradle. I won't ruin any of the story for you by telling you what happens, but it is, like Vonnegut's other books I have read, funny, but at the same time makes you think. Keep an open mind when you read it, that would be my only advice other than read it."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Perhaps Vonnegut's masterwork...although many would argue for Slaughterhouse. This appears to be the start of Kurt's insane phase which seems to span from Cat's Cradle all the way until Galapagos, give or take. Where this books tops many of his 'insane era' novels is it is more a mesh of his early, 'money-making' novels where he tried to follow more traditional writing guidelines (i.e. Mother Night, Player Piano). Again, many will disagree, but due to Cat's Cradle combining Vonnegut's insanity and early Orwellian/Huxlian style this book is ultimate read to truly taste Kurt's entire pallate (of course, ignoring the later 'Bitter, Old Man' phase [Bluebeard, Timequake]).For those looking to sample the taste of a brilliant, raving lunatic, which is Kurt Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle is the true paterfamilias, not Slaughterhouse."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"As a high school reader I missed the Vonnegut craze. But, on one Saturday with nothing to do my father suggested that I read this. I can say that a few hours later it is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. It my not be the best structured book, but I really enjoyed it thoroughly. It is written so the main character, Jonah, has already gone through this. This makes it helpful to the reader to explain some of the plot before you get there. Anyway, Jonah is writing a book about the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on a Japan. As we go though his research he see Vonnegut insights into the institutions like science, religion, and many others. This is a book that really is going to make you think about ideals that you hold deal. I can't wait to read other books by Vonngut."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Dude, this novel rocks! Awesome in its complexity and scope! The world will end, not with a bang, but a whimper of despair so silent it deafens the soul."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"My favorite quote from Cat's Cradle by Jonah, our somewhat humble Hoosier narrator. It is just one among many quotes that you will be itching to write down while reading Vonnegut's blackly fatalistic, yet humorous take on the madness of humanity. After having read other dystopian, apocalyptic masterpieces such as Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, and 1984, Cat's Cradle was a break from the monotony that not only makes you laugh, but also makes you think."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Initially I was somewhat put-off by the first few pages of the book. I didn't feel like familiarizing myself with this invented religion (Bokononism) and it's respective jargon, so I put down the book and didn't pick it up for several months. But I decided to give the book a chance again and I came up w/ the following:This work goes at a good pace, in the few places where the novel may start to dull, Vonnegut picks things up again. You can say that it's a roller-coaster of a book, you have no idea where the book can go. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" involves Jonah, who decides to write a biography about Dr. Felix Hoenikker, who invented the atomic bomb. Yet, his search really starts to takes off when he acquires information and contacts w/ the former scientist's children. From there, the storyline is like letting to of an inflated balloon --> from the lab to Newt on the plane to San Lorenzo to lust to presidency to ice-nine @ work, and more! I'd find myself returning from a 10-hour workshift and I could still read this book for hours. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is a good one, it'll make your head spin, you'll find yourself begging for more."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If you like the writing style of Kurt Vonnegut, then this is the book for you.

Such was the case with this classic and my Sunday. It was fairly short and odd enough to be interesting; full of wisdom and dark, important humor.With Vonnegut, you always get some satire, some sci-fi and something you can take home and add to your own personal religion. This one will make you a Bokonist, which is like an atheist, but without all the smug ignorance passed off as knowledge."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"People who like Vonnegut either for his ideas or humor will like this book.

It precipates the end of the world.Before Ice Nine takes over, and freezes the world, Vonnegut takes us on a whirlwind tour of the hearts and minds of a slew of zany characters, from Newt the midget, son of The Father of The Atom Bomb, to a secretary who disdains anyone who \\"thinks too much,\\" to a philanthropist who turns out to be the complete opposite, to a zillion others (almost too many) in between. We are taken to the island of San Lorenzo, a Carribean banana republic run by a paranoind, eccentric dictator that is totally at the beck and call of the USA, and that is where things really get weird.This book is divided into 127 very short chapters, which makes it not only easier to read and remember, but also made it easier, I'm sure, for Mr. Vonnegut to write.One of the main points of this story, if I understand correctly, is that religion, in this case \\"Bokonism,\\" is pretty much a hodge-podge/hocus-pocus bed of spectacular lies. In the end, the founder of Bokonism, Bokonen, admits himself that it was all a complete joke, not to be taken sersiously (how can anyone take seriously a religion where people make love by rubbing their feet together?), but I won't spoil it by telling you what happens in between.Mad scientists and their nervous secretaries, midget kung-fu, foot sex, countless hungry, skinny, stupid natives, one beautiful, \\"healthy\\" native, fat businessmen here to save the world, steep jungles, waterfalls, underground bomb shelters, earthquakes, tornadoes, fire and brimstone (don't tell Vonnegut I said that), horse faced flute playing enfent terribles, and much, much more. Oh, and I almost forgot. Ice Nine. How could I forget Ice Nine?This book is a parable for the end of time."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I read this book when I was in high school and liked it, 40 years later I will read it again and love it."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Having read Cat's Cradle for the 3rd time in 30 years, I have to conclude, for the third time, that I've never read anything with such bitter truths presented so humanely.

It has changed mine, 3 times now!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"What I liked most about Cat's Cradle is that it can be whatever you're looking for in a book.It certainly holds it's own if you're looking for pure entertainment.Vonnegut's wit and the story shine through here by themselves. I never felt like I had to search for greater meaning to the words in order to appreciate them.As an example there is an exchange between Miss Francine Pefko and Dr. Asa Breed early on in the novel that I found so hilarious I reread it about 8 times.Another that stands out in my mind is the chapter titled \\"Bicycles For Afghanistan\\" in which H. Lowe Crosby describes the current state of the American Bicycle industry.It just goes to show how politics can screw up the simplest of business models and although written in 1963, could very well have been penned yesterday."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut is an apocalyptic story about a writer's wish to findout about the personality of the man who created the atomic bomb. His journey bringshim to San Lorenzo, a secluded Island where a religion exists that's main point is \\"finding meaning is futile\\". He meets the children of the maker of the atomic bomb, all of which possess a substance that could potentially destroy the world.This is my first time reading Kurt Vonnegut and it's an experience that I should havehad sooner. The book has a very satirical tone to it and is reminiscent to the works ofChuck Palahniuk and Christopher Moore. Vonnegut offers us a tongue in cheek view of religion, politics and the human condition in general. His style of writing is confusing at first but the reader can tell that it's intentional. There is mystery and an element of surprise. In the beginning I wondered what exactly the book was going to be about.The characters are round and well developed, all have their own unique quirks,and lack predictability. Even Mona with her nonchalant personality ends up surprising you. The main character (John or \\"Jonah\\") is delightfully inconsistent when it comes to his structures of belief and always keeps the reader guessing. Newt (who is a little person and the son of Felix Hoenikker, the creator of the atomic bomb) seems irritated and resentful at first but emerges later on in the novel as a dignified man with an amiable disposition. Julian Castle (a well-to-do member of the island of San Lorenzo) provides comic relief one moment and enrages you the next.The overall feeling that I got from this book is that it is a futile business to try to understand the meaning of life, why people behave the way they do, and why \\"evil\\" in the world continues to prevail."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is one of Kurt Vonnegut's less subtle satires, as he lays his views out there in a very obvious manner for all to see. One of the dominate themes of this text is that when science is weaponized it is always wrong, period. He also goes after his usual suspects: religion, God, and man's inhumanity to man.Stylistically \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is told in a much more linear format than most Vonnegut texts. In fact, it is told completely in chronological order which is a very unusual device for Vonnegut novels. It is also very funny, but in a very dry, dark humor sort of way. Many parts of the book also feel like a precursor to his \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\", which was published six years after this novel. There are some shared characters, and a shared setting, the city of Ilium, NY.\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is at its most biting when Vonnegut depicts the arrogance and selfishness of humanity. The callousness with which the characters (practically all of them) treat the world ending due to man's carelessness is truly frightening. How aloof man can be about his destructive powers. The massive irony of this text is that the world ends by accident! We don't set out to destroy it, we are just careless with our ability to do so, and when one is arrogant and careless...well you know what that can yield. There are no real villains in this piece, just sloppy and short sighted people. Vonnegut seems to be reserving his harshest judgment for the character of Frank Hoenikker. Frank resents that people were not nice to him when he was younger. Yet his treatment as a teenager does not engender sympathy in him, but rather bitterness, and does not lead him to be kind to others. To be that blind and unobservant about your own life is something that Vonnegut seems quite disgusted with in this text.Religion also gets its share of jabs in this book, but unlike many readers I don't see Vonnegut as knocking religious faith, as much as I see him saying that he understands why people need it, he just does not put much stock in it. Like most of Vonnegut's oeuvre, God plays a huge thematic role, and on page 225 of this text Vonnegut gives an interesting and keen observation of the role that God holds for many people. The question is also asked in the text, what is God up too? The answer given is apparently nothing, although Vonnegut does not go so far as to state this. He leaves the role of faith wide open for his readers.Vonnegut also plays with a theme that dominates many of his books, which is the idea of predestination. His invention of the religion of Bokononism is a lovely idea for a religion, although it does not hold up to intense scrutiny, unless you make a lot of allowances for it. And that is the point. Isn't all religion like that to a certain extent?The ending of this novel is nihilistic and hopeful all at once. I am not sure what I think of it, I am almost positive I don't agree philosophically with it, and I am absolutely sure it is the perfect ending for \\"Cat's Cradle\\". At its heart this is a book about how much stuff (most stuff) we don't really understand. A character occasionally asks \\"See the cat? See the cradle?\\" when there is nothing to see. There is nothing there, and thus the text's satirical question/ comment on religion and science, which both are in the explanation business. Page 183 in the book aptly brings this home for the reader. Making sense of the world is what science attempts, and in the arena where it matters most it has failed. What next? \\"Cat's Cradle\\" dares to ask this question."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I enjoyed this subversive, satirical, nihilistic, and absurd novel. It is definitely a bit odd and won't be for everyone. Historically speaking, mankind has done some catastrophically stupid things.

He also stumbles on a secret substance discovered by the scientist he is studying, which can certainly alter the world. The story provides the platform for social commentaries by the various characters about religion, the futility of mankind, and war. There are plenty of colorful moments and humor, and the overall effect for me was one of strangeness. It provided some entertainment, but I could hardly take it very seriously. I read one other Vonnegut book, Mother Night, which was deep and riveting. This one could scarcely have been more different. Both books are easily identifiable as Vonnegut's.

He is extremely misleading in his simplistic, choppy, writing style that gives the opportunity for anybody and anybody who has a small amount of reading skill to pick this volume up and consume it. Though its simplicity is comforting the words spelled out in the metaphorical between-space of each line tells an entirely different tale.Vonnegut picks apart aspects of family and love, religion and war, science and government so well that this book is absolutely worthy of reading several times over. The most important aspect that he delves into is the concept of science. Is anyone else out there frightened of science and its ability to make new and 'better' technologies at such a phenomenal rate that eventually, inevitably, somebody is going to mess it up? Ice-nine, the scientific creation that seems like it would be a work of genius is, in fact, a work of stupidity that eventually leads to destruction and chaos. Science dooms as well as heals. Seemingly, Vonnegut ties this aspect into all his other lessons. Family, love, religion, war, science and government all heals as well as dooms those associated with it.

I hardly put this book down, which is a rarity for me.This was my first Vonnegut read, but it most certainly will NOT be my last! A great place to start if you aren't familiar with his work. Thought-provoking, gently pokes fun at most every topic, and is guaranteed to make you question. Read it, read it, read it!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I don't want to spend too much time writing a review of what is, in essence, a classic novel. This is my first reading of Cat's Cradle, and my first time reading anything of substantial length by Kurt Vonnegut. The simple reason I don't want to spend too much time reviewing this book is that it has already been reviewed countless times, especially by people far more familiar with it than I am.SPOILER ALERT! This is a short book, and it's almost impossible to avoid spoiling even the ending while trying to discuss significant aspects of the work. Also, this book has been around a while, meaning it's highly unlikely you won't have heard at least a capsule summary of the plot. That said, the following two paragraphs reveal details near the end of the book.There were only two things I found disappointing in the story: First, there was no speculation nor explanation given as to why there would suddenly be purple-mouthed tornadoes all over the place. Perhaps that was just the author's speculation about the knock-on effects of all the Earth's water suddenly converting to ice-nine.Second, there was mention of a strange nimbus (\\"lavender corona\\") surrounding the \\"weird plug\\" of rock sitting on the back of Mt. McCabe, and it wasn't clear if this was some strange phenomenon or not; the narrator spoke of his desire to visit this formation, to climb it, but he never reports doing so. It's an unexplored detail, and in such a slender volume, such things make me wish for more.The writing was excellent: literate, trenchant and witty. This is my first foray into Vonnegut, so I have no other points of reference to go by.The Rosetta Books edition of this Kindle e-book seems to fall somewhere between the ultra-cheap e-books (free or $0.99) and the premium e-books (with list prices close to those of the print editions) sold by Amazon -- both in terms of price and in terms of general quality. This edition was mostly decent, but had some typesetting issues with punctuation (wrong type of quote or apostrophe used -- open quote instead of close quote, for instance). Further, there were several cases where it was obvious that the text was obtained using OCR of a print edition, and this manifested frequently as the wrong letter in a word, or a letter like \\"m\\" being replaced by \\"rn.\\"I was never unable to determine what was truly meant in any passage, but the handful of flaws in this e-book could be easily corrected."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I expected Cat's Cradle to be a hilarious satire, but what I got was a book that is mildly funny, but extremely deep with a true message about technology and science and what could become of it. One could call Cat's Cradle a number of things. Satire, philosophical literature, science fiction, even subtle horror. I call it a masterpiece. I finished it in a short period of time, but I still think about it, and what might happen in the future.Slaughterhouse-Five, while great, is nothing compared to Cat's Cradle. Kurt Vonnegut was and is a brilliant man, and he will be missed, never to produce another masterpiece again.If you have not read anything by this amazing author, Cat's Cradle is the perfect place to start. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE TERRIBLY DEPRESSED, as it will make you more depressed. This is one of the most depressing books that I have ever read. Nonetheless, it deserves five stars."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's CradleKurt VonnegutISBN#: 038533348X304 pagesPublisher: Dial Press Trade PaperbackCat's Cradle offers a pessimistic outlook on human society, religion, and politics, but does it in such an ironic, lighthearted yet dark way that the reader won't be able to put it down. The protagonist John, who is only referenced by name once in the story, attempts to learn from the children of the fictional scientist Doctor Felix Hoenikker about the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. It is revealed that the late Dr. Hoenikker, who was one of the top minds behind the bomb, created another weapon before his death. This substance, known as Ice-9, is a form of ice that freezes at room temperature. If it comes in contact with water it will force its molecular pattern on it, and freeze it into the diamond-like Ice-9 as well. The only known samples of it were given to Dr. Hoenikker's three children, Newt, Angela and Frank. Through a seemingly random series of events they eventually encounter each other on the poverty stricken island of San Lorenzo; ruled by a merciless dictator where everyone belongs to an illegal religion known as Bokononism.These beliefs are central to the novel. A man named Bokonon sought to create an escape for the miserable people of San Lorenzo, and so he constructed a religion of \\"foma\\" or lies, which he himself calls lies at every turn. Ironically it seems to make perfect sense. These lessons, which are often in the form of short poetry or Confucius-like statements, are interspersed among the chapters of the novel by John, the narrator, who has realized he too is a Bokononist.Cat's Cradle's deceptively simple writing style masks the deeper messages it offers including lessons on love, pain and human nature. These seemingly innocuous sentences blend together to create both a compelling story, and a valid view of both events in the past and those likely in the future of humanity. In short, this novel is an enjoyable read brilliantly choreographed by one of the greatest American authors of our time."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Dr. Asa Breed, scientist from the research laboratory of the General Forge and Foundation Company, had this statement to say about Dr. Felix Hoenicker, one of the founding fathers of the atomic bomb as well as the creator of \\"Ice Nine:\\"\\"I told you all this in order to give you some insight into the extraordinary novelty of the ways which Felix was likely to approach an old problem.\\"The statement could easily become non-fiction if the word \\"Felix\\" was replaced with \\"Kurt Vonnegut.\\" Vonnegut is a master of spinning a crazy web of seemingly random events that poignantly, clearly spell out a very clear and crystallized point.Vonnegut is a crafty-sneaky writer. Two skills, which many writers have individually, but few have in tandem, set him apart from other writers. First, he has the ability to present his story as an unrelated series of random events. The \\"hero\\" seems to be victim of merciless random forces that confront him with strange events and experiences. However, the story remains tight and coherent and Vonnegut's points are amazingly clear.Second, in the true science fiction tradition, Vonnegut makes bizarre, incredible and completely fictitious creations seems completely plausible. Taken together, he seems to repetitively beat the reader over the head with rather salient life observations hidden behind bizarrely incredulous premises. With the exception of \\"Slaughter-House Five,\\" Cat's Cradle may be Vonnegut's best demonstration of these two most characteristic skills.He starts the story with the narrator giving a brief explanation as to why is called Jonah (which he is never referred to as for the remainder of the story):\\"...somebody or something has compelled me to be certain places at certain times, without fail. Conveyances and motives, both conventional and bizarre, have been provided. And according to plan, at each appointed second, at each appointed place this Jonah was there.\\"Similar to other Vonnegut Heroes (Billy Pilgrim, Rabo Karabekian are two), Jonah passively and seemingly haphazardly drifts among nonsensical events. For Jonah, the terminal destination is President of the island republic of San Lorenzo. During his journey, he meets a motley cast of characters seemingly unrelated. For sneaky Vonnegut, they are related, many of even them belong to his own karass.Secondly, Vonnegut is the master science fiction writer. Two science fictional concepts that Vonnegut creates in Cat's Cradle are the scientific invention of \\"Ice Nine\\" and the religion of \\"Bokononism.\\" Both Bokononism and Ice Nine are the centerpieces of the novel, so they had to suspend the reader's disbelief, or the story would die. With Ice Nine, Vonnegut needed to create a scientific discovery that was capable of destroying the earth. He did it, and explained in a simple and believable manner. Very clever. The religion of Bokononism includes its own philosophy, last rites and vocabulary (karass, granfalloons, pool-pah, foma, wampeter, etc). Similarly, he defines religion as \\"better and better lies\\" intended as an \\"instrument of hope.\\" On San Lorenzo, everyone is a Bokononist, and Jonah becomes one over the course of the story. Most of the Bokonon philosophy is presented as short statements, often only in short, Confucius-like statements and often provided to a calypso beat. My favorite Bokonon saying is: \\"Maturity is the bitter disappointment for which no remedy exists, unless laughter can be said to remedy something.\\"The story provides some insight into the extraordinary novelty of the ways which Vonnegut is likely to approach an old problem. Cat's Cradle asks the tough question of what is morality in an existential world. The ultimate answer, unfortunately, is self-destruction."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"What Kurt Vonnegut can do with the written word amazes me. Cat's Cradle is both a rambling diatribe of apt social observations and a finely crafted novel at the same time.Centering around a dead man, Felix Hoenikker, the scientist credited as being the father of the atomic bomb, the story reflects on the lack of social responsibility of a society so invested in killing and war that consequences aren't measured. This man, Hoenikker, didn't just create the most powerful WMD ever used, Vonnegut also suggests that he created a substance that could teach water molecules to bond in a new way - a way in which life on earth couldn't process. ICE-9 is this substance and the narrator stumbles through the story knowing of the substance but not knowing its true significance as he tries to unravel the events of the day of the bombing of Hiroshima,Another social statement of the book is in regard to religion. Inventing Bokononism, a belief system of total falsehoods with punishments for disobedience merely to make the religion seem more important, the protagonist brings order where there was never order needed before. It cuts to the heart of organized religion and satirically shows that manipulation of belief and twisting of the social construct are necessary to build a classed society. Brilliant.Throughout the story, a wide cast of disparate characters rush past, unconnected - - but for Vonnegut this is merely a ruse - - they are all tied together by the end in an intricate web of cause and effect, of influence and reason.I don't know if this was my favorite Vonnegut novel, because the one I'm reading always seems like the best one at that moment.- CV Rick"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I've just finished Cat's Cradle and I have walked away with a sense of low self-esteem. I, however, will not allow this feeling to pain me that much. Intuitively, I know this is a natural reaction many have had after reading Vonnegut for the first time. You see, after you have had your first experience with the man you gain an important insight. The insight is simply this: Vonnegut is more intelligent than you are and he revels in it; this, I am convinced, is what makes his writing outstanding. The reasons for this correlation are easy to find for they lie, laughing up at you, strewn across the pages of this book. On the surface, Cat's Cradle is a chronicle of the last days of humankind. Its nameless protagonist, a writer, relates the tale of how he set the events that eventually led to our demise in motion. His recounting makes our departure from this planet seem like an event in the best interests of everyone involved with the planet Earth. For support, Cat's Cradle happens to rail against every absurdity present in modern day, western civilization. All the things that make us suck as a collective are satirized brilliantly here folks: blindly ignorant nationalism, blindly conformist religion, and of course, politics. In Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut has authored a book that has its finger on the pulse of the western human condition and I relate to and like it immensely. For the first time, exemplified in this little novel, I can see all of the attributes that have made Vonnegut a champion to high school and college students for over forty years. I am no longer a college student but I am more of a cynic now than ever before. For those of us who can not turn a deaf ear to the discord around us, Vonnegut's writing will always be there, saying \\"It's okay. I understand\\"."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Wow.P.S. In &quot;Cat's Cradle,&quot; Kurt Vonnegut tells us everything we ever wanted to know, but were afraid to ask, about foma, ice-nine, and Bokononism. In the telling, he leaves us mesmerized with his sadly warm, warmly sad vision of mankind, and of mankind's pathetic proclivity for trying so hard to believe in known lies, and in unknown truths.The story is told by Jonah, who is researching the life and times of a great physicist, Dr. Hoenikker. Hoenikker is one of the more prominent fathers of the atomic bomb, yet he has an image of being a childlike, saintly figure who lived his life enraptured by the cerebral, celestial music of the spheres. He may or may not have been a saint, (this is never fully resolved,) but he definitely was directly responsible, in this book, for at least two devices which are foolproof, sure-fire, results-guaranteed means of totally annihilating all life on this planet. Doesn't sound much like a saint, you say?!?!? Well, all I can say is, you need to read this book.As the story unfolds, we meet Hoenikker's scared, lonely, grown children, whose fates are locked together by the terrible secret of ice-nine. Jonah travels with them to the little-known, Caribbean island republic of San Lorenzo for his research. Once there, he discovers the bizarrely sensible religion of Bokononism, and his life is changed forever.&quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is crammed with a curiously concatenated cornucopia of consistently compelling creative conundrums. A word of warning: you may want to wear some kind of metal helmet while reading this book. Otherwise, you will risk scratching a hole in your skull from scratching your head all the time, trying to understand all the brilliant ideas in this book. There are just tons of insights into how we interpret reality, how we interpret fiction, and how we sometimes do the second of those activities, when we should be doing the first... One character is a professional book indexer. She goes through manuscripts of books for a living, and creates indexes for them. Sounds like kind of an odd profession, eh? Well then, how do YOU break down dreams, or reality, to make them easier to cope with? What's YOUR strategy for this basic human need? Or, for another example -- another character is one of Dr. Hoenikker's grown sons. He was called &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot; as a child, because he happened to have a few fairly furtive mannerisms. As an adult, he basically lives a James Bond life, making or breaking kings, and consorting with beautiful women on a lush, island paradise. Did his dreamlike adult reality grow out of the real nightmare he lived out as a mocked child? Where did one start, and the other stop? This is the kind of question that Kurt Vonnegut raises in this book. Every sentence has meaning. Just amazing. An infinite number of thumbs up."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I am a disc jockey and this past week I read a news story on air about the US government dropping powder onto thunderheads which dried up the clouds and greatly lessened the strength of the storm; now our government is planning on testing the powder on hurricanes. This actual event drove me to search out my copy of Vonnegut's &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; and re-read this hilarious, thought-provoking, doomsday tale. It's filled with eclectic characters: a dwarf with an ugly sister, a mad scientist, spiritualist, bicycle manufacturer, South American dictator, losers and misfits. It's peppered with cliches that only Vonnegut can get away with. It introduces a fantastic religion that makes perfect sense. He even creates a new language. But at the core is the chilling fact that the U.S. Marines have induced the scientist to invent Ice Nine, even though he knows the inevitable outcome of this substance. It's a merry ride that Vonnegut takes us on. One of his best books, and that is high praise indeed. A very fast read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I first read Cat's Cradle on trip through Illinois heading for Chicago. I started laughing out loud almost immediately and the others in the car had to hear the 'funny part'. Soon I was reading the whole book out loud and all of us were laughing our heads off constantly. This remains for me the best example of Vonnegut's use of black humor to make a serious point. The characters and plot line are as original as anything he ever wrote and the humor is still as fresh as ever. This is wonderful, hard edged writing, a kind of modern day Jonathan Swift tale that mingles science, religion, philosophy, political upheaval and human nature at its most extreme. The book keeps us laughing and leaves us thinking."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle was an intriguing and thought-provoking book, but it was rather dark. Throughout this book, author Kurt Vonnegut shows his morbid view of the world, including a dystopia and a ninth ring of hell. The story is about how the narrator, an author who is writing a book about the atomic bomb, meets the children of one of the scientists who helped build the atomic bomb. Little does the author know that the scientist had created something much more dangerous than the atomic bomb. His fate becomes entwined with the children, a midget, an introspective genius model builder, and a clarinet prodigy, and he witnesses the end of the world as the powerful weapon, ice nine, freezes all the water in the world.Vonnegut comes up with brilliant ideas as well as sneaking in his own advice on living through the holy man Bokonon, whose self titled religion has poems, songs, and scriptures throughout the book. The author vividly shows his prediction of the future in this book, and through his eyes, there is no hope for mankind. As a warning, this book might disturb more sensitive readers and is most definitely not a children's book. Also, Vonnegut has the bad habit of going off on a tangent that is not always necessary. Vonnegut uses the narrator/author named John as a representative for himself, such as both of them went to Cornell College and were members of the Delta Upsilon fraternity.Kurt Vonnegut was a soldier and prisoner of war in World War 2, and was one of the survivors of the Dresden bombing, which was the theme for his other book, Slaughterhouse-Five. His mother also committed suicide on mother's day when he was 22, which might have helped give his writing the macabre twang it has."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The 60's paranoia doesn't get more sharp, more funny and more smart than Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Cat's Cradle\\". But, unfortunately, this portray is still somehow up to date than ever. Published early in that decade, this novel concerns on the fear of a chemical war and the end of the world. One of the characters is a scientist who fathered the Atomic Bomb and also developed something called \`ice-nice' that is able to freeze all the water in the world. When the novel was published the world was living the edge of Cold War - hence the interesting metaphor. This is also a cautionary (and very funny) tale about too much power and too much desire of ending the workd. Vonnegut's tone transits between the regular science- fiction and black humor that add more layers to the book. If for one side the characters are plain, on the other, what remains, the fear of a nuclear war or something like it, is very relevant and contemporary."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"An easy read that led to Vonnegut's Anthropology B.A. The story evokes questions regarding mankind's ignorance when faced with scientific achievement."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I am of the opinion (so far) that Cat's Cradle is one of Kurt Vonnegut's best books, if not the best book he has ever written. It was the first book I ever read by him and certainly was not the last.Cat's Cradle spans a tail narrated by a Scientist in search of what is at first only a biography of the man who created the atom bomb. This simple endeavor quickly escalates into a world ending climax. As the story grows closer and closer toward it's end, it becomes more clear of what exactly will happen...although this is never totally revealed.The book provides a lesson about humanity's inevitable fate of self-destruction and self-doubt. There also lies a message about religion's role in all of this."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut knows how to draw your attention, and it's often only after you've finished the book that you realize the level of seriousness that he was trying to portray.Having read Slaughterhouse-Five, Breakfast Of Champions, and A Man Without a Country, I was excited when heard about this one from my friend Eric.It's about a guy writing about the day the bombs were dropped on Heroshima and Nagasaki. He's also telling his story of how he converted to Bokononism.In real life, Vonnegut is a notable humanist, and the cyncism of man-made religion is evident in these pages. Bokonon is a religious leader who follows a few basic steps to creating a good religion. He lives life as an outlaw voluntarily, and he admits from the beginning of the Books Of Bokonon that his religion is all lies.The plots seems to shallow out a bit in the middle (only slightly) but by the end you are flying through pages to find the ultimate fate of the wonderful and crazy characters.Dark humor on par with Catch 22, it is difficult to decipher what is meant as farce and what is absurd, but overall a highly entertaining read, and a very good take on organized religion."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I don't know whether to categorize the book as political, adventurous, anti-religious, satirical or philosophical (perhaps all). This being my first Vonnegut novel, I can say with personal conviction, that I am a staunch Bokononist. The journey of Cat's Cradle is one of absurdities, cliches, wisdom, luck and chance. What I find intriguing is how Vonnegut manages to balance the seriousness of the atomic bombing of Japan, and the foolish life of a scientist, who helped create it. I do like the characters and feel they all have their moment of catharsis. Somehow they all feel relevant to the story, yet John(the main character) never seems dull."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is one of the best sci-fi novels I've ever read. Vonnegut continues his outlandish writing style of satire and suspense with this short (but very well written) novel."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book is a must read. It is a very short book, with almost as many chapters as pages. It reads like book crack and you won't be able to stop till your finished. If you haven't read other books by KV then this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If you have never read a Vonnegut book before, this is the one you want to start out with. It's a great book for any occasion, but it's perfect if you want to get acquainted with the author and his dark humor. It's a very easy read, fast paced, and a cleverly written story. Some of his other books that I've really enjoyed were Slaughterhouse- Five, Sirens Of Titan, Mother Night, God Bless You Mr. Rosewater, the short stories in Welcome To The Monkeyhouse, and Breakfast Of Champions (don't read Breakfast of Champions until you've read some of the books previously mentioned, or else you probably won't understand where a lot of the material comes from)."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"For those who haven't read Vonnegut, you must read this book! This short, simply written novel manages to reveal the latent absurdities in our most cherished institutions: politics, religion, and science.The novel centers around ice-nine, developed by the idiot savant Dr. Hoenikker (sp?). Hoenikker invents it as something of a game, but its first use will cause the oceans to freeze and the devastation of the world. We see clear parallels to the nuclear bomb and the rationalizations of its creators: according to them, they are advancing &quot;pure knowledge,&quot; and the consequences are not their concern, even if it results in worldwide devastation.The novel also targets religion in the form of Bokononism, a religion whose own creator admits that it is &quot;foma&quot; (lies). Even so, the Books of Bokonon cited throughout the book are absurdly sweet and insightful. The Bokononist practice of &quot;boko-maru,&quot; or merging of soles, also seems to be one of the rare ways to achieve genuine pleasure with one's fellow man. We see how religion, even where it may be technically false, may give great peace to its believers. When I first read this book in high school, I was tempted to become a devout Bokononist myself!Vonnegut always emphasizes the importance of family and genuine interhuman relationships, rather than the abstract absurdities of &quot;granfaloons&quot;: nations, parties, sports teams, etc. This short, spare novel tears apart such granfaloons, and through it, we may see a glimmer of what is genuinely important in our lives."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's CradleBy: Kurt VonnegutReviewed By: J. GagnierPeriod 1Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle is a very good book. It is about a man who is trying to write a book about the day the atom bomb fell, and the people that constructed it. He soon found out that the chief designer of the atom bomb was a strange man named Felix Hoenikker. He mails Two of Dr. Hoenikker's children, Angela and Newt Hoenikker. Later on he finds out about a chemical called ice-nine, then the trouble starts.I really liked the way the writer worded the book. He wrote about how the world came to an end and the events preceding it. I enjoyed the way that he presented his personal opinion on how man makes things to complicated. He wrote about an imaginary religion called Bokonon that is nothing but \\"sweet lies\\" according to the founder of Bokonon himself.My favorite part of the book was when Angela was talking about ice-nine. I like the idea of ice that has a melting point of 114.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Unfortunately if such a substance were made the end of the world would be it's effect on humans and nature alike."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Heller's Closing time places a character in1944 Dresden alongside Vonnegut as a young POW.Considering the (self reported) impact the bombing of Dresden had on Vonnegut's life and work, this could be construed as a crack in the wall hiding the greatest literary conspiracy since they misplaced the last page of The Fifteen Comendments. Admitedly, these could be ravings explained by the vertigo I'm suffering having over-dosed on morbid satire. I reread Cat's Cradle for the nth time this week. This is my current comment: Much like being punched in the gut by a heavyweight, you're left breathless and staggering even if you'd seen it coming."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I am glad this wasn't the first Vonnegut book I read. Had it been I probably wouldn't be enthusiastic about reading another. Fortunately, my first was Slaughterhouse-Five.There are plenty of reviewers here who gave great, detailed synopses of the book, so I will skip that.What I found good about the book was it's commentary on religion and, more specifically, the relationship between religion and political power (Papa and Bokononists/Bokonon). I also enjoyed the reactions John had to some of the absurd things people would say, especially on the plane. And the elevator scene was a riot, funny and thought provoking. Vonnegut is a master at providing us with funny and ridiculous characters, and there are some in this book (although not enough to make it a great book, but still enough to make it worth a read).But...the book got slow in many places, and after a while it seemed almost like a chore to read. I enjoyed the message, but not the way it was told. If this is your first Vonnegut book please don't use it against him if you find it boring, many of his other books (like Slaughterhouse-Five) are awesome."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Writer researches family of father of the atom bomb, Hoenikker, who split his new invention, ice 9, among his three children.

I read this book while taking AP US History and could make many connections which helped make the book interesting. There were some parts in the book that seemed to drag on while others were quick reads. At many point I told myself that I was going to stop reading but then an interesting part came and I could not put it down. The book does jump around a lot which at times make things difficult to follow. Although it does not jump around as much as Slaughterhouse Five there is a strange fluidity that is created that puts a damper on the usual Vonnegut books. It is almost to fluid to make the book interesting."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"It is an interesting book with a masterful writing style. My appreciation of this book was largely literary. But it is not personally touching or inspiring or meaningful. For that read Paulo Coelho. The story is not exactly as \\"thought-provoking\\" as people have been claiming. For that read philosophy.Some parts are very funny, many parts are interesting, and it is a very easy read. The plot is purposely ridiculous, and tangibly depressing. It is worthwhile, if you know what to expect (satire, dry humor, captivating writing, but not anything deep, moving, inspiring, wise, etc.)"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Having never read any Vonnegut before (but hearing good things about him from my sister), I was unsure what to expect.

The narrative is quick-paced, never stopping to allow you to catch your breath from alternately laughing and crying at the folly of humanity.Of course, it's as all of the reviewer's here note; the novel is short, though takes a wide scope. It contemplates such difficult subjects as the nature of science and science's refusal to consider religion or the moral implications of its work. The novel is also extremely interesting for its commentary on religion, particularly considering that Vonnegut was an atheist. Each minute chapter is thought-provoking in its way, and underneath its primary themes, there is an exorbitant range of objects to satirize. And yes, the much of the stupidity is captured in the pages of this little read.Cat's Cradle is one of the greatest novels of this century. Everything which Vonnegut comments on is just too much to go into here; this review would end up being longer than Cat's Cradle itself. It certainly makes a great read, and the things Vonnegut writes will keep you thinking whether you agree with him or not (I particularly recommend this for college science majors)."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut discusses the importance of science and religion in his science fiction novel \\"Cat's Cradle\\". On the first the protagonist seems to be an average person: He does not have a focus in his life, is unstable and feels unloved. That is very interesting about the book because this ordinary person from the beginning becomes someone special in the end.The protagonist, Jonah, is a journalist who wants to write a novel about the \\"father of the atomic bomb\\" whose family he meets doing research. Jonah finds out about Ice-nine, a substance that converts water into ice even at high temperatures, it is unclear if this substance is existent or not. This stays mysterious until the ending of the book, which is an apocalypse, all life on earth dies of Ice-nine. The author has a very descriptive style. The story takes place in unpleasant settings. The characters in \\"Cat's Cradle\\" are weird, persons who are very rare in real life because they are so extreme. The plot itself is unrealistic. Vonnegut has a black and white view of life: something is good and bad. There is nothing that is just good or bad. The result of the book is that also science is bad sometimes because it can be destructive and even religion is not only good because it is based on lies.The book is entertaining and it has an unique humor which is not to be understood for everybody. Who does not like black humor would probably not think the book is funny. But the novel is still a good book to read because it makes people, who are interested in its theme, think about it and get interesting points of view. For people who just want a book for pure entertainment it is not the right book to read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Pardon the hyperbole. This is the best book ever written. Kurt Vonnegut traces the story of Lionel Boyd Johnson (recognize the initials), the story of a man washed ashore on a Caribbean island to find his match in the island's self appointed not-so-evil major domo. What's lacking on this island? According to the dictator's limited exposure to philosophy (Charles Atlas' theory of Dynamic Tension -- retrieved from the back of a childhood comic book), what's missing is a kind and gentle counterpart, a false religious leader who can divert the attention of island residents from the poverty surrounding them. He empowers Mr. Johnson, renamed Bokonon, who enchants island residents with his restated version of the creation, written in \\"calypsos\\", a lyrical guide to just how God manages to gets things done. If you've somehow managed to get this far through life without reading this book, buy it now. You'll become a devout Bokononist, finding yourself singing a calypso alone at night \\"Nice, nice, very nice, see how we all fit into the same device\\"."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I picked this book up on a whim because it was on sale...great choice! The black comedy is hilarious. I actually found myself laughing out loud while reading the book on my way to work. A very quick read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"At the tender age of 19, thanks to Kurt Vonnegut and Cat's Cradle, I learned that a book did not have to be 800 pages long and have a happy ending to be a great book. More importantly, I realized that I didn't have to understand a book to enjoy it.I recently reread Cat's Cradle for the fourth time, and 20 years later, I'm no closer to understanding it. Yet, I still caught myself laughing out loud and profoundly sad upon reading the final paragraph.Cat's Cradle is not the best book I've ever read, but reading it opened my mind and allowed me to pick up and read some of the best books I've ever read"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If the worst thing you can say about a book is that you wish it was longer, then, hey, that's not too bad, right?I mean, I can recognize wonderful writing more than I can produce it so I won't write much here.

You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If you do not feel like reading what I think about the book, and just want a recommendation \`yes, go for it / no, you would be wasting your time', go to the end of my review. If, on the other side, you want to know what I do think about \`Cat's cradle', keep reading.Politics, religion and God, love and friendship, life and death. All is nonsense for Vonnegut. All is scorned, ridiculed. Or maybe he just tries to throw to the trashcan the absolute character we, human beings, tend to give to all those supposed absolutes. It could sound hard, but probably he is right in some way. Think about love, think how sometimes we just idolize the object of our longings: oh, I would do whatever you want me to do (and whatever means whatever--that crazy we can be). Then, for some reason, you realize the worshipped idol is not such, but just a human being, like me or you. All those great thoughts, ideals, aspirations (\`I'll take the moon for you') just blow out. The result: a huge disappointment, a crisis. Any solutions? Yes, realize that love, or friendship, politics, morals, and everything else, are relative. And I am not saying that their value change with circumstances, but that any single of these elements should not be the sole foundation of our life and way of acting. Maybe I should think more about this, but it makes sense to me. My personal experiences tell me so.Anyway, the book is good, funny most of the times, and it makes you think. Worth the time and the money."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Put this review down at once, it is nothing but foma! You there, sitting in your granfallons, thinking you know your karass, but really living out a wrang-wrang. Shame on you! If you want to know your zah-mah-ki-bo, read this book.

If you do, we will all be killed, and not even the pleasures of boko-maru will help ease our sufferings!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"There are two things I've discovered about Kurt Vonnegut.1) His books are ultimately depressing and cynical2) His story lines are incredibly interestingThis is the height of both. It's a short, easy read. It's totally absorbing and entertaining. I think I discovered that I'm a Bokononist. Too bad."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I had heard so much about Vonnegut since my freshman year in High school. I know now that I will become a hard core fan of all his books. I'm an avid reader of all science fiction novels and this one is definitely one of my favorites. This book is by far a thrill ride of an apocolyptic adventure. There are also alot of great charcter introduced in the book and alot of funny scenes. This was my first experience with Vonnegut and I enjoyed every moment of it. When I first saw the cover of the book I thought that it would be interesting and it was. It was not so hard and it was not very easy either. I love the way he satires religon and science. Blending his patented wry humor with acute social insight presented in an absurd fantasy world, Vonnegut has written an exceptional novel of love lies and the self destruction of mankind. The story centers around the narrator, Jonah, who is called by name only once in the entire book. We are told in the begining of the book that he is writing a book on the events of the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan.His research leads him to a correspondence with Newt Hoenikker, the midget son of doctor Felix Hoenikker, father of the atomic bomb. After meeting with Newt, destiny leads our protagonist to the impoverished island republic of San Lorenzo, where among other adventures he finds religon, falls in love and becomes a president. All of this by itself would make for a very entertaining book, but it is not in the story line that Vonnegut's genius lies. Cat's Cradle is rife with painfully accurate insights into the institutions that our society holds so dear, such as, religion, politics, and science. Vonnegut invents for the inhabitants of San Lorenzo a brand new religion based completely and admittedly on &quot;foma&quot;, or lies. This wouldn&quot;t be so shocking, except for the fact that this &quot;bokonism&quot; seems to make perfect sense. Other Vonnegut ironies pervade the book and are too elaborate to go into. Cat's Cradle is one of the most absurd,and frightening novels. This book truly causes one to stop and think about the things that one holds as unquestionably true. All of these incredible people, places, things and ideas in Cat's cradle are intricately woven into a perfect tapestry that sums up and spells out many of mankind's self-created problems in 191 pages. I haven't read any of Kurt Vonnegut's other books but I know that I most certainly will. After checking this book out from the library I went and bought my own copy. I strongly recommed this book to anyone over the age of four-teen. There is no reason not to buy this masterpiece of modern literature. SO IF YOU READ IT WAS AND DIDM'T LIKE IT THAN READ IT AGAIN. IF YOU READ IT ONCE AND ENJOYED BUY IT AND READ IT AGAIN."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The writing is very good and elegant and it worths reading the book only because of that, but the story is something else. The first half of the book is brilliant. That's the part which takes place in US, while the narrator is interviewing people related to Felix Hoenikker, the father of the atomic bomb. The book is full of interesting phrases and has a sharp insite into social life and relationships. But when the plot moves to the ficional island of San Lorenzo, the interesting stuff became rarer and rarer and what was intelligent and funny became dull and boring. Sometimes I had the feeling I started reading a certain book and finished reading a completely different one."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Maybe I did not read the fine print, but I was disappointed in the quality of this book. It looks like a very high quality fake. My primary gripe is with the cover. I have owned this book in softcover and the hardcover looks like someone scanned the softcover and printed it in their back room. The text looks fine and if you are just looking to read the book, nothing more, I am sure it is fine. If that was what I wanted though I would have paid 5 bucks for a softcover. I was looking for something a bit more collectible. Something that would look nice on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I've read a couple of Vonnegut books before and I really enjoyed them. To say Vonnegut is quirky might either be a compliment or not taking it far enough. First off, this is a quick read. Also, it's a fun read. The characters are unique and even the main character is likable and that's sometimes hard to portray in 1st person writing styles. When I looked online to see the synopsis of what the book was about, every description tells you more about Vonnegut and what he's alluding to rather than what the book is actually about. That's because this book is kind of hard to describe. There is a main story here for sure. However, the hardest part of reading this book is actually to understand what to get out of it. I think there's some commentary on religion and the Cold War (literally in this book). But, with reading Vonnegut's other books that I have, I knew what he wanted me to take away from it. Here, that's a little harder. I'm sure that undercuts me as a reader rather than Vonnegut as an author. Still, I had fun reading it and it would be interesting to see what other people took away from it. Final Grade - C+"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"It's Pure amazement i am what most people call an athiest i don't really have a religion but this book doesnt try to suck you inot the religion it just expresses it Vonnegut is a great writer I have read Sirens of Titan,Slaughterhous-Five, and Timequake and this is the best so far as soon as i heard about this end of the earth idea my eyes started to water and think of how much of a genious he is to think of such and extra-ordinarily cruel way for the world to die which is also kinda commical. Great book won;t want to take your attention away from."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book was full of unexpented twists, and was extremely well written. I've always been a fan of Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Obvious satire on all the ridiculous happy endings sewn onto stories but why else throw in the towel on mankind? One wonders if the story might be a justification for suicide. One supposes that Vonnegut, like his character, little Newt, was disappointed that in making a Cat's Cradle that there really is no cat and no cradle-that there is really nothing supporting the religious tripe that seem to keep people rolling down the track. He certainly put the \\"dys\\" in utopia here. I doubt if a more poignant tale of futility and hopelessness could be penned.Although his memorable characters are nicely drawn-they are all too easily erased by the final page. Why struggle through so many pages of words only to reach the same blank page one started with? Looking for virtue in the tale one can say that it was short and abrupt. The suffering doesn't last that long. Everyone would prefer an instant and painless end to their life."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Don't waste your time on this book. After reading in Palm Sunday that Vonnegut considered Cat's Cradle his finest work, I turned to it with anticipation. I had enjoyed Vonnegut's style in Palm Sunday, his irony, and was expecting something equally stimulating. What a disappointment. The \\"plot\\" is pointless, and leads nowhere other than to an abrupt and sudden ending. His coining of new words and concepts along the way attempts to mask the absence of any serious message. I lived through World War II and the Cold War and kept looking for something I could relate to either of those 20th-century challenges to Western civilization, but I found nothing here--only flights of Vonnegut's fancy that I couldn't relate to any real world I know. His characters are shallow and undeveloped and his dialogue much the same. If you like pure fantasy that isn't related in any way to the challenges of our lives in the real world then maybe you'll find something here. For me, the lesson I take away from this is to approach any other Vonnegut novel with extreme caution and scepticism. Time is too valuable to use on shallow ramblings like this one."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle started off well enough and flowed easily, then it took a turn for the silly and outlandish. I must admit that K.V.Jr is a very intelligent man, and behind his somewhat unremarkable dialogue there is a very large message here. This book has the typical anti-establishment theme Vonnegut is known for. I'm sad to say I wasn't a good audience for his words. The concept of the \\"ice-nine theory was great, but I didn't care for the story three forths of the way through. It ended silly and not what I expected. I didn't cheer for any of the characters, in fact I had no respect for any of them. I will not say it is a bad novel, but it is a bad novel for me at this point in my life. It is a hard novel to grasp, but easy to read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Didn't know what to expect. Thought it might be difficult reading for some reason. Turns out it was pretty easy. I guess it just gives you a lot to think about instead of looking up words and things like that. I think it could have been a 4.5-5 star book if the story would have been expanded upon to at least 500pp, or at least long enough to develop the characters."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"To be honest, I was left with a strong feeling of distaste after having finished Cat's Cradle. First, there's the book's rather blunt ridicule of science. In Cat's Cradle, science is represented by two characters - Dr. Hoenikker, inventor of the atomic bomb and all-around genius, and a fellow scientist whom the protagonist goes to interview some years after Hoenikker's death. The latter is basically an overbearing pompous ass and veritably invites the reader's contempt, especially given his praise of the former. The former is portrayed as a completely delusional psychopath to whom nothing exists besides research; his complete lack of contact with reality or with anything outside of his laboratory leads to the death of his wife and the severe maladjustment of his children, and aside from the other scientist, the whole town still hates him even years after his death.Hey, Vonnegut, you don't think you're being a bit too hard on scientists there, man? I mean, certainly, given the premise of science being irresponsible, deluded and in many ways blind and repugnant, like Hoenikker, then Vonnegut's \\"parable\\" about \\"over-reliance on science\\" makes perfect sense. But the entire premise is completely intellectually dishonest. There have been, believe it or not, works that have examined the same problem, in the same way of looking at the life of one scientist who is too wrapped up in his work to notice other aspects of life. The film Nine Days Of One Year immediately occurs to me as an example. But that film, though it reached a conclusion similar to Vonnegut's - that, the search for truth aside, one must not forget certain other important things in life - was far more honest about its subjects, acknowledging that they were more than just garish caricatures, and was all the more thought-provoking and powerful as a result. In comparison, Vonnegut's portrayal of science (which, in the book, is always greatly and deliberately praised by the most vacuous and unlikeable characters) is just ham-fisted and crude. Essentially, it proves a point about something that has no basis in reality in the first place.But that flaw, I suppose, would be forgivable. It's not uncommon for artists to oversimplify this issue, and it doesn't mean that the end result can't be good. The real problem I had with Cat's Cradle was the grotesque and very forced \\"comedy.\\" Actually, to be more accurate, it was the way Vonnegut turned _everything_ into grotesque and very forced \\"comedy,\\" and expected me to laugh at it. The prime example of this is that bit where Newt, Hoenikker's midget son, falls in love with a beautiful young circus freak who turns out to be a Russian spy and, moreover, twice as old as Newt. How does that sound to you? To me, it sounds like some gag made on some bad \\"cult comedy entertainment show,\\" and it was genuinely painful to read. Yes, yes, yes, plenty of great literature contains scenes in which characters suffer painful humiliation - but _this_ scene made me feel, very uncomfortably, that Vonnegut _himself_ was actively getting off on inflicting this sort of mean-spirited, artless tripe on his characters. And then there was that bit with Frank Hoenikker, the missing son who suddenly became second-in-command in a small island dictatorship, when he suddenly tells the protagonist where and why he had been secretively running about throughout his youth. Which would've been possible to ignore, if not for the exposition, in which we view him as a talented, creative human being and are told what he _really_ spent his time doing. Why did the author ever bother characterizing him if he was just going to turn it into another hideous caricature with no depth later on? Why am I supposed to laugh at people being abased for no reason? Oh, wait, I get it. It's supposed to prove some kind of facile \\"point\\" about how \\"life is really one big joke!\\" Insightful.I could say more. I could talk about the utterly awful \\"Calypsos,\\" about the way Vonnegut bludgeons the reader with his overwrought message, about that silly religious terminology, and about other things. But that's all secondary. The science fiction element is original, and Vonnegut's an inventive and imaginative author, but this book simply left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Where is the contemplation in this \\"classic\\"?This book, though an interesting insight into one man's thinking and life journey, certainly did not seem to merit the hype it has received.It seemed very whiney and a little condescending, talking down to the reader. If the world annoys you, Vonnegut, work to improve it, or better, your view of it, rather than complaining to the world! Cat's Cradle seemed like an explanation of one man's depression and corruption so we could understand, even agree with him. I am certainly not saying the world is perfect, but if you are looking for a pensive and melancholy-toned book about its problems, I suggest \\"Demian\\" or \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and others of Bradbury's classics. In comparison, Cat's Cradle is merely a collection of a cynic's complaints creatively assembled."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first 90% of this book. But then it was if if Vonnegut said, &quot;Well, better end this now&quot; and slapped on a contrived, simplistic, and extremely unsatisfying ending."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This review will likely spoil parts of the plot. I'll try and keep those to a minimum, but you've been warned.My English teacher once called this book a \\"science-fiction\\" novel, and that was the first red flag I should have noticed. Science-fiction, in a literature class? What English teacher would allow such a thing? I thought they despised books that focused on ideas instead of character!I soon learned that I had misread them entirely. It's not the focus on ideas that turns English majors off--it's optimism, and a sense that science and technology empower humanity and allow a brighter future. That's why \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is a book that they endorse. It goes beyond mere pessimism and dives into the abyss of nihilism.From Kurt Vonnegut, we learn that science and technology will be the death of us all, that the military-industrial complex is a force that will develop any weapon for its own sake without regard for the consequences, and that the purpose of religion is to provide comforting lies.These ideas are delivered through two plot devices--a substance called Ice-9, which converts water into solid form at room temperature, and an ideology called Bokononism. The former eventually--spoiler--kills almost all the world's population, and is supposed to be a parody of the atomic bomb. The latter is a religion whose adherants tell each other comforting lies. Leaving aside that doublethink is necessary for a lie to be comforting if the recipient of the lie is aware of its lack of truth, Bokononism fails as a parody of Christianity--Vonnegut's target--because the whole point of Christianity is that the adherants believe their ideology to be the truth! If an ideology is accepted to be a lie, why would anyone follow it? It is also an inherantly ugly ideology in that it provides no reason for one to exist. Even Marxism has some sort of bright ideal at the end of it to motivate its followers--Bokononism has nothing going for it.As for Ice-9, its inherant flaw as a satirical concept is that it is a parody of a phenomenon that doesn't exist. The military-industrial complex would not develop an obviously self-destructive device--the fact that there are no Cobalt Bombs should be evidence enough of that. Before anyone counters this point with the Atomic and Hydrogen bombs, an atomic war is not inherantly a civilization-ending event. They're just big explosives in a small package--humanity no more can wipe itself and the earth's biosphere out with them than it can alter the earth's orbital path. Ice-9 is a wholly different concept, a device that can freeze all liquid water on earth, and, if one thinks on timescales of trillions of years, perhaps the entire galaxy. Its use in battle would inherantly destroy the one who wields it. There is no reason that any power would develop it.Another flaw in this book is its lack of memorable characters. A character can be judged on his or her strength by how well one can remember them. Some authors write truly memorable characters--Allen Steele's William Tucker in \\"A King of Infinite Space,\\" Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle's Allen Carpentier in \\"Inferno,\\" Henryk Sienkiewicz's entire cast of main characters in his Trilogy, to name but a few. In \\"Cat's Cradle,\\" the only characters I can remember are that one midget (because I thought maybe the word \\"midget\\" was the source of that legendary Vonnegut humor) and the woman from Indiana who wants people to whom she is not related to call her \\"mom\\" (I remember her only because I tried to figure out what her mental disorder was for a while).Bottom Line: The book's messages are that Science is Bad and Religion is Lies. If you believe that either of these statements are false, you'd be better off with just about any other writer (Arthur C. Clarke, Robert Heinlein, Jules Verne, if you're into Science Fiction. Otherwise, I can recommend Henryk Sienkiewicz). If you are an English major, this might be the book for you. It's depressing, cynical, and all the other things that make for those excessively-long papers that English professors love."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut was one of the literary voices of my generation, even though the seminal events in his life occurred as part of my father's generation.I love this book! I've read it many times and often think about Bokononism when the world seems too bizarre.

If you have access to calypso music, turn it down very low and have a jar of dark rum nearby."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is by far Vonnegut's best work.

I was glad that he managed to put together a coherent story. The creation of Bokonism and the concept of ice nine is good stuff. The characters are just as cartoonish as ever. Nicely done, overall, and an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Back when I was in high school and college (shortly after the dinosaurs died off) Kurt Vonnegut was probably the most read author among my peers, followed closely by J.R.R. Tolkein and Hermann Hesse. Of these three, Hesse's novels addressed the spiritual restlessness of the 1960s, Tolkein was like a few hits off a bong that allowed the reader to experience an entirely different world, and Vonnegut, well he was the one who best expressed the frustration and lack of faith in our leaders and government.Vonnegut, followed closely by Mark Twain, was the greatest satirist this country ever produced. He took on all the topics of the day with a wit that was as sharp as a rapier's edge. He had the ability to make you laugh and squirm at the same time. His passing a few years ago left a void in American literature. (\\"So it goes,\\" to quote another of his books.)Cat's Cradle is one of a handful of Vonnegut's books that rank among the best of 20th century literature. Re-reading it after a couple of decades is to immerse oneself again into a familar stream. I'm glad I had the chance to read Cat's Cradle years ago. To read it for the first time now, in the post-9/11, post Cold War era, must seem a bit daunting. Without the background of living through a time when nuclear missiles were poised to reign down annihilation on mankind, some of Vonnegut's bitter humor is lost. Put it remains a powerful voice.In a mere 300 pages and 100+ very short chapters, Vonnegut manages to construct a novel that pulls together the threads of a uniquely dysfunctional family, an outlawed religion, a banana republic dictatorship on a small Carribean island, a secretly created substance that can destroy the world, and ... well, so much more that you wonder how he will ever pull it off without unraveling all the various threads. Somehow he does it and, in the process, turns those threads into a tapestry of human folly. That's the true genius of Vonnegut. That his unique voice and vision will still be around a century from now seems inevitable!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Who am I to even try and review a book by Kurt Vonnegut?I come to Cat's Cradle in 2011, about 40 years after everyone else my age has long since read the book, and I can see now why, more than likely because of Bokonism, it was so popular. I'm not sure why I never read the book before (not even the connection to the Grateful Dead was enough to get me to pick it up), but my guess is that it maybe had something to do with the connection Kurt Vonnegut had to Science Fiction and that wasn't a genre I was into at the time. Anyway, I don't feel bad for having waited so long because I think I appreciated the story now more than I would have then.My review in a nutshell, and these are not shameless lies, is that Cat's Cradle is frightening story full of wit, wisdom and insight and is a work of genius.\\"No damn cat, and no damn cradle.\\""},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This was the first Vonnegut book I read, and I couldn't put it down.

I could NOT put it down. I don't have a lot of time to read, but I managed to finish this in 3 days. Definitely one of my new favorite books..."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The relative lack of solid character development alone might scare off the type of reader who feels compelled to know the protagonist's favorite kind of vegetable spread as much as the underlying premise of the story itself, but in what is easily Vonnegut's most concise verbal bitchslap of organized religion and the perils of modern technology, don't expect a warm fuzzy feeling upon completion.Now, I wasn't even a twinkle in my old man's eye when this book was written, but the apocalyptic, (most likely) Cold War-inspired storyline upon first glance seems similar in tone to some other pieces from that general time period. In \\"Cat's Cradle\\", Vonnegut is quite successful in a short period of time (this is a quick read) to churn many of the constant fears in the modern world and turn them into an intelligent, cogent storyline that is in fact rather direct in its delivery. Many writers and many stories have touched on these topics but often delve (usually unintentionally) into sounding \\"preachy\\" and \\"overzealous\\". Vonnegut's wit and humor allows an otherwise mad genius to spin a tale as if Kurt himself is your friend, and not a fanatical know-it-all professor.Again; the concept of scientific progress causing the slow but apparent evaporation of the very humanistic element we pride ourselves on as a species is far from groundbreaking. However, to do so and wrap it around such biting political and social satire (to create and explain \\"bokonism\\" seemingly on such a whim is simply...awesome) is another thing entirely.The story itself is both humorous and rather appropriate for the times. Futhermore, as I hint in the above title, this is one of the darkest books I've ever read, but it should be."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book is simply another notable chunk of evidence that Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. was clearly the biggest genius who ever lived.The most dangerous substance in the world: ice-9.

I was hooked from the beginning. I didn't find this book nearly as witty as Slaughterhouse Five, but I wasn't expecting it to be. It's an engaging look at the ultimate futility of mankind to make the right choices at the right times. The story is also filled with themes and morals for the reader to discover (e.g. ice-nine was created to put an end to mud, and the Bokononist cosmogony says God created man from mud).I'm not sure which I liked better, this or Slaughterhouse Five; the only thing that I know for sure is that I will be getting another Vonnegut book as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I read Cat's Cradle back in the mid-'80s when I was in high school, and I liked it. On a whim, I dug it out to see what I'd think of it now that I have a few decades of pessimism under my belt. The verdict: it held up quite well, and I remembered why I went on a Vonnegut spree 20 years ago.This is not a book for everyone, especially those who prefer \\"feel good\\" fluff. This is a dark comedy, and such things are an acquired taste. Likewise, this is not a book that you read for the plot so much as for its character studies and (especially) its social commentary.Some of the impact of this book will quite likely be lost on younger readers who are not hip to the social circumstances of when it was written. Much in the same way as new viewers of Citizen Kane or readers of On The Road often go \\"what's the big deal?\\", Cat's Cradle is best enjoyed if you take into account what was available (and \\"acceptable\\") by comparrison in its contemporary setting. Certainly, America has its share of sardonic authors blasting the complascency bubble (Twain and Bierce, for instance) but Vonnegut shrewdly skewered the copascetic bubble of the early '60s in a way that was either shocking or refreshing, depending on your mind-set. Such things have increasingly become the norm, but Vonnegut was at the vanguard, and I think many authors delving into dark comedy and social parody take their cues from him.Vonnegut's prose is a pleasure to read, full of wit, wry descriptions, and a \\"voice\\" that just flows off the page. This is also a quick read that quite likely will lull you in and make you want to go just one more chapter before stopping for the night.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Not as good as Sirens of Titan, but easily as good as Slaughterhouse.

Most teenagers fear this assignment, and I was one of them, not wanting to HAVE to read just for the sake of writing down notes and listening to what the teacher had to say about the author's words. But once I began to read the text, I was engrossed in Vonnegut's phrases and the satires he used to describe every day life. Among other books that I have read during my school years, this was the only one I truly read for content. I enjoyed the ways Vonnegut criticized scientists, and the way he described the made-up religion of Bokononism. His intelligent understanding of the way things are run in the world made it perfect for his words to capture the obsurdity that is really shining through. I loved this book and plan to read others by Vonnegut, and I thank my teacher for finally assigning a book that caught my attention."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"A great satire of the cold war, american life, and banana republics, as well as religion and other sacred cows.

This book, like others by Vonnegut, uses satirical, seemingly spontaneous, black humor and extreme sarcasm to relay his cynical messages about religion, science, and life in general. In this story, a writter is researching the life of a strange scientist Frank Hoenikker, the inventor of the atom bomb. His research takes him to the obscure island of San Lorenzo, where the people are secretly devoted to the faith Vonnegut created called Bokonism. The ideals of Bokonism question the validity of all religions, while the writter's research conveys messages of science's malevolent effects on society. This book is very entertaining, funny, and thought provoking, and everyone should own it."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Using his trademark gruff, farcical voice, Vonnegut has written another brilliant novel proclaiming disdain for war, nations, horror, science, religion and all the other absurdities of mankind. Cat's Cradle is a clever, humorous Cold War satire involving an obscure Caribbean island, a religious philosopher named Bokonon, and an apocalyptic substance called \\"ice nine.\\"I especially enjoyed tidbits of Bokonist philosophy sprinkled throughout the book. For example, the Bokonist term, karass, refers to the teams that all of humanity is unknowingly organized into to do God's will. People in the same karass participate to help each other achieve cosmic goals-all perfectly unwittingly. And there's granfalloons, which are false karasses created by people themselves, and which are meaningless. Examples of granfalloons are, according to Vonnegut, \\"the Communist Party, the Daughters of the American Revolution, the General Electric Company, the International Order of Oddfellows-and any nation, anytime, anywhere.\\"While the narrative is broken up into staccato chapters containing references to future events, the book mainly follows a standard timeline-basically, from beginning to end-unlike his most sophisticated and emotionally charged book, Slaughterhouse Five. Nevertheless, while not on a par with Slaughterhouse Five, Cat's Cradle is an enjoyable romp into Vonnegut's colorful imagination and worth a read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Now I will destroy the whole world.\\"- What Bokonists say when they commit suicide, Cat's Cradle, Chapter 106You'd think a story about the end of the world - not just the world of one person, or human civilization, but all life on the planet - would be a grim affair, but Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle is replete with wit, wry humour, and a touching compassion for human frailty.Vonnegut's book is no bright dystopia, like the one portrayed in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, nor is it as unrelentingly dark as George Orwell's 1984. It's our world that Vonnegut so amusingly satirizes, a world in which human beings are awfully good at creating doomsday devices (atomic bombs, religions), and lying to themselves.Many have said this is a story about the insanity of the Cold War, but I think it's a short history of human stupidity. And it is as relevant today as it was when it was first published in 1963. The plot follows a narrator who is writing a book about one of the creators of the atomic bomb and in the process discovers the scientist has also made Ice-9, a substance with the potential to turn all water into solid ice. Why invent such a dangerous thing? Come on, science can't be held back by such existential worries - it's progress, baby.Our world is beset with climate change caused by our technologies. As a species, we're on the cusp of massive changes that could exceed the pace of evolution - whether from genetic engineering or through fusing our biology with information technology - and this is precisely the kind of book that everyone needs to read.We need to think about what we are doing with our scientific power, not just proceed blindly.Cat's Cradle is the book that helped me find a way I could be a writer: it's literary, but it plays with science fictional tropes; it's funny, but there's a point to it all. In it he invents a religion, Bokonism, that is both humane and ironic, and that puts the lie to all other human religions. He spoofs geopolitics as easily as he skewers human egocentrism. And he does it all with humour and prose that's accessible and well crafted. It's deceptively simple, in fact. You can't help but be moved, and then you think, \\"How did he do that?\\"The short chapters are perfect for today's attention-deficit-disordered readers (at least, until we have our concentration chips implanted), so it works as a book that everyone at university could read.Not to mention all the great ideas (foma: a harmless untruth) and kickass existential \\"Calypso\\" lyrics from the Book of Bokonon:Tiger got to hunt,Bird got to fly;Man got to wonder, \\"Why, why, why?\\"Tiger got to sleep,Bird got to land;Man got to tell himself, he understand."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"When I got my Kindle I quickly decided that a Vonnegut novel would be the first thing I read, like christening a new ship. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is a superb book, and it remains one of my favorites even 30 years after I first read it. This digital edition, however, needs some heavy proofing by a copy editor. In most-- if not all!-- instances, trailing double quote marks do not immediately follow the final letter or punctuation mark. Instead, they are shifted one space to the right and appear before the first letter of the next word. This frequently gives the appearance of a new character speech, when the author intends only narrative. This is compounded by the author's own use of the word 'Papa' in double quotes. The problem is not a deal killer, but it causes the reader to back up and re-read many sentences to get them back into the proper context, thus yanking the reader frequently out of the story being spun.5-star book brought back one star due to a bad digital conversion."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"cat's cradle, like all of vonnegut's books is a rather odd little piece of work. it's bitingly cynical, deeply depressing, and yet seems to convey a fragile sort of hope all at once.this book was written as a critique of what mr. vonnegut referred to as unethical scientists, people so concerned with what they might possibly be able to do that they don't stop and think what the consequences of their actions might be. it's rather effective at this in my opinion, creating a scenario that is silly and terrifying all at once.it's a harsh book, and some people will find that the almost fluffy humor grates with the dark premise and sometimes nasty characters. some people will love it deeply as it showcases vonnegut's ability to hate what humanity is and yet care what becomes of it at the same time.even if it turns out to not be your thing it's probably worth the read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is basically a unique and creative look at the end of the world. To me, Vonnegut is arguing that the dizzying progress of science and technology in the last century has made the total destruction of life on earth a frightening possibility, and it's not just the \\"bad guys\\" who threaten humanity with annihilation: an equal threat comes from the well-intentioned but short-sighted, from the lonely or downtrodden, from the greatest superpower to the tiniest and poorest island nation.In other words, truly destructive technologies, once they exist, become a danger to the entire world regardless of the \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" reasons for which they were created, and regardless of whether they fall into the hands of the \\"good guys\\" or the \\"bad guys.\\" Vonnegut seems to be saying that scientific advancements cannot exist in a moral vacuum, that scientists should take responsibility for what they're creating. The need for extreme care in creating such destructive technologies is made all the more pressing because, according to Vonnegut, we as human beings are addicted to classifying ourselves into nations and religions and political parties, and then killing and dying for these classifications.Perhaps this is the importance of Vonnegut's invention of Bokononism, the religion of the island nation of San Lorenzo: if Bokonoism offers one real truth to its followers, it's that the entire religion is made up, a \\"shameless lie.\\" The result is that, instead of striving to live Bokononism as the only possible truth, Bokononists are easy going; they realize from the start that Bokononism itself is just another example of the uniquely Bokononist notion of \\"foma,\\" i.e., \\"harmless untruths that make you brave and happy and kind.\\" If that's the case, there's no reason to kill others who disagree with you; instead you can focus on what really matters, which for Vonnegut seems to mean creating satisfying connections with other people.Cat's Cradle, then, is not only Vonnegut's plea for responsibility in the development of technology, but, perhaps even more fundamentally, it's the story of how we ought to simply learn to get along with each other. Luckily, it also happens to be a wildly funny, perfectly crafted piece of fiction. Great book."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This early classic was one of the books that made Vonnegut famous, and probably the first book where he really found successfully his particular style of black comedy. (He aimed for something similar in Sirens of Titan, but that book, with some fine moments, is uneven and significantly less successful.)The first persom narrator is known only as Jonah, although his first sentence is the allusive, \\"Call me Ishmael.\\" He is writing a book about the atomic bomb that leads him to research on the late Dr Felix Hoenneker, a brilliant scientist who viewed science with pure curiosity. Never caring about the practical implications of his work, Hoenneker made no distinction between working on the atom bomb and investigating how turtles retract their heads.Seeking to learn more about Hoenneker from his surviving children, Jonah follows them to the impoverished island nation of San Lorenzo, loosely based on Haiti. There he is introduced to Bokononism, the dominant religion of the island which, among its many unusual features, openly proclaims that it is a fraud. A good part of this rather short novel is a detailed discussion of Bokononism, which is one of Vonnegut's most memorable creations.While on the island, Jonah also learns more about ice 9, the final project that Hoenneker worked on. Ice 9 is ice with an entirely different crystalline structure from regular ice, which has the trait of freezing at normal temperatures. Thus, if you mixed ice 9 with any body of water, it would promptly freeze. Jonah soon finds reasons to doubt his assumption that ice 9 could not really exist.Jonah's adventures come to a grim if strangely appropriate finale - I don't think Vonnegut has ever written a novel with a happy ending. The moral of the story is, it seems, that life is entirely without meaning or purpose. And yet, the humor and vitality of the novel give it an energy and even joy strangely at contrast with its depressing message."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"was saddened to hear last year of the death of Kurt Vonnegut.

He managed to cover some of the most important philosophical, religious, psychosocial and ethical questions of the times.Can science and religion coexist peacefully? Can most people accept reality or do they prefer to live with their delusions? Is there any point in reading history, let alone writing it, if humanity's track record is such that we appear to be doomed to infinitely repeat our own mistakes?Vonnegut covers these tough issues and more in an entertaining and ironically humorous fashion. Although the book was published in 1963, his preoccupation with substances that could obliterate the species is every bit as relevant today as it was then, if not more so, and his characters are quirky yet believable.He spins a tale about a writer named Jonah (John to be exact)who becomes fascinated with the Hoenikker family: the children of a late scientist who co-discovered the first atomic bomb and an even more lethal substance called ice-nine, which could freeze all of the rivers and streams.Fortunately for us, Vonnegut's doomsday scenario has yet to play out. Perhaps it's just a matter of time but hopefully, people and nations are smarter than Vonnegut gave them credit for.Sigrid MacdonaldAuthor of D'Amour Road"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Cats Cradle\\" tells of the story of a man simply setting out to write a book about the atomic bomb. From this simple objective, our hero finds himself thrown into a world of dwarfs, banana republics, Hoosiers, scientists, and one secret formula called Ice-9. The plot is a wild one, but the theme remains constant as Vonnegut pits science against religion in a no holds cage match. In the end, our hero barely survives both as Vonnegut seemingly thumbs his nose at the rest of the world.\\"Cats Cradle\\" reminds me of Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", both books speak in powerful ways to youthful angst and both tend to grow and develop with their audience. There's no protagonist like Holden Caulfield here (a youthful soul most readers related to strongly) but there are a number of characters that represent the worst society has to offer, characters we see each night on the news. The book starts with \\"Cradle's\\" protagonist, Jonah, coming up against a guarded and cynical scientist who in turn leads him to the three children of Doctor Felix Hoenikker, inventor of the nuclear bomb. Each of Hoenikker's kids, now grown, have some of their father's last experiment Ice-9, a chemical, which freezes all fluids on contact. A small amount could freeze the planet we learn, this while the Hoenikker siblings are running around the globe, each with their tiny thermos of Ice-9, the very future of the world in their incapable hands. The trail of the sibling's flows to San Lorenzo, a small island, that is responsible for the creation of Bokonism...a religion based on lies. It is here where Ice-9 and Bokonism go head to head and the results are devastating.Of course Vonnegut's true villain in all this is man and his incredible talent of making wondrous things, be it through God or test tubes, that are very good at destroying us."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut is one of those author's with such a ridiculous cult following that he never interested me. I've got friends who would bleed for Vonnegut, who would gladly get into barroom brawls with people who slander him in any way. So I always avoided him: I'm not down with overhype.But I read Slaughterhouse-Five, and it wasn't bad, so I borrowed a copy of Cat's Cradle, as a light read.Holy cow. What a great book!Cat's Cradle revolves around the concept of lies. One of the main features of the book is the tenets of Bokononism, a made-up religion that is admittedly based on lies. The name sake of the book, the Cat's Cradle, is a reflection of lies in society-- There's &quot;no damn cat, no damn cradle.&quot; Lies in conversation, lies in life: it's an ongoing commentary on it all.So it's about lies. But it's Vonnegut, so it's not a heavy read, and the prose flies. It's a book you can finish in a single sitting, and still come away with handy hints on life (&quot;Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.&quot;)I hate to admit that I'm now hooked on Vonnegut. But I am. I don't know that I'd fight for him, but I'd be much more apt to consider it at this point."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Cats Cradle&quot; produces an excellent outlook on society in general. The main character, Jonah, named after the biblical Jonah and the Whale story for his unfortunate circumstances, is writing a book called &quot;The Day The World Ended&quot;. Throughout his research, he meets many brilliant minds and by pure coincidence (or as Bokonon would say, as it was supposed to happen) he comes across an object which can actually end the world. A interesting analysis of scientists, truth, religion and human nature. Near the beginning it tells you that if you cannot understand how a religion can be based on lies yet still be practised then you will not understand the book (that Jonah is writing: &quot;The Day The World Ended&quot;). You will understand this later in the book. An excellent read for an open mind on many topics such as religion, truth and science."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is the second Vonnegut novel I read, the first being Slaughterhouse-Five. I was highly impressed by both of them. He has become one of my favorite authors. Once again, I am amazed at Vonnegut's ability to treat deathly serious subjects so lightheartedly without trivializing them. I laughed out loud several times during the course of this book, and yet, it is no less profound than the overtly serious 1984. How can this be, you ask? The answer is that Vonnegut has discovered what Orwell, Huxley, and countless other brilliant &quot;fair warning&quot; writers failed to realize: humor is the one universal element. Many people disdain such so-called universal elements as love, religion, politics, and the like. However, NO ONE, I repeat, NO ONE, is safe from the far-reaching potential of humor. Vonnegut uses it skillfully here. I won't go into plot details here, read the book for that. What I will say is that on the surface is an entertaining and fast-paced piece of black-humored satire, and between the lines is a highly relevant novel that has, and hopefully will continue to, displace the arrogance and folly of modern Man."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"my first vonnegut book and, so far, my favorite. i did not have a sense of who vonnegut was or how he wrote when i picked up this book on a recomendation of a friend. 50 pages into it i really did not know if i was actually reading a novel or just some mad old fart rambling about chemistry and conflict. it jumps around in the usual post-modern fasion, leaving the reader to wonder where the author could possibly go with all of the seemingly usless information being hurled at us at every turn of the page. but soon i got a sense. then a grasp. then an almost privledged feeling as i saw the parts of the puzzle take their place. this seemingly incoherant babbeling was slowly starting to take shape and what's more, make sense. i could not put the book down. it hooked me with confusion and reeled me with its wit. i recomend this book as a pill for the mundane. a psychotic break from textbooks. and as a prime example for understanding the post-modern world in which we now live."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is my favorite Vonnegut book, and one of my most favorite books of all time. This book shaped my views on religion and on life in general. Vonneguts writing is deceptively simple and easy to read. His ideas are the kind that make you think, &quot;Of course! That is what I have thought all along, I just didn't know how to express it!&quot; Vonneguts main characters are his ideas, and such is the case in this book. You don't necessarily identify so much with the characters, but with the ideas their story illustrates. This is a great book and I would, and do, recommend it to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut displays, once again, his amazing abiltity to interweave various elements into a captivating read for people of all ages! I'm 16 and have read only a small number of Vonnegut novels, and I appreciate his work as much as people three times my age (sorry guys!!) That's the sign of truly great literature. I'm using Cat's Cradle as the basis for a paper that is supposed to pull together all my scholastic subjects under one unifying theme, as introduced in a book of my choice. Vonnegut makes this task easy, with his tying of a fictional religion, Bokononism, with the terrible catastrophe caused by science going too far with the creation of ice-nine, which eventually brings about the end of the world. Vonnegut delievers a serious message about the willingness of mankind to give up everything for lies. Through this fun to read book, he displays genius and complex philosophy. The levels of thought in Cat's Cradle are multi-layered -- you appreciate a comment on its satirical face value, then realiz"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Don't be a fool! Close this book at once! It is nothing but foma! Foma of course, are lies\\" (177). This is the title page of \\"The Books of Bokonon\\" (177), the fictional and Nihilistic religion in Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle. Vonnegut uses Bokononism as a device to communicate his social commentary on science, religion, and human stupidity. Although Cat's Cradle is a witty, black comedy based around the end of the world, it makes you think while you are laughing. This book is a beautifully written classic and is an essential read for any fan of Vonnegut's work.This novel starts out with the narrator, John, doing research for his book about \\"what important Americans had done on the day when the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima\\" (11). This leads John to the \\"father of the first atomic bomb\\" (14), Felix Hoenikker, and his very unusual family. He has a midget son named Newt and his other son, Franklin, is the assistant to the dictator of the island of San Lorenzo. San Lorenzo is the main setting of the story and is home to religious leader, Bokonon. While on the island, the old dictator dies and John becomes president. Before Felix died, he made a substance called ice-nine, which makes water freeze at room temperature, simply because he thought it was interesting. Ironically, combined with human stupidity this crystal of ice leads to the destruction of all life on the planet.Cat's Cradle is a cynical and pessimistic portrayal of humanity. Vonnegut owes this outlook to his harsh life. His mother committed suicide on mother's day in 1944; he was a prisoner of war during the firebombing of Dresden; he watched his sister die of cancer; and he himself tried to commit suicide in 1984. His experiences in the war and his life have led him to become a pacifist and this moral vision shows through in Cat's Cradle.Underneath the humor in this novel, Vonnegut gives cutting social commentary. His thoughts about religion are demonstrated through Bokononism. Bokonon says, \\"she was a fool, and so am I, and so is anyone who thinks he sees what God is Doing\\" (13), showing Vonnegut's disapproval of organized religion and its interpretation of god. He also writes that when man asked God about the meaning of life, God replied, \\"'everything must have a purpose? Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this', and He went away\\" (177). Bokononism holds that the only meaning in life is to search for a purpose. Although this Bokononism is meant to parody religion, it brings up interesting existential questions about the meaninglessness of life.When this book was written, Vonnegut was commenting on the Cold War and the foolishness of man in building weapons that could destroy the world. In today's age of the \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" and impending doom from terrorists, these themes and ideas are still applicable. He ironically has the \\"father of the atomic bomb\\" (14) creating a simple crystal of ice that eventually destroys the world. This warns against carelessness regarding life and the foolishness of building weapons capable of destroying humanity. Vonnegut makes a convincing argument for pacifism by making fun of the consequences of war and destruction.In Cat's Cradle, Kurt Vonnegut perfectly balances humor with thoughtfulness. This unique style and tone in his writing separates him from any other author and he gets his point across without preaching to the reader. This book is a masterpiece of literature and is Vonnegut's greatest work of art."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"[...]Vonnegut skewers science, religion, families, human foibles, ... and does it with such a pleasently twisted story. The concept of Ice 9 is itself such an amazing absurdity. I read this book in college in 1968. I've read it six more times since then. My teenage son and daughter have also read it. It is now a family tradition. I rate this book as my favorite piece of literature. Don't pass this book by."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut was trying to make a point with these words at the beginning of \\"Cat's Cradle,\\" but they're wrong. The events and characters may be foma, but the things that drive this book are all too real.\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is the story of John or Jonah and his attempt to write a book about the events of August 6th, 1945, the day of the first dropping of the atomic bomb. His efforts begin weaving his karass with those of the Hoenikker family, children of one of the prime scientists who worked on the bomb.Foma? Karass? These are Bokononist words. While this book is written by Vonnegut, the tale tells that it's been written by John, after the events of the book. He started his book as a Christian, but has since converted to Bokononism, developed by a man named Bokonon, a Buddha in his own right. Bokonon's religion is simple: Make lies, be happy. It is at the beginning of his book that it claims the entire text is foma, or lies.Vonnegut has created an excellent conflict within the politics of San Lorenzo, the island where Bokonon lives, and how it draws John in as a catalyst for events to come. While the end result is not his fault, it's interesting to see how he learns of things that will happen, and since the book is being written by him, he comments on his own thoughts and those of others in the past. This isn't very new, but often first-person narrative books make the character not know what's happened, even if they tell everything in the past tense, even so much as to know how long ago the events took place.Within \\"Cat's Cradle\\" and stretching into a few of his other works, Vonnegut has created an entirely new and original religion, one that professes openly that nothing about it is true except it's theme, which is exactly what is true about the novel.Little Newt Hoenikker represents the second best theme, the first having been the religious implications present. His traumatic obsession with the cat's cradle and the fact that he wonders why he can't see the cat, not as a six-year old, and not as an adult, shows that sometimes people are expected to see what they cannot see, and that it's ludicrous sometimes to expect anyone to see it.The most intriuging questions of all lie in what the character Mona says late in the book, after the climax; questions that are sure to have you yourself wondering about things in our world, in the real life posed by this book.Above all, \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is an interesting book that will keep you reading. I originally heard of it through the movie \\"The Recruit,\\" where Ice-nine was used as a code for a computer virus. Ice-nine is something very different here, and its effects are monumental, even when simply discussed hypothetically earlier in the book.While many Vonnegut books are primarily for those who enjoy Vonnegut's dark humor and style, \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is a novel that can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone old enough to read it. It is anything but foma."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle may be Kurt Vonnegut's best book, and John -- the main character who is not mentioned by name beyond the first page of the book -- may be a bit like Vonnegut himself, a man swept up by events, an involuntary protagonist.Vonnegut's characters, as always, are eclectic, unusual and extremely funny. The general subject matter is at once irreverent and relevant to the world we are in today, and the insight into human nature is timeless.Without giving away the story, the end of the book is biblical, one way or another. I see it as apocalyptic, which is an easy interpretation, but a friend sees similarities with the Great Flood, a cleansing event. Now I wonder if the first and last books of the Bible have more in common than I first thought. Thanks, Kurt, John, Ice-9.For those who don't know much about Vonnegut himself, the man never meant to become one of the leading writers of his generation. He was a short story writer in the 1940s and 1950s, when that was still a viable profession, and he turned to novels reluctantly. According to his biographies and interviews he's given, he saw himself as a simple story teller, a catalyst for readers to live in a different reality for a few pages, to chuckle a little on the bus home. But his longevity, the importance of the then-contemporary issues he has written about and the impact he had on generations of young people (who later became middle aged and then old people while remaining influenced by the writer from Indianapolis) have solidified Vonnegut's place in the American literary canon, and Cat's Cradle is the best example of his work.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Don't read this review; it is foma. Absorbing. Do read the book. This review was a lie."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The novel was actually, a bit of a disappointment. From the praise, and encouragement, I recived from my AP Language teacher I assumed it would be fantastic. The novel itself was very sporadic and difficult to follow. I understand that this is Vonnegut's style of writing, but it did not appeal to me. On any normal occasion I would have given the book a two. However, it did have an interesting plot. Having an apocalyptic theme and the technology that was introdced made it more compelling. In my opinion, this story gets a three to three in a half as a rating. If you enjoy books that require a bit more thought then normal, then I highly recommend the novel. If, however, you enjoy page turners that need little to no thought process to understand the plot, I would not recommend it.

Vonnegut has been said by others to be a satirical genius, but all his humor is lost on me. The story chronicles a man named Jonah, who attempts to make a novel regarding August 6, 1945, the day the first atomic bomb was dropped. He then decides to write to Newt Hoenikker, the midget son of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the creators of the atomic bomb, to ask him what happened in his house on the day that the atomic bomb dropped. Jonah then on his way to do another story passes through Illium, New York, the place where Dr. Felix Hoenikker conducted the majority of his research on the atomic bomb and ice-nine, a form of ice that has a melting point of one hundred fourteen point four degrees Fahrenheit. While in Illium, he interviews many who knew Dr. Felix Hoenikker, including his former boss, about what the man who created the atomic bomb was really like. Another story then takes Jonah to the Republic of San Lorenzo, where another one of the sons of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, Major General Franklin Hoenikker is prominent in government. When the president, Miguel \\"Papa\\" Monzano falls ill and dies the logical choice to succeed him is Major General Franklin Hoenikker. Major General Franklin Hoenikker then strikes a deal with Jonah for Jonah to become president in exchange for Jonah marrying Mona Aamons Monzano, the most beautiful woman in San Lorenzo. At San Lorenzo, Jonah also finds a new religion, Bokononism, which admits to containing only lies. Despite this all the poor inhabitants of this dreadful island are devout Bokononists. The vast majority of Vonnegut's characters are utterly implausible, ranging from Zinka, a Ukrainian midget, Newt falls in love with, to Philip Castle, the homosexual one time fianc&eacute; of Mona Aamons Monzano, to Bokonon, a man who created a religion consisting of only lies and turned himself into a saint and the President of San Lorenzo into a villain.

Or most of the elements of a story, for that matter.Granted, it was an entertaining read, and I can see a smile on Vonnegut's face upon reading this. He would probably look at me and say, \\"Cat's Cradle.\\" Was that the point? Was I supposed to come out of it with a nihilistic outlook? The story was short, simple, and it lacked depth. I found it lacking.Read it if you like, or don't.

Like I said origonaly, the first half or so of the book loses me. I only got interested in it when the protagonist got on the plane midway through the book.In some ways, people could find this novel contrivesal, because the main religon(Bokonon) mimics the eairly Christians death by the cross, and that man is going to far with science that is harful to us, but only if your trying to see that like I was.

In fact, it's very analogous to our world and just as a cat is easily amused and full of schizonphrenic ponderings over a cradles motive and purpose, we humans jump around at once significant and then insignificant images and movements through vast re-interpretations relative to the socio-historical context of the times. Once thinking that we've found our quenchable thirst for play and/or food by capuring that pattern of yarn strung together to form a cradle, it is morphed into a new dimension of complexity and mysteriousness.Instead of releasing that which is patently false and which can destroy us (i.e. ice-nine), we humans hold on to these farcical notions. Maybe the key is to create our own farcical analogies and conceptual vision of reality to makes sense of the underlying farcical framework upon which we are evolving.

I thought it was such a disturbing book. Everything I've heard about him, though, seems to be true. He's a brilliant satirist. Well, this is a story, a satirical effusion of sarcasm, about that subject - The End of the World. The irony here is that the guy who was really the father of the atomic bomb didn't wipe out the earth on his first try using the fiery, nuclear holocaust. So he tries again with this substance called Ice-9, with spectacularly better results. I thought it was a very incomplete yet complex story portraying the end of the world, yet I still found it enjoyable. War, religion, capitalism, Americanism and the implied hatred that the entire world has for it, politics -- Human Nature are all targets of Vonnegut's caustic satire. It's an interesting story, but it's more interesting as a macabre, yet humorous, linguistic feast. As I read this book I couldn't help thinking of that Robert Frost poem, Fire and Ice. You know... Some say the world will end in fire, some say in Ice. I thought this was appropriate considering the man behind the atomic bomb was like an attempt to end the world in fire, and Ice-9 was like an attempt using Ice, yet all done by the same man. In the end I found that this book was an excellent read, at least once. While it has the potential to be a favorite re-read, I would not give it overwhelming praise such as guaranteeing it. I found some parts humorous and others quite depressing, but it was well written and had a fairly easily followed plot, if not incomplete. So I would recommend you definitely read this book for yourself, and you be the judge, don't just take my word for it."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I had heard so much about Vonnegut since my freshman year in High school. I know now that I will become a hard core fan of all his books. I'm an avid reader of all science fiction novels and this one is definitely one of my favorites. This book is by far a thrill ride of an apocolyptic adventure. There are also alot of great charcter introduced in the book and alot of funny scenes. This was my first experience with Vonnegut and I enjoyed every moment of it. When I first saw the cover of the book I thought that it would be interesting and it was. It was not so hard and it was not very easy either. I love the way he satires religon and science. Blending his patented wry humor with acute social insight presented in an absurd fantasy world, Vonnegut has written an exceptional novel of love lies and the self destruction of mankind. The story centers around the narrator, Jonah, who is called by name only once in the entire book. We are told in the begining of the book that he is writing a book on the events of the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan.His research leads him to a correspondence with Newt Hoenikker, the midget son of doctor Felix Hoenikker, father of the atomic bomb. After meeting with Newt, destiny leads our protagonist to the impoverished island republic of San Lorenzo, where among other adventures he finds religon, falls in love and becomes a president. All of this by itself would make for a very entertaining book, but it is not in the story line that Vonnegut's genius lies. Cat's Cradle is rife with painfully accurate insights into the institutions that our society holds so dear, such as, religion, politics, and science. Vonnegut invents for the inhabitants of San Lorenzo a brand new religion based completely and admittedly on &quot;foma&quot;, or lies. This wouldn&quot;t be so shocking, except for the fact that this &quot;bokonism&quot; seems to make perfect sense. Other Vonnegut ironies pervade the book and are too elaborate to go into. Cat's Cradle is one of the most absurd,and frightening novels. This book truly causes one to stop and think about the things that one holds as unquestionably true. All of these incredible people, places, things and ideas in Cat's cradle are intricately woven into a perfect tapestry that sums up and spells out many of mankind's self-created problems in 191 pages. I haven't read any of Kurt Vonnegut's other books but I know that I most certainly will. After checking this book out from the library I went and bought my own copy. I strongly recommed this book to anyone over the age of four-teen. There is no reason not to buy this masterpiece of modern literature. SO IF YOU READ IT WAS AND DIDM'T LIKE IT THAN READ IT AGAIN. IF YOU READ IT ONCE AND ENJOYED BUY IT AND READ IT AGAIN."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Jonah, the main character, plans on writing a book about the day that Hiroshima was hit by the a-bomb, but not about the bomb itself: he wants anecdotes, stories that happened to people on that particular day. To pursue this idea, he gets in touch with Newton Hoenikker (son of Felix Hoenikker, inventor of the a-bomb) and many other characters related to Hoenikker's life. We see that his interest shifts slowly from the day the a-bomb hit Hiroshima to the Hoenikker family. This wild information chase leads him to an island, San Lorenzo, where Frank Hoenikker (another son of Felix's) is one of the top dogs - his title exactly, I can't remember.Anyway, before dying, Felix had invented ice-nine, a chemical product able to &quot;teach&quot; water molecules to assemble themselves in a different manner, the way oranges can be piled up in a different manner in a crate.This tale, also revolving around a religion thoroughly explained - called Bokononism - gives us an apocalyptic view of ourselves, and takes to the extremes many things we take for granted. And still, for some reason, you just can't help laughing at the bitterness and harshness with which this story is written.This is without a doubt a must-read, and is one of the best-ended books of all time. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"A great work of art, I would recommend it to anyone needing a good laugh.

The characters are just \\"types,\\" and so incompletely sketched that we can't care what happens to any of them. The plot brings together an assortment of these characters - for no apparent reason at all - to an island for a doomsday scenario. After the scenario plays out, we receive from Vonnegut the valuable intelligence that all of mankind's effort is meaningless and absurd, and that the best we can hope for is a good laugh at the joke that God has played on us. Most readers will have no reason to trouble with this inconsequential work."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"We ordered this product more than 30 days ago and it still has not arrived.

Do you think there is any importance to life (at all)? Well, the whole point of this book is that life means zilch. Religion is a crutch, politics is a crutch. Everything means nothing. I wonder why some people like to be this pessimisstic. Why people want to believe that life means nothing. If life means nothing, then why don't we go on murder rampages? Why don't we steal, rape, and loot? What's the point of trying to teach a lesson if life means nothing? There is no point. One of the previous reviews mentioned Catcher in the Rye. Awesome Book.

Vonnegut is not only a genius of wit and satire but a master judge of the pitiful human pathos. He may be a tad Cynical but then A little cynicism is a good thing.

He blends humor (Admittedly not as much so as his other novels)with his trademark apocalyptic visions of doom. This book is as hard edged as any of the satire he spilled out in his other novels. This book ranks in his top three and is far better than Bluebeard or Hocus Pocus (Don't get me wrong, those two are great as well.) But if you can say that this is not one of his better works than you simply weren't smart enough to grasp it. It's nothing short of pure genious"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Far be it from me to imply that &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is not a good time. But for some reason it has come to sit in Vonnegut's pantheon next to &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House.&quot; And again, it's not that it doesn't work; the odd little tale of island romance in the midst of revolution and the ultimate freezing element, ice-9 has plenty of terrific moments. But ultimately, the book feels cold and clammy; where elsewhere Vonnegut contrasts the sad and the funny here he chooses to club you with pathos and neglect to explain much of anything. Overall, a good read, but check out &quot;Sirens of Titan&quot; or most of his other early novels before shipwrecking here"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The end of the world as seen through Vonnegut's eyes and yours as you will read and re-read this book for years to come.The Grateful Dead took icenine as the name of their music publishing company.I have read all of Vonnegut's works and still come back to Cat's Cradle every few years, enjoying it more each time"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is one of those great books that I recall reading when I was younger that made reading fun.

It left a huge impression on everyone who read it when it was first published. I just read &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; for the first time, though, and I must say I was disappointed. I am a huge fan of Vonnegut; I read Slaughterhouse-Five and Hocus Pocus before &quot;Cat's Cradle,&quot; and several others since (I hope to have read all of them by the next millennium), but I think that &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; was the least impressive of all, especially after just having finished &quot;Hocus Pocus,&quot; his best I have read so far. &quot;Cradle&quot; lacks the emotion and wit of 'Slaughterhous,&quot; or &quot;Bluebeard,&quot; and the tremendous humor of &quot;Hocus Pocus.&quot; He seems to take the story just a tad too seriously, which is strange because this is his most bizzare and unrealistic story.

At a period of scientific advancements, and a terrifying World War, Vonnegut uses the confusing character of Felix Hoenikker. Behind his innocent nature, Hoenikker is the creator of the atomic bomb and ice nine, which kills nearly everything in the world. In a twisted way, Vonnegut confuses the reader, because Felix is not what people conceive as an evil person. His playful humor, is merely a play on words of his conception of the world filled with human stupidity. Unlike many authors, Vonnegut relays the truth of our perfect technological world as it is not always perceived. The book's excellence is expressed by Vonneguts relentless emphasis on human stupidity, still running ramped in the 20th Century. Through his carefully planned irony, Vonnegut relays that man's technological advancements combined with indifferent, careless, stupid people are enough to destroy the world. However, as intelligent and excellent Vonnegut's perception of our world is, it does come across as a terrifying reality to some. Some readers may not be able to accept these dangers that surround us, and the capability for Cats Cradle to actually occur. Never the less, Vonneguts greatness and intelligence cannot be overlooked, no matter how terrifying his book appears. Clearly, I believe that every adult, who ever thinks about our future, should read this novel. The book answers many questions of what mankind is capable of accomplishing. If I were to rate this book, it would be an immediate 10."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I thought Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut was a creative, entertaining, humorous and unique novel that dealt with science, religion and politics. The narrator is a writer aspiring to compose a book about what people were doing the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. He begins his investigation through communicating with one of Frank Hoenikker's (the father of the atomic bomb) three children. His investigation brings John, the narrator from Illium, Illinois to San Lorenzo to finally the destruction of the world. John meets Frank Hoenikker's three children on his way to San Lorenzo. Here, he found his religion and becomes president. John encounters the end of the world due to a substance known as &quot;ice nine&quot; invented by Frank Hoenikker.Cat's Cradle was an intriguing novel. The ideas of Bokonists were fun and also the way Kurt Vonnegut connected all of his characters. His short and witty chapters made the reading go by quickly. His style of writing and creativeness kept me hooked.I recommend Cat's Cradle for ages 14 and up."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle is a fantastically witty narration of an author's bizarre encounters as he goes about collecting material for his book, The Day the World Ended. Through the voice of the narrator, Vonnegut lampoons organized religion and creates an imaginative science fiction story in which a new atom called &quot;ICE NINE&quot; that has the potential to destroy the world. Vonnegut's ideas are expertly assembled to create a masterpiece of science fiction and humor that holds together and is extremely entertaining."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle is an apocalyptic interpretation of the world's future. Written from the perspective of a free-lance writer, John, Cat's Cradle cleverly links a scientist's disfunctional family to a Caribbean island living under the illusions of a religion grounded on lies. Pursuing substance for his novel, The Day the World Ended, John contacts the family of Felix Hoenikker, the father of the atomic bomb. Consequently, John travels with Hoenikker's children to a Caribbean island, falls in love, assumes the presidency, and witnesses the destruction of the world. The text flowed very well; terse chapters maintained the reader's interest. Witty conclusions exemplified how humans are connected through intricate links. Vonnegut's varied settings, ranging from suburban New York to an impoverished Caribbean island, certainly maintain the reader's interest. Vonnegut also refrains from narrating the novel with an omniscient voice. On the contrary, John is ignorant about human relationships; this naivety evokes humor. Two themes the novel served to exemplify, illusion vs. reality and the destruction resulting from unrestricted science were prominent. To comprehend these themes, readers should be in the adolescent or adult age groups. The reader must also bear patience to see how obscure events string together at the novel's conclusion. With patience, readers will relish this ingenius satire."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The novel Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut is a prime example of the science fiction genre. The novel contains a perfect blend of scientific logic and literary fiction, making it both believable and entertaining at once. The story is the fictitious memoirs of a writer named John, who is doing research for a book he plans to write about the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. His curiosity spurs a chain of events, and he soon is caught in the middle of the intricate web of secrets and lies of the Hoenikkers, the children of Felix Hoenikker, the father of the atomic bomb. John soon discovers that the children possess a synthetic compound called Ice Nine, an isotope of H20 whose unique structure gives it properties unique from any other material on Earth. The discovery of Ice Nine proves to be the turning point of the novel, and Ice Nine ultimately plays a key role in the conclusion of the story. I found Cat's Cradle to be an insightful and brilliantly composed novel. Cat's Cradle has the captivating plot that is characteristic to science fiction novels, but it separates itself from other novels in its genre with its sense of reality. Despite some of its far-fetched aspects, while reading Cat's Cradle, I couldn't help but think that it was a true story. Vonnegut's detailed characterization, believable setting, and blend of fictitious occurrences and historic events make the novel seem as realistic as an autobiography. Vonnegut also did a great job using irony and black humor to express the hidden themes of the novel. Cat's Cradle offers a cynical and insightful view into the worlds of religion, technology, science, and government. Although I consider this novel to be one of most well written works of science fiction ever composed, it does contain a few minor downsides. This book is written in an odd format, and it is set up as a collection of interconnecting anecdotes. Although this format gives Cat's Cradle a unique and interesting feel, it can make the plot confusing to understand at times. The only other downside is that the symbolism and hidden meaning of many of the events and people in the novel can be difficult to decipher at times. For these reasons, I would recommend this book to people ages 16 and above who read at a sophisticated level. I would certainly recommend this novel to anyone who has an interest in science, as well as anyone who is interested by politically and socially ironic literature."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonneugts Cat's Cradle is carried along by a group of captivating characters, which include a scientist, Dr. Hoenikker, and his 3 awkward children.

The symbolism portrayed makes this a wonderful book that will absorb a reader completely. This book is recommended to anyone 15 and older."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut is an accomplished text that masters the essence of a new religion, and hazards of science through a sarcastic and humorous tone. The novel comprises a curious man gathering information for his novel on The Day the World Ended. While interviewing the family of a doctor that contributed to the discovery of the atom bond, the narrator stumbles into a society where religion is based on lies and human stupidity is universal. By surrounding the character in a new civilization and faith, Vonnegut engulfs the reader into his masterpiece. As the lead role, John's arrival at the island of San Lorenzo and his discovery of Bokonism paves the way for his commitment to the awkward religion. John develops a relationship with a childish midget, his stringy six-foot sister, and their public shy brother that unfurls him into a mysterious world. This unique novel tours the reader through a separate dimension. With his unpredictability and ability to create suspense, Vonnegut creates a sense of curiousity persuading one to continue reading. Cat's Cradle is an ideal piece that ignites one's imagination and is fit for a teenager to an adult that is ready to explore a new religion and way of life!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The novel Cat's Cradle by the author Kurt Vonnegut shows how a society can maintain itself around the contradiction of science and religion. The novel reflects around such examples as the infamous ice- nine and the profound religion of Bokonism developed by a most impressive man, Bokonon himself. The novel mainly revolves around the concept of the crystals known as ice- nine. This is said to be a compound of water whose molecular structure has been altered into another form which makes it solid at room temperature and have a melting point of one- hundred and fourteen degrees Fahrenheit. It also is known to instantaneously freeze anything that it comes in contact with, which eventually destroys the world. Ironically this substance happened to be created by the maker of the atomic bomb. An interesting book indeed. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the concept of science versus religion and also to anyone who is intrigued by science itself. I found the book to be quite an enjoying and extremely fascinating book to pick up, and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in trying out one of Vonnegut's \\"different\\" books."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut skewers science, religion, families, human foibles, ... and does it with such a pleasently twisted story. The concept of Ice 9 is itself such an amazing absurdity. I read this book in college in 1968. I've read it six more times since then. My teenage son and daughter have also read it. It is now a family tradition. I rate this book as my favorite piece of literature. Don't pass this book by."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is a well-known excellent writer. He wrote several great books that incorporate human life and emotions. One of his best works was A Cat's Cradle. This book talked about the contradiction between illusion and reality and how people valued it in their societies. It also showed the topic of science vs. religion in modern society. Vonnegut's creative style of writing made this book an interesting read. All of these reasons make A Cat's Cradle an excellent book to read and a beginning for the understanding of the world portrayed in Vonnegut's many writings. The plot of A Cat's Cradle involves humanity and the contradictions that exist in modern society. Vonnegut focuses on the theme of illusion and reality in this book which were also explored in his previous novels, Mother Night. He came to the conclusion that illusion becomes reality in people's lives. A gloomy world is depicted in this novel to show the reality of life. This book is basically about one man who wants to write a book about World War two. It leads to his investigation between the topics of science and religion. The science part of this novel discusses an atomic bomb and a fanciful \\"ice nine\\" poison. The religion part of this novel discusses the widely followed religion of Bokonism that said that God is \\"utterly indifferent.\\" The topics this novel discussed were written very humorously. Every chapter had a joke at the end. It was an easy and very interesting read. The characters were exciting and easy to follow. A Cat's Cradle questioned topics of humanity and life in a very interesting and joyful way. Kurt Vonnegut's book A Cat's Cradle was an excellent read. Its theme was creative and questioned certain topics that really never discussed. Like all of Kurt Vonnegut's books the chapters are short and discuss short segments of the main character's life. After the reading the book, it makes the reader question their own life and humanity in general. The way the book is written keeps the reader consistently involved in the book. I truly enjoyed this book especially since I have read other books by Kurt Vonnegut. I hope you decide to read it and then read other selections by Kurt Vonnegut, an acclaimed and highly recommended author."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This wacky tale of a journalist who witnesses the end of the world is a wonderful satire filled with memorable imagery and witticisms. Since this is the first Vonnegut book I've read, I don't know if it's his best, but I certainly think it's a fascinating read. The use of a cat's cradle string-game as a metaphor for various ideas and things is quite astute and sparklingly new, even though the book is from 1963. This book is definitely for anyone interested in zany literature that challenges the status quo, of any sort."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. The end-of-humanity theme is presented in such a humorous manner, that you can't help but love it.

I recommend this book to anyone, especially if you enjoy other Kurt Vonnegut books (my personal &quot;other favorites&quot; are &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; and &quot;Galapagos&quot;."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I'm not going to write a lengthy review, but I must say that this book, among other Vonnegut writings, has changed my way of thought.

I highly recommend this book if you want to have a new perspective on life."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"CAT'S CRADLE is categorically brilliant, a magnificent piece of fiction, and Vonnegut is enormously talented. CRADLE is doubtless one of the most imaginative, thought-provoking, and entertaining books I've ever had the immense pleasure of reading. I whole-heartedly recommend it to readers of all ages and backgrounds."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Well, maybe not quite, but it's certainly the first one I've gotten so involved in. I related to the characters' dilemmas so well it was rather frightening. The absurdity/satire, while not for everyone, is also right up my alley. I also spent a few days carrying the book around with me everywhere and whenever I'd see one of my friends, I'd show them some part about Boknononism and tell them &quot;This is just what I was trying to say when you were telling me I was nuts!&quot;Engaging reading."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I just finished Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle. This is my first Vonnegut book and I'm most definitely a fan now. He has the incredible ability to interweave serious issues into a humorous satire. There were times I laughed out loud, and then I wondered why I did. He forces one to search deeper and to question our beliefs and the consequences of science, religion, capitalism~everything. The books of Bokonon were some of my absolute favorites, even though it was a ridiculous religion; it certainly contained many roots of truth. It is a very very fast read, I didn't want to put it down. However, you wanted to savor every word and think about every chapter. DO READ IT!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I enjoyed reading this short novel. Vonnegut satirizes everyone and everything. Read it for the satire on religion (Bokononism); read it for the satire on politics (San Lorenzo); and read it for the satire on education and the arts (&quot;keep looking at all the Xs but can't find the cat and can't find the cradle&quot;).I had the same enjoyment reading this as I had while viewing Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, and reading Heller's Catch-22, and reading Tom Robbins' novels."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Love this book and you say its a thrill ride of an apocolyptic adventure. Hate it, and its just another cheeky Sci-Fi farce. There is a lot of faux scientific gobbledygook to cut through, but there is also fine characters and funny scenes. Across the spectrum of his work, Vonnegut's glory comes in the stories he weaves from fantastic situations. He uses science fiction without being a Sci-Fi writer the same way Flaubert used romance but was not a writer of romantic novels. Vonnegut may not be the scholar's darling now, but he will be after his death. He is a true American stylist in the tradition of Twain and Nabakov. Cat's Cradle is among his best books. It is in the very American tradition of combining wit and innovative style with a solid storytelling."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"He created the religion of Bokonon,and I am now a follower.Something was using him as a vessel because Kurt was kind of a jerk as a human being,but boy could he write interesting books."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"My first Vonnegut. What a great writer. I recommend this to anyone who appreciates a book with good old fashioned quality sarcasm."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"As most Vonnegut writings, this book (one of his most famous along with Slaughterhouse Five), is a great story that makes you think about the possible destruction of the world and makes you think about life. Vonnegut is a genius"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is the second time I've read this story - the first time was when I was at university. I really enjoyed the book back then but now, free from the pressure of study, I've found it even more delightful. Read it if you like Black Humour with a dose of Science Fiction. Cat's Cradle has a special blend of tragedy and utter silliness that will keep you engaged to the bitter and ridiculous end - it leads the reader to think of the absurdities of human civilization and how the highest of ideals are most often brought undone by basic human weaknesses of character in both leaders and followers. The narrator is not preachy or judgemental because he fails to notice himself stumbling into the whole mess until it's too late - and then hindsight proves completely worthless. Cat's Cradle is a short novel and the chapters are brief, so it's a good book to read when you don't have much time. Despite its brevity the story is jam packed with interesting characters, important themes and absurd events - plus an actual hook."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Easy to read short story reviewing religion and society. A lot of things to consider through easily digestible format. I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If you've never read Vonnegut before, just search for his name and buy them all. I think Cat's Cradle is awesome- it will take you to places that you didn't even know you wanted to go and make you glad you went along for the ride. Several extremely funny parts (expected), great necessarily ridiculous plot, and sooo many memorable lines. Who else can insult religion, monarchy, midgets and a variety of races without being insulting?"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I read Slaughter House-5 in college and thought it was fun and goofy with a little humanistic existentialism thrown in to give it some depth. My reaction to Cat's Cradle now is similar, but I had not realized how pessimistically cynical Vonnegut was about our species. Yet, despite his doubt about our worth, Vonnegut did not give up on us.I have admired Vonnegut's personality as much as his writing. He struggled with depression, but managed to have a brilliant career. He survived the horror of the Dresden firebombing and turned his horror into inspiration for art. His Masters thesis was rejected by the University of Chicago, but he forgave the University and became a supporter (after the degree was granted for his literary accomplishments). He had a love/hate relationship with his hometown, and loved to lampoon and praise Hoosiers and Indianapolis in his books.In my one chance meeting with him, he tousled the hair of my two little boys and took it with grace and pleasure that we didn't know who he was.He once said in an interview that he'd rather laugh than cry, \\"because crying was so much more messy.\\"False Prophet, a Legal Thriller"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I come to Vonnegut late, as I plow through a long list of recommended books. I was pleasantly surprised by the economy of Vonnegut's prose, which, along with its sharp wit, deft plotting and wicked characterization, lends a sharp sting to the satire even half a century on. Other reviewers have cannily summarized the plot; I will add only that the new reader will find in concentrate here many ideas greatly diluted in Vonnegut's followers, not the least of which is the evident wisdom of Cat's Cradle's faux religion. The protagonist's cleverly shifting point of view veils but never completely obscures his writerly role, as it shifts from researcher, to reporter to fatalistic memoirist. Were it not for dated epithets regarding race and disability, CC might have been written yesterday."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I think it's been 30 years since I first read this book and for some reason was craving Vonnegut. It's time to start loading up, how I missed his clever and witty writing. Keenly insightful by using outlandish and bizarre scenarios. I can't wait to get another!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I really liked the beginning of this book and the setup. I thought Vonnegut did a great job of enticing the reader and in creating an atmosphere of mystique around what the main character was doing and researching to hook the reader. I thought it devolved in to an over the top story at the end, but I did enjoy it. I don't know if that's typical for Vonnegut or not to compare to other novels of his."},{"Title":"In Spite Of","review":"Victor McGlothin's &quot;In Spite Of&quot; is an excellent piece of reality unfortunately, that the Black Community has experienced for years.

Walter Mosley would be proud!"},{"Title":"In Spite Of","review":"I guess I'll be the dissenting voice here. I could not wait to put this book down. It was just plain bad.The characters came off as one-dimensional stereotypes with no real depth who could be easily summed up in five words or less. John Holloway was &quot;strong black man&quot;, the villain was &quot;evil racist white man&quot;, Nation of Islam- &quot;strong black men with suits&quot;, John's best friend-&quot;Player&quot; etc... While it's admirable to have a book featuring a &quot;strong black man&quot; to the extent that character is &quot;Mr. Perfect/Dudley Do-right&quot; he's not all that interesting.Moreover, I lost count of how many times the author used John's thoughts as a vehicle to preach his views of what's wrong with Black America and how it can be fixed. While I understand the desire convey some sense of morality in a character, it just felt a little heavy-handed to have some moral lesson being conveyed to the reader on every other page. I couldn't help but wonder if this book was targeted towards teenagers because of the constant and obvious soap-box preaching going on.As for the plot, why the author felt the need to make this an action novel I'm not sure. I felt like I was watching bad made for TV movie which from start to finish was obviously going to have a happy ending.Finally, setting this story in Dallas was interesting, however the details were somewhat superfluous. As a reader I don't need to know every single street name the characters travel on to really &quot;feel&quot; like this story is in Dallas. A little too obvious an attempt to &quot;Dallasize&quot; the story on the author's part in my opinion. One more thing, way too many typos and misspelled words for a real book."},{"Title":"In Spite Of","review":"'In Spite Of' is a great debut novel by author Victor McGlothin.

It takes us inside a small part of that history, not exposing too much and yet giving us a taste of what life must have been like for those who lived it.

Frantzman"},{"Title":"Ismene: The Journey Back","review":"The stories of the Greek myths have passed down to us for thousands of years: myths originally told around a fire and passed through the memory of generations before they were written down. Long after the last bard died, this particular legend of the enchanting young Ismene is told most beautifully again. For this reader, not knowing the legend, I read it as if it were the first time told, and I was around a fire at night thousands of years ago, listening to it chanted to a Greek harp. Another world opened to me.Ismene is the young, tragic daughter of Oedipus, hunted by the present king who wishes to extinguish her as the last living member of her family. Her protector sends her from his cave high in the mountains to the only place the king cannot find her: the world of Hell. There she finds the shades of her family but more, finds love with the god of death, Hades. This love affair is strange and wonderfully told. Send back again earth, she is now a stranger among the living who has many more adventures to live before she can join her beloved in the underworld.Erotic and lyrical, told in the simple manner of an ancient legend, the story unfolds page after page, in which the virginal girl becomes a woman. There is a wry humor in the tone of the living, the shades, and the immortal gods who find much to complain of in their present states and also some phrases of great beauty and mysticism.ISMENE belongs in every library for adults and literary adolescents, on private, public and school library shelves. We can hope the author will bring more legends from this ancient world to life so that we can, in our complicated lives, awaken the time when gods and men walked barefoot on the earth together, the wind and sea were mysteries, and the veil between the natural and the supernatural was blown away.The author is a playwright, poet and actress; this is her first published novel and grew out of a theater piece about Ismene; it was too short a piece to contain the whole story, so this book was fortunately born."},{"Title":"Ismene: The Journey Back","review":"Poor Ismene. The sole survivor of her once-proud-and-noble-now-disgraced family, she is being pursued by cruel Uncle Creon. Where to go? What to do? Advised by her friend and mentor, the blind prophet Tieresias, that her only hope lies in the Underworld, she agrees to undertake the perilous journey. She crosses the River Styx, disembarks, and finds a beautiful young woman rushing onto the boat and joyfully embracing her mother. It's Persephone, beginning her annual six-month reunion with Demeter and the earth.Entering the Kingdom of Death, Ismene finds the abandoned Hades lonely, mournful, and dejected. Remembering the scene at the boat landing, she realizes that although Hades has won the hand of Persephone, at least part-time, he did not win her heart. This insight leads to an unlikely love affair between the human in distress and the god in despair in the least romantic of all settings. Impossible? Not in the skillful hands of writer and playwright Christine Emmert. Somehow she convinces us that not only is romance possible in the Underworld, but it can soar to heights unimagined by mere humans.Part myth, part fantasy, this book can be read on many levels. Lovers of mythology will enjoy the what-if quality of extending a well-known myth, and lovers of fantasy will enjoy Emmert's use of strong visuals to enhance the setting. In addition, book club members could have a fine time exploring the possibilities for all of us who dare to set aside our fears and explore the darkness."},{"Title":"Ismene: The Journey Back","review":"ISMENE gives homage to Joseph Campbell who advised us to follow our bliss.

Who are the abos? The shoadw children? And are the hill men either of these, or something different? Like many of Wolfe's books, this is one that doesn't get boring or repetetive in time, it gets more and more fascinating. Each time you read it, you find a new piece to the puzzle."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"This set of 3 novellas that actually should be considered a novel is an intricate work that one can easily be submerged in. From the story of Number Five in the opening novella up to the search for the abos in the last, this masterwork of Gene Wolfe is characterized by a fascinating sense of uncertainty in his search for the meaning of what it is to be human."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"This book is just another example of Gene Wolfe's prowess at taking the human soul, converting it into alphabetica, and then deciphering the jumble of letters until they spell out the very thing that contrived them. This book leaves you feeling like that. You need to read it more then once. The best thing is, you'll want to."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"This is an amazing multi-layered work, so rich and complex that it rewards multiple re-readings. I pretty much believe that careful reading of this book will make you more intelligent. I've recommended it to dozens of people since I first read it. I feel kind of sorry for those who didn't enjoy it-to me, it would be a bit like being color-blind."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"Having read a few books by Gene Wolfe I find that his novels are almost always hauntingly memorable, the Fifth Head of Cerberus is no different. This book is divided into three stories, each approximately 100 pages long, covering the history and curiosities of the sister planets of Sainte Anne and Sainte Croix.The first novella tells the story of a young man coming of age on Sainte Croix, living in the brothel run by his father. As in many Gene Wolfe novels, the reader has to be attentive, and recognize discrepancies in the narrator&#8217;s story, which can lead to a more profound, overarching narrative hidden behind half-truths and offhanded observations. This storytelling mechanism is only expanded upon in the next two stories, the second a vision quest taken by a native of Sainte Croix, and the third an anthropologic journey undertaken by a foreign scientist. The three stories, when interpreted as a whole, paint an interesting picture of the twin planets. Gene Wolfe leaves the reader to solve the planets' mysteries.The symbolism is strong, the story memorable, and the secrets discovered through a careful reading can be very rewarding."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"An earlier piece from Wolfe that manages to be at once both accessible and complex, with the story making more sense as one works through the novellas. It is essentially a Faulkner book with science fiction themes. It may well be Wolfe's finest work."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"The Fifth Head of Cerberus by Gene Wolfe was published in the early 1970s. Still fresh and way ahead of it's time. I've read almost all of Gene Wolfe's work (the Sun series) and this is now one of my favorites! The story will stay with you. Reading Wolfe is like reading a sci-fi James Joyce novel ala Finnigans Wake. Cerberus is comprised of 3 novellas that are tied to the same story involving a missing race of shape shifters who assumed the identities of the early settlers of a planet. The first story only touches on this very slightly but is a great read about a young man who finds out his true identity and where he meets the protagonist Dr. John Marsch who is doing research on the elusive aliens. The second story is way out there and is the most surreal. Written by Dr. Marsch, the story speaks of the shapeshifters. Told as if in a dream like state, bringing you into their belief system and mythos (i'd like to see an interpretation of this if available.) The third story at this point, involves our hero who is inhumanely imprisoned. The intelligent Dr. Marsch is arrested and interrogated by the fascist governement in power (very Orwellian). The story brings everything together (via flashback and interrogation), clarifying the previous two novellas in a way that makes the third story compelling, thrilling and heartbreaking all at once. The book particularly the 3rd novella, imho addresses tyranny by a political instrumentality that resonates to this day. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"I have a love/hate relationship with the works of Gene Wolfe... I'm sure this isn't uncommon among science fiction readers. I love linear and elegant plots, but I'm also fond of florid prose, plot backtracking, and red herrings. Gene Wolfe provides much of this and for that I'm thankful, but some of the passages (much like some of his short stories) are unfathomable, needlessly laden with mythological allegory and context. I've never been a reader of mythology; this one point turns me off to some of his work and parts of this novel. And if you know anything about Gene Wolfe, while his writing is beautiful, he's rarely ever straight to the point (allowing the reader to draw their own conclusions - clever at times, annoying on other occasions).Written in 1972, Gene Wolfe expanded the novella \\"The Fifth Head of Cerberus\\" into a novel by including the last two novellas. Each novella has its own characters, one straight story with tiers of complexity, another story saturated in impenetrable allegories, and the last story structured around the scaffolding of \\"found-footage.\\"(1) The Fifth Head of Cerberus - 5/5 - A nameless narrator reflects on his childhood upon the French colonized planet of Sainte Croix, which shares a solar orbit with its sister-planet Sainte Anne. Reclusively living in his father's mansion/bordello, the narrator/to-be-named Number Five learns from an \\"unbound simulator\\" with his brother David. As Number Five ages and meets his love interest, the pair begin to stage plays for public viewing, but soon find themselves short of cash. Reflecting on the borderline torture Number Five is receiving by his father, the two concoct a plan. (71 pages) ----- Such an excellent novella for its portrait of a decaying colony, the rich yet mysterious history regarding the settlers, and the ballet of emotion between the characters. What impressed me most, however, was the way Wolfe challenged my cognitive grasp of the plot, forcing me to reverse the polarity of my viewpoint, by allowing me to sink through layers of chaotic deception and yanking me straight back to the calm surface of awe. Very impressed!(2) \\"A Story,\\" by John V. Marsch - 3/5 - John Sandwalker is traveling on foot in search for the high priest, a hermit in the hills of Thunder Always. Befriending the natives of the planet, John Sandwalker is allowed into the communal circles of the Shadow children, hearing their songs and their tales. John's twin brother Eastwind captures John and the Shadow's and throws them into a sand prison where others are indentured, awaiting execution in the river for Eastwind's clan's feast. (57 pages) ----- I wasn't following the logic or allegory of the first half of the novella at all. It felt too much like Delany'sThe Einstein Intersection, with felt lost in its own plane of existence; nothing felt connected, nothing felt relevant, nothing felt tactile. Only in the last half do hypotheses come to light, suggestions are delicately put forward, and good amount of guesswork leaves the reader their own paradigm of truth behind the planet, its people, and its lost inhabitants.(3) V.R.T. - 4/5 - An interrogator on Sainte Anne fingers through material collected in regards to the incident involving the earth-born anthropologist, John Marsch. Transcripts of interrogation, excerpts from John's scribomania, journal entries from John's trek on Sainte Croix... all interspersed with interrogator's thoughts about his review. (108 pages) ----- I'm a huge fan of \\"found-footage\\" type stories with peripheral yet relevant data, like in John Brunner'sThe Sheep Look Upor Filbrun'sGemini Rising. The history of the case is detailed and adds a distinct flavor to the end of the novel, which leaves the reader with one of two paradigms regarding WHO Number Five is, who John Marsch is, and what ever happened to those reportedly transmogrifying native inhabitants."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"... shorter-length science fiction books I have ever read. The world was very well put together; I truly felt as though I was stepping into an eerie, mysterious place, and thoroughly enjoyed the trip. This is a beautifully written book, and very puzzle-like. It is a good book to introduce people to Wolfe as well, since it touches on the style and ideas found throughout his later works (tricky first-person narration, stories-within-stories, puzzles and hidden \\"clues\\", etc.). Highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"I first read this novella in high school and knew by page five Gene Wolfe was the most brilliant writer I'd ever encountered, in any genre. I just re read it for the fifth time and find it more impressive as my palate has matured. It ages like a fine wine with ever passing year, as do most of his longer pieces I wish Mr. Wolfe were thirty years old so we could look forward to dozens more of the same."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"Gene Wolfe's _5th Head of Cerberus_ was originally published in 1972. The Orb Books / Tom Doherty Associates re-issue is paperbound on acid-free paper. The first of the three novellas originally appeared in Damon Knight's 1972 _Orbit_ anthology; Wolfe dedicated the book to Knight.Wolfe manipulates the reader's point of view in a three headed story that examines the themes of Personal Identity and Self-Knowledge. Wolfe is particularly adept at looking outward from within the minds of his characters, and the structure of the intertwined novellas is calculated to capitalize on this strength. The protagonist in the first novella resonates with the same qualities of dispassionate narrative that Severian uses to relate his story in the more richly-developed world of the _Shadow of the Torturer_. The second novella is a story within a story that follows the form of Wolfe's early other-worlds narratives. The third novella reminds us a bit of the fragmented introspection typical of _The Doctor of Death Island_.The behaviorial sciences -- anthropology, sociology, and psychology -- form the template of the book's ideas, but Wolfe weaves many dark threads into his tapestry: a revered house of prostitution, five generations of self-cloning, a close approximation of a replicated personality, slavery, murder, cannibalism, infant kidnapping, tribal warfare, racial genocide, colonial conquest, and an imputed identity theft.Wolfe's fine writing style is a consistent delight for the thinking reader, filled with multiple layered symbols, metaphors, and wit."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"Gene Wolfe is difficult to praise highly enough without sounding unconvincing. One can urge people to read his work, claim that he's one of the greatest living writers in the English language regardless of genre (indeed, perhaps the greatest), one can ramble on about his virtues for hours to friends and strangers, and in the end, to those who have not read him, the claims start to sound unhinged, even deranged. \\"Aren't you overselling him just a tad?\\" they inevitably ask.To this I can only say: read some of his work and see. \\"The Fifth Head of Cerberus\\" is perhaps the best place to start, not because it is his easiest work (it is not), but because is both fairly compact and an example of Wolfe at his best. The commitment is smaller than if you launch in to the Latro books, or \\"The Book of the New Sun\\", but the joy to be had on reading is no smaller. You will know soon enough if Wolfe is, for you, all that his admirers say he is. I say \\"for you\\" because taste in literature is inevitably personal, and perhaps you will find that Wolfe is not what you are seeking. Perhaps, however, you will find that he is, and if so, you have a wonderful treat awaiting you.I suggest that you not read any review of this book that describes the plot. In fact, I suggest that, if you choose to buy the book, you avoid reading overly much about it, looking at the cover image, or reading the back cover copy. None of them will improve your experience of the text. No summary will do you any good, anyway. I could explain the plot of in a couple of moments, and it would in no way convey the pleasure that reading it will bring to you. In fact, knowing anything about the plot at all will explain nothing about why you want to read it, and might, in fact give one precisely the wrong impression about why one would want to read it.Wolfe is said to have claimed \\"my definition of good literature is that which can be read by an educated reader, and reread with increased pleasure.\\" \\"The Fifth Head of Cerberus\\" is, by that standard, some of the very best literature there is. Immediately after I first read the book, I was driven to read it again. I have since re-read it perhaps five or six times over the course of many years, and each time I find both that understand the book better, and that, like a bottle of incredible wine, aging has only improved the content.I would normally be reluctant to give five stars to any work, but not in this case. Can this book really compete with, say, \\"Moby Dick\\", or \\"Hamlet\\", or \\"Lolita\\", or \\"Ulysses\\" in the canon of great literature? I claim yes, it does. See for yourself.I will close with a few remarks to serve someone newly encountering Wolfe's work. He is a master craftsman, and makes few if any mistakes in shaping the intricate puzzle boxes he hands to his readers. Every sentence in a book has been placed there for a reason. No detail of character, setting or action is described thoughtlessly, and no detail will be described to you twice. Wolfe does not telegraph his motives or paint a summary on a billboard -- he expects a thoughtful reader. That said, I discourage you from treating his works as mystery stories or as a game to be solved. They are not. You should not be attempting to commit each line to memory, and should not try to drain every last bit of meaning from them on first reading. You will not succeed, and it will serve no purpose. Instead, dive in, enjoy the elegant prose, hang on to the galloping story as it carries you forward, and marvel at the form of the whole as you reach the end. When you inevitably wonder about something you may have missed, worry not -- you can and will enjoy the work even more on re-reading."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"This book is, quite simply, brilliant, especially if you like sophisticated puzzles. The three tales, each of which stands on its own, intertwine in mysterious ways to lay out a fourth, untold story. I've never seen anything else like it, and it stands up to repeated readings. In fact, you'll want to read it several times to catch all the hidden clues and meanings that Wolfe has scattered through the book (and they're NOT revealed at the end... you have to find them yourself). Just brilliant."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"Fifth Head of Cerberus is one of the finest examples of misdirection in literature. Three novellas with only loose connections combine to tell a story that is never explicitly present in the book. When you are done, you understand a story that was never there on the page. The art and subtlety of the story telling is both profound and overwhelming.One of the few books that compares is Samuel Delaney's The Einstein Intersection, although there is also some commonality with Durrell's Alexandria Quartet. Fifth Head is possibly the finest writers' book around."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"I haven't read a book this good, in any genre, in a long time. Very challenging and thought provoking reading, but not for readers who are looking to simply be entertained. Now I know why, at age 13, I was unable to get through Wolfe's The Shadow of the Torturer when it was originally published--both books are tough reads for inexperienced or casual readers, but rewarding if one reads carefully. I'm glad I've given Wolfe another chance, after seeing so many passionate references to his books over the years."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"In the first novella, the familiar voice of Severian appears in full bloom. It was so comforting and familiar to join with this world weary narrator that I had grown so close to in the New Sun series. The events recounted in the story were almost secondary to my pleasure at being with that voice again. The second novella reminded me of R.A. Laferty's best anthropological expositions and is a magnificent centre piece. The third novella is Kafkaesque and does create some connections with the first two stories though many questions are left unanswered and many postulates are left unexplored. I want a sequel but since Wolfe has not produced one in the intervening thirty-five years, I doubt there will ever be one. So it goes."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"Easily one of the most creative, well-written works I've ever read.

The Fifth Head of Cerberus is a novel with some serious literary intentions. Many (most?) fans aren't really keen on that when they pick up an sf novel.But I would like to comment about the many reviews that claim this book is difficult, that it requires repeated readings, that it has many possible interpretations. (BTW, if you want to get someone interested in a book, don't tell him that he has to read it several times to understand it!)Wolfe's narrative style is not opaque or contorted. It is straightforward and elegant throughout. It does switch scenes, sometimes frequently, to tell the reader what the other characters are up to, and it does go back and forth in time, to some extent. These are techniques to which any reader of any genre of fiction in the 21st century is well-accustomed.Be that as it may, The Fifth Head of Cerberus is a mystery novel, in this case a speculative anthropological mystery. Like many mystery novels, it includes a number of riddles whose solutions intertwine. The most fundamental is how the societies of the fictive planets reached their very peculiar current condition. The solutions are not spelled out for the reader in the courtroom denouement of a traditional detective novel, though they are finally revealed by means of a legal evidentiary investigation. There is one solution (the \\"fourth story\\" mentioned by some reviewers) that explains the intertwined enigmas. A plethora of alternatives is neither required nor possible. The reader can gradually come to know the fourth story by means of clues scattered liberally on almost every page of the other three. The most important clues are repeated, often several times, and well signalled. Others are cleverly or clumsily dropped by the wayside. Nothing is wasted. Every sentence has significance. An unexplained or puzzling remark or occurrence is a signal of something that will assume importance later.The mystery (or mysteries) can be solved easily on a single reading. One has to be awake to detail, keep in mind obvious clues, and should probably pause now and then to mull over what might solve the riddles currently in play, what explanations might work, what is the evidence pro and con: like reading a detective novel. Still, several reviewers have insightfully pointed out that the \\"fourth story\\" of the triad (i.e the various mysteries' explication) is not found on the printed page but is carefully constructed by the author in the alert reader's imagination. By the end, the reader has all the information he needs to share the author's vision of the history of his planets and characters.Though the story and the anthropological speculation behind it make for an enjoyable and moving tale, The Fifth Head of Cerberus contains some philosophic themes that run deeper than the mysterious plot. Every part of the narrative illustrates or exemplifies these more profound themes. Wolfe does not make philosophical statements but ruminates, always employing the narrative and characters, always \\"showing rather than telling\\".Other reviewers have discussed most of these themes, but have neglected the most important, that is, the moral character and behavior of the novel's people and animals (and machines). I have been told that always at the forefront of Wolfe's writing is morality, the moral dimension of his subject matter. If so, The Fifth Head of Cerberus is no exception. The foundational characteristic of Wolfe's imagined world is that the physical and mental parts of all its living beings are malleable and transferable. Every character embodies the moral strategies and behaviors called forth by this psychophysical (inter-)changeability. By our standards, all three protagonists are amoral members of amoral societies, yet their lives are undergirded by inescapable ethical infrastructures. Some reviewers have asked what the novel is about. I answer. It is about morality, ethics in an invented world and in our own. Morality in extreme circumstances is what each of the three narratives and the triad as a whole are about. And again, not a sentence is wasted.The Fifth Head of Cerberus was published at the time when genetic engineering and cloning technology had only begun to break down the boundaries of our physical identity. Today, the book should be recommended reading for any seminar in Speculative Ethics. (Or Speculative Anthropology, if there should be such a discipline!)"},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"Wolfe delivers three unique tales spanning two planets, which examine the notion of identity. As always, the characterizations are subtle and convincing, and Wolfe leaves the reader with plenty of food for thought. The futuristic aspects are almost off-handedly (but never less than expertly) scrawled in the background, providing a suitable stage and setting for the story, without intruding unduly on the author's real focus."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"Gene Wolfe's 'The Fifth Head of Cerberus' is three linked novellas, although the nature of the link isn't clear until the last story. This was not as difficult a read as I found Wolfe's later 'The Book of the New Sun' to be. Although I greatly enjoyed that series, I always had the feeling I was missing a lot of what was going on under the surface. 'The Fifth Head of Cerberus, although still somewhat opaque (especially the second story), is much more straight forward. In this case the answers are ambiguous but at least I felt I knew what the question was."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"You're about two-thirds of the way through the third novella when you see how the entire edifice of this magnificent novel comes together. My understanding is that after Damon Knight showed the title piece (which he had originally published in one of his Orbit anthologies) to a New York editor, Wolfe was asked if he would write two more to make it a book. The subtlety of the prose, vivid depiction of all the characters and the setting most of all will haunt your imagination long after you've closed the book.And, of course, tease you to read it again for even more insight as soon as you can...."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"As one expects from Wolfe, this is a first-class, three-part sci-fi novel that merits rereading.

They called it the best science fiction ever written ... far better than Asimov.Forget it. Favorable reviews call it &quot;subtle&quot;; &quot;disjointed&quot; suits far better. The story isn't particularly interesting, it doesn't qualify as literature by any stretch and the joke about the dog guarding the gates of Hades is pathetically juvenile.Don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"Out of the many, many fine books Gene Wolfe has done, this is probably considered his greatest single novel (as opposed to the Long Sun, Short Sun, etc series, all of which deserve their critical acclaim) due to its richness and complexity. People looking for an easy way to break into Wolfe's writing won't find it in this book, he piles on the head hurtin' stuff pretty early and it doesn't let up, adding layer upon layer of meaning and detail to the point where the reader cannot ignore it, you have to spend time actively interepreting the novel or reading it becomes a wasted effort. Such is the genius of Wolfe and of not taking the easy way out. The novel actually consists of three fairly separate novellas and while Wolfe could have devised some vague basic linkage and taken three novellas and dumped this arbitrary linkage over them and been done with it, he goes way further than that. The novellas are all different, but they're also all connected in some way, either through offhand scenes or subtle clues or overarching themes or perhaps all of that and more. There's a reason for nearly everything done in the book, from the placement of the novellas to the order of events happening in each section, heck, even the titles are chosen for specific reasons that resonate within the structure as a whole. The first novella sets the scene, a pair of sister planets orbiting each other, colonized by man, and rumored to have once been home to a race of shapeshifters who may have been so good at shapeshifting that they took humanity's place and then promptly forgot they did (the &quot;copy is not the original, or is it?&quot; argument), one of the ideas explored throughout the novel is this question of identity, whether the human race has really been replaced and if so, do the new people count as humans since they're like them in every way. And would anyone even notice? This is not typical SF stuff and it's not told in a typical SF way, for every nuance that I &quot;got&quot; I'm sure a hundred more went over my head, this is a book that demands rereading and is so far from the &quot;So, Zolgar, we meet again&quot; type of SF that fans of literate, intelligent novels will want to jump up and cheer. For all the literary tricks in the novel, it never comes off as pretentious, Wolfe is exploring real themes with real resonance and it all works with the scheme of the novel, none of it can be confused with arty indulgence. Still kind of in print (most bookstores seem to carry at least one copy) it's an excellent introduction to Wolfe, since the longer series can be a bit overwhelming, but again, don't think you're getting off easy. Smaller doesn't mean simpler and shorter doesn't mean less work is involved. People who demand a little more effort from their book and want more than simple entertainment, regardless of genre, should give this a look."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS, Gene Wolfe's first book-length work of note, is a collection of three seemingly unrelated novellas that are, at the close of the third, shown to be cunningly interlinked. The first novella, \\"The Fifth Head of Cerberus\\", was published in one of Damon Knight's Orbit anthologies in 1974, while the latter two were written and published together to expand the themes and plot of the first. The setting of it all is Sainte Anne and Saint Croix, two sister planets revolving around a common center of gravity in a far-away solar system, colonized first by Frenchmen and later occupied (in a brutal fashion, it is hinted) by later waves of English-speaking colonists. Before men arrived, legend goes, Sainte Anne was inhabited by an indigenous race of shapeshifters, which humans wiped out. Or did the aboriginals wipe out the colonists, imitating them so faithfully that they forgot their own origins? The novellas touch upon many themes of post-colonial theory.In the first novella, a young man grows up in a strangely sheltered environment on Saint Croix, discovering at last the secrets of his scientist father's work. Here, the aboriginal inhabitants of the sister planet are only briefly mentioned, but the plot has much more local concerns. The second novella \\"'A Story' by John V. Marsch\\" is inevitably confusing to first-time readers, and initially seems unrelated to the first. It is the story of an adolescent's initiation to manhood in a primitive society, a dreamquest that brings him across a bizarre landscape and introducing him to various tribes espousing peculiar religious beliefs. In the third novella, \\"V.R.T.\\" a bureaucrat on Saint Croix goes over the diaries of an imprisoned anthropologist. Again, it seems a complete change of direction with little to link it to the first two, but by the end a story arc spanning the three novellas is revealed. THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS is an excellent example of Wolfe's love for mysteries, some revealed so casually the reader might easily miss it, and others so deeply buried that it may take several tries for the author to find the key. This all gives the book excellent re-read value. And here one can see the genesis of the techniques that Wolfe used in later works, such as his masterpiece The Book of the New Sun.The narrative here is so ingeniously constructed that I would recommend THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS to any lover of literature, even those that are usually wary of anything called science-fiction. Wolfe's novel PEACE, published a year later, continues this strong writing and is also highly recommend, and its plot might be attractive to a more general audience."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"When I originally read this book, I had trouble making it through the first of the three novellas. I wasn't prepared for Wolfe's many layers, and thus missed a great deal of symbolism and hidden meaning.When I came back to this book and read the final two novellas, something clicked and I realized how beautiful and subtle a writer Wolfe is, filled with ideas. The stories are interpretable many ways, and thus with each reading of them I find myself thinking more and more, and enjoying the book more and more.For anyone who is interested in the deeper meanings of Wolfe's works, I would suggest searching the Internet Public Library for criticism on him, specifically the Post-Colonial thought found throughout the novellas in Fifth Head of Cerberus.Get this and all of Gene Wolfe's works."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"Three seperate stories, which when completed, reveal a fourth hideen story that proves to be as perplexing as the other three. While none of the three stories are directly connected in any major way, one character travels through the first and third, and is the author (apparently) of the second.These stories do not directly tell the reader the truth behind the mystery of the abos, indeed, only the third is directly related to the search for them. Yet, we find ourselves catching glimpses of hints of them, hiding here and there.In the first story, a character is accused as an abo. Initally this is discounted - the character doign the accusing has an ulterior motive, of which the reader is well aware. Yet in the third story, the accused is revisited, and having read this third story - I am no longer sure.Who was an abo? Were they all abos? Or no? Did the abos intermingle witht he human populace to such a degree that they forgot themselves? Did some humans, seeking to return to a simpler form of life, become the Free People, the term the abos call themselves? Did the abos ever exist?While the book doesnt provoke any of these thoughts while reading it, in retrospect and rumination - it provides a thought-provoking read. If humanity met a shape-changing species that took on our form - how would we tell ourselves from them? Would there be any difference?A great book."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"Gene Wolfe seldom tackles genuinely &quot;new&quot; science-fictional ground. Clones, shapeshifters, colonized planets, genocide, &quot;uploaded&quot; intelligences, and the other SF tropes of this masterfully interwoven set of three novellas are often-visited ground. But only Wolfe brings the intensity of vision and nuanced, complex, evocative, winding prose of Proust, the nightmarish flagellation of the soul of Kafka, the moral clarity and sympathy of, well, Gene Wolfe to bear--not so much &quot;talking about&quot; these ideas as using these ideas to go deeper and to examine the nature of identity, self, guilt and knowledge. Wolfe is not guilty, however, of the sin of using his created worlds merely as metaphors for our current conditions; rather, Wolfe grounds his insights, which are universal, in the concrete conditions of a fictional reality, as only the best writers manage--to neither be idealistic nor materialist, but rather, Incarnational."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"I liken another of Gene Wolfe's works, The Book of the New Sun, to the myriad pieces of a mosaic that have been jumbled and have no mortar to hold them together. There are pretty bits and pieces but no overall impression that emerges from it. The stories in The Fifth Head of Cerberus, however, are more like three paintings -- a triptych, as it were. Each brush stroke is thoughtfully applied, revealing only as much as Wolfe wants us to see. The synergism of the three stories -- between the slight overlaps of theme, character and location -- becomes entrancing.The key to why this works is focus. Each tale has a unique story structure. Each of the three has a different voice and perspective. Symbolism and allusion are used sparingly and well, enmeshed with Wolfe's imagery to add depth to the stories. There is an attention to detail that fleshes out the stories convincingly, giving them a distinct sense of place.In the title story, Wolfe describes a melancholy world of decaying grandeur where the humans make your skin crawl and the most sympathetic character is a machine.The second tale is in some ways the strongest entry and in others the weakest. The imagery is lyrical and haunting, told in an intriguing folkloric style. I enjoyed the issues of identity and consciousness Wolfe raises, and the elliptical change in subject to convey these. But, unrelated to this theme, he peppers throughout the story awkward sentence structure and the use of vague pronouns. This seems to be intentional, as if Wolfe enjoys these little mental misdirections. It pulls me out of the experience of the story and so detracts from the work, though not greatly.In my favorite of the three, Wolfe lets us peer over the shoulder of an officer and read the private journals of one of his prisoners, presenting them to us out of chronological order so that important hints are dropped in the most careful way, culminating in a clever conundrum: is he really what we think he is or merely mad from long confinement? It's rewarding fun to fit these puzzle pieces together.All in all, Wolfe delivers enough of a payoff to be satisfying, and yet keeps the reader wanting more -- in just the correct proportions to be both entertaining and thought provoking."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"How does one even begin to describe The Fifth Head of Cerebrus. Needless to say, very few authors have ever had a first novel that good. In fact, very few authors have ever written any novel that good. A lot of people found the book strange and complicated...well so did I, and that's the whole allure of this book.Mr. Wolfe has an amazing imagination, as you will immediately see upon reading any of his novels. Fifth Head is filled with haunting visions of a distant colony in the far future; technology is advanced in some areas but antiquated in many others. The society and culture are masterfully rendered.The second novella is about a young man finding his twin; the viewpoint of these people is so strange and alien that I should have quickly become confused or bored. And yet I didn't; such was Wolfe's mastery of the writing style. No matter how strange things got, you read right along as if you had no other option.The third novella consists of a military captain reading a prisoner's diary, returning to the society of the first novella. Again, the pure imagination is astounding. The characters seem like real, tangible people, not prefabricated creations placed down for our amusement. They are real people coping with impossibly strange situations.If you're looking for a good book to read, then read The Fifth Head of Cerebrus. No, it's not light reading, but it's worth every minute. After reading this book, I immediately became a Wolfe fan. Great, amazing stuff.Oh, and if you liked this book, I recommend Frank Herbert's &quot;Dune&quot; and Dan Simmons' &quot;Hyperion.&quot; These books also have outlandish and amazing scenes, worlds, people, technology, etc."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"Like a Flatlander getting to explore a tesseract, this novel will at first leave you scratching your head in bewilderment. What really happened? Do the three novellas contained within FHoC truly interlock, other than sharing a few characters? Do so many of the baroque, seemingly oblique character descriptions have a deeper meaning? These and more questions arise until at last you're forced to realize that a two dimensional, linear plot analysis won't yield a satisfying interpretation.So, as is often the case with the fiction of Wolfe, subsequent readings are a must. Dusting off chips of clues picked up in the last two novellas to fill in cracks in the first, and vice versa, you begin to see that all is not as it first appeared. Yes, the novellas interlock; yes, the descriptions are highly relevant. And, your idea of what really happened is likely to change with each of several readings.Wolfe was quoted as saying (roughly) that good fiction may be defined as that which yields greater reward upon subsequent reading. If this idea of re-reading a book puts you off, this one is not for you. In fact, this could be said of most of Wolfe's work. His attention to detail, use of arcane etymology in deriving character, place, and object names, and subtle refusal to bow to the now standard requirement of a Hollywood wrap-up speech at the end to recapitulate and explain everything you've just read -- well, let's just say that Wolfe's work doesn't lend itself to \\"airport\\" reading.FHoC is multi-faceted, and although later works such as the Sun series are quite entertaining even at the surface, this novel lacks such fine lapping and as such isn't as rewarding if a certain amount of thinking isn't attempted by the reader.FHoC gives the reader a glistening of some of Wolfe's earlier ideas that were later incorporated into the stories that have been given greater acclaim. This is a must-read for hardcore fans of the Sun series. You'll see the genesis of some of Wolfe's New Sun philosophies diffracted throughout this novel, along with a refinement of his unreliable narrator technique.If you did happen to find this book in an airport, it was likely put there by mistake. Put it back, grab the Stephen King, and enjoy your flight. King writes himself into his own novels, too, but with so much less tact."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"Science fiction as a genre is a useful place for Wolfe to explore the theme of uncertain and time-dependent identity, because the reader only knows as much about the setting as the book lets on. Understanding of Saint Anne and Saint Croix, the twin planets on which the three novellas of the \\"Fifth Head\\" takes place, requires us to take an analytical approach: perhaps as a psychologist or anthropologist (there is one mad psychologist and two anthropologists to show us the way). After re-reading the first novella, I think that the real enthusiasm of Wolfe was to show how limited the characters' understanding of their world is; and the surprises that come up are subtly foreshadowed in the first story. This is following in the footsteps of the good (and often great) Jack Vance.Wolfe goes beyond what Vance has done (at least in the Vance books that I've read) in using allusions and indirect points of view to enrich the story. By allusions I refer to the tie-in to the Book of Revelations in the first part and the resemblence to Conrad in the last part. Indirect points of view are used in all three novellas: childhood memories drive the first (and the most enjoyable) novella, the middle novella is a recitation of a (fraudulently) indiginous inhabitant of Saint Anne to an anthropologist, and the last novella is a mixture of writings of the same (?) anthropologist in a scrambled time-order.Wolfe presents Vail's hypothesis and lets us decide whether or not it's true - the shifting identities throughout the book create what appears to be a complex puzzle to which the answer might be buried in the details. In this way, Wolfe shows just how difficult contemporary science is: in order to find something new and useful about nature, one has to rely on the validity of a mountain of past observations and reasonings. Often,there's no real certainty about the most fundamental things that the sciences are built upon.Some of the reviews of this book centered on messages Wolfe may have been sending about colonies and the treatment of indiginous populations. I'm thinking that anthropology and psychology (two sciences going under radical changes around the time of first publication, 1972) were not devices, but the purpose of \\"Fifth Head.\\"One does not have to be scientist, obviously, to appreciate the complexities of the book, but it helps to understand how equivocal some of the fundamental questions were being addressed in the \\"human\\" sciences at the time. How should we raise our children? Where did we come from? Who came to North America first? These days, genetics are revolutionizing and (apperently) clearing away a lot of the fog surrounding these basic questions: something like Vail's hypothesis would get answered very quickly by a gene chip. It's much more difficult now to imprison somebody with purely circumstantial evidence with the availability of DNA testing. I give my highest recommendation to read Wolfe's novel, as well as re-reading of the first part. \\"Fifth Head\\" may serve as a classic reminder of the natural world, as was understood, before the genome revolution."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"I'm not a huge sci-fi fan so I wasn't sure I would like this one. I finished it in awe, thinking this might be the greatest living author, and a relative unknown, in the back-waters of sci-fi. The book is atmospherically sinister, intricate and complex with an unreliable narrator. Rereading helps, but it's not like a Rubik's cube, complicated with one solution. You can narrow it down to several possible alternatives, but that is all.What I found equally fascinating is how some on the Net interpret this novel. They take the theme of \\"shape shifting\\" too seriously, in a sci-fi sense -- i.e. people who can really imitate any human form they like. The novel leads you down this path, but you do not have to read the \\"shape shifting\\" this way. It might be simply a myth the conquering people have of the \\"natives\\", who are now lost, but once had \\"magic\\" powers. Again, sci-fi markers can be unreliable as well.I tried other books by Wolfe, but they were too slow or dark, and short stories are not his best format. But this guy is a master, in or out of sci-fi. But cerebral, definitely."},{"Title":"THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS - Signed","review":"A huge disappointment. Another \\"serious\\" sci-fi novel that makes everything opaque and tedious and intentionally baffling so no one will mistake it for \\"kid-stuff\\".

Part one is the least annoying (that's not saying much). Part two is narrated in pseudo hippy-dippy Native American Cosmic-Speak. Part 3 is set mostly in a cartoonish, unintentional parody of a hellish prison, run by the evillest of evil evil-guys (including imperious slave owners who are often French- Haw!).

These are an excellent way to discover painters you don't know about yet, and I've enjoyed working my way through the series. This volume on Joan Miro features a text by Janis Mink.Mink charts Miro's stylistic evolution in a clear fashion, often mentioning relationships with other artists and writers of the day that influenced his work. The break from realism to fanciful representation is elucidated, and Mink really inspires a passion for deciphering Miro's language of symbols. Nonetheless, I felt that Mink's text had two weakness. The first is that it often makes reference to paintings that, perhaps for reasons of copyright, could not be reproduced within the book. Entries in the \\"Basic Art\\" series are usually entirely self-contained, but Mink would force the reader to seek out another introduction to Miro to understand her writing. The second weakness is that Mink does not say anything about Miro's relationship with the Spanish state in the postwar era, something that would surely interest many readers who know of Miro as \\"the Catalan national painter\\".Nonetheless, these are essentially minor quibbles.

After presenting background information on P/E ratios, the historical real returns of the S&P500 are presented versus its P/E ratio. The near linear relationship shows that when P/Es are high, ie prices are high, real returns are low. One feature of dollar cost averaging is to buy more shares when prices are low; however, investors can improve upon this by considering the P/E ratio to increase their periodic purchases when P/Es are low and decrease them when it is high.

In spite (or because?) of the author's extensive academic background, she is able to convey facts about a wide variety of subjects related to the UFO/ET phenomena in a creative, story-like style. Most books I've read in this genre were dry and merely interesting. This one's fun! What I really appreciated was her honesty. If certain material was speculative, she said so. If an idea was her own, she claimed it. It is evident she did a lot of research, yet she does so much more than merely review and recite. She forms her own conclusions, which are fresh and sound. Writing style is clear and concise. She is able to transition to new points and topics with relative ease, weaving it together with the underlying theme of the book - the \\"Wizard of Oz mysteries\\" - esoteric truths about the symbolism in that story and how it relates to the material in her book. She reveals connections not ordinarily discerned and her insight sheds much needed light on controversial issues. She gives an in-depth analysis of the principles of occultism, and even gives out a technique for individual practice so that the reader can experience firsthand the reality and effectiveness of this engaged spirituality. This preliminary material forms a strong foundation for what comes next - an overview of the evolution of the esoteric mystery traditions and how they're tied into the UFO/ET phenomena. Why this information is important and how it relates to the reader is thoroughly explored psychologically, sociologically, and spiritually. An entire chapter is devoted to the workings of what she calls the \\"muddlers\\" -- a shadowy corporate/governmental oligarchy - how it maintains control and spins the wheel of disinformation and what we can do about it. She explains that they need not resort to conspiracy or secret societies to do this -- it's all done through mainstream politics and economics and she shows how. Finally, she explores at length the little-known physiology of awareness and effects of music and how we can use this fascinating knowledge to heal and strengthen ourselves, leading to a better understanding of each other and meaningful extraterrestrial contact. Very down to earth, she excels in translating supportive scientific studies into layman's terms. Her main message is self-empowerment, that spiritual enlightenment is anchored in the heart - not the head, and ends the book on a compassionate and positive note. Overall, this must be one of the most original books I've ever read. I found it to be empowering, uplifting, and incredibly comprehensive. I only wished she'd included more diagrams. Still, at a whopping 654 pages, it's a lot of bang for your buck.

It is one of the classics of the original suffragette era, and has a wonderful title role in it. Cheerier than Edith Wharton, Zona Gale nevertheless shared some of Wharton's incisive social satire as well as a great heart for human dignity and courage. For even a tro-upon \\"old maid\\" like Lulu Bett can suddenly rear up and take command of her own life as she does in this book. The things she has to put up with are so awful, and what's hreatbreaking is to think that the life she leads is just typical of unmarried women of the day. She is really nothing but a slave in the household of some people who are no better than she is, only they're married so that makes them better than she is automatically, under the legal and social codes of the day. While reading through Lulu's struggles I was also reminded of Dorothy Parker's wit and expansive humor, though Parker was apparently incapable of extending herself to the length of a whole novel: a new reader might think of \\"Miss Lulu Bett\\" as the novel Parker might have written with a wee bit more self-discipline and less gin.Barbara Solomon and Eileen Panetta provide a sensible introduction that gives us something of the flavor of Gale's unique personality, sketching in the background of the literary scene in which Gale took such a prominent place. And they do their best to explain why she was so quickly forgotten, even her best selling Pulitzer Prize winning works hardly a memory any longer.On the other hand, \\"Selected Stories\\" is a little bit of a misnomer or if not a misnomer, a rip off, since only four stories are included! This from a writer whose short stories are among the best of the 20th century! One story alone, \\"The Need\\" is so beautifully and starkly written it might have fit into one of Willa Cather's collection. It tells the story of a suburban couple newly installed in a tight little town where they don't know anyone, and the husband orders the wife to throw a party, only she can't think of anyone to invite, and there's the rub. Sounds simple doesn't it, but Gale takes this unpromising material and makes of it the most poignant demonstration of heartbreak since Katharine Hepburn made a fool out of herself putting on a showy dinner to impress Fred MacMurray in George Stevens' ALICE ADAMS. And yet would it have hurt the editors (or the publishers) to give us a \\"selected stories\\" worth its name?"},{"Title":"Beyond Medicine","review":"I was happy to have read this book.

The book also explains just about all you need to know so that you can successfully manage a Windows 2000 server. I like how the book explains all the different aspects of each part of the operating system. The information ranges from how the operating system actually works up to the different techniques that you can use to tweak the server. Another thing I liked about Windows 2000 Server Unleashed is that it tells you both the GUI way to do things and also the command line way.

This book discusses in detail the internal workings of Windows services and components, but not on practical applications of the new technologies available or will be made available (eg. ASP.NET on IIS 5.0). I'd say the author focused on the &quot;why's&quot; but less on the &quot;how's&quot;.I am a web developer and I wanted to learn all the technical processes and hardware requirements in setting up and administering Windows 2000 such as setting up a LAN, a name server to point my domain at and make it available on the web, or even just to connect my network to my ISP (like setting up a router, a hub, proxy server, etc.), but I was disappointed not to get even a single hint.

The plan is for consuming 2,000 tons of wood/day to produce 35 mw electricity for supplying a paper-pulp mill and its supporting 30,000 people city. Native forests were to be cut down to plant fast-growing trees for paper production.Cost of the power plant and pulp mill was $269 million. A 26-mile railroad terminus and 2,800 miles of road were waiting at the site. At the time of the article the plant was producing 750 tons of paper every day, worth $300,000. Contract labor turnover was 200%/year, and more than 20 have headed the project in its 13-year life.Daniel Ludwig, financial backer and project creator, made his money originally in oil tankers and supertankers. His original tree choice, melina, grew a foot/month in Panama and Cost Rica but did not grow well in the sandy soil in Brazilian jungles - thus they switched to Caribbean pine and eucalyptus.Postscript: Original expectations were to spend up to $500 million on the project; over-runs brought it to $1 billion. Revenue projections were $300 million - instead, 1979 revenues were $70 million, vs. operating costs of $110 million. Debt service made the red ink even worse, and no one was anxious to loan more on an uncertain project when the Brazilian government began challenging Ludwig's ownership of all the land and his tax exemptions. Ludwig gave the project, including its debts, to local businessmen."},{"Title":"Life After Loss : A Personal Guide Dealing with Death, Divorce, Job Change and Relocation","review":"This book was recommended and a copy provided by a friend.

I strongly recommend to anyone who has undergone a similar loss."},{"Title":"Life After Loss : A Personal Guide Dealing with Death, Divorce, Job Change and Relocation","review":"A dear friend gave \\"Life After Loss\\" to me after my wife of 32 years died from cancer in 2004. This book was one of a number of books that I received, but is the only book that I continue to use and reorder. I have lost track of how many copies I have given away.The book offers practical advice and endorsed my feelings and allowed me to find a path to regain some balance (and laughter) in my life. It also helped me understand that grief is a difficult, non-linear journey, and is unique for each individual. I also learned that my loss is not the only type of profound loss and that there is a clear difference between sudden loss and slow loss. And that all happy couples should come to understand and accept that widowhood is almost certain for all strong marriages and partnerships."},{"Title":"Life After Loss : A Personal Guide Dealing with Death, Divorce, Job Change and Relocation","review":"This book helped me recover from the loss of my father.

I'll have to admit that when he gave it to me, the last thing I wanted to do was read it. I was interested in nothing,and even if I would have read it at that time, I wouldn't have remembered it. I was numb. After a few months I pulled the book out from under a big pile of my mother's things in my closet. I was going to look at it, but I didn't want to get upset again so I didn't think about it for another 4 months. When I finally sat down to read it, it wasn't a sad book like I was scared of. It actually helped me to cope with my mom's loss and to like myself again. I no longer felt guilty or ashamed. I learned that things happen because &quot;we live in an imperfect world.&quot; I know that this isn't the kind of report that you may want, but I just wanted to let people know that this book can help you. Everyone going through a loss of any kind should read this book and refer to it when they get down again about their loss or losses. Believe me, this book helps...even when it is the last thing you may want to see and especially read. I went through it and now I am so glad that I read it."},{"Title":"Life After Loss : A Personal Guide Dealing with Death, Divorce, Job Change and Relocation","review":"After losing my wife to cancer in late 2000, I've read several books dealing with grief and this is easily the one that I've recommended most.

I loaned my &quot;precious&quot; copy to a friend who had a recent loss. Every time I bought a copy to replace the original it did not last long in my book collection. After the fifth time I loaned my copy out and hesitated to ask for it back, I realized it was a much more personal gift than flowers. I was even more surprised to learn that many recipients will re-gift it again and again. I must have given out 50 copies over the years."},{"Title":"Life After Loss : A Personal Guide Dealing with Death, Divorce, Job Change and Relocation","review":"This book has become a classic in the area of life after losses of all kinds. It is a MUST-READ - in part, because our culture is ignorant yet pushy about how to live through major losses. While this book provides lots of guidelines for how to get through difficult times, it also appropriately repeats the truth that losses are different for each person - and even for each loss. It gives necessary permission for people to allow their unique feelings to come up and be expressed, rather than hiding them or being afraid of them. It promotes the truth that the only way to get through losses in life is to go \\"THROUGH THEM\\", not to \\"get over them.\\" \\"Getting over\\" losses is merely a way to avoid feelings and force them to come out through the body (illness)or some other mode that is more accepted in our culture than emotions. Although these feelings may at first seem unbearably painful, the reader will find surprising relief by allowing them to be felt and then expressed either through direct emotions, or through some of the exercises provided in the book. This book recognizes that many people and even professionals may be unaware of these truths. It recommends that you either educate those people or else find a way to do what you need to do to get THROUGH your process without their input. I am a psychologist and have used this book regularly in my practice for years. But more importantly, I am a person who has experienced many losses that this book helped me find my way THROUGH."},{"Title":"Life After Loss : A Personal Guide Dealing with Death, Divorce, Job Change and Relocation","review":"On January 27, 1991, I scoured the bookstores of Southern California trying to find the following title: &quot;What to Do When You Find Out that Your Baby Doesn't Have a Brain.&quot;I had just left UCLA and I was stunned to learn that after 28-months of painful, infertility treatment that the child we had dreamed of bore such a terrible birth defect.After I left my fourth bookstore, I realized that no one had ever written a book about the specific situation I was living through. Happily, I did encounter a title called, &quot;Life After Loss&quot; that day.Life After Loss saved my life. My first copy is dog eared, tea stained, tear stained, filled with momentos, and much loved. In the subsequent eight years, I have bought at least 30 copies of the book to distribute to friends and associates going through grief.I learned that our society is embarrased by the display of pain. To keep myself sane, I had to learn to express it. In Life After Loss I learned that you can't go around grief, that you have to go through it.I learned that my sorrow wouldn't engulf me if I understood what to expect from the grief cycle.I grew to understand and have empathy for the small and large losses each of experience in our daily lives.

It was originally given to me following my divorce. My thinking of loss was when a death of someone close happens. I soon discovered that loss occurs in several forms. Author, Bob Dietz, has captured the dynamics most of us experience during and after a 'loss' of any kind. Getting laid off or fired from a job, moving to a new house, breaking off a meaningful relationship, What should you feel?I like that Amazon offers good used copies of books. In my recent order of \\"Life After Loss,\\" I was able to get two out of five at the 'low, low price' of $0.01 each. It has never happened to me before. I've told others about my good fortune and that I've used this book for Grief Support Groups. It is the best I've found to aid the process of grieving. It is so important to one's future mental health and development that anger, denial, and depression be dealt with properly.My bonus from using this book is that I've met the author and had phone and email conversations with him. The most recent 'loss' in his life is Alzheimers. Not his, his wife. She is a published author too. Here's what they decided to do; write about their experience and go on a speaking/workshop tour of the country. When I last spoke to him they'd just returned from a week-end workshop. It was going well and was very rewarding.

This book helps validate that experience as well as act as a roadmap for the grief experience. It includes practical tools to move through the process and information not always covered in other grief literature, e.g., nutrition during grief.

I have read the other reviews and this must not bother everyone, but I have found it made the \\"process\\" 10 times worse. I mean the book has a lot of good things to say. It is a great book on loss. However I would be reading something crying and \\"growing\\" and all the sudden he starts talking about divorce or losing a pet or a job. I mean those are all terrible things, but not the same as someone in your life dying. I would either have to skip all those parts and only read about 1/3 of the book or I would read it and get very, very sidetracked to what I was supposed to be thinking about. For example this would be my thought pattern while reading: Crying about my mom's passing, then go into the part about divorce and think about so and so and why they must have gotten divorced...no no focus...skip that part...then about someone losing a pet, ok ok please that is not the same thing stop trying to say it is...focus skip to next part...start reading about job loss...my cousin just lost his job...why the heck does this book have to be so hard to read!?!So my summary is this,"},{"Title":"Life After Loss : A Personal Guide Dealing with Death, Divorce, Job Change and Relocation","review":"This book was given to me after my husband died.

The book gives the reader the permission to grieve that our larger society has often denied him. Emphasized over and over again is the theme that: \\"Going through the experience is the only lasting and healthy way out of grief.\\" The book advises those who grieve: \\"Never apologize for grieving. Remind yourself as often as needed that the very worst kind of loss is always yours\\" and to \\"Learn to acknowledge that your loss is worthy of grief.\\" The griever can further admit to himself: \\"The loss I experienced is a major event in my life. Perhaps it is the worst thing that will ever happen to me. But is not the end of my life. I can still have a full and rewarding life. Grief has taught me much, and I will use it to be a better person than I was before my loss.\\" In this way those who grieve can be left a sense of hope, not to be forever devastated. The book concludes with some valuable appendices on the role of nutrition in grief recovery, words that describe feelings and information on how one can form their own support group. Not only was it deeply comforting to read this book, (I lost my own father to aortic stenosis five months ago) but I also can see where it could be immensely useful for mental health professionals to use in their practice. I have been a Licensed Clinical Social Worker employed by the Department of Defense for over twenty years most recently working with a number of those individuals who lost family members in Iraq. I can see suggesting they read this book themselves and it being of great comfort to them. I would strongly recommend this book to all who have suffered a significant loss in their life."},{"Title":"Life After Loss : A Personal Guide Dealing with Death, Divorce, Job Change and Relocation","review":"After the loss of my 14 year old cat, Tabitha, I was a mess and had no focus or direction on how to handle my grief. I picked up this book at the store and found it to be a lifesaver. It is a book that understood my grief and didn't undervalue it. It helped me to cope with others lack of compassion which can be very hurtful especially non pet-lovers. Since the loss of Tabitha, this book has helped to grieve over the loss of my 2 other beloved cats, Bart and Katie. And now I will read this book again as my sweet cat Bridgette passed away 2 days ago. It has also helped me when I got laid off and losing my favorite manager. Losing someone you love is the hardest thing to face. Grieving is terrible, painful, and difficult but with the help of this book you will get through it. I highly recommend this book as it will help you find peace in your grief."},{"Title":"Life After Loss : A Personal Guide Dealing with Death, Divorce, Job Change and Relocation","review":"My mother passed away this summer at the age of 83.My mom was the center of our family, even at that age. All four of her children were devoted to her , and she was much involved in our daily lives. A more kind compassionate and generous person did not exist.When mom passed, I was overwhelmed, not only by her death, but the hole she left behind. I had the belief that because hers was not a tragic, sudden death, that mourning the way I felt was not appropriate.Many said:\\" you were lucky to have had your mother for such a long time etc...\\" I felt conflicted.Life after Loss helped me see that no matter what the age or circumstance of death, you have the right and duty to mourn as YOU see fit.There has been a life altering event, and my reaction was just as valid as anyone else's.It explains that the steps in mourning do not follow a pattern, and that grief may strike you at any time anywhere.After rteading Life after Loss, I felt I was normal.... and going to be O.K."},{"Title":"Life After Loss : A Personal Guide Dealing with Death, Divorce, Job Change and Relocation","review":"This book was recommended to me by a co-worker, so I could learn to live with the idea of an unforeseen divorce hitting me like a speeding freight train. My life took a turn I NEVER saw coming and totally threw me into a deep depression and one of dispair. When the book arrived, I jumped into reading it immediately, so I could find help for my raw emotions, and try to get myself out of my very low funk. Although death is a greater challenge, divorce can be equally challenging when you don't have the opportunity to work things out with your spouse. The book provided a wonderful \\"support system\\" for me, as it reminded me that I was NOT alone in my feelings and how much the loneliness hurts - every day. Yes, you truly cannot see that things will get better when you are in the moment. People can tell you that, but until you experience it for yourself, you cannot believe you will get there. I do recommend this book for people who are experiencing a drastic change in their lives - whether a death of a loved one, divorce, moving or job change. It can provide you some semblance of strength to help you move forward!!! And when your emotions are so very raw, strength is certainly a good choice to help you on your journey."},{"Title":"Life After Loss : A Personal Guide Dealing with Death, Divorce, Job Change and Relocation","review":"When my brother was dying in 1999, a grief counselor recommended this book.

Nothing drives me nuttier than getting my hands on a great book and not being able to sit down and read it straight through. So be warned before you start High Stakes by Justine Dare. Make the time to read it straight through or pay the price! Ms. Dare has a winner in this book. It has every element that makes great romantic suspense--a wonderful hero, feisty heroine, great secondary supporting cast, syndicated crime and murder.The hero is Aaron Montana. He is running the family business, a gaming casino known as Golden Phoenix. He is a big, rugged man, not particularly handsome. By the size of him, you would expect him to be someone who is used to bullying his way to get what he wants. But in fact, it is just the opposite. Aaron is a wonderful leading man. He's smart, values his family, friends, and employees. His one big fault is his need to protect those who need it. He has the need to rescue people.Our heroine is Shelby Wyatt. Shelby has been on the run since she was twelve. She has finally settled down thanks to the kindness of a woman who took her under her wing. Now that woman is threatened by blackmail that could destroy her marriage. Shelby isn't about to let that happen. By trying to help, Shelby gets involved in murder and is on the run from a man determined to find her.Now, put a wonderful protective hero with a feisty heroine used to taking care of herself and watch things explode. The book has one of the neatest opening scenes that I have ever read. The moral to the opening scene should probably read if you ever want to keep a low profile, don't play the slot machines in a casino.I expected this book to get bogged down in places with all the characters and everyone holding back information that could solve a crime. Ms. Dare didn't let that happen. I liked the ending. Even though Ms. Dare threw out clues to whom the murderer was, I missed picking up on them so the ending was a complete surprise."},{"Title":"High Stakes","review":"This is the first book by Justine Dare I've read.It won't be the last.The premise is interesting and nothing you've seen too often before. Shelby has been in the wrong place at the wrong time and is now on the run, (and this is not the first time she's been a runaway either.)She ducks into a casino in a small town near Vegas, and just when she feels her luck has run out and the person after her might catch her, she gets a big run of good luck in the form of hitting a $25,000 jackpot at the slots. She is wary of the attention, afraid it will draw the person after her right to her, so she dashes off.Aaron Montana, the owner and head of security at the casino, sees this and all of his \\"Save the Whale\\" instincts rise to the surface. Aaron has a penchant for saving wounded birds and the fear he sees in Shelby's eyes is something he can't ignore.The two join forces, but each has their deep wounds. Can Shelby learn to trust in time to save her life?The way Ms. Dare handles characterization was the best part of this book. Shelby and Aaron are characters you love, for all their wounds. You just want to hug them and make them feel good. The suspense is mimimal, compared to say, a Linda Howard book. Nothing dark and evil here, but it works for this book. This is a book about healing wounds and Ms. Dare does a fabulous job.A really enjoyable read."},{"Title":"High Stakes","review":"In Output, Nevada's Golden Phoenix Casino and Hotel, Shelby Wyatt wins the $25,000 grand prize at the slots. Instead of collecting her money, she flees the casino for the hotel in a panic trying to avoid the attention. The owner, Aaron Montana, watches what she did on tape and wonders what would make someone so afraid to accept her winnings. He next watches her on live camera managing to defeat his security and get into a hotel room.Aaron confronts Shelby, but does not stop her when she flees. He decides to track her down anyway and learns from the person standing next to her when she won the grand prize that she likes horses. He checks the nearby phone booth and finds she ripped out a page containing Outpost Flat Stables. Aaron goes there and persuades Shelby to hide in his hotel. He takes her to his secure apartment through a secret passage. Aaron wonders if Shelby killed Pruett, but she accuses him of wanting sex. Shelby begins to worry that the kind Aaron who she is beginning to love will die due to the murder she witnessed and her knowledge of who the killer is, but will she trust him with the truth?Three-time RITA Award winner and a Reviewer Choice Award winner Justin Dare provides her vast audience with a powerful romantic suspense nobvel that never slows down from the moment Shelby plays the slots until the end. Though the male lead is too perfect (except for being an ultra hunk), the tale is non-stop action starring a feisty female whose loyalty to her \\"mom\\" happens to leave her in the right place at the wrong time. Readers will feel they won the jackpot with HIGH STAKES.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"High Stakes","review":"This was a good book, and a nice change from what I usually read - Nora Roberts. I almost gave up on this book because it started slow I thought - the reason for all the running around took a bit too long to unfold. The writing was very funny in many areas, and that was great. This was my first Justine Dare book, but I will definitely look for more."},{"Title":"High Stakes","review":"This book definitely had me turning the pages. It was suspenseful, but I didn't really get how the other readers considered it to be funny. There isn't one line in it that I can remember as making me laugh, but maybe I just didn't get the joke. Anyway, I felt the author did a good job at portraying the character's backgrounds that described their personalities, but as far as the connection between the two, it was not well built.For being classified as a romance, it did not even come close to filling the genre. As far as a romantic suspense, it is closer to some of the books that lean more to the suspense than the relationship. I just didn't feel the chemistry between the two that the author was trying to get across. As for the mystery part of it, it does pull you along until the end, but also is a let down in a way.I have come across a few other authors that think they can surprise a reader by hardly mentioning the unsub. The fact is, it is really annoying when you get to what should be the climax and you barely remember who that person is.This is the first Justine Dare book I have read and only chose it based on the reviews. According to her other books, this is her best. I hate to say it, but if this is the best, than I may not choose to read any of her others. It's not that it was bad. In fact, it had me glued to the pages, but I felt absolutely no connection to the characters and even thought many of them were thrown in needlessly. They were not red herrings, and maybe the author should have had more developed ones.

Thank you, Michele"},{"Title":"Deryni Checkmate","review":"The middle piece of a work in a trilogy is usually less satisfying than its bookend pieces simply because you know nothing will be resolved until the third work. In Deryni Checkmate this attribute is not so glaring as it could've been. Kurtz has written a novel that stands alone or as part of the series.Deryni Checkmate takes up right where Deryni Rising left off as King Kelson tries to organize his kingdom after defeating an evil sorceress. He has many problems working on his mind. First, the powerful Archbishop Loris is using the chaos to further his end of getting rid of all Deryni or at least making them renounce their powers. Similar to Adolph Hitler and the Jews, Loris uses the Deryni as a scapegoat for everything evil in the world. He is also covertly supplying aid to a rebel leader, Warin, who believes he was appointed by God to wipe all Deryni off the face of the earth. So what if Warin believes that he is a messiah? Loris believes he can control him. Also, Wencit of Torenth, a Deryni lord, plans to start a war for the opposite reason, to extend Deryni rule over all humanity for once and for all. Can you blame him? The Deryni have been slaughtered and harassed for 200 years.The Church's first order of business is to isolate Kelson from his best friend and mentor, Morgan. His offense? Practicing Deryni magic out in the open, a blasphemy against God. In this novel, Kelson is really not the main character. Instead, Kurtz focuses on the adventures of Morgan and his cousin, the priest Duncan as they try desperately to evade the Church and Warin and still be able to help the young king see his way through what is rapidly developing into a civil war.Deryni Checkmate is a more psychological novel than Deryni Rising, focusing instead on the moral decisions facing the characters than swordfights. What I like about this fantasy world is that it is fantasy without all the magical unicorns and orcs and goblins that fluff most of the genre. It has more to do with the relations between two races. The series is also a cautionary tale about the power of the Church. When the Church serves as a brake for society, a force to hold us back until we are wise enough to use power for good, it's positive. When the Church becomes an Exterminator, a prosecutor, it becomes a servant of evil.This is a good series. I don't know why it's currently out of print. Well, I guess there is a reason. It doesn't sell. It's too bad. You can always pick them up at used bookstores or here on Amazon. The next book in the series is High Deryni."},{"Title":"Deryni Checkmate","review":"Someone once told me \\"Women can't write good fantasy because they're afraid to kill your favorite characters\\" ... I then introduced him to Katherine Kurtz and the Deryni. I never heard that statement again.I have been reading this epic saga over and over again for 20 years, and I will be reading them over and over again for the next 20 years.Katherine Kurtz's blending of \\"Magic\\" with fact based \\"Church\\" ritual and her use of real medieval living truly makes you feel that the Kingdom of Gwynedd could truly have existed.If you are looking for a series of books that you just cannot put down, these will keep you on the edge of your seat turning pages well into the wee hours of the morning. Though I must warn you to never assume what will happen next; and I advise always having a tissue on hand just in case."},{"Title":"Deryni Checkmate","review":"With this book, Kurts takes Deryni Rising, and transitions it from stand alone novel to introduction to a series, and she does a good job of it as well. There are many possible threads left over from the first book, and she picked them up adeptly.Since there exists in Gwynned a race of Sorcerers known as the Deryni, there would exist people who hate and/or fear them. In this world they are found largely in the church. This sets up a conflict between the King and his Archbishop, the two single most powerful individuals in the kingdom. That all of this happens on the eve of war makes it more stressful for King Kelson, and Archbishop Loris would rather go down in flames than compromise.The allegories that can be made for racism are abundant and clear, as the status of Deryni is inherited, so can one be held responsible for an accident of birth?"},{"Title":"Deryni Checkmate","review":"I just read this series because I had picked up &quot;The Harrowing of Gwynnedd&quot; in a second-hand store and really enjoyed it. Boy, is it obvious that this was written by a much younger writer. The plot is interesting, the action fast-paced, but the writing is pretty awful. Let's face it, having the villain stand on a hill and shake his fist at the escaping hero is so cliched as to be embarrassing. Read it only to fill in the background for the other books."},{"Title":"Deryni Checkmate","review":"I think part of the reason the other people here give it such a low rating is because so many tragic incidents occur and that disagrees with them. It's not as fast-moving as Deryni Rising, and they expected it to be so. I agree, it's not the best book in the series, but there are some very good scenes in it, and it is necessary to read this book to understand what happens in the final book, High Deryni. Now, that book is really worth reading, and you can't appreciate it as well if you haven't read this book. There are some new characters in Deryni Checkmate that become very important later on, and some of the characters from Deryni Rising are elaborated on. I find it very entertaining to read the development of these characters. They can easily become favorites (as they have for me) if you can appreciate the trials they go through in this book."},{"Title":"Deryni Checkmate","review":"King Kelson of Gwynedd faces a war on two fronts: a Church led internal rebellion, and an invasion from a neighboring land; while covert forces loom in the background, in volume two of The Chronicles of the Dernyni, Deryni Checkmate.

It held my interest from the opening word to the last one."},{"Title":"Deryni Checkmate","review":"This book focuses on the anceint battle of church versus state, and it's effects on Mrs. Kurtz magical kingdom of Gwynedd. Unfortunately for the characters involved the age old battle hasn't yet been solved, and there doesn't seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel.To read this one you would almost have to have read the previous novels in the series. Mrs. Kurtz usually recaps well enough to make it possible for her readers to pick-up the series mid-stream, but the plot thus far must have become too involved. Still, this remains a very well written book, and you will finish it wanting more."},{"Title":"Deryni Checkmate","review":"I'm am sitting here wondering if those people who gave this book such a bad review even read it; or perhaps they didn't understand it. I will be the first to admit that it is not her best work ever done, but it is far from the worst book ever written either. This novel has quite a few unpleasant moments in it, but that is part of the story the author is trying to portray. how true to life would it seem if everything in all of the novels was always peaches and cream? I think Mrs. Kurtz is an amazing author because she is willing to write the bad events with the good. This novel is definately worth the read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Deryni Checkmate","review":"A well-done, suspenseful, entertaining book. I must disagree with the reviewers who gave it a low rating. It requires concentration to fully understand the plot with all of its subplots. The conflicts of the persecution of the Deryni and the threat towards Alaric Morgan's duchy are continually entertaining. The end is clearly a cliffhanger (and an excellent, though sad one) leading up to the next book, High Deryni. A must-read."},{"Title":"Deryni Checkmate","review":"Kelson is now a young king. It takes pretty much zero time before he has problems with those annoying church wankers.An archbishop is up in arms, wanting one of the nobles to basically not be Deryni.Threats of excommunication, conflict, and running around ensue, as well as magical stuffups, executions, and outright battle. Not a good time for all, by any stretch."},{"Title":"Deryni Checkmate","review":"I love Katherine Kurtz's deryni novels. This one is the weakest of the Deryni Chronicles but it is necessary in the set up for the next book. I know lots of people hate that but I think she did a good job of trying to describe the events within the kingdom and what could be happening by those who threaten at the boarders. If you like historical type fiction and a bit of mystery and magic this book could fit the bill.I think Katherine's greatest talent is getting you to feel what the characters feel. I also think she does a great job of describing the social situation in her settings."},{"Title":"Deryni Checkmate","review":"This was a wonderful book, and I also must disagree with the low ratings.

It can serve as an introduction to the world of phenomenology, sociology and philosophy as pertaining to Human-Computer Interfaces.It felt more like a mixture between a proposal and an introductory philosophical treatise than an overview of the current state of the field (it carries the word \\"foundations\\" in its title for a reason).After reading it however, I still wasn't convinced that \\"social computing\\", \\"tangible computing\\" and \\"embodied interaction\\" really add up to a construct that can effectively inform the design of new HCI devices even though this claim was repeated throughout the book almost like a prayer wheel.Interestingly, while the book points out the meaning of embodiment in already existing work practices, it fails to give any strategies on how these theories can actually be applied to the design of effective new HCI devices that go beyond the shiny toys produced at MIT Media Lab.The loophole seems to be that embodied practices can only arise once the tools are defined, so that it is hard to predict what practices will be used once it's out there - since the way we use tools is largely improvisatory, as Dourish points out.I also can not stop to wonder if the term \\"embodiment\\" is akin to \\"multimedia\\" - a belief system that can mean so many things that it effectively disintegrates sooner or later.So, while it left me not exactly sure that there really is another end to it, it was certainly worthwhile and inspiring to work through this book in a thorough manner - I now feel courageous enough to put my nose into \\"Being and Time\\" by Heidegger.A friendly way to get your brain going!"},{"Title":"Where the Action Is: The Foundations of Embodied Interaction","review":"This is a major work on the redesign of the human/computer interface. It is well written but very deep. Excellent academic research is clearly demonstrate throughout. I would not say, however, that it is an easy read.Engineering research does not generally have to be as strongly academically founded as scientific research. The controlling factor is &quot;does it work,&quot; not how does it relate to previous work. This tendency leads to problems when it is necessary to do multidisciplinary work involving both engineering and science. The redesign of the human/computer interface is just such a problem.As an engineer working independently in this field, I have often wished for the time and resources to do proper academic studies. Paul Dourish has now done them for me. All my future publications will have to show consistency with this book, show they are clearly outside the area covered by this book, or show the book is wrong. The last alternative is most unlikely. I think I can show my work, based on Darwinism and ontology, complies with the first option. I am certain that my work will be stronger for this effort."},{"Title":"Where the Action Is: The Foundations of Embodied Interaction","review":"A very interesting, and yet clear to read and follow book. \\"Where the action is\\" was a reading reference for my qualifier exam and after reading it I was hooked up to HCI forever.

George Boolos was (is) famous for, among other things, his gift of didactically brilliant exposition.There is only one other book on the subject\\"C.Smory'nski's \\"Self-Reference and Modal Logic\\", now out-of-print, which provides a nice complement to Boolos with surprisingly small overlap. For an introduction, I would not hesitate to recommend Boolos over Smory'nski.Since 1993 the \\"baton\\" has not completely \\"fallen out of Boolos' hands\\"\\"the interested reader can follow up on this via e.g. a couple of handbook-chapter expositions, easily found by googling around, that point to current research literature. However, no further textbook-level exposition appears to be forthcoming anytime soon.As a comment to galloamericanus' review, I would note that Boolos does not restrict his monograph exclusively or even primarily to his own results. The reader gets a fair overview of the research field by 1993 as shaped by many contributors."},{"Title":"The Logic of Provability","review":"George Boolos regrettably died too early, at age 56. He was a witty engaging writer, and a brilliant logician. This book,completed not long before his untimely death, is probablythe high point of his career. The key insight, that modal logiccan be interpreted as a sort of metamathematical algebra,is Godel's from the 1930s. And a key result is due to MartinLob about 50 years ago. But Boolos built a towering edificeon this slim material. I think that the provability interpretationof the modal operator is the most philosophically and mathematically satisfying of all, and I hope someone comesalong to pick up the baton that has fallen from Boolos's hand."},{"Title":"The Logic of Provability","review":"This book is an excelent reference for Logics of Provability.I consider this book a &quot;must have&quot; for anyone in the field, or in the field of Modal Logics.The author is a leader in the field, and this book is frequently cited in the bibliography of papers in the field."},{"Title":"Couples Therapy, Second Edition","review":"I can really recommend this book!

Curiously it is not taken from &quot;Dracula&quot;, but from Universal's 1941 movie, &quot;The Wolf Man&quot;!This book explores Dracula's vampiric past (as conceived by Peter Tremayne) even further than &quot;Dracula Unborn&quot; and the last chapter ends with a neat tie-in to the original novel Tremayne's &quot;Dracula books&quot; are based upon.An entertaining read, but not a patch on Stoker's masterpiece."},{"Title":"English Grammar (American Linguistics, 1700-1900)","review":"Gave this to a friend as a gift.

Loaded with mouthwatering pictures, plenty of detail and advice and, even better, some of the history of the region which has gone from a remote, pastoral valley to a thriving mecca for outdoor adventure seekers of all sorts.The author clearly knows the area like the back of her hand - I thought I knew the area fairly well, but I've learnt an enormous amount from browsing this guide and can't wait to put some of the information to use.There's enough material in here to also provide for a day or two of rainy weather reading if, as happens, the weather does not co-operate.A new edition is apparently about to come out....."},{"Title":"MONT BLANC WALKS","review":"When you buy this book, you're paying for a glossy, color production with lots of pretty photos of mountains. I would have rather had a black and white book at half the price. There are a few places where the color is used effectively, as in a few of the summary maps that show different hikes in different colors, but for the most part it's just a waste of money to pay for it.The book has no index. If I want to find information about the a particular peak, hut, tram, etc., and its name isn't in the title of one of the hikes listed in the table of contents, then I'm out of luck. All I can do is flip through the entire book scanning for the name on one of the maps -- or go online for information, in which case what was the point of buying the book? It's absurd that anyone is publishing a book like this in the 21st century without an index -- computers have made indexing extremely easy.There are no topo maps, only highly schematized maps with no indication of relief except for lines meant to represent ridge lines.

If you're an avid fan [like me] of Woody Allen and understand philosophy a little [like me] you will enjoy this book. I found out more than I thought I would ever know about Allen's films from reading this book. Thoroughly engrossing and fun to read."},{"Title":"Woody Allen and Philosophy: You Mean My Whole Fallacy Is Wrong?","review":"The first thing to know about this book is that it is but one in a series. \\"Woody Allen and Philosophy\\" is brought to you by the same folks who brought you \\"The Simpsons and Philosophy,\\" \\"Seinfeld and Philosophy,\\" and so on. I have not been impressed with this series. Generally, the pop culture topics chosen have no explicit philosophical inspiration. Philosophy must be read-in to otherwise superficial material. Some of these movies and sit-coms constitute good illustrative examples of philosophical topics (e.g. the tired observation that Seinfeld is a \\"deconstructive\\" comedy about nothing), but none of them was consciously embedded with philosophy.Woody's work is different. The attempt to understand the intellectual references contained in Woody's early films is precisely what led me to study philosophy in the first place. They contain deeply philosophical themes and explicit philosophical references. Films like Annie Hall, Love and Death, and Bananas are absolutely packed with high-culture easter eggs waiting for a good interpreter. Sadly, the essays in this book miss pretty much all of them.Of course, I admit I am the sort of snob who thinks that philosophy should not be the handmaiden to pop culture. I am embarrassed to see Schopenhauer wasted on Seinfeld.The bottom line is that you will enjoy this book if you enjoy the series itself. Serious Woody Allen fans and philosophers alike will probably be disappointed."},{"Title":"Woody Allen and Philosophy: You Mean My Whole Fallacy Is Wrong?","review":"How often has the reader combed a casual survey of actor Woody Allen longing for insights into the witty sayings and cutting remarks Allen is notable for?

In Woody Allen And Philosophy, Mark Conrad and Aeon Skoble edit a fine philosophical approach to Allen's sayings and life, presenting articles which survey his pragmatic optimism, his sex comedys and spoofs, and his artistic films alike. Articles focus on Allen's philosophy and viewpoints and provide plenty of personal insights in the process of analyzing his works."},{"Title":"The Revolt of the Angels","review":"The book tells the story of an archbishop's guardian angel who starts reading the bishop's books on Theology and becomes an atheist. The angel moves to Paris, meets a woman, has his wings fall off &amp; takes up the harp to make a living, since he can't handle harmony. Then he meets the Devil. This is a very funny book, by the world's greatest ironist. A wonderful read for those who smile at people who pray on TV while squinting. Elegant prose even in English, better in French; a quintessential skeptic at his best."},{"Title":"The Revolt of the Angels","review":"Yes, Anatole France was a Nobel Prize laureate; No, that is part reason enough to read him (Who can name six laureates). If you need to be convinced, try The Revolt of the Angels.An angel, Arcade, leaves heaven, comes to earth, uses his invisibility to steal books from a library, after which he joins a host of fallen brethren with plans to overthrow god. Fantastic? Think again. In the hands of France, the plot is a mere jot; he is more interested in expressing his contrarian view of the universe.His knowledge of history and religious texts is amply demonstrated; however the main draw is his cynical philosophy and his virtuosity in descriptions. When one of the angels delivers a tirade, the lifespan of the universe is captured in paragraphs: Original sin is a fable concocted by god, the Reformation was started Luther \\"all swollen with beer and theology,\\" and god's thunderbolt was stolen by Franklin. According to France, god foresees everything, yet is surprised by the most probable event. France is not interested in orthodoxy, this is not religious satire to make you laugh; this is one that causes you to painfully shake your head and smile.The conclusion is obvious, but it brings us back to reality - nothing will change. By the end of this impressive work of literature we discover only one angel is in revolt and it is not Arcade. It is Anatole France."},{"Title":"The Revolt of the Angels","review":"There's a lot to work with in this idea. Angels exist on earth, lots of them, including many assigned duties as guardian angels. God's in his heaven, and all's right with the world.But, at the hands of master satirist France, all is not right with the world. The god in this story is a petty, tinhorn tyrant. He has arrogated himself power of life and death over this world's little beings, but with no true understanding of the clockwork perfection of even his assigned corner of this universe. Many of those angels on earth have defected, and are plotting an insurrection against that god's dictatorial rule. They secure funding, they stockpile bombs of horrific power, and they brace themselves for the struggle ahead.I'm no scholar of the French revolution, but one point of similarity leaps out: the rebels' near-total lack of plan for what happens after the current in-crowd is outed. And, once the angels take on some features of earthly flesh, they fall victim to many of the ills that human flesh is heir to. Those include love of money, love of women, and love of the anarchic plotting in itself.There's a lot to like in this novel by Nobel winner France, but also a few things that didn't work for me. France move his plot forward using an alternation of many viewpoints - a technique that works poorly for maintaining cohesion in a story. This translation, from 1914, is generally readable and enjoyable, but a few of its phrases seemed stilted by today's standards. And, although I enjoyed the narrative, I was not always sure how the family story of the d'Esparvieus matched the larger story around it. France makes up for any failings, of course, in his repartee, including some well-place barbs at America and Americans.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Revolt of the Angels","review":"Excellent, starts a bit slow but proves itself to be a tour de force of comic invention, emotional intensity and general creativity. The story appears for the first forty pages to be a setup for a rather dull society world with one Maurice the owner of a vast collection of books and discovering one of them to have gone missing. After a bit of by the numbers effort to see who might have taken it, Maurice is met by the being responsible. It's his guardian angel, and as the result of reading the rationalist literary text the angel has decided that religion and the bonds of heaven are tyranny, and sets about to spread emancipatory consciousness among the order of angels. The title of the book wasn't symbolic, it features the direct plot of the book, with lots of unexpected turns, good insights and general hilarity. The strength of the discordant relationship between Maurice and his ex-guardian angel could carry the book in themselves--there's lots of hilarious and surreal scenes like where Maurice tries (unsuccessfully) to preach the virtues of religion, or when he challenges the angel into a duel over an issue of personal honor. Ultimately the book's scale is a lot wider than just that aspect, and it benefits from it.Much of the book is a direct satire. It's from the early twentieth century and bits of this humor haven't aged well, but a lot of it has. For instance there's the effort by one angel to talk another into rebellion against the celestrial arrangement and the current social arrangement in France. The second angel protests, on the grounds that France needs no change and was already completely perfect. It then goes on a speech on how the main credit bank of Frane was particularly refined \\"as pure and chaste and the Holy Virgin.\\"The novel also has, late on, one of the most affecting inversions of Christian myth that I've seen. The text had previously established a gnostic worldview where the entity ruling by the name of God was a lying oppressor of less than ultimate power. It had also shown Satan and his followers to be free thinkers, who tried to defeat God from humanitarian altruist notions. Across the novel the new outbreak lead by Maurice's ex-guardian angel linked up with the old resistance and formede plans for a new front, gathering strength to a march against the status quo. In the last chapter Satan has a dream, whereby his invasion is successful, the God-being is cast down and he takes on the celestial throne. The scenario plays out longer, with Satan becoming more cold, distant and egotistical, remote from and callous towards the human suffering that motivated his earlier fighting. He starts to shroud himself in mystery and hierarchy and govern as a tyrant. Simultaneously, cast down from the seat of power and command, God begins to observe the suffering of the small people and has a turn towards compassion and activity. Satan awakes from the dream, sees that a successful invasion of Heaen would just switch roles, and calls off the attack, resolving to maintain his spirit of compassion and work to help in smaller ways. There's a basic attitude of decency built into this story that's rather affecting, combined with the very strong and narratively surprising ending tone of anti-militarism. Such moments, of which the above is only the culmination, establish a writer of great sensitivity and complexity as well as humor.The novel is enormously rewarding and entertaining. Proof that at least sometimes the Nobel Award for Literature wen into deserving hands. I'm definitely going to look up more of Anatole France's writings.Similar to and better than: Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry PratchettSimilar to and also better than: The Hunchback of Notre Dama by Victor Hugo"},{"Title":"The Revolt of the Angels","review":"\\"The Revolt of the Angels\\" is a wonderful tale spun around the dichotomy of existence. In this story, much like man, we're told of the polar feelings of angels. Journey through this text, from the start of the 20th century and see its elements laden with Gnosticism. Truly a different way to look at the conflicts of faith and what is deemed good and evil. Written in an intellectual fashion, containing a through understanding of biblical proceedings, \\"The Revolt of the Angels\\" succeeds in summoning up thought processes, even amongst the most pious of Christians. Just like Arcade's (one of the main characters of this tale) thirst and journey for knowledge, readers are proposed with philosophical and social dilemmas, which will leave you deep in thought.~John J.

In towns like mine, books are in decline within the library system which is dominated by so-called media studies. While heritage in the United States is broadening to include the cultures of the nations who have supplied people for the melting pot, there is also a growing awareness of the history of the local town.This set of papers serves to underscore the fact that we cannot keep all of the past. It sets out the limitations, both spatially and of accessibility, of preserving and displaying artifacts and other remnants of the past, and questions the whole future of the heritage industry.No mere dry economics text this, the papers point out the political and economic aspects of heritage and the importance that heritage has to various clases and income groups in society.Regardless of the purists' motives in preserving the past for consumption by the future generations there are considerable costs involved financially and socially which must be considered.Following on from a superb paper by the excellent Sir Alan Peacock, various papers by UK and European authors consider various aspects of the political economy of heritage case before concluding with a paper on the international aspects by Dick Netzer.My only negative comment about this book is what is not included. I would like to have seen a written analysis of the whole question of heritage from different perspectives including a post-modernist approach. As any buyer of products from Amazon will know there is considerable debate about the relative values of the consumer products which we buy today especially in the entertainment field. This poses the serious question of how do we decide what is valuable in today's society and how do we make sure that those products will be accesible in the future.As I conclude this review I am reminded of the lady I met in a theme park in the North East of the US who was complaining in a loud voice about how certain countries represented there were not like the real thing. She knew what those countries were like she said, because she had visited the real thing at Epcot!"},{"Title":"Schaum's Easy Outline of Principles of Economics","review":"I like it.

Together, they provide an intimate portrayal of the City by the Bay. This stunning collection of photographs captures the contrasts, the energy, and the vitality of San Francisco. As do the essays.Tom Cole takes us back to the beginning and provides an historical review of the raucous town that suddenly grew up overnight in its feverish bid for gold. Barnaby Conrad leads us into the night with anecdotes witty, clever, and sensuous from an eclectic mix including, to name just a few, Graham Green, Frank Sinatra, and Eva Gabor.\\"Bahnaby tells me you haf a vooden leg, vitch vun iz it?\\"\\"Eva, I never thought I'd have to tell a Gabor what a man's leg feels like.\\"\\"Vell, dahling, ve vass never in zee lumber business!\\"In a final essay, Allen Pastron walks us through much of the city beneath our feet.

Multi-faceted lifestyles unfold with each page, the images capturing the curious joie de vivre that reigns over The City.

The collection is compelling and earnest, and her artistry is breath-taking. She has given us the gift of her voice with the publication of this first monograph, years in the making.Influenced by the innovative work of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, the poems are always richly nuanced and layered with many meanings that newly reveal themselves after each rereading. However, one never gets the sense of 'knowing' a poem completely, even after numerous readings.The three-part structure of the book, along with the fascinating epigraphs from which she takes the titles of her chapters, provides a sense of the delicate balance the work negotiates on multiple levels: art, silence, language, politics, identity, power, and love.The poet specifically deals with, among other things, her family's histories and her identity as a Filipino (American) and a woman."},{"Title":"Cultural Evidence","review":"This is a great book.

Full of first-hand quotes, the lives of the people of this region from 1750 through the early 1900's is witnessed. It should interest people who don't even live in Texas, so much American history is intertwined with this region. Especially great is the civil war section."},{"Title":"I Would Rather Sleep in Texas: A History of the Lower Rio Grande Valley and the People of the Santa Anita Land Grant","review":"I spent the first 44 years of my life in the Coastal Bend area of Texas (Corpus Christi), and studying the settlement and development of it for the past twenty-five years. So I am intimately familiar with the history of that area, but knew very little about the Rio Grande Valley, only 150 miles away.Due to the exhaustive research performed by Mary M. McAllen Amberson and her family, my knowledge of the history of the area has been vastly increased. For me, it ties together a number of events in the history of South Texas. I never realized the degree and amount of conflict that occurred in the border area as was documented in this book. It is obvious that the Wild West extended well into the 20th century. The book also provides another view of Richard King and Mifflin Kenedy that is absent from other published works - more detail about their persona and the diversity of their business interests.I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but due to the long time period in history and large number of people, it was difficult to keep track of the family members. A diagram of the family tree would have aided in keeping track of the many people involved. Since I have traveled throughout the Lower Rio Grande Valley, it would have been interesting to see more maps, particuliarly the current cities and towns overlaying the original Spanish Land Grant boundaries. Ownership of the property within these Spanish Land Grants is still being disputed today, with one of the most notable being the Balli' family claims on Padre Island.Overall, a very good book for someone interested in the history of the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas and the border areas of Mexico adjacent to that area."},{"Title":"I Would Rather Sleep in Texas: A History of the Lower Rio Grande Valley and the People of the Santa Anita Land Grant","review":"This is absolutely a very well written history of the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

This book gives a very good insight of what was going on throughout the lower Rio Grande Valley during this time frame. Mary M. McAllen Amberson along with her father, grandfather and great-grandfather have done an excellent job in preserving the history with all their personal notes with James B. McAllen. I now have a better understanding of the struggles and hardships the people had to endure in order to survive this rugged time. I strongly recommend this book to all people who are interested in learning more about the history of the Lower Rio Grande Valley during their ancestors' time. Hats off to Mary M.

This book is a true epic that follows intermingled families and fortunes from 1749 to the 1950's in deep South Texas. The first Spanish settlements in South Texas were entrepreneurial, rather than projects of the Crown or Church. Development on both sides of the Rio Grande remained market driven up until the present. This long and exciting history reminds us that the Rio Grande has more often been a juncture than a divide. As an example of the interdependence that spanned the shallow river, leaders of two northern Mexican states once considered seceding from Mexico to join their Texan colleagues as members of the Confederate States. As our Civil War ended, the citizens of Matamoros, Mexico, raised a militia to cross the Rio Grande to protect the citizens of Brownsville from marauders as the Army of the Confederacy retreated. There is also coverage of the very difficult period during the 1910's and 20's when bandit raids into Texas were linked to a plan, fomented in Germany, whereby Mexico would take back Texas, California, New Mexico, and Arizona, thereby distracting the U.S. from the war in Europe. This book does not simply look back at a tumultuous time but offers an understanding of the dynamics at play in the present."},{"Title":"I Would Rather Sleep in Texas: A History of the Lower Rio Grande Valley and the People of the Santa Anita Land Grant","review":"It is very interesting to read about the goings on in South Texas in the past and to apply that history to today's map.

Avelina died of cancer at 36 in a shack on Polk Street in Brownsville, Texas. She was my grandmother. James fathered children by at least two woman not mentioned in I Would Rather Sleep in Texas. (See the film, Border Bandits, to learn a little about one of the others). It is possible that part of the land that now is the McAllen Ranch was taken as a debt owed from the Guajardos and that the ranch came with a girl who was promised marriage.

I'd played a lot of pool before, but this book changed my game from mediocre to excellent, which is why I recently bought a new copy to give to a friend who is just learning the game. The tips on holding the cue stick alone made a difference in my game; when I spent the time to practice the other principles Mosconi discusses, I began to win more often than not, and could honestly say, &quot;I meant to do that,&quot; when I'd just made a particularly difficult shot. The fact that the book is small enough to roll up and stick in your back pocket helps; you can whip it out whenever you need to review a particular concept."},{"Title":"Willie Mosconi on pocket billiards (Little sports library)","review":"I have played pool off and on for years and never real got very good.

One of the nice things about this book is you will be able to read the whole thing in an hour!Willie Mosconi was the master pool player and one of the best to ever live so who better to take lessons from then the master himself. He starts out by showing you how to properly hold the cue stick. What a difference that makes. Then proper stance, making the bridge, stroke, cueing the ball, hitting the ball, english, combos, strategy, practice and more. This is a compact guide that can help anyone improve there game in as little as a couple games.

Then it's all practice. In fact even a player with poor fundamentals who practices more will beat you, because he won't miss much, but it still helps to have good ones, and you do look better.I practiced a lot and became a well regarded amateur player in my neighborhood pool room and on my college campus. I also traveled and played (I don't say beat) a lot of hustlers in Boston, Houston, Wichita, Nashville, and other mostly small towns. In my twenties I even beat a young Ronnie Allen, and Jack White, the traveling college campus exhibition professional, a couple of games, but not a full series. White was pretty surprised though and assumed I was a professional ringer, although I was an instructor at the college he was visiting. (My students and) I never forgot the impression I made on him when I made a lucky one handed cross corner shot, stretching to the far end of the table, in a game of one pocket. He was momentarily stunned, accounting no doubt for my couple of quick wins before he recovered his composure.This book only cost about $1 in 1957 or so when I bought it, and is not worth $50 today, but is easily worth $10, and a used copy for less than $5 is about right.

It's a classic story of two people who probably shouldn't get along finding they really have a lot in common. As a historian, I have some problems, especially with the second story. They mention the characters wearing pant suits and jeans. Jeans weren't common for women in the 1940s, especially outside the US, and I'm not sure pant suits were even invented yet. It's also difficult to believe that, once again, everyone who knows these two, except for the bad guys, of course, totally accepts their relationship. Society just wasn't that accepting then. And did lesbians even call each other &quot;wife&quot; yet? It is a nice story, but don't read it expecting to find passionate sections.

Two small children grow up in a small mill town near the Allegheny mountains, peopled with Polish immigrants and with cold, unloving parents who struggle to barely maintain a living. It's a bleak life for all the town's inhabitants and even more so for this small sister and brother who daily face the burden of poverty, hand me down clothes and a father who drinks. I was particularly moved by the little girl who was always desperately trying to please her mother, so as to get even a moment's recognition from her, only to end up feeling unloved and unwanted. At the centre of the town's consciousness is the shameful occurrence of the handsome and talented young priest who hanged himself in the the local church, to the total amazement and disbelief of the townpeople. This sad little story concludes with the daughter finally realising the cause of her family's unhappiness. It's not a cheerful read but a carefully crafted gem of a book."},{"Title":"The Grave of God's Daughter: A Novel","review":"I found The Grave of God's Daughter an absorbing and magical journey to a time and place that was not only Lost Allegheny, Pennsylvania among hand-scrabble, insular, obsessively private and shriveled-spirited Polish Catholic immigrant stock, but a sojourn reminiscent in a hundred ways of an emotionally-starved and delimited childhood savored and endured anywhere, on any dark streets or backroads. The narrator is being metamorphosed by the gigantic events of her lived world into an ultimately-wise but scarred, brave and (in her case) empathetic, self-reliant but regretful young woman before reaching adolescence and awareness of what being a woman will mean for her. The narrative is spare because the milieu of her and the younger brother dependent on her emotionally is stark and spare, darkened by overpowering but realistic foreboding and fear, by a graniness and plainness that darkens the sky and stunts childhood itself. The author is to be highly commended for not straying outside the bounds of that sadly all-too-common, even prevelant, milieu in the larger world beyond our tinsel and fading affluence. Lest we forget! At times, toward the end, I was almost afraid of what I might uncover turning the page... I, a child of the rural small-town protestant and anglo midwest, by far happier of circumstance, was taken back to that other world."},{"Title":"The Grave of God's Daughter: A Novel","review":"The Grave of God?s Daughter is technically, a precise a work of literary fiction as one is ever likely to read. Every sentence and image is superbly crafted, as though, author Brett Ellen Block, has tried painfully and meticulously to recreate every image. The story involves the sad emotional passion of a Polish-American girl?s childhood - a few brief weeks that illustrate what it?s like to grow up on the worst street in a Pennsylvania mill town in 1941.The story begins when a nameless woman, who after thirty years, returns to her childhood home of Hyde Bend, a small Polish Catholic town near the Allegheny Mountains, to attend her mother's funeral. At the graveside she meets her brother, Martin, who carries the scars of a life of drinking. She hasn't spoken to her brother in years and she doesn't say much to him during their mother's funeral in fear that she will tell him the truth about why she left. As the funeral begins the woman thinks back to 1941 when Martin was eight and she was twelve. They live on River Road, in an enclave of Polish Immigrants who are almost entirely Catholic. Most know at least a little English, but the customs, traditions, food, and the morality are vestiges of villages carried straight from Warsaw and Krakow.Their drunken father works nights in the steel mill and their mother works in the rectory as a cleaning woman and cooks for the priest. Both seem distant and disparate, shutting the children out of their seemingly pained lives. At one point the girl observes, &quot;we were her children, but we had faded into the far reaches of her peripheral vision and nothing we did to clamor or claw our way back into her line of site would work.&quot; The family lives in a two-room, cold hovel in the most horrible section of the dreary town. All the residents of their block had to share the one outhouse with each other and with the rats that lived there at night.Poverty pervades the story and the girl observes the misery around her with a startling resonance. Her mother wears her &quot;weariness like a heavy mask, it could not blunt her fair features, or hide the hint of flexibility for a smile in her lips.&quot; One day the girl notices that her mother's favorite painting, The Black Madonna, is no longer hanging on the wall. Thinking that her father sold it so he could get drunk at the local bar, the girl persuades Mr. Goceljak, the town's butcher to hire her as his delivery boy so she can earn enough money to buy the painting back. Dressed as a boy, so no one will recognize her, the girl makes her daily meat deliveries and gradually uncovers a mystery from the past that surrounds her family and also uncovers the truth about a murder that has taken place in the town.Block?s novel is narrated in the first person in a slow, smooth and gracefully modulated style. Her writing is so well paced and Block?s language is, at once, stark, yet packs an emotional and expressive punch. The narrator's voice is realistic and convincing, and there is a genuine verse-like quality to the story. But, at times, The Grave of God's Daughter tends to read more like an exercise in creative writing 101, and this reader was left wishing that perhaps the seamless structure could have been sacrificed for a little more depth, profundity, and passion.

I am impressed that Brett Ellen Brock had such detailed accounts of actual people and events. She appears to be too young to have lived these experiences herself, so she must have done extensive research.The hard facts she reveals are absolute:- St. Ladislaus cemetery's decay- Slatka Pani, the \\"slum lord\\"- Recognition of River Road (the main street in this tiny town)- Mention of local taverns by their real names. Bars outnumbered churches by a ratio of at least 5 to 1- The closed society of Polish immigrants primarily from Warsaw and KrakowThrough this book Block brings life back to what is now a decaying steel mill town which is rapidly eroding toward ghost town status. She contrasts the beauty and simplicity of small town life with the hidden secrets that lived and died in Natrona, PA.This book brings back my reflections on a safe, carefree childhood combined with the mysterious morals and ethics my grandparents brought with them from war torn Poland - the pain that is ever-present in the eyes of the elders, but never discussed. The people who lived in \\"Hyde Bend\\" learned to celebrate the joys of today and bury the pains of the past. Brett Ellen Block brings this these hidden feelings to the surface in \\"The Grave of God's Daughter: A Novel\\"."},{"Title":"The Grave of God's Daughter: A Novel","review":"This novel, written aginst a backdrop of rural industrial Pennsylvania circa 1939-40 is strikingly similar to a &quot;A Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot;, albeit a darker version. The central character, a young girl, raised to be close to her younger brother Martin, remains (notably) unnamed thrughout the novel. She projects love, and silently screams out for love throughout this novel. Sadly, the return of love manifests in ways all too subtle and, so, unrecognizable to a young child.The saddest part of this novel is a scene where, after she has burned her hands on a pot of hot water, boiled to bathe her brother, she reaches for the washroom door only to have the door jerked from her by her father, entering from the living area. She then lowers her head, mumbles an apology, and brushes past him. At this point you can feel the inner turmoil of this woman/child. All she wanted was some small token of recognition. A smile. A word. Something.An unexpected ending underscores this brilliant novel of growing up, complete with the yearning for acceptance, identity and love.I highly recommend this wonderful, evocative novel. It's not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Grave of God's Daughter: A Novel","review":"Excellent descriptive powers and some deeply expressive passages don't save this novel from being an inexplicable waste of time. We have a cold, harsh mother, terrified children and a horrific neighborhood to rival anything written by Dickens. It seems the poor have no compassion or friendship or even a moment of hope. A mother who appears to risk everything for her children doesn't want to be around them or even speak to them when they are. A brother jumps from a timorous childhood to alcoholic adulthood with barely a clue (he is accused of being a sissy). Our narrator, the young girl who lives in this Stygian hell longs for her mother's love and attention but spends most of her time avoiding her. We don't even find out what led to her adult circumstances. Even the title of the book seems an attempt to pull togther a concept that never works. And what was that whole side narrative on dog fighting? A lament on cruelty to animals? Okay....but it all just fell off a plank of dispair with the rest of the novel.I have become increasingly discouraged by authors coming out of writing degree programs and workshops with all the skills guarenteed for publication while they lack the experience to come up with a compelling and moving narrative with characters we can care about. This was just an exercise in descriptive construction that left me feeling I'd lost valuable hours of my life that I will never recover. In fact I feel the same way about this review so I'm finished."},{"Title":"The Grave of God's Daughter: A Novel","review":"For a first novel this isn't too bad. Clearly, the first thing on which you need to concentrate when writing your first book--or any book for that matter--is to tell a good story. Ms. Block certainly does that here; it is very compelling and the pages almost seem to turn themselves. Beyond that, though, there is not much else. The characterizations are a little thin, the setting demands far more attention, and there are aspects in the relationships between her characters that are puzzling and require explanation.It is a girl's coming-of-age story--told by her in the first person--and is framed by her adult visit to her mother's funeral many years later. It takes place in a western Pennsylvania town in 1941 that is mostly inhabited by Polish immigrants. Just about everyone in town is poor but her family with their alcoholic father is more so than most. In any event, she wakes up one day and notices that the one precious item in their meager household--an iconic painting--is gone. She assumes that her father has pawned it for booze money, and decides she is going to get it back. The plot has to do with her efforts to obtain enough money to do so and as she does, she makes some surprising and very sad discoveries about herself and her family.As mentioned, it is a good plot, but the setting is downright weird. The Polish inhabitants of this town are a very closed society and don't tolerate outsiders. Just about all of them are grim and petty and mean-spirited and there doesn't seem to be a sense of humor in any of them. They are vicious to the one black guy who comes through, violent to a retarded boy, and overly harsh towards their children. In other words, their behavior in this strange place is at odds with what we know of human nature. No, this situation is not impossible, but it does seem improbable, and much more than is offered here would be needed to make this place real. As it is, it remains a work in progress, not fully developed.The narrator's primary motivation in re-acquiring the icon is so that her mother will finally show her some love, or acknowledgement, or even simple recognition. But it is never explained how the mother became this way. The father is also uncommunicative and distant, but at least in his case the plot reveals a possible reason why. One wishes that the narrator--again, speaking from an adult perspective--would have shed a little more light on this. Better yet, it would have been nice to see her parents in action, or perhaps carrying on conversations with each other or their children, so that the reader can figure it out for himself. But, unfortunately, without exposition or revelation these characters remain stale.The kids, though, are done very well. The narrator determinedly confronts her fears yet is also quite nervous about the venial sins she finds she must commit in order to complete her tasks, and which go against the teaching of the Catholic nuns at her school. Her younger brother also come across very sympathetically, a sensitive and intelligent little soul attached to his picture book.In the end, it is an enjoyable read, and a good first novel. One looks forward to seeing more depth in her next effort."},{"Title":"The Grave of God's Daughter: A Novel","review":"I loved this book though many of the people in it are not the way she describes them. knowing the author as a child i am glad the she wrote this book she will be a big writer some day.

It taught me that there are things worse than death, that it's better to lose a noble fight than live as a popular billionaire betrayer. The fact that these men go back, not for blind betrayal, like Coriolanus, but to rescue their people from the cancerous wealthy still speaks to me in these days of war and corporate profit.This is not Tolstoy, or even Clarke, but it is an honest tale with a truth to be told."},{"Title":"THE LAST DEATHSHIP OFF ANTARES","review":"Your typical sci-fi book-movie would have warriors killed or injured after pitched battles between two sides. but few have told of what happened to those captured. stuck for years in deathships cos the antlike aliens who caught them found it beneath their dignity to kill warriors who surrendered in battles, the humans have nothing to do but kill each other for food (ant gruel or cannibalism -- what a choice). how they survived and descriptions of the deathships off the antares platform are great. i like the way the 'anties' treat them to make sure they all die in the end but in a slow excruciating manner.

My main issue with it, however, was excessive exposition. This, I'll admit, might just be my own issue. I tend not to like a lot of descriptive verbiage and this one has pages and pages of it that I basically skimmed.I thought the main story was interesting and generally well laid out. The author did a lot of flashing back and forth in time, especially early in the book, to provide the back story on certain elements. Some of it I didn't think were necessary or useful at all, but some was helpful. The main character (Locke Lamora) was one that definitely grew on me.

The story proceeded with a good pace. There was very little 'down time' in this story; something was always happening or about.The Cons:1.) A story that had characters were so shallow and one dimensional that the book was difficult to finish.2.) Profanity!...profanity that was excessive and unnecessary (were talking about the 'f ' word here). Profanity that occurred in situations that, generally speaking, it was very unlikely to happen. e.g. When Locke was speaking to the members of the upper crust of the Camorr society; and even more unbelievable was that fact that these members of Camorr's nobility never said a thing about our hero's continuous vulgarisms.Let me add this; I have no problems with swearing in novels when it is done in the 'proper' situation, (there are times where swearing adds realism to the situation (depending on who is speaking and what is going on at the moment). However, this novel exceeded even my level of 'reasonable' swearing tolerance. I find it hard to believe that one of the editors didn't get this problem discussed and corrected. (then again, maybe they did, but the suggestions went unheeded.)1 1/2 Stars.Ray Nicholson"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The world created is very immersive.

The characters created are very rich and convincing.The book is a lot about the world of thieves and especially one called Locke Lamora. I was very interested in reading how he reaches his goals with his various cons and tricks.The one thing I did not like too much about the book was the late introduction of the antagonist and how he explained his reasons for him being there.

I'm very impressed. This has massive amounts of imagination in a world-system that often surprises, as fantasy with SF overtones.

The main character, Locke Lamora, is an orphan after a plague outbreak taken in by a Thiefmaster.

Then he grows up and malevolent forces begin to move in his home of Camorr. Locke and his Gentlemen Bastards become embroiled in the trouble with interesting results.This book is well written, somewhat in the style of Oliver Twist. There are flashbacks interspersed with 'present day' which, after the prologue, take a little getting used to and don't technically carry throughout the entire book. Some of the dialogue has a tendency to seem a little forced, but overall is engaging. Character development is interesting and believable. After one of the major events in the book, which is a little over halfway through the body of the novel, events move quickly.

I picked up the book as fast as I could.Unlike other reviews, I loved the first 100 pages. I just didn't find anything special about the tale. In some instances I feel like the description paragraphs were overdone, which is surprising for me to say since I fancy elaborate prose. There was also a few moments where the profanity appeared forced. I have no personal objections to obscene language in books, but unless the book is meant to be a jarring read (like Fight Club), it should come off natural - just like anything, really.Character sympathy extended to half of the crew.

The dialogue crackled, the characters were interesting and well-developed, and the setting was amazing. Lynch created a world that I didn't want to leave. It was a lot of fun following along with Lamora and his gang as they attempted to outwit the corrupt upper crust of his Viennese-like city. This is some top-notch writing and highly recommended!Joel Arnoldauthor of BEDTIME STORIES FOR THE APOCALYPSE"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I picked up Scott Lynch's The Lies of Locke Lamora with high hopes because I've really got a thing for stories about confidence men. I don't know why. I guess that's something to philosophize about another time...I did like Locke Lamora. Lynch has created a unique and fascinating world full of wonderful creations such as a crime boss who rules his empire from a houseboat, his little daughter who sits on his lap drinking ale and kicking subordinates with her steel-toed boots, a blind priest who begs for alms and eats gourmet meals off fine plates in his luxurious cellar, noblemen who live in glowing glass towers, a blood-sucking rose garden, alcoholic oranges, and women who fight jumping man-eating sharks for sport. This is truly entertaining stuff!The pace of the novel was quick and the plot was simple, but interesting. Flashback interludes often broke up the action, which was occasionally irritating. At first I wondered if the editor had dropped the manuscript and not got it put back together in order, but I soon realized that these flashbacks serve to give us information about the world without major info-dumps, and backstory on the characters without having to watch them grow up. The pace escalated during the last 100 pages or so, and I couldn't put it down.Scott Lynch generally writes very well, but I do have three minor complaints in that regard. First is that the first half of the book is slightly over-written. The dialogue is too witty and clever. The smartest and best-educated people you know would have felt dull-witted while conversing with Locke and his gang of thieves. The narrator, also, tries a bit too hard to impress, and this makes for some slightly awkward prose. But the writing was toned down in the latter half of the book as the action picked up and things got more serious. I expect, now that Mr Lynch has proved himself, his writing style will become more natural, and better for it.Second is the profanity. While I don't mind reading profanity in a fantasy novel (especially one whose main characters are the dregs of society), if it is overused, it loses its potency. I once remarked to one of my grad school professors that he needed to coin some new curse words because he cursed so much that it was impossible for his students to know when he was really mad. Likewise, Locke and his friends curse so often for no apparent reason that, by the end of the novel, when those words would have been most meaningful and appropriate, they lose all effect and the climactic scenes lose a bit of poignancy. I don't doubt that Locke and his friends would curse as much as Mr Lynch portrays but, since we can't actually hear inflections and tones of voice, Mr Lynch would do better technique-wise to make those words count by using them to give us clues about a character's state-of-mind.Third, there are 499 pages in my hardback edition, and I think the word \\"alchemical\\" was used 499 times in this story. If you've got some friends who want to read The Lies of Locke Lamora with you, I suggest getting together with a bottle of your favorite liquor, appointing a designated reader (and driver), and every time he or she reads the word \\"alchemical\\"....But these are minor complaints -- enough to keep this from being a 5-star book, but not enough to keep me from greatly enjoying it. I'm looking forward to the next installment. If there's anything I like nearly as much as stories about confidence men, it's stories about pirates, so the two combined should be just my thing. And I really look forward to exploring more of Scott Lynch's world."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I can't believe this is Scott Lynch's first novel. The plot is so carefully constructed, the writing so elegant, the characters so believable that it seems like the work of a much more experienced author. I guess Lynch just has a lot of natural talent.The Lies of Locke Lamora is a witty and fun fantasy adventure. It is well-paced and exciting from the very beginning. The story is complex, with unexpected twists and turns. Lynch is an excellent world-builder, and Camorr is vividly painted through his words--a sort of fantastical Venice. In fact, Camorr was for me one of the most engrossing elements in the story. I felt like Lynch really immersed me in this fantasy city in a way that made me want to stay there.If you enjoy Matthew Stover's books, you will love Scott Lynch. There are a lot of similarities between the two authors, though Lynch is less over-the-top than Stover (in terms of violence, language, gross-out factor, etc.), which I think makes Locke Lamora more fun. This book is lighter reading than, say, Heroes Die, or than George R.R. Martin's Song of Fire & Ice, but I think that's a good thing. This is a book that is easy to enjoy because it is a great adventure with compelling characters in a compelling setting. I am excited that it is the beginning of a new series, because I am really looking forward to reading a lot more from Lynch!Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"\\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" is an amazing, artful, and ambitious piece of work, but it does have a first-novel feel to it. Maybe when you get to the 720th page you'll feel that there are some scenes that could have been eliminated, some scenes that could have gone more smoothly, and some descriptive passages that could have been shortened.But here's what you'll find: Scott Lynch has tried for the picaresque fantasy, and has created for his setting the city of Comorra, which is meant to resemble Venice, although clearly the book is not set on planet earth. This world has multiple moons, ruins of a previous civilization, and sorcery is practiced.It has literary pretensions (it's published by Bantam Spectra, which specializes in that sort of thing), and while it is certainly well-written, Lynch (fortunately) lacks the \\"look at me! I'm writing!\\" pretentiousness of some of his contemporaries in this field. His grifter-hero, Locke Lamora, is a fascinating rogue, and the plot takes delightful twists and turns. It's not always a fun read, though: some of the scenes, for example when Locke tricks a money-lender out of his fashionable outfit, are amusing, but there are scenes of graphic violence, too.Mr. Lynch has come up with an interesting, but occasionally frustrating, way to tell the tale. He provides \\"interludes,\\" which flash back to Locke's days as an apprentice to a supposedly blind priest, and he means them to throw some light, and some hints, on the action that is taking place in the book's \\"present.\\" While they do provide information as to why Locke and his fellow \\"gentlemen bastards\\" behave as they do, they tend to appear while Locke is hanging from a literary cliff--and some of them don't supply enough information to make the diversion worthwhile, and a few of them seem tossed in simply because, well . . .Notes and asides: First of at least three, but complete in itself. Not for children under 13."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The Lies of Locke Lamora is surprisingly interesting, if not overly hyped, fantasy entry by a debut author who shows flashes of brilliance in his prose. Perhaps the book's greatest strength is the way in which Lynch interweaves both the current exploits of the characters with the history of the land he's describing through well-placed interludes.Surprisingly, I wasn't hooked on the tale until around the 185 page mark where the scheming, lying, and just general conniving of the lead cast becomes more than just a novelty and instead an integral part of the plot. I particularly enjoyed Lynch's ability of painting Locke and company into corners that even the most thorough reader cannot conceivably overcome.Also noteworthy is the author's commitment to realism in the form of lead character deaths. Not to give any spoilers, let's just say that not everyone you'll come to know makes it to the end. Additionally, his references to alien technology are certainly interesting and play a consistent role in the environment itself.It appears Lynch's use of modern slang/ profanity in Locke's dialog has been met with mixed reaction. On the one hand he does an admirable job of creating a character with a nice dose of attitude in a world where only the strong survive. On the other, there's little in terms of character maturity save for physical growth.The overall pacing is impressive thanks in no small part to the historical interludes mentioned above fitting neatly between chapters, which, themselves, are broken into multiple parts. It's always easy to put off sleep, work, or other responsibilities with the logic \\"just one more section.\\"All in all, a fun read that does a commendable job steering clear of the more common fantasy genre clich&eacute;s with enough intrigue and personality to warrant some attention. Based on what I've heard about the sequel, it's yet to be determined whether Lynch represents the next big thing in fantasy or happened to get lucky with The Lies of LL."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I just finished reading this novel and I am happy to report it was better than I expected it to be. I had purchased this one a while ago and it sat on my \\"to be read\\" shelf for some time. At least its turn came and almost immediately I was drawn into the complex but beautifully laid out world of Locke Lamora. The overall premise is very basic, as several other reviewers have already noted. It has an air of Oliver Twist to it, with some good old fashioned betrayal and revenge mixed in. I fully enjoyed the mix of plots and characters which I think were all well drawn by the author. Some of which I thought were so well done they could carry a story of their own (I can only hope). I also liked how the story would allude to a long forgotten \\"alien\\" civilization but did not delve too deep and take away the momentum of the story. Which brings me to my next point, pacing. The story was very well paced which is to say it moved along at warp speed, the pages will fly by if you give this one a chance. I read that this is the first of a projected series and I hope that all of the successive novels in this series are as good as this one was."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The book tends to bounce between the main character as a child and as an adult so be aware that you will be reading basically two separate story lines. While the story is very well done there is a few mysteries that the author hints at but don't seem to be related to the story. Random comments about an ancient civilization are introduced but don't seem to go anywhere. While this book is the beginning of the series it just didn't make sense for the author to make commentary about the architecture unless he was intending to have the main character discover something unique about it. Outside of these mild annoyances I am really enjoying the series. I am looking forward to more from this author."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I'll start by saying this book is really more of a 3.5/5 for me. 4 seems slightly too high but 3 seems too low for how much I enjoyed it. It wasn't masterfully written, the characters aren't incredibly complex, and the story definitely had it's small flaws BUT I really had fun reading it. It was definitely enjoyable and that has to be worth something when you're reviewing literature right?I guess in general it was slightly more juvenile writing than I normally read but I would still recommend this."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"What a sharp, witty, sometimes sardonic, sometimes heartbreaking beginning to what I believe promises to be a true standout in the epic fantasy field - characters very well developed (or, develop*ing), interesting plot, cool city. Great book."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"A great series with good character development. The second one seemed a little flat in the first half, but picked up just fine in the second half.Of course the last one left room for more stories... good news imho."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"If you are a child, poor and in the underclass in Camorr, there is not much you can do to change your circumstances. Well, unless you are damn good at lying, thieving and mummery. And Locke Lamora is very very good at all of them.Camorr, with a lot of parallels to Venice, is run by either gangs, or by the upper class, or perhaps by both, working in congress.Locke, orphaned and alone, is recruited into one notorius gang, but is so much trouble he's passed on to a somewhat more sophisticated level of thievery and cons. There, his exploits gain him some not necessarily great attention. He becomes \\"The Thorn of Camorr and that's where things begin to go pear-shaped. Who is out to get him and his the rest of his gang, 'the Gentleman Bastards' and why?Good pacing, good writing and engaging characters you really want to root for. Some very surprising twists. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I was very pleased with this book. I read a fair amount of fantasy, and consider myself a good judge of authors. The characters in this book are extremely enjoyable. I would highly recommend reading this book solely because there is nothing remotely like it being sold. The plot, the characters, the comedy, and the witty banter are all noteworthy. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I read The Lies of Locke Lamora knowing almost nothing about it when I began. A friend had recommended it some time before, and I started on a whim, and then couldn't put the book down. Locke is a charming, multi-layered protagonist inhabiting a vivid and unique setting. Even the more minor characters are fleshed out, and the detail Lynch has put into the world is enchanting without being distracting. The plot, much like the hero, employs many tricks and turns, but remains so charming that you don't care if it's conning you, so long as you get to enjoy more time in Locke's company. It's a book you don't want to end, and can't wait to reread."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Excellent story and one of the few books to make me laugh out loud. The characters are well done, realistic, and rounded."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I bought this book based on previous reviews I read on the web. They were quite accurate as the book is magnificent. Not one dull or boring moment. Very fast paced, really well told, interesting characters, great setting, leaves much to grab at later, (there are hopefully six more books on the way!)Highly recommended, I couldn't put it down. The last 3 fantasy books I had tried to read were a PITA, I just ditched 2 in the process: Wicked by G. Maguire and The mirror of her dreams by S.R.Donaldson and the other I read but in constant agony and boredom: Dragonflight by A. McCaffrey. In comparison TLOLL was a blessing.Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book is an amazing read. I couldn't put tt down from start to finish. It is undeniably dark, but has loads of witty banter, character depth and action. Simply a page turner."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"For a first book, a nice start. Good central characters. Interesting world. Starts off better than it finishes. Liked it well enough to buy next book in series, which was a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I've always been a sucker for stories with strong anti-heroes as the main character, and after finishingGaebrel's Gamble (The Nine Suns)by Zackery Arbela, I knew I needed another fix. Then I hit the mother lode, as it were, with the Lies of Locke Lamora. For anyone looking for that old school sword and sorcery reminiscent of Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar, this will certainly hit all the right spots. No noble elves and square-jawed heroes without a blemish on their character here, just thieves, backstabbing and glorious betrayal.To summarize: Lock Lamora is a thief, and a pretty good one at that, doing his thing in the city of Camorr (think Golden Age Venice meets Dickensian London...) Crime in this city is under the control of a mafia-like Don, which has brought an element of order to the once-chaotic streets (an arrangement supported by the powers that be in the city...) But then a new player moves into town, bodies start piling up, and Locke Lamora is forced to embark on a series of wild cons and hair-raising escapades to save his life and those he loves.Picaresque romance mixed with a hint of tragedy and biting social commentary...what's not to like?"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I have just finished reading the Lies of Locke Lamora and I am impressed with the quality of the story. Mr. Lynch weaves a complex tale of betrayal and revenge that keeps you guessing all the way along, there was a momento when I thought I have figured out the identity of the antagonist just to completely miss my mark. I have read comparisons to Ocean's Eleven in a Fantasy setting. The comparison is fair although I really prefer the fantasy setting of the story.Relating to world building, the author makes a complete job of creating a compelling world with its own rules of magic, there is magic, there are fantastic creatures, but they are not the drivers of the story. What moves the plot are the characters and their quirks.I really enjoyed this story and already started on the second book of the series."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book was just awesome, from the character development to the one liners through out just a very fun (albeit) very dark novel with the right blend of humour and brutality."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I read a review that called these stories a bit like oceans 11. True. These are great stories of wit and deception. You will immediately like the main character. These are written well too."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I knew Scott from livejournal but I didn't even think to buy his books until he wrote a very mean but spot-on parody of Orson Scott Card's homophobic Hamlet book. As with most books by people that I have met in passing, I was reluctant to read it (I have read too many mediocre books by people that I like and it always makes me sad). Besides, my love of fantasy has waned considerably since high school (only to be recently revived by George RR Martin).That preamble is there to say that the only reason why I am happy that I delayed reading this book is because I will have less time to wait for the third book (already got the second book).This book begins with a scene out of Oliver Twist, only instead of an innocent orphan, Locke is presented as the boy that is too incorrigible even for the Fagin-like head of the pickpockets. The book is irreverent and hilarious from the beginning. Locke Lamora is the kind of rogue with a moral code that has inhabited fiction for decades, but not so much in fantasy. The opening half sets up a lot of the characters and takes a casual tone.The fact that I hated Scott a little when he killed off a character that was only in a few scenes tells you something about the emotional investment that you will develop for these people. The introduction of the grey king comes in mysterious ways and even when the grey king shows up, it doesn't ruin his mystique.There are so many things to love in this book. The flashbacks which set up dread that Locke attacks, the \\"anyone can die\\" tone of the book and the hilarious dialogue. What impressed me most about this book is that it could have fallen into a \\"it was all a setup by the main character who is seemingly omniscient\\" cliche that infects movies like Oceans 11 and shows like Dr Who. Locke screws up and has to recover from some serious setbacks. There are some real stakes happening in this book and by the time I got to the halfway point, I needed to stay up late in order to finish. I did not want to go to sleep not knowing what came next."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"It started off slow and turned out fantastic. Fans of fantasy and heist stories will love this one, as well as anyone who loves a rich story and memorable characters."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Ok, I apologize for the bad pun/rhyme. But I don't understand the 3 and 4 star reviews. It's possible some people's expectations are a tad too high and I don't know why. (ugh more rhyming :) For example, there's the review which gives it 4 stars and compares it to Tolkien, Moorcock and Martin. SRSLY?This is the first book by the author and it's fabulous. The characters are good. The story is engrossing. It's got a fresh take on historical fiction/fantasy. There's no Deus ex Machina. While some of the plotlines are predictable, I am surprised many a time. The back story is pleasantly well fleshed out. The back and forth between flashback and present-day works exceedingly well.Was it perfect? No. But this is a first effort and I can't wait for more. Given some of the drivel gets 3 stars around here, anything less than 5 is an insult. I look forward to more from the author. And I highly recommend it for your reading pleasure."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"A thief-story meets a fantasy novel and they go out shopping in Venice. From the humble point of view of a non-native speaker, the book was a pleasure to read. The only drawback, though it can be a major one at times, is that the constant flashbacks and/or interludes are sometimes really anti-climatic, especially in the last part when action became more fast paced."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This is the first effort I have read by this author. Very pleased with the product. Pace was fairly fast, characters were very interesting. I have purchased the next book in this series."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"After I got to the point where one character was pretending to strangle another character for about 5 pages where they kept jumping back and forth between the present and the past without giving much indication that they were doing so, I put the book down and have had no desire to pick it back up. It took me about 4 days to get 50 pages into this book. In comparison It took me about 5 days to completely finish \\"The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)\\" and 7 days to finish \\"The Wise Man's Fear: The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day Two (Kingkiller Chronicles)\\". I haven't been this let down by a book since Gerorge rr Martin showed he can suck at writing as bad as any first time author with \\"A Feast for Crows\\" (another book I could not finish)."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I suppose my idea of a fantasy is different than the modern day version--a crass, everyday term as every other word, depressing, and completely unscrupulous...if I wanted those things, I'd read the paper. When did we get so negative? Can't we have the hero anymore?"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The story is very interesting but the way it is written really put me off. The constant flashbacks is annoying because it unnecessarily intrudes on the story telling. All the characters aren't very interesting either. After reading Death of a Necromancer (similar book about a genius thief in a world full of rich, corrupt nobles), this book pales in comparison. I don't recommend it to others."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Boring in parts and I have to admit that I skipped parts of the book. Still looking for a really good Fanatasy read."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This was highly recommended and ended up being the worst fantasy book I've ever read.What it lacks in sympathetic or believable characters, it makes up for with plot holes and deus ex machina. Don't worry, the hero never dies (it's the first book in a series, see), but not because he's smart and resourceful -- it's because the author repeatedly saves him from death with the stroke of a pen.There's very little original thought here, just a mash up of ideas the author found in other books or video games or movies and thought would be cool:* Gang of child thieves (ahem, Oliver Twist)* Identical twins who finish each others' sentences (a la Samneric from Lord of the Flies, Fred & George from Harry Potter...)* The mafia* It's set in Venice (or the equivalent)* An intelligence chief called the Spider (like Varys the Spider in George RR Martin)* Characters killed for no reason (this does not make you George RR Martin)* Random swearing (and I mean random -- when most people swear it's related to what they're saying or thinking of - has the author ever heard a real person swear?)* All-powerful magicians who have power over you by writing your secret, true name that you tell to no one, like Ged in Earthsea. Just kidding - they have power over you by writing your given name that you tell to everyone. Middle names don't count. Not sure about the rules on nicknames; guess it has to be the name on your long form birth certificate.* Magical sea creatures that make a surprise appearance (no forshadowing, just written in for fun) and are easily defeated by your friends who happen to show up at just that moment* All crooks -- all characters -- are super smart, or super dumb, or both, but always cardboardLuckily this is all tied together nicely by prose somewhere between mediocre and lackluster."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The book was fine if you only care about the action and story.but in truth the characters were horribly bland, and not because the author gave them bland personalitiesit was because his writing offered absolutely no view on their characters inner selfs, what they thought of how they felt.he hardly ever even told you they were talking with a specific emotions.the large amount of swearing throughout the bookw as one of the things that gave this book a l ittle b it of color against all that gray,but most people seemed to hate even that.I got as far as I could but eventually I found myself reading through words without paying attention to what they were.I need deeper character development in the novels I read."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I expected something light hearted with a fox outwitting the farmer conclusion. Instead it was page after page of violence and gore-and that would be SLOW PACED violence and gore. The plot twists were intriguing but the resolution so downbeat and the ugliness so sad & overwhelming I couldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"A more appropriate title for this shlockfest would be THE LIES OF SCOTT LYNCH and though the story may be about a con artist, the true con artist is Lynch himself. How in the world such a bloated, overwritten mess ever got such high praise is beyond me. As this is a debut novel, I can excuse some of the \\"oh my isn't this so wonderful\\" reviews written by the author's friends and family. They probably had good intentions, but there are so many of them its a bit too much especially when the book itself is so bland, boring and subpar.Even when you look past one of the most egregious flaws in the book, the lack of any real depth, you can't help but think that the people in the story are little more than caricatures. It's like the author had an idea for his characters but never bothered to develop them. Even the main character, Locke, is little more than the author's puppet on a string.Who in the world edited this shlock? Every character from the lowly Locke to the higest born speaks exactly the same. Worse, they all cuss every five seconds, if only for the perceived shock value doing so brings. Apparently, the author believes if he throws the f-word and a few others around with enough frequency no one will notice how poorly written and subpar his story really is.Someone also should demonstrate to the author the difference between showing and telling. Clearly, he doesn't understand the difference. He's constantly telling when he should be showing, and it pulls you right out of the story.Composing sentences isn't the author's strong suit. He constantly drops verbs (no I'm not kidding). Characters sigh, grunt, cough, etcetara their dialogue more than they say it. Note to author, the word is said. Said is a word. Character don't need to look at their feet, shift their hands, cough, grunt or sigh everytime they prepare to speak.It gets worse. One minute the author's describing things in minute detail, the next no detail at all. Examples a plenty:Locke couldn't tell if the four women were truly beautiful, but they were undeniably striking. ***Huh?Idler's day, the eleventh hour of the morning, at the shifting revel. ***Huh?Calo snorted, \\"This Gray King mess will be over in a few months, Bug.\\" ***Huh?\\"This isn't working,\\" he said, less than two hours later. \\"I'm sorry, it's ... not your fault.\\" The room was dark and exceedingly pleasant. *** Huh?The Gray King's man threw down his crossbow and reached for a blade at his belt. Locke scooped up the crossbow and fell upon the intruder, howling. *** Huh?Locke and Calo slipped down the hallway, sweating now, but barely letting their heavy cloaks flutter as they moved. \\"Listen,\\" he murmured. Clang, clang... footsteps...clang, clang. *** Huh?This awful prose fills this book and the others Lynch has written. It doesn't get better as it goes along, I wish it did since I bought the entire awful series."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews and was unfortunately disappointed. The characters were flat, undeveloped and wholly uninteresting. By page 200, I realized I didn't care what happened to the characters or story and chucked it to my \\"donate to the library\\" pile. Don't buy this if you like stories with well-drawn characters you can relate to or care about."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I can't for the life of me figure out how anyone can give this a positive review. Incredibly boring read. I just finished reading the First Law series, the Night Angel Trilogy, and the first book of the Kingkiller Chronicles. I'm not sure if these are all debuts but they are far more entertaining than this crap."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I am trying to decide whether the fact that something about this Lynch novel reminded me of the best of the fabulous and uneven Thieves' World series is only because of the sects and the thieves. I have decided \\"probably\\" and agreed to agree with myself that the resemblance is only in my own head. Still, I had that thought (kind of a sense association) when I was reading The Lies of Locke Lamora-- and definitely in a good way.Locke is one in a long and honorable line of fantasy anti-heroes. Orphaned, talented at all the wrong things, imperfect and endearing and clever. We learn enough about him to make him extremely real. Still, there is enough mystery left under the surface (his mysterious lost love) to make me anxious to readRed Seas Under Red Skiesonce it appears in paperback.The book has some messy moments, and some elements that might have been sewn up more tightly or more perfectly. Still, I enjoyed myself immensely while reading it. I wouldn't change a word.Messy or not, the spirit was somehow just right."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The fact that this book is a first effort by Scott Lynch is amazing in and of itself, however there are many authors with great first effort novels. What I think is so amazing about this book is the fact that this story is one that could easily transcend the fantasy genre into mainstream appeal.The story is written with a very quick wit, a compelling set of characters, especially the main protagonist of the book, and the story is a fun ride from beginning until end. This is a story of intrigue, humor, friendship, good, evil and revenge.Locke Lamora is a character who is multi faceted, he's a thief, but one of the \\"good guys\\" and you will find yourself very attached to him and his gang of \\"Gentlemen Bastards\\" and cheering for them as they battle the sinister forces arrayed against them.The style of the book has the story progressing in time, but spaced with interludes that go back and detail parts of Locke's life before the story takes place. This ultimately increases the suspense of the book as the interludes keep you turning the pages. In some books this would be frustrating, but in this book the interludes serve to illustrate things that are going to be relevant to the upcoming chapter. It also continues to develop and define the characters in a way that would otherwise be tedious if done in a more straightforward manner.I look forward to the upcoming series. In this case, if you are a fantasy reader (or love suspenseful and entertaining novels!), put this book at the top of your list....even in hardcover."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I've just finished reading my advance copy of The Lies of Locke Lamora, and Scott weaves an exciting and suspenseful tale. I can't really describe how good it is without giving away plot points or twists; but suffice it to say, it's amazing. I very much enjoyed my read, and even lost sleep working on \\"just one more chapter\\". But hey, don't take my word for it; take George R. R. Martin's; his review is here on Amazon, as well as on the cover of the book (at least my copy)."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I started this thinking this would be a grand fantasy read, but the fantasy elements in this one are rather light. That's okay, and I wouldn't have minded so much if the rest of the book made up for the fantasy-lite experiences. However, the book starts off rather slow. It's a long while before it picks up as the author lays out the elaborate \\"scheme\\" the characters are involved in. Those were some of the slowest parts. It did pick up in parts of the book and there were so geniune good moments, but in the balance of things, not enough. Also, I'm no prude. I swear myself on occassion, but the characters swear nearly every time they speak, high class, low class, middle class, they all do and for not reason. I swear when I'm mad or tense. The characters in this swear for no reason at all except that the author seems to think it's cool. On the plus, and the reason for 2 stars, is some of the action scenes were pretty good, but they were far apart and few."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book probably deserves three stars, but I was so disappointed after having read so many glowing reviews that I can't help but give it a lower rating! The main character doesn't seem to have any substance at all. He's supposed to be extremely clever, witty, and street-smart, but he makes mistake after mistake in his adventures, getting his friends killed in the process. I found the one-liners to be inappropriate and annoying. The swearing doesn't bother me too much, I just didn't feel any respect or sympathy for the main character. It's not really the same type of literature, but you might try Robin Hobb's Farseer series if you're looking for something better."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I found this book via Livejournal, I believe through the journal of Elizabeth Bear, which led me to journal for Scott Lynch. I liked his posts enough (the writing style and attitude, etc), and tLoLL was highly praised enough, that I went ahead and bought it, despite the fact that I rarely purchase hardcover books by authors whose writing is unknown to me.I'm awfully glad I did. Although I think my wallet may be a little annoyed...this is going to be a series,which means I will have a number more hardcover books to buy!OK, to the meat of the thing:I very much enjoyed this book. The characters were engaging, the plot was suitably complex, and I wasn't able to guess every twist and turn. I particularly liked the character development -- even the characters I didn't like, I didn't like for good reason! I've seen reviews (and read one particular reader-author interchange) that mention the swearing by the characters. Yes, there is a good bit of swearing, but it's not *that* much, and it is all appropriate to both the characters, the world, and the story.It took a bit for me to get used to the timeline jumping, but once I did, it became obvious that this was the best way to tell the story. I was *really* confused at the beginning by the references to Sabetha, who we didn't see in either the childhood interludes OR in the present-time episodes, and that was mildly irritating. But it mostly just served to make me more curious and provided more incentive to keep reading.One thing I did not like, which is really more of a pet peeve of mine, is the (over)use of italics. I thought the italics were really unnecessary for emphasis, and since at times their presence made me stop, and re-read a sentence to put the emphasis in the proper place (instead of where it sounded right in MY head), it was really annoying. Some words being italicized (such as garrista ) was acceptable, and would have actually seemed wrong had they NOT been italicized.All in all, a great new voice, and I'm really looking forward to what happens next with Locke & Jean!

Can't wait to download the next installment and begin reading. What a blast?!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This is such a good book, and compared to some of the duds I've been getting halfway through only to abandon them lately... well, what a relief. The characters are likeable and multifaceted. The plot is well-crafted and does that really satisfying thing where details and minor events from earlier in the book turn out to be important in the end. But the absolute best part is the world. The alchemy, clockworks, elderglass... it's a place I want to return to over and over, which means Scott Lynch has gained a loyal reader in me. The last time I felt this way about a world it was Jacqueline Carey's Terre D'Ange. And that was a while ago (I also really loved McCaffrey's Pern).My only quibble is with one character who seems to serve the same purpose as Wilson the neighbor in those old Home Improvement episodes--you know the one, you never see more than his eyes peeking over the fence? There's a character in this book who is only ever referenced, and while she would seem to be pretty important to the main character, you never get to meet her. I kept expecting her to turn up at some point. But hey, as flaws in a novel go, this is pretty minor.I heartily recommend this book to anyone who like adventure stories, although be aware that there's some pretty harsh violence from time to time. It's not for little kids."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I would give a five full stars to the first half of the book. It was a thrilling story packed with an unexpected twists. Main characters are very likable and one can't stop chearing for them during the ride. Few times I even compare this book to The Name of the wind (keep the hype flowing ;). Unfortunately the second part of the book wasn't that great for me. Story took different turns that I expected (for the worst) and mood of the book slightly shifts. Nevertheless it was a great read and I'm looking forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The Lies of Locke Lamora Locke is a bloody, entertaining book. Lamora, a thief with a soft heart, is one of the most engaging and clever protagonists whose adventures I've had the pleasure of reading. He almost immediately zoomed to the top of my elite and discriminating list of favorite characters. The dialogue was wicked and consistently laugh out loud *funny*, the plot twists caught me, an experienced and jaded reader, off guard, and the characters were fully fleshed and 3 dimensional. The story left me gasping, cheering, and chewing my nails in anticipation.My only complaint, and it's relatively minor especially in contrast to the immense delight I feel about this book, is that the foreshadowing structure was a little too clunky. Whenever the Gentlemen Bastards reached a crisis, the flashbacks, particularly in the first half of the book, to the lessons from Father Chains and the thieves personal histories, provided convenient resolution to the situations they faced. And the flashbacks heavily telegraphed what was going to happen. Don't let that quibble deter you from picking up the book though.RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"THE LIES OF LOCKE LAMORA is a fairly-well-hyped fantasy debut about the charismatic leader of a gang of con artists in a city that does (or tries to do) for renaissance Venice what PERDIDO STREET STATION did for Dickensian London. Overall, I enjoyed it - the prose was technically proficient, the plot hummed along efficiently, the setting was considerably more interesting than the usual plate-mail-and-offal-carts business, and there was a good deal of welcome humor. As debut novels go it's a promising start.On the other hand, it really doesn't amount to much more than an entertaining confection. The book's apparently been optioned for a movie already, and I can see why: the dialogue's relentlessly effervescent, occasionally stretching credulity past the breaking point (characters have one-liners for every occasion even while collecting broken bones and concussions like trading cards) and the screenplay-friendly three-act structure is too often embarrassingly visible underneath the flesh of the story.It's difficult to articulate my feelings on books like this. On the one hand, Lynch's technical talent clearly elevates him above the great gormless herd of modern fantasy writers already. And there's no denying that the book is very likeable indeed, while it seems unfair to fault it based only on what it could have been. On the other hand, it's just *too damn safe*. Lynch is going to be a major player in the genre - that much is obvious already - but he has it in him to do something Seriously Good rather than settling for being the next RA Salvatore. But it's not gonna happen until he gets over his fear of failure. PERDIDO had parts that worked and parts that didn't but Mieville wrote his ambition on every page in letters of fire, and the excitement swept me, the reader, away with him. Whereas LOCKE LAMORA felt like Lynch was parceling out his ideas and his talent and calculating every story beat based on whether it would make a good start for a franchise.In short, it's worth the money, even if you're not big into fantasy - I'm emphatically not, aside from staples like Tolkien, Moorcock, and Martin, and I still enjoyed it. But it's not a *necessary* book."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Scott Lynch's much-heralded debut leads readers on a dashing thief tale in the best classic fantasy vein, through a vivid Renaissance-inspired fantasy city. Locke and his companions are clever rogues who must outwit not only their marks but also the city guard, their own underworld leaders, and a new vicious underworld faction.The plot surges into high gear in the second act with the appearance of this new faction, which could have been introduced sooner. The Grey King and especially his mage are so shockingly well-informed and powerful that Locke seems helpless against them. This keeps the reader turning the pages, but it also makes Locke's eventual victory seem implausible and rushed.The climax abandons the clever thief scheming in favor of a super-villain plot out of a James Bond movie. The villain's plan is far-fetched and poorly justified, Locke's response is oddly benevolent, and the other characters' reactions to him are unrealistic bordering on authorial wish-fulfillment.The constant interlude chapters covering Locke and Jean's boyhood distract from the exciting heist plot. Lynch does relate them to the present story, but this material could have been shown more quickly and less disruptively in short flashbacks. In addition, the narrative's shallow point-of-view makes the characters feel distant. Only their most basic internal reactions and emotions are described in a point-of-view that shifts through different characters in the same scene, includes constant descriptions of the point-of-view character's own facial expressions, and artificially hides from the reader much information that the point-of-view characters obviously know. This leaves them feeling shallow, like movie characters on a screen rather than fully internalized novel characters.Lynch's strengths, the vivid setting and his constant heaping of conflict onto his characters, pull the reader through this ripping thief yarn. But _Lies_ is less than it could have been if the novel had gone deeper into both the personalities of his heroes and the justifications of his villain."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch is the first book in the Gentlemen Bastards series. Not only is it the first in the Gentlemen Bastards series, but this novel happens to be the first novel published by Mr. Lynch as well. When I first heard that this was a debut novel I was slightly hesitant, but it came with a glowing recommendation so I took the chance. Let me say right off the bat that I am very thankful that I took the chance on this new author as this novel is absolutely fantastic.There are several aspects of this novel that I think need to be reviewed.The characters really allow this novel to stand out and shine. The characters are well developed and vivid. Each character is done in such a way that they all appear unique, anything from their look to their dialog. While Mr. Lynch has added many curse words, which at times, for me anyway, shocks the reader out of the dialog, it also seems to bring a grittiness to the characters. There are quite a few characters in this novel, but I didn't find any difficulty in keeping them separate and knowing what each was doing. The main character, who I would struggle to call a hero, is a rogue who is bent on stealing from the nobles of the cit. A Robin Hood type character if you will. Mr. Lynch goes to great detail to explain and develop Locke throughout the book, and he pulls this off very well. The other assortment of characters are developed at varying degrees. This just makes sense or else the book would be huge. In my opinion the supporting cast of characters are done perfectly, not too much and not to little. There are many truly memorable characters in this book.The plot, on the surface anyway, seems rather simple in that the main character is a rogue set on fleecing the nobility out of their wealth. However, there are many things that Mr. Lynch tosses into the mix to make this a much more complicated story than just your typical steal from the rich story. This story follows Locke from when he was a very young boy all the way up to his involvement with the Gentlemen Bastards and the escapades that he routinely pulls on the noble class of the city. There are several twists and mysterious characters that are slowly added to add more depth to the story. Even though there are multiple elements added throughout the book they are not done so to cram things into this novel. It has a very steady pace and was obviously well mapped out. It's a well written plot and one that certainly leaves room for further development in later books.This novel is set up in an interesting way, in fact I have not seen a novel like this to my memory. There are regular chapters, but interspaced between these chapters, or sections really, there are flashbacks or as Lynch calls them interludes. Were he harkens back to past events that helped shape the characters actions and choices. This is certainly a unique way of putting a novel together and at times it works beautifully, but there is at least one point where I read an interlude and was a little unsure why it was included in the story or at that point in the book. For the most part though, this idea works rather well and adds a certain depth to the book.There are a few things that I wish would have been better developed, such the way magic works as well as a little more explanation of the \`thirteen'. Since this is the first book in this series I expect that these things may be explained in greater detail later.Overall, this is a fantastic book and one I am sure to recommend to many other people. It really is a gem and a surprising first release from a new author. I wonder just how good Mr. Lynch will become if this was the first release from him. I am eagerly looking forward to the second book in this series as I am sure many others will be once they give this novel a chance. Have no fear in picking this up, I think it will appease many a different fans. Certainly fantasy fans, but also others will probably like this as well."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Impressed with the positive reviews this book received, I decided to give it a read, but finished feeling like I wasted my time. I'll skip discussing thing like technique, writing style, etc. and just cut to the chase - I didn't particularly like the story. There were some parts that I found entertaining, but another reviewer described it best as a \\"confection\\". It never felt like there were any teeth here, and in particular, I found Locke's character inconsistent with the stature attributed to him. Writing \\"clever\\" is very difficult, and the action in this book never seemed as clever as the character was supposed to be."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Somehow this book managed to be lush *and* gritty and completely absorbing. The characters are real, the pace doesn't let up, the setting is three-D and colourful and dangerous. It made me laugh aloud and gasp and, in one place, cry. By the end I wanted to cheer for Locke, the lovable rogue of the title.The action centers around organized crime in a Venice-like fantasy city, focusing on the Gentlemen Bastards, a ring of young grifters who fleece nobles for fun. It's a right laugh until the new mob moves in and things turn deadly serious, setting them up for their biggest caper ever. Provided nothing goes wrong, of course.This is interspersed with the backstory of the Bastards themselves, which only adds to the richness of their characterisation and the darkness of the city and its cultures.I can't recommend this book enough. If you enjoy fantasy or crime books, it'll be a good time. It just didn't seem to have any weak spots: the characterisation, the setting, the plot were all dead-bang-right."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Entertaining plot, reasonably amusing characters, but painfully cookie cutter - felt as if it was written using the character classes from a D&D; game: \\"Hey, we've got a rogue, a wizard, a fighter, and a cleric! That's a great party!\\"Writing is decent but nothing special; a bit *too* clever at times, as other reviewers have pointed out but no jarringly awful prose. Comparisons to China Mieville are totally misguided: Mieville approaches writing as if he is trying to create great literature or at least transcend the bounds of genre fiction. Think more along the lines of Glen Cook's Garrett novels or Matthew Reilly's \\"Scarecrow\\" series, but I think Cook and Reilly take themselves less seriously.Would I recommend this book? Well, I gave it three stars...readable but not something particularly worth seeking out."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Desperate to find something to read in between Hobb's, George R.R. Martin's, Guy Gavriel Kay's, C.S. Friedman's and Donaldson's latest, I chose this title primarily based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I've been reading fantasy for over 25 years and appreciate all the aspects of world building, so was considerably dismayed when I saw my very own American foul language peppered throughout the pages of this fantasy. And despite all the rave reviews, I would argue the plot plods, the characters are two dimensional and the \\"twists and turns\\" become annoyingly repetitive and predictable half way through the tome. I feel no pathos for the orphan who only finds purpose in life when he seeks revenge. To keep this review short and put it bluntly, this book bored me enough to write my second review ever."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book - it was rich in every way - characters, place, history, magic mixed with the mundane, stories waiting to be told around every corner.This is a four-star book, and not a five, because it is like the best 'pop' music, in that it is very good for a very wide audience, but nothing is absolutely fantastic literary work that will be remembered indefinitely. If you're looking for a wonderful distraction - like a great romp of a movie, this is it.I only hesitate in that I think (and hope) that in his future efforts, we will see improvements in the following ways:**generalized spoilers follow**1. (and this is the foremost one that I struggle with) Locke may be the heroic villain, but there is no true transition from immaturity to maturity. In the beginning, he's a terrible knave and in the end he's a noble knave, but we have little reason to believe he's gone from being utterly immoral and self-centered to being loyal and somewhat principled. We are told through the narrative that he is, but the implication is that if you're an evil genius you naturally become loyal to your compatriots and have what everyone would agree is a basic approach to morality - but not absolute immorality. But in the real world, people who start out like that have to be forced into realizing they can't and shouldn't be evil. Unfortunately, I couldn't love the character as much as I might because I couldn't believe he'd really learned to be 'good' even to the small degree that he was.2. Unfortunately, Lynch did have the habit of creating 'Rocky' scenarios where the 'good guys' are totally beaten down and then suddenly out of nowhere are able to come back with a whalloping series of punches as if they'd never been down. (Granted that not everyone who we are supposed to care about works out so well, still it seems awfully fortunate time and again for Locke, in particular.)3. I personally couldn't suffer (the way I think the author wanted me to) along with Locke, through which the suffering was channeled. This is because Locke is the one responsible for everything bad that happens to him and those around him (except, I suppose, for the final dastardly plan). If, perhaps, I saw the suffering through the eyes of those who followed Locke to their doom then I would be in more pain, but of course, I might despise instead of sympathize with Locke, mightn't I?4. Unfortunately, the main foil to Locke's otherwise unimpeded genius and success comes off at the end as nothing more than a desperate and obsessed common criminal since his bankroll is apparently promises rather than genuine wealth and genius.**generalized spoilers end**But, to close on a proper note, this is a very fast-paced, FUN read. (I distinctly recall particular moments when I had to force myself to slow down so I could take in the scene properly since I wanted so badly to discover what craziness was transpiring.)1. The landscapes of the book are absolutely wonderful in every way.2. The customs and peoples and histories are rich and complete (while creating in me a desire to read whatever more may be written about them).3. The lore of magic and magicians is a wonderful unusual method that makes them unusual and exotic while not being inaccessibly legendary.I absolutely will read further installments."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This is one of the best books I have read, in the fantasy genre or otherwise. Reading this, it's hard to imagine that this is Scott Lynch's debut novel, as it reads like a book from someone who has had plenty of time to master their craft.I hate always bringing a comparison to George R.R. Martin, but here it's inevitable, for me anyways. First, I bought the book because of Martin's blurb of praise on the cover. Martin has great recommendations and he's never let me down. But not only is it a great book, Lynch's style draws comparison to Martin in many ways. It has the simple yet easy flowing prose, the sarcasm, the grittiness, the unpredictability. Yet it has a depth of character that I find more reminiscent of Robin Hobb, (just much less sadistic, as any fan of Fitz might know) as it follows mainly one character as he grows and learns his trade. If Martin and Hobb were to collaborate on a book about thieves, The Lies of Locke Lamora might be the outcome.Not to say that Lynch pulls heavily from other authors. This book is a breath of fresh air and very different from fantasy that's out there today. Honestly, I normally wouldn't be entirely interested in a book about thieving, but I found this entertaining as hell. It's loaded with action, numerous plot twists, flawed characters, sharp (and often times filthy) dialogue and plenty of moments where I laughed out loud and got strange looks from my wife.Yet even with all of that, I think Lynch's greatest strength may be his world building. Throughout the book there are interludes that flash back to Locke's past, as well as the past of other key characters -namely Jean- that provide a rich back story. These interludes aren't intrusive at all, and work really well to propel the story as a whole. It shows how the characters change and grew so much from the past to the present. This is done wonderfully. And then there's the world itself. I can tell that the author put a lot of time into the environment. I had no problem at all imagining the setting with the strange Elderglass buildings and Venice-like layout of islands and canals.From the seedy underbelly to the rich towers of the nobility, Camorr is a city worth visiting; where the villains steal and murder and the heroes... well they steal and murder too. I really have nothing negative to say about this book. Although it's the first in a series, it is a complete story within itself. The author simply uses his skill and devilishly addictive writing to ensure that you'll come back again anyways. I recommend The Lies of Loche Lamora, and its author, whole heartedly."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I almost couldn't finish this novel. I was bored from chapter one. The prologue was great, and many of the flashbacks to Locke's childhood were interesting, but the rest of the novel was not good. The book is based on one big scam that Locke and gang are planning on a nobleman, it comes to fruition pretty early in the novel, leaving the other 3/4s of the book to throw problems and trouble in Locke's way. In addition to the plot not keeping my interest, the writing style was strange. An event would happen, then we would have to go back in time and read about how it happened, just to pick back up at the event happening. An event would happen, there would be a twist, then we have to read about how exactly the thieves accomplished the twist. Just explaining the twist was enough. I really wanted to like this book, I could have given up much earlier but since I spent so much time on it I felt compelled to finish. This book is mostly dialogue, but the characters weren't interesting enough for me to enjoy that. The capers weren't funny, fun, or exciting. In my opinion, a failed attempt at something that could have been good. If told a little differently, and rearranged a bit, this book would have shown promise. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book started out a little slow (it took me a few chapters to get into the world), but once everything gets going.... wow. Lynch doesn't mess around. I find it amusing that George R.R. Martin's praises are on the cover of this book, because Lynch shares his propensity for offing thoroughly likable characters.This is one of the most satisfying books I have read, unlike many fantasy novels, this comes to a fast and speedy conclusion. The end of the book doesn't come too late or too soon, and finishes it's own story while leaving plenty of room for a long and wonderful series.Great action, unexpected twists, unreal plotlines (Isn't that what the Fantasy Genre is for?), great character flaws. What more can you ask for? Also, the Robin Hood and Little John similarities are a delight, with a few subtle nods to The Princess Bride. Also, anything that doesn't follow the Tolkeinian template is a welcome addition to any fantasy reader's shelf.I'm nervous about this book so quickly being snapped up and made into a movie... Hollywood can do horrors to this sort of book. But read it now before it gets made into a terrible movie and becomes cliche. My only problem upon finishing it is deciding to whom to lend it first."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"What I love about \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" by Scott Lynch is that it isn't your typical fantasy. The setting isn't reminiscent of Medieval England or ancient Scandinavia or the like, but rather it looks and feels like the Renaissance era of Italy. Also, the characters are much more anti-heroic than the protagonists found in other fantasy novels. And plus, the dialogue is sharp and witty (I hope you don't mind heavy profanity). The plot twists are hard-hitting, and the ending of \\"Lamora\\" leaves you wanting more. Well, luckily \\"Red Seas Under Red Skies,\\" the sequel, has come out before I bought and read this one. I'll be reading that soon.Grade: A"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Expectations to me are often the harbinger of disappointment. Hype, that flimsy, distorted bubble promising a transcendent experience, lures me inside, often only to pop, and leave me with the wet, soggy truth. Hype and reality may occasionally be bed mates, but mostly they gaze wistfully at each other from across the room.This time around, the grand Marshall of the hype parade is Scott Lynch's \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\". Extremely positive early reviews of Lynch's debut novel had quickened my enthusiasm. How can one ignore a book that is receiving proclamations of awesomeness from the fantasy literati? Would it live up to its own hype? Could it live up to its own hype, or would my expectations doom it?So tempering my enthusiasm with a healthy does of scepticism, I was greatly pleased that \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" was even better than I had anticipated. Oh yes, there is joy in Lockeville. Much joy!In fact, the novel's greatest strength is the joie de vivre that continuously bubbles through to the reader. Try to not smile, have fun and root for Locke Lamora, Lynch dares you. It is at these moments that the story becomes charming and magical. And when the latter half of the novel turns suddenly dark, the sharp contrast gives the conclusion even more gravitas.Set exclusively in the Venetian-inspired city-state of Camorr, where a grid work of canals differentiates the city's diverse districts, \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" follows, not surprisingly, Locke Lamora, orphan, con-artist, rapscallion, and the reputed \`Thorn of Camorr'. And with a moniker comes expectations. Only characters who are legendary and ooze with flair and style, may earn them. And Locke does not disappoint. Locke is the leader of a young band of grifters called the Gentlemen Bastards, who through elaborate schemes and deceptions target the Camorr upper class. The Gentlemen Bastards criminal misdeeds have earned them a place among the vast Camorrian criminal underworld headed by Capa Barvasi. Before you can say \`Mafioso', Locke and the Gentlemen Bastards find themselves embroiled in a gang war between Capa Barvasi and a mysterious newcomer, the Grey King. All the while, the Camorrian authorities, no longer willing to tolerate Locke's deceptions, are spinning a tight web around Locke. Embattled from within and without, Locke must struggle to save himself and the Gentlemen Bastards. And he must do it with style. Pesky moniker!Lynch's strengths revolve around his vivid characterizations, particularly of the main characters, Locke and his best friend Jean, and his storytelling tendencies. The banter between the characters, which is heavily infused with a male-posturing and sarcasm similar in style to that found in movies like Ocean's Eleven or Reservoir Dogs, serves as Lynch's primary means of in-depth characterization. It is dialogue clearly written with an eye cast toward the coolness factor. If this strikes you as too testosterone intensive or you are allergic to anything snarky, you may wish to look for greener pastures, elsewhere.The main storytelling is straightforward, for the most part, following a three act narrative structure. Interludes, which fill in background information on the characters, come between the chapters dedicated to the overall plot. These interludes are slightly jarring and seem more appropriate to film, where the narrative is more linearly constrained, than in a novel, where mental asides convey thought in a character. This is a minor quibble, though, and does no real harm to the novel. In the light of awesomeness, flaws become transparent.Last Word:The Lies of Locke Lamora is an auspicious debut by Scott Lynch and a very promising start to a new fantasy series. Infused with an infectious joie de vivre, the novel transcends into the magical, charming you to the very end. And leaving you to eagerly anticipate the next volume. Let the hype begin!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Fantasy book lovers (and lovers of good books in general), this book was just simply a lot of FUN! The story telling is great, the dialogue real and genuinely funny at times, and the world created feels real. Give this one a try, you will not disappointed. I am looking forward to reading the second book - Red Seas Under Red Skies. Thanks, Scott Lynch!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The debut novel from Scott Lynch, The Lies of Locke Lamora is an incredibly fun story that mixes all of the excitement and joy of Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser and Ocean's Eleven to create an imaginative tale that I found to hard to put down. The prose is fresh and rich in description, the dialogue is witty and foul-mouthed, and the plot is a delightfully Byzantine labyrinth of complex cons, double and triple crosses, sinister assassinations, alchemy, black magic, and the bonds of friendship in the face of overwhelming odds.The story takes place in Camorr, a vaguely Venetian city built by a mysterious race known as the Eldren, who fled their empire thousands of years ago for unknown reasons. Mankind has since taken up residence in Camorr as long term squatters and gotten along just fine in the eerily beautiful city. It's here that Locke Lamora and his brotherly band of Gentleman Bastards relieve the nobility of their hefty purses, always with a smile and an expertly executed con.Locke and his crew are just beginning such a scam when they become involved, much against their will, in a plot by the elusive Gray King, scourge of the underworld, to overthrow Camorr's Godfather of crime.And that's when things REALLY get interesting.I can't stress enough how much fun I had reading this book. Lynch delivers an engaging plot that continuously raises the stakes and makes you want to turn the page and find out what happens next, all the while keeping you emotionally attached to his merry band of thieves. Additionally, he does an amazing job fleshing out Camorr itself, delving into its culture, crime, religion, and daily life in a way that makes it every bit as important a character in the story as Locke. However, I will admit there were times I parsed my way through those descriptions of the city to get back to the plot. These moments were few and far between though, and rarely distracted me from the plot.The Lies of Locke Lamora is a great piece of fantasy that should not be missed by anybody. In a genre that has been choking on Too Much Of The Same Thing for years now, Lynch succeeds in putting a new spin on classic ideas, and the result is an entertaining narrative that will leave you wondering why there aren't more books like this out there."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This was a wonderful very non-traditional fantasy populated by great characters that were none of them perfect or even completely likable. The main character is an acknowledged thief, killer and conman that in a different context might have been the villain of the story. The story took place in the seedy underworld, a place that is usually only hinted at or ignored in most other fantasies. This is a story populated by the ordinary folk who were not born to power. Magic did not win the day; sheer chutzpah did. This was a wonderful fantasy which I highly recommend to anyone who wants something different than the normal sword and sorcery."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I should preface this by saying that I love con-man stories, and heist stories and the like. Harry Harrison's \\"Slippery Jim\\" DiGriz and Spider Robinson's \\"Professor\\" are two of my favorite characters in SF. On the fantasy side the list, I will very happily add Locke Lamora.This book is simply great fun. Don't look for deep soul searching or life-changing hipster-pretentious prose. What the book has is a fascinating world, and incredibly fun and audacious characters. It has its tragedies and heavy moments, but they're neither overly melodramatic or jarring to the plot. Locke's plans, if looked at objectively, might be a bit far-fetched, but the book pulls you along and draws you in so well that you won't mind straining your suspension-of-disbelief muscles a bit."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The first book by a new author is usually promising but shaky.

The story is a bit like Robin Hood meets Pirates of the Caribbean; a swashbuckling pirate tale set in a unique and interesting fantasy world, and the story hooked me in right from the get-go. This is the story of Locke Lamora, an orphan boy who learned to survive on the mean streets of Camorra, was then trained as a thief by the Thiefmaker, sold to Father Chains and trained even further. Locke is now a member of the Gentlemen Bastards, an elite group of thieves who do their dirty deeds on a much larger scale and live with the outward appearance of poverty but in their inner sanctum dine on the finest food and have a vast array of resources at their disposal. Ever plotting and scheming to achieve the big score, it's the game that keeps the Bastards going--the money they steal is secondary. At what point will Locke and his pals be in over their heads? I really, REALLY enjoyed this book! There is quite a lot of graphic violence and cussing, just as a warning for those who don't care for that sort of thing. The characters all felt very real to me, and had me rooting for them right from the beginning. Where's the next one? This one stays on my Keeper shelf! A+"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"When I read this, I eventually found myself turning pages quickly, and with anticipation. The story's about a rogue, his past, his surroundings, and his adventures. He's a grey character, a morally-mixed a tragic hero, and an interesting one to get to know. He's very far from perfect, which makes him more believable as a hero, and eventually you understand why there's a book about him.What makes the book stand out creatively, in my opinion, are how the author weaved the complex schemes our rogue would engage in, which are far more than petty pickpocketing. They're genuinely clever, well thought-out schemes on the part of the rogue and his party. Additionally, the book jumps backwards and forwards in time, chapter by chapter, in an organized way, ever more tightly weaving Locke's past with his present; this keeps things moving with anticipation as you learn about him.This, however, brings me to my first criticism of the book, which is that the introduction to the fantasy world Locke inhabits seems to go on and on, in a static fashion, with weak context. Proper names of builds, towns, rivers, regions, people, and the list goes on, are introduced in a suffocating way, sometimes in rapid-fire. I understand what the author was doing -- he was creating a Lord of the Rings or Dune-like world that opens up to the reader, pumping energy into the fabric of a world which made possible what eventually becomes a story. Well, it was a noble effort, but he overdid it. I started sighing myself at the throwaway mini-stories of parts of the town, or the region or what-have-you, the massive name-dropping of capitalized names not quite in English; at one point I remember looking down at how far I was in the book, on the Kindle I was around 12% in and he was still rapid-firing introducing throwaway proper names of people, events and places. Things as simple as a single bridge, or some silly festival; also, little things are unnecessary, like calling doctors 'physikers', an example of a distraction the author accidentally creates as he's showing you his world.When the story started, and we never bothered re-visiting the vast majority of the proper names he created, things started picking up. Plot-wise, the book was well done.My second piece of advice to the writer, and warning perhaps to the reader, is that more could have been done to create separate voices for the different characters. When you read a true world-class fantasy or sci-fi novel, you can often see a difference in the way the characters talk, not just their accents or choice of ways to express themselves, but also in what they say based on their emotions and personalities.Unfortunately, I found the characters here very two-dimension in how they spoke. I got the impression that Locke and many of his compatriots, young and old, would talk in almost exactly the same way. A lot of creative, if lewd, metaphors, sometimes amusing; but you can't have half of the characters in the novel talk like medieval George Carlins. Then there are the aristocrats, which also all have the same two-dimensional voice. There a couple of interesting evil characters in the book, but overall, the characters don't stand out from one another all that much.In short: strong on plot and creativity, weak on character development and balance."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I really enjoyed this book.If you're a fan of con men, swindlers, and heists, as well as spells and swordplay, you'll probably like this novel. I was surprised and happy with the amount of world-building that went on, until I discovered that this is to be the first of seven novels for the author. Scott Lynch never lets the action bog down in one place by alternating a chapter of story in the present with an interlude from the fictional past, where he weaves in clues that pay off later.I really don't have anything in particular that I disliked about the book, though the length may turn some people off."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This was a refreshingly fun novel, extremely well-written with great plot twists that keep the reading guessing. If you enjoy a good, fun read, this is the book for you. This book is based on its characters, like all good books should be. Locke Lamora is an intriguing person, obviously too smart for his own good, who finds ways to deceive, cheat and con, all the while having you rooting for him to succeed. The book follows several plots in the beginning, which merge into one story at the end. It also uses flashbacks in a very convincing and literate style. You look forward to reading both the current story and reading about the characters' pasts as well. There's so much hackneyed, crappy fantasy out there nowadays, reading a book like this is refreshing and I do hope the author gets more recognition for his free-wheeling writing style that doesn't overburden the reader with too many characters, too many settings, too much confusing politics, all without advancing the story. (Yes, I'm talking about George HBO Martin.) This book has a sequel, with another one on the way, but the story in this book actually ends. You don't have to read a sequel if you don't want to! Imagine that."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This is a good story, I am still reading it. I just think it is well written already and wanted to leave good feedfack for it. I almost bought the mass market paperback version because the art work on it it is so lovely, but I just find it easier to carry around my Kindle."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Picked this book up on a whim because of it's interesting title, and I was not disappointed! The story is wonderfully written with much humor and wit. The flashbacks were a little bit confusing in the beginning, but once I got used to them, they added depth and flavor to the book. The characters were wonderfully developed and the plot made for an engaging read."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Now to review one of my favorite books! Scott Lynch's The Lies of Locke Lamora is perhaps the best book I have read, EVER! Whether you are into fantasy fiction, action packed adventures, or mysteries this book will please. I have heard it referred to as Oceans Eleven - this is not far from the mark in a lot of respects. Let the heaping of praise begin...Take the age old tale of Oliver Twist. Now instead of finding Oliver a home, let's turn him into a con-man. Not JUST a con-man, a con-artist! A con-artist with a tight knit family who all surprisingly have each others' backs. Why would a con have another con's back? Because they are family! Lynch does a fantastic job building the relationships between all the characters. His style of doing this is a clever back and forth between the present and the past, explaining myriad relationships and actions taken in the present with events from the past.The language, Brilliant! On the verge of offensive, but not crossing the line, Lynch knows exactly what his reader wants. F-bombs are dropped in clusters - not to shock the reader but because that is actually how these characters speak! I was cracking up to the dialogue. Picture some young inner city kids - no respect for the law, fearful of those bigger than them but witty enough to worm their way out of almost anything. And if words fail, they have no qualms with (actually, they'll enjoy it and brag about it later) kicking their oppressor in the sack and running down an alley as fast as possible to escape.The story... wow! Tons of twists, gotchas, lots of tragedy, and even a small heart warming feeling at the end. Revenge, murder, honor, loyalty, a crimson tinge around your vision as you read on - I couldn't put the book down.I give this book a glowing 5 out of 5 stars without any reserve. I have read a lot of fantasy books, but this one seriously has been my favorite to date. Whenever anyone I meet asks me about a book to read, Lies is the first one I always recommend. I'm very glad I finally read it this past summer, and angry at myself for not reading it sooner."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I was in need of a good adventure story with tales of intrigue and action. This book delivers in every way. It satisfies the little devil in all of us, yet bleeds of the honorable actions of an atypical anti-hero.The book moves fast, yet gives you pause for breath with frequent anecdotes (that form a completely relevant and interesting back story). It's told much like a supreme campfire story, but with the depth of something much, much more.Thoroughly recommended for anyone who loves action and doesn't mind intensity or some foul language."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I went into this book like I do most...without reading a review and without reading the book jacket. Coming to it, not knowing what to expect, the story and characters unfolded, engaging me completely. I was intrigued by the hints of the backstory and the history of this world. Lynch doesn't treat his readers as though they're a bit slow, needing everything spelled out and explaining all the jokes."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Excellent book. Fresh and fun characters. I was instantly drawn in. I do want a prequel though. SO much back story is missing."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I just want the 3rd book to be released! I've been waiting awhile! There is a first chapter floating around, but it wasn't enough."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"One of the most entertaining, unique, and well-written books I've read in ages - it's hard to believe that The Lies of Locke Lamora is Scott Lynch's first novel. Locke manages to be both a sympathetic character and an unabashedly underhanded con-man at the same time, and he and his band of Gentleman are ferociously entertaining to follow. The plot is complex, the actions at time very graphic and brutal (wee ones had best not read much about things like the Teeth Show): but violence is never thrown in with a kind of sophomoric glee, but taken as a fact of life in what is a very dangerous city. Lynch makes liberal use of flashbacks, but oddly enough, his use of the trope doesn't dilute or slow down the action of the novel, but adds a heightened sense of urgency to the rest of the novel's events, and puts in background information where it is most pertinent to the plot.There's so much more to say about this novel - but I'll simply state that if you even REMOTELY enjoy good fiction (fantasy in particular, but not exclusively), you should very seriously consider picking this one up. Heck - stop reading this and just buy it already!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Very engaging characters and storyline. It left me involved with the characters and anxious for the next installment which I immediately ordered. It was refreshing to be entertained by an action novel that did not fall predictably into the pit of gratuitous social violence that is feeding into our world's &#34;violence as entertainment&#34; pattern. There is violence to be sure but it serves a different more abstract purpose. There are primitive notions of honor in this story that would go a long way to enlighten the leaders of today."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Beautifully written book. Though the story contains some heavy cliches, such as the main character being an orphan, it makes up for it in sincere literature, style, and a violently unfolding series of events that held both humor and grittiness much in the style of Joe Abercrombie. I've rarely seen such a good book that has such a horrible cover. I mean that thing is hideous. They should keep the old one with violet buildings and white pedals or whatever, the cover alone will turn most people away.I became quite emotionally involved with some of the characters, and got much of the same feelings of shock i recieved in George Martin's third book of his Song and Ice and Fire series, \\"A Storm of Swords,\\" some of you will know what i mean by this.The book is not meant to be full of profound, philosophical depth- and instead quite adeptly accomplishes an original (despite the cliches) fantasy adventure."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book was a great read. Suspense from beginning to end. I strongly recommend this debut to anyone who is in to fantasy. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I frankly adored this book. There are few things I love as much as unrelated people becoming a family and teamwork, both of which this story has in abundance. I love people who are very good at what they do and there's no question Locke Lamora is one of those. And let's face, I love stories about gentleman thieves :)I highly recommend this book and its sequel to anyone who also enjoys those things! I loved the characters, the world building, the setting, the pace...everything."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I loved the book and read it in less than twenty four hours! It is a sort of fantasy Ocean&#8217;s Eleven, following my son&#8217;s description of the book, setting a clever con artist in a Venezia-like city and following his team through increasingly complex schemes until all falls apart. The dialogues are quite funny, the setting is completely convincing, and the background plot unravels superbly. Even though it is a single-volume read, I am clearly looking forward the second volume in the series. Red seas under red skies. (The following volumes are in the coming, apparently due to an on-going depression of the author&#8230;) One highly critical review of The lies of Locke Lamora on Strange Horizons Reviews induced a lot of flak: I however think the reviewer makes the right point when she states that &#8220;Lamora [the character] is not very interesting&#8221;. It is true that the book somehow lacks an in depth psychological analysis of the characters, incl. Locke Lamora. Nonetheless, I keep a fairly good overall impression of it and do recommend it."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This is a great book. I read this after The name of the wind by Patrick Rothfuss and many had referred my to Lynch. I enjoy his work and his writing style."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The Lies of Locke Lamora is another very highly suggested work within the fantasy genre. I picked it up expecting a cleverly written piece. After finishing the book, I just felt very \\"meh\\" about it all. More than anything, it was the reading of Rothfuss' Kingkiller Chronicles, previous to this book, that shows the myriad of flaws in Lies. Probably an unfair comparison for Lynch to compete against.The idea of a street urchin rising to master thief of the city is nothing new, we've read it a million times before. To overcome this cliche, a richly imagined world full of colorful characters is needed. Lies attempts to go there, but the world and characterization fall so very flat. I can't tell you much about Camorr other than there's some alien glass lying around that glows at sunset/night. The descriptions felt rushed and don't grab the imagination. The characters are just as flat. I can tell you a little about Locke but between all of the rushed sequences and the such, I can't tell you much of anything about anyone else. Calo, Galdo, Jean, Bug, Chains? Very forgettable and unengaging (sp?). Perhaps the most fascinating characters the book sees, the main villian and the mysterious leader of the spy network, are either dealt with too easily or not developed enough. I was really interested in both of these characters...And then there's all the ill timed flashbacks to childhood sequences and mini-chapters, a couple of pages each, that explain why things are like they are in Camoor. They too, distract from the story. You're left feeling cheated as a clever concept is explained away very quickly. It would have been much nicer to possibly see some character interactions that would have explained these things out in a more engaging manner. Instead, we get quick history lessons.Again, it's just an overall meh book. There's not a lot of interest to see where the next book goes. I feel that if the Gray King was dismissed so easily and we're just floating to another continent, then Locke feels like he may be embarking on a sitcom quest, where every little book as a tidy intro, middle and ending with no continuous flow between it all. No thanks."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I loved the way the story keeps on jumping between current and historic experiencing for the main characters, help with building a decent foundation for the plot and add a lot of intrigue to the story.Author also goes to great length to describe a scene and surroundings.A definite read."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"That is the gist of it. Nice dual storyline going and the journey to the end doesn't follow exactly where I usually predict."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The story is good enough that I really wanted to finish the book, but the offensive language was a huge turn off. I did not give this book away--I threw it away, thinking not many readers would tolerate the foul words. Now I know to always check the lower ratings on a highly rated book in the hope that someone will give more clues about the content."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"i got tired of using white-out to cover swear words and trying to figure what period of time the auther had this section of chapter. it is not a good book for it takes 10 pages to get any action but by then you are off to another time. go to a resale store and pay 50 cents for it for you'll end up tossing it out like i did after 200 pages of swear words and more to come."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book so far has been great however halfway through the book there is a printing error that ruins the book right during one of the best parts. The pages are cut off at the top of the page meaning you only get half of the page then the bottom half of the page is printed upside down and has nothing to do with the top half so you miss out on about 40 pages of the story. I would suggest buying the book as it is really good but go to a books store and flip through the book to make sure its printed correctly look at pages 389 to 420."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book was really, really enjoyable. I'm not going to say it was a life-changing meditation on power or revenge, or a remarkably deep and touching piece - so if that's what you're looking for, head elsewhere.But I will say that it's a technical tour-de-force, and Lynch's talent made this book so much FUN to read. I haven't gotten through a book this effortlessly or happily in a long time. The characters, the corkscrew plot, the well-built world and the original-yet-somehow-familiar setting...It never truly dragged, despite its length, and I flew through it eagerly.Just read it!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Scott Lynch does a wonderful job of creating a group of interesting and sympathetic characters to follow around his cityscape, which works as a nice alternative to the traditional high fantasy worlds common to the genre. The story can be gritty and brutal at times, which further defines the underdog role of the protagonists, who seem to maintain a roguish sense of common decency no matter the cost. The book has a few decent turns, and the plot doesn't always go as you might expect, even though the supporting characters and subplots can be a bit thin at times. Overall, it's a good read, and I can definitely see a bright future for Lynch. I look forward to the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I am thoroughly impressed with Scott Lynch's debut novel, The Lies of Locke Lamora. The titular character is a thief, and the story follows him and his exploits in a fantasy city that may remind you somewhat of Venice. Locke and his gang seem like a urban fantasy version of Ocean's Eleven, wth their grand heists targeting the highest echelons of the city of Camorr's elite. The plot is solid and will engage you. My biggest caveat is to warn about the language: if you cringe at profanity, this book is not for you. The themes and language make this not suitable for a young adult audience. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and its followup, Red Seas Under Red Skies."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Couldn't put it down. Loved the characters, plot, and moral ambiguity. Its the sign of real talent when an author can make you sympathize with and even side with people whose actions you might normally question. Lots and lots of humor, fascinating atmosphere, and just the right amount of realism and unlikely lucky breaks/optimism. If you sometimes read for escapism check it out."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I am a real snob when it comes to fantasy and I rarely take the time to review. It had to be done here though because this book was awesome and just FUN to read. It all comes together in this book with excellent, intelligent, witty writing; a fast moving story and likeable characters. There is not the usual unsurprising formulaic fantasy writing. Loved the thieves and the focus on their complicated plots. I love having an anti-hero to root for and I was rooting for him all the way. Loved it!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I saw a bunch of recommendations for this book, but they were from people who had pretty bad taste. I tried it anyway, and I'm glad I did. It's not the greatest book in the history of the universe. It won't change your life or anything. It's just a load of fun. It has the obligatory surprises near the end. The main problem I had was that the villain's motivation was disconnected from the plot and characters that you cared about, so I didn't care about him at all. So the inevitable resolution for him didn't have much impact.And hey, I just bought the sequel."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This is really a book about organized crime. Think Al Capone. Or think some swanky British gangsta film, like \\"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\\", or \\"The Limey\\". Throw in a medieval backdrop built on the fossils of some alien race and you will understand the book's genre. A melange of everything.For those of you who are hell bent on magic, be forewarned, you'll find none until page 250 of the book. The author's pacing of the novel can be compared to a steam engine that has just left the train station at the top of the hill. The plot starts rather slow, but gets better and better and faster and faster.I highly recommend; especially to those who put up with the multiple story lines methodically found in Sanderson's \\"Elantris\\"."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"It was a little slow in getting going. The last hundred pages were quite good, but it took some effort to get there. I will say that this was an original book. I hate to read a book that feels like I've already read it somewhere before and this was unlike most fantasy books."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I'm a relative newcomer to the fantasy genre; as of two years ago the only fantasy I really read was Harry Potter and the occasional Discworld book. But I then devoured George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series. I was ravenous for more fantasy, and grew impatient for Martin to continue his series. So Scott Lynch's first volume in his Gentlemen Bastard sequence was the next fantasy book I picked up, and boy I wasn't disappointed.Firstly, the book reads more like a crime caper than a fantasy book. Locke and his friends pull off many a brilliant con throughout the story, and I enjoyed the flashback format thoroughly between Locke's present-day woes and scenes from his childhood. There are no 'thous' and 'dosts' in this book; the dialogue is very modern but witty and engaging.Another strong aspect of the book is the setting and description. Lynch obviously put a LOT of thought into not only the history, culture and description of Camorr, itself beautifully realized and almost a character in and of itself, but into all of the Therin city states like Emberlain, Karthain, and many others that are just mentioned in passing. Just reading about Camorr and descriptions of different groups and cultural traditions in it is just as fascinating as the exploits of Locke et al.The story and characters are both solid, and some of the twists are very surprising. Lynch does not shy away from violence and tormenting and even killing major characters, which even adds more to the drama. Locke and Jean are especially well realized as is his mentor, the priest Chains, and the villainous Gray King. My one complaint is that many aspects of Locke's past remain, intentionally, unrevealed. While I understand the point of this is presumably to have more flashback content for future installments in the series, it in a way takes away from the development of Locke's character and I would wished, if nothing else, to see more about his mysterious love interest who apparently played a major role in his life and yet we never see her, both in flashback and present day.All in all though, Lynch delivers a solid, entertaining story that as I mentioned isn't so much fantasy (though there are magical elements and nasty creatures) as it is a simply thrilling crime/adventure story. I've moved onto many other fantasy series since yet found nothing even close to Lies of Locke Lamora. Truly unique, can't wait for more."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Great book, up there with RR Martin and Erickson.Pros - a great story line, intricate plot, keeps you guessing, good action.Cons - story line is always jumping back and forth between past and present which gets a little old, side characters could have been given a little more depth. Language is a little much for younger readers.I think Lynch would have done well to expand his vision for the story of this book and could have stretched it into a short series all by itself. Unfortunately not, but still a great read."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"\\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" (hereby to be shortened to \\"Locke Lamora\\") is a well-plotted novel that resembles an old-fashioned adventure tale. As other reviewers have undoubtedly stated, \\"Locke Lamora\\" is basically a medieval Oceans Eleven, with more dying. However, while I enjoined the twists and turns of the plot as well as the very well-developed backstory of the titular character, \\"Locke Lamora\\" is a novel that I was unable to finish. The reason? I really didn't care about Locke Lamora.As a Robin Hood-style novel, the quality of this book is inextricably linked to the charisma of its main character. And unfortunately, Locke Lamora isn't sufficiently intelligent to be admired, sufficiently tragic to be pitied, or really even sufficiently human for me to care about. The author presents him as a sort of anti-hero, an unparalleled thief with a heart of gold, yet when the action ramps up, Locke Lamora becomes surprisingly beige. By the time I got three quarters of the way through the novel, I realized that I really didn't care what happened to Mr. Lamora--and that is a death sentence for this kind of novel.It also does not help that the author spends quite a bit of time on world-building, yet this world-building never pays off. We see a fantastical world of alien artifacts, yet the reader is never able to understand this world--indeed, the world-building adds very little to the story of the novel.In all, Mr. Lynch's novel has all the hallmarks of a great book, but for me at least, it was never very engaging."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"It takes special talent to create an entire world and Scott Lynch has that talent. His world seems loosely based on medieval Venice but it has its own rules, its own history, social structures and its own magic. Lynch writes a little in the style of Guy Gavriel Kay -- except that his world is more violent and occasionally the violence takes on a gratuitous almost sadistic tinge. It is because of that gratuitous violence that I am giving this book only four stars. Otherwise I found it an absorbing and enjoyable read.The hero, Locke Lamora, is a scruffy orphan with a talent for crime and for trouble. He and his small gang of fellow miscreants specialize in elaborate con jobs and for the first couple of hundred pages we follow one of these scenarios put together with the same care as the plot of \\"The Sting.\\" But Lamora's meddling soon entangles him in much more weighty affairs of state and ultimately the fate of his entire city.We meet many colorful characters -- fake priests, crime kings, aristocrats, fearsome female gladiators, beggars and thieves. Lynch's dialogue is especially masterful and colorful -- he has a way with expletives that is highly original and enjoyable.The one missing aspect is the absence of realistic and compelling female characters. One -- apparently Lamora's lost love, is hinted at but never seen. Perhaps the author is saving her for the sequel.So one and three quarters thumbs up for this book."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The Good: This book is all good. Lynch as a flow about his writing that allows readers to flip through quickly and enjoy every bit. He is descritptive without being overbearing and the characters are enjoyable and have their own personalities. The ending is biting, brutal without being overly grotesque, and overall satsifying.The Bad: Throughout the book Lynch has included \\"intermissions\\" where the main story veers off and he examines a back story or historical footnote. This wasn't too bad but I found I was skipping past some pages because I was so enthralled by what was actually happening and cared less about the footnotes.The Ugly: F-bombs. There are a lot of f-bombs in this book. Personally I did not care but for someone who isn't ready for it, it can be a bit of a surprise. I actually think they added the necessary grit but others may not think so.The Verdict: If you don't mind the cursing, then read this book. You will not be let down."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I'd read a couple of the critical reviews.Yes, the blue language was overdone. Even obnoxious sometimes, unnecessary, and made me somewhat less willing to believe and invest in the characters and story - initially.And the jumping around in the time line was irritating at first. Until I recognized that my irritation was born of wanting to know what happened next. And that, for me, is the mark of a good story. So the two timelines told several good stories between them and after getting used to it, I could live with it.Bottom line - if you persevere just a bit, soon enough you will be accustomed to the harsh language, tolerant of the time frame jumps, and highly interested in the success of the characters.In the end, the book is pretty fun stuff, and a step higher than most of the fantasy fare out there today.By comparison, I did not think it was as good as Joe Abercrombie's First Law series. BUT it had a similar unique slant, focused as it was on a young con man in the criminal underbelly of a fantasy realm.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book has a great story and concept but its biggest weakness is its character depth. And this to me made all the difference in the world. If Lynch was able to bring the characters more alive I would have given this book 5 stars. It's got every other aspect to make it such a good book but the lack of feelings for the character is overwhelming. E.G. Lynch isn't afraid of killing off characters which is excellent-no writer should be afraid of this. But he'd kill a character and I'd just shrug because I never really felt a whole lot for the character to begin with. And he even kills off major characters so you'd think this would be even more significant. But it wasn't any different from when a minor character died to the major ones."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"What a surprise this book was. In short:Positive1. Original and entertaining storyline2. Keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next (sure, sometimes it's obvious, but overall there were enough surprises)3. Enjoyable & real charactersNegative1. The city never really took shape for me. I have a hard time visioning the items he described.2. I did find that periodically I had to re-read a paragraph or two to understand what the author was trying to get across.The long version:I have read hundreds of fantasy novels over the last 15 years and it seems like the good books ran out about half way through. I'm sure my aging had something to do with that as well. Anyway, I thought I would try and break out of the norm and did some research on new authors. I don't usually like that approach, because I don't like waiting for the next book in the series to come out. However, in my search I found some positive reviews on Scott Lynch and so I gave him a try. It was well worth it.This story is wonderful. It was a new twist in fantasy that I find myself longing for. The lack of a big war, wizards throwing bolts of lighting, political backstabbing, etc was refreshing (I still enjoy that stuff, but it does get old when you see the same storyline over and over again). I also enjoyed the use of real language (thieves do curse, and quite a bit if I were to guess), because it gave me a feeling that I was part of their lives, not having a children's story told to me.I could go on and on, but in the end it comes down to good characters, surprising twists, and page hanging excitement. I'm very pleased.As noted above, there are some negatives. I never truly grasped the city that the author was trying to reveal to us. Glass buildings illuminated at dusk and the like. It just never clicked. I also didn't like the whole \\"it's from the people before us\\" stuff. I'm not a big fan of futuristic aspects being brought into medieval themed fantasy novels. That's just my own thing though.Also, I did find that there were some sections in the book I had to read twice to fully understand what the author was trying to say to us. It wasn't too often though, so I didn't have an issue with it.With that being said, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Modern fantasy tends to ape the current bestsellers - bloated Robert Jordan type epics in the 90s, gritty war-and-politics stories in the George Martin era. The Lies of Locke Lamora is awesome because it doesn't fall into this trap; Scott Lynch realized that it's better to make something original.Originality is something this book has in spades. The city, Camorr, breathes with life, even more than the famous New Crobuzon of China Mieville's books. Equal parts Renaissance Venice and early modern London, it feels real in a way fantasy cities rarely do, with a culture and a political economy that actually seem plausible and consistent. The characters are anything but cliche, and the villains are some of the most evil I've ever encountered. And the ending is awesome, despite the fact that there is a sequel, which is the rarest of rarities in the fantasy genre.The book's one limitation is the slight predictability of many of its plot elements. Though the story is twisted, convoluted, and wildly original, Lynch has a tendency to telegraph his punches a bit - you kind of know how the characters are going to react to a situation before they know it themselves. But maybe I've just read too much fantasy.In any case, The Lies of Locke Lamora is, in my opinion, the best book to come out of the \\"new fantasy\\" crowd of Lynch, Abercrombie, Rothfuss, Bakker, Sanderson, etc. It breathes new life into the genre."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"i recently read scott lynch's the lies of locke lamora. i had avoided it for so long because i always thought it was a book aimed at the immature end of the fantasy spectrum. you know - aimed at kids who like reading salvatore, or terry goodkind.however, having nothing around except a copy i'd been given as a gift, i cracked it open for a bit of a squizz and found something i hadn't expected - a really really good book.i guess what made this book wincingly bad to me before i'd read it was the write-up on the back of the book which included:The Thorn of Camorr is said to be an unbeatable swordsman, a master thief, a friend to the poor, a ghost that walks through walls...ick. see what i mean? it reads like you're about to read some juvenile rubbish you wish had just stayed buried under a vogon's peat pile.the book inside the cover, however, really doesn't seem to be about any of that at all. it's much more subtle and interesting to read, and in no way shape or form does our hero look, smell or even act like robin hood. it was a sort of blend of the the magnificent seven, ocean's eleven (take your pick), the godfather, and the dungeons and dragons franchise.it's a healthy novel filled with suspense and told with a parallel backstory which provides you with a jaw-dropping finale. i was surprised not so much from the story itself, but how well-constructed it was. how cohesive. lynch has managed a masterpiece sure to go down as a classic of the genre. the fact that locke isn't a lost heir to a throne, a wielder of unqiue magic or a saviour of the kingdom, is simply testament to the power of this story which didn't give one inch into the pressures of the genre. he chose instead to create something deeply original.if you're a fan of steven erikson, as i am, you'll simply fall over this book in spellbound rapture. the sequel, red seas under red skies is also an incredible novel. i mean, how can you go wrong? a fistful of con-artist thieves taking on the medieval mafia in book one and then taking on pirates and dictators in the sequel? well, if you're scott lynch, then you just couldn't go wrong if you turned off your torch and walked backwards in the forest in the middle of the night.i look forward to book three.i hope it's ninjas."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Minor spoilers to follow.First of all, let me say this: I am sucker for first books in the series. My usual tactic is to order up a basket of \\"Book ones\\", read through them, throw the horrible ones in the waste basket (I'll refrain from naming those not to anger the fanbois of Mala.. oops, said too much there), put the so-so ones on the bottom shelves (First Law, Prince of Nothing), and fill the rest with the good ones.Lies of Locke Lamora belongs right in the middle - a fair place, because the top shelves are reserved for such that it is doubtful any book to ever be published yet will ever take those.Now, for the review.The excellent: Setting.It is like the blurb from mr.GRRM on the cover says - fresh. It is believeable. It is a blend of a couple of things - as named by previous reviewers, the Godfather and Ocean movies come to mind. Everything from the episode of Cribz that we witness moving down the blind priest's temple's basement, to the pawn shop, to the Capo's HQ. Good stuff.The good: Plot.Not to reveal much, but the book is a solid page turner. Dues to be paid for the deaths, body in a cask, the wine merchant plot, all is well until we come to...The bad: Ending.Anyone else has a deja vu feeling? I sure do. Once again, no spoilers. By the way, I really thought the Thiefmaker was the Grey King with some cool reasoning behind it. Alas. WTB better villains.The ugly: Dialogue.I am no prude, really, and I couldn't care less for the THINKOFTHECHILDREN crowds, but the cursing simply does not fit the world. It feels too modern. It just does, I am sorry. Many have mentioned the abundance of one-liners where the author simply went for the \\"lite\\" hero stuff we've all heard/read before.With all this being said, the book deserves solid 4 stars and I will be looking forward to the next installments."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Lies of Locke LamoraWithout question, one of the best books I've read this year and probably the best book in the genre I've read since I finished the last George R. R. Martin Song of Ice and Fire book. I finished it a few days ago and I'm still excited about it!Lies, by new author Scott Lynch, follows the exploits of Locke Lamora, an orphan who is raised to be a thief. The setting is Camorr, a Venice-like city that has a rather significant crime problem, mostly made up of little gangs of orphaned thieves and controlled by a mafia-like crime boss. Lamora is the ultimate anti-hero, charming and funny but also a little despicable. He is trained in the art of deception by a false priest named Chains, along with his adopted brothers Galo, Caldo, Jean and Bug. The book switches back and forth between when Locke and his \\"brothers\\" are young and being trained by Chains, to the present day when Locke is the new \\"garrista\\" (leader) of their gang, called The Gentlemen Bastards, now that Chains has passed away. Although the Gentlemen are thought to be just a bunch of low-producing sneak thieves to the rest of the crime gangs and the boss, they really spend their day breaching \\"The Secret Peace\\"--a deal struck between the ruling class of Camorr and the crime boss that his thieves would stick to robbing the commoners and merchants and leave the upper class alone, and in exchange the police would \\"miss\\" a lot of the crime going on right under their noses. Lamora and his gang purposely target the upper class, even though they have no idea how to even spend their secret fortune, just to prove they can get away with it. The trouble begins when a man calling himself The Gray King starts targeting the gangs, and Lamora in particular.I read some of the negative reviews of this book, and most seem to take umbrage with the extensive use of foul language. Yes, if cursing inherently offends you, this book is not for you. It's about a bunch of people raised from childhood to be criminals, so to me the cursing is pretty natural. I also saw a criticism that the wittiness of the dialogue was distracting and unrealistic--that characters in mortal danger should not be ready with a pithy, thoughtful comment. Ok, fair, but honestly, the dialogue in this book is so masterfully entertaining that I can forgive the fact that it's just a little bit too good to be real. I mean, it's not a book that is trying to portray any sort of realism, so I think a bit of overly witty commentary is ok.To any fan of the genre, this is surely a can't-miss read. I'm about 100 pages into Lynch's second in the series and already lamenting that the third isn't out yet."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"***SPOILER FREE REVIEW***This book is fresh, unique, AMAZING, with writing so witty and sharp it cuts like razors. I love the concept of the anti-hero hero and this book utilizes this concept masterfully. Not to mention that the story always keeps you on your feet, constantly turning pages just to see what happens next. The plotline and storylines are nothing short of incredible, you have no idea what is going to happen, but at the same time the twists and turns feel natural and organic.You grow to love and bond with the characters, you feel their joy and pain as your own.I read a book a week, have so for over 20 years, so it is no small thing for me to put an author on my top ten favorite list. Scott Lynch has now made that list. He is a very talented writer, probably the best dialogue i've ever read evarrrr...thanks for a great story Scott, you have a fan for life, keep those books coming!!!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This was a mixed bag of enjoyment. Some aspects of the storyline you can anticipate, the rest you think you can, then it changes. I really enjoyed this book. I'm still trying to figure out Locke, but that's a good thing for such a complex character. The villains where fantastic, I wanted to reach into the book and strangle them myself. The length of the book was perfect. Some readers of previous reviews found the flashbacks confusing, I found that they fit in perfectly and helped explain the story better as the book progressed. Scott Lynch also nails the details perfect, just enough to help the story along and building the world and characters, but not so much as to bore you. I would highly recommend this book to any of my friends."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I finally found another author good enough to transport me to his world. Mr Lynch creates a fantasy landscape with enough detail to be immersive, and yet enough unexplored world to keep me wondering where the next book will take me.The main character is well developed and is constantly adapting to new experiences, feelings and influneces from the people close to him, making his person an interesting one, easy to relate to.The balance between mischievous inclination and seriousness of the situations at hand is hard to find in most books, tending to either approach the ridiculous or lacking humour. Lynch did an admirable job of finding the middle path.It's also a well-paced novel, no weak 30-page inner contemplations to fill the book, but real adventure that keeps you locked in the story until the last page. This is one of those books that made me annoyed for having to wiat for the next installment, and that's the best compliment I can give!Both this book and the sequel are must-reads for any fantasy fan that likes a mix of magic, adventure and mischief."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book was recommended to me as a good \\"steampunk\\" novel, which it really isn't. But I'm glad for the recommendation anyway because this book was a fantastic read. From the beginning, it is an anxious page-turner; I don't want to admit how many late nights this book brought upon me (I'm a slow reader to begin with).On the surface, this book is about Locke Lamora and his Gentlemen [...]. Their profession is thievery. They rob the rich by developing complex schemes that should result in the victim's willful giving up of their own money. The schemes are well developed and entertaining to read as the Gentlemen [...] perform their tricks from beginning to end (like Ocean's Eleven).Aside from the entertaining and frankly funny schemes described in the book, my favorite parts were the lavish descriptions the author writes about the setting. I'm a huge fan of well-developed settings and characterizations, and this book had both of those. I could picture this world clearly in my head with its fantastical Elderglass and the like."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I purchased this book a few days ago and read it over a weekend. I must say, the story kept me turning pages wanting to know what happened next. It had everything I expected - thievery, lying, violence, betrayal, etc. While the way the story is put together does take away somewhat from the actual excitement of the plot (with flashbacks every other chapter to the main characters childhood), it does offer the reader the chance to learn a little more about the characters, thus giving them a better understanding of why they act the way they do, why they're better at one thing than another, etc. So it's almost like putting together a puzzle on the characters while seeing how they plot, scheme, etc. Overall, I recommend it. It's an entertaining book, if nothing else."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The only bad thing about a really engrossing book is that it can get to the point where it's almost impossible to put down, even at night. This was one of those books that kept me up reading much much later than I should have been awake.I know this book seems to have gotten some less-than-favorable reviews, but I guess it depends on what you're looking for when you get this book.I got it on a whim at the bookstore, and wasn't really sure what to expect-- and an epic fantasy it's not, but that doesn't make it any less fun to read, or filled with its own intricate details of the city and the people in it. There were parts that had me bursting out laughing, or had me seething, and plenty of tense moments that made it that much harder to put it down.It's a FUN read, and well done, and sometimes that's exactly the kind of book I want to read."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"With The Lies of Locke Lamora, Scott Lynch has not only burst into the modern fantasy scene, but also positioned himself as the man to beat. 'Lies' balances an appropriately convoluted plot with beautifully developed characters in a subtly magical world.Lynch eschews the seduction of detailed world-building, but still puts Locke, Jean and friends in the midst of a fantastic magical city with the enticing depth of Gormenghast or Viriconium. The characters themselves are complex, wonderful and ultimately quite real - it is a shame that the genre placement of this book will keep Locke from ever getting the recognition he deserves as a literary (and tragic) hero.The plot - alternately jumping forwards and backwards in Locke's past - is astoundingly complicated, yet still easy to follow. Scott Lynch deserves praise for keeping track of the plot alone - much less rendering it in such a way to make it easily engaging to the reader.With Abercrombie, Morgan, Rothfuss and Lynch all turning out incredible new series, we're easily living in a 'golden age' for the fantasy genre. I'd be hard-pressed to choose between them, but with 'Lies of Locke Lamora', Lynch makes a great case for being the best of the lot."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"\\"Rich\\" is the word that keeps coming up as I talk to people about this book and it's sequel.Lynch is one of the most original and engaging new authors I've ever read. It's hard to believe this is his first book. It's a great read that satisfies on many levels. It \\"feels\\" like a classic .. but also completely original.It's a little bit Fafhrd-and-the-Grey-Mouser-meets-Ocean's-Eleven, with a side of Oliver Twist and a dash of Renaissance Italy.And it's a good mix. It left me satisfied with an extremely well-told tale ... but still wanting more of these characters and their world. I fell in love with Locke - and his friends and his world - within just a few pages and I could. not. put it down.In addition to a refreshingly original protagonist, story and voice, Lynch offers an amazingly detailed and unique world and fully realized \\"supporting\\" characters.Lynch's narrative style - jumping back and forth between Locke's past and present - was VERY skillfully done. It *could* have been distracting and disjointed. Instead, it brilliantly serves to reveal Locke (and the other characters and even the city - which is almost a character unto itself) to the reader a little bit at a time - like slowly and tantalizingly peeling away layers of wrapping to reveal the prize within.This was hands-down one of my favorite books I read in 2008. I was completely drawn in to this amazing world and emotionally invested in the characters. I enjoyed it so much, I immediately ordered the sequel, Red Seas Under Red Skies and devoured that as quickly as the first. I am eagerly awaiting the release of the third installment."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I sit in silent having just finished the book. It has taken me to a world that has lifted me from mere living to heart racing joy. I am in a state of joy for a book has again made me love the world. Thank you!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This debut novel was exactly what I hoped for when trying a new author: skill at storytelling, unexpected twists, and characters and settings that did not feel cliche'd.The richness with which the author details not only the main characters in his story but the world in which they interact is truly impressive. Obviously a great deal of thought went into the details of life in Camorra, not just for our hero, but for all walks of life.A fun read from start to finish, Lynch has created a world which readers will eagerly wait to re-enter in future books.This twisty adventure yarn gets my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This is Scott's first book, but he does such a good job; head and shoulders above other first books that I've read.The Lies of Locke Lamora is set in a dark, urban fantasy world. It is a tale of thievery, double-crossing, and magic. It reminded me of a dark Dickensian London with imagery alluding to Gotham City. The story was very engrossing. It was a page-turner the likes of which I hadn't read since a Song of Ice and Fire. The other notable bright spot of the novel is the dialog; it is very witty yet believable. There were many times when I found myself laughing or cheering or otherwise physically reacting to something a character said. There are many twists and unexpected surprises, but done with a purpose, not just in an attempt to throw off the readers, which ends up making the story nonsensical like so many other \\"twisty\\" stories end up doing. I was very impressed.If you are looking for a great story about thieves, burglars, and confidence men, this is definitely right up your alley. If one were going to run a thieves campaign in D&D;, this is how you would want to do it!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"It has been a long time since I \\"escaped\\" into a novel. Locke Lamora is a fun character... and there isn't a wasted word in the entire novel.Mr. Lynch did a tremendous amount of rewriting and editing. I don't want to spoil anything, but everything you read about no matter how minor becomes important later on.What a tremendous endeavor to undertake and it all slowly builds to a very satisyfing and believable conclusion.I cant imagine how much work went into this, but great gob Scott and good luck!Great job."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"What a fun read. Funny, fast-paced, scheming, and with a witty, conniving title character. I look forward to reading other works in this universe, and whatever other ones Mr. Lynch comes up with."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This was the most entertaining book that I have ever read. I loved it. My boyfriend loved it. We actually raced to see who would get to the finish line first. He won. The story is unique. There's plenty of comic relief through out the story and all of the character's have these great dimensions. There's a lot going on in this story, but you wont find yourself getting lost. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I liked the story. The world was fasinating and the characters were funny and interesting. It seemed to be a book of flashbacks, which helped in the reading for the slow parts, but my only complaint is that the story dragged a bit here and there."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"A very enjoyable book.Hard to believe it is the author's first as it is very competently written. The world building was believable and provided a nice backdrop for the rip-roaring action. As another reviewer commented, it is reminiscent of Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser series.The fractured time-line referred to by one reviewer is not particularly difficult to navigate, though if you are a young teenager or only a sometime reader it may disrupt your attention for a while.The swearing in the book obviously puts some readers off. I agree that maybe it was a little overdone, but most of the time it was appropriate to the characters and their situations and I soon stopped noticing it.The principal character was very well drawn - it is a tribute to the author that the principal character who has few morals (he does usually draw the line at murder) is easily adopted by the reader, whereas the principal protagonist who is arguably trying to achieve much needed social reform/revolution, is clearly the villain.I've just been on 3 weeks' holiday lying on a beach and over that period read about 35 books - all carefully pre-selected based on other reader's reviews. Along with Carol Berg's Transformation and C D Payne's Frisco Pigeon Mambo, this was the one I enjoyed the most.I look forward to reading his next novel."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"An entertaining heist book with some pretty good twists and a couple tear-jerking scenes. This is just the sort of thing to read when your world is lacking swashbuckling adventure, con men, and derring-do."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"At first I found the pace a little difficult and the story line a little hard to follow. The first few chapters were difficult for me. But once I got \\"on the same page\\" (so to speak) with Mr. Lynch I was off and running.This is an amazing new world he constructs for the reader. The relationships he creates make for a very enjoyable read. You can't help but fall right in step with the main character criminal Locke and his band of thieves.I look forward to more stories with the Gentlemen Bastards.Would have gotten five stars if not for the difficult first few chapters for me."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"You won't find the meaning of life in The Lies of Locke Lamora, but will have a lot of fun. It's a story of thieves, deception, and friendship. Thieves who are sometimes too good to be true, but you won't care. Just read and laugh and have fun. The writing is impressive for a debut. Don't expect too much character development, but a lot of action and very intriguing fantasy elements. I'm sorry to say that the sequel (Red Seas Under Red Skies) is not as good, but it was this book that left me with such *huge* expectations."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book's a fun read. No doubt about that. You root for the good guys, hiss at the bad guys, and never have the slightest reason to wonder which is which. Nice descriptions of the city, snappy dialogue (if a bit relentlessly clever and flippant), scams, bloody deeds, betrayals, a swordfight, and a predictable ending in which the bad guys get what's coming to them. This book's got it all.Unfortunately, it also has a bad case of internal inconsistency. The setting is about as determinedly pessimistic as I've ever seen in a fantasy novel (though it's not quite as bad as _Perdido Street Station_). It's a brutal city, a place where prisoners are fed to sharks and children are as a matter of policy allowed to starve to death in the wake of plagues. In order to wring a happy ending from all this, Mr. Lynch ignores his backdrop and for about the last 50 pages makes people behave in ways that are completely unbelievable. Would the head of the city's secret police really see to it that a gutter rat (Locke) was invited to the Duke's exclusive party, rather than just arresting him at his victims' house and beating the snot out of him there? Would said gutter rat, once at the party and his identity exposed, really be listened to by the nobility and secret police? Would they really do everything he told them to? He's a known con man, after all.Then there's the inconsistency problem with Locke's character itself. On the one hand, he can't allow hundreds of nobles and their children to have their minds wiped out by magic. Fair enough. On the other hand, he convinces the head of the dreaded secret police to sink a ship sitting in the harbor as a gesture to his dead friends, knowing that this action will kill dozens of sailors. The contradiction here doesn't even occur to him. Strange.All in all, though, this book is worth your time. You may find yourself scoffing for reasons similar to mine, but you'll enjoy it anyway."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"\\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" is an awesome book!Absolutely fantastic ... one of my favourite books ever. I love it.However, I do not like the hardcover edition as much as the paperback. The font under the dustcover is strange, there are a few grammatical errors in the book, and the first two words of each chapter are capitalised ... which really annoys me, but probably won't bother anyone else.Also, make sure you know whether the version you are purchasing is American or British, because it can be frustrating to find words spelled differently to what you're used to. \\"The Grey King\\" vs \\"The Gray King\\", etc.But the story itself is wonderful and 100% worth reading!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"First thing that grabbed my attention was the superb writing style of the book. The dialog was spot on and I was quickly immersed in a well designed world. A great adventure, a nice tricky clever plot and fantastic characters with intelligence and believable core value systems. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Clever, complex, very well done. So is second book. I have read alot of SF, this is akin to Martin (wish he would get busy!). You will like it for sure."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"It really is nice to read a fantasy book that is not the ultimate battle of good vs. evil, and also one that stands alone as a single novel and doesn't just function as the introduction to an epic series that may be completed sometime around the middle of the century.The Lies of Locke Lamora is brisk and a lot of fun as most other reviewers here have said. I did not find the beginning to be slow as some reviewers have said because I thought the tales of young Locke the thief who joins the Gentleman Bastards was quite compelling. However, at a certain point perhaps 150 pages into the novel I did stop and scratch my head and wonder, where is this thing going? The setup of the Big Con of Don Salvara takes quite a lot of ink, and the stakes seemed to be pretty low for a con story or a fantasy story of any sort for quite a while there.Things do pick up when the Gray King starts to really stick his fingers into things.All in all I'd say that Lynch's inexperience shows in how the novel is plotted. The Gray King does not impact the plot until we are too far along. Certain characters are set up as if they will be highly consequential only to die \\"off stage\\" early on. The device of mixing the past with the present is interesting at first, but overstays its welcome to the point that even Lynch himself seemed to have have run out of ideas and only kept up the \\"Interlude\\" trope because he felt he had to.**SPOILER BELOW**One particular bit of plotting really bothered me a lot. We are introduced to Nazca, daughter of Capa Barsavi, in \\"the past\\" with much fanfare. Locke pledges himself to her. She is shown to be highly intelligent, selfish, and ruthless. In \\"the present\\" we see her again and Locke gets involved in a tricky situation with her. Then we hear that Nazca's been killed by the Gray King! And on the day of her funereal Locke must impersonate the Gray King because the King himself is \\"otherwise disposed\\"!! Well I knew where this was going and patted myself on the back. Nazca was clearly too important a character to just kill off like that, and she was on record as wanting to run her father's empire. So right up to the very end I was waiting for the King to unmask himself--Nazca in disguise. This never happened. Instead he was some guy disgruntled for reasons that were never clear to me.You might say that Lynch did well by toying with my expectations in this way, but I disagree completely. Though unmasking Nazca as the Gray King would have been predictable and perhaps trite (though I'll wager a good 75% of readers would never have seen it coming) it would have been far more satisfying and would have made the story make a lot more sense--for example why Nazca was killed first, why Locke needed to pretend to be the Gray King, why the Gray King wanted to eliminate the Gentleman Bastards, etc.I know it's bad to try to mindread, but I can't shake the feeling that Lynch originally wrote the novel with the ending I was expecting and either talked himself out of it or someone else talked him out of it.*** END SPOILERS ***However, the novel has much to recommend it. The world the characters inhabit is rich and detailed. The story, once it gets rolling, is entertaining."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I picked up this book off the library's new book shelf. I had not heard the hype or any publicity about it. I love it! I was sorry when it ended and now I find it's a trilogy! For once, I'm thrilled. I want more. It was inventive, colorful, and twisty. I was surprised to find it was the author's first book. I look forward to more of Scott Lynch as well as Locke Lamora. I thought it might make an interesting movie.

It was a little wordy and slow moving. I was getting annoyed with his dialogue being broken up with \\"ah\\" and \\"...\\". His characters had a bit too much of a good ole boy feel to them as they were trying to be to witty and clever. But then, gradually, I was drawn into the story and Lynch's style if writing. I am coming away from The Lies of Locke Lamora a fan.What began drawing me in was the intricate and well thought of plot. As you slowly moved through the lives of the Gentleman [...] you begin to see their interaction with one another, making their impact all the more believable and powerful. What was really fascinating me was the unpredictability of the plot and, with that, you are always on the edge of your seat wondering where Lynch was going to take you.His style of writing is also an asset that made for a colorful read. I am a big fan of recursive writing, or telling a story by backtracking to fill in the holes that a character's history usually leaves. Lynch uses this heavily as he has Interlude chapters to tell the history of a character, which would then lead straight in to the plot. This could be a little disarming with some chapters because his Interlude chapters are always from different periods of time, from a few days before the main storyline to 10 years before.In the end you have fun characters that are believable in their audacity, characters that you want to root for and to jeer for. And their unsavory lifestyle doesn't hurt the story, but instead adds a flare that stands Lynch apart from other typical fantasy. I would recommend and I look forward to reading the next installment.4 stars."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this introduction to an interesting world with captivating characters. I look forward to future adventures and getting to know them better.I could nitpick this first novel to pieces like some of the other reviewers, but why? I ENJOYED IT. It made me laugh. I gasped aloud for the first time since the red wedding. I even got a little teary eyed. That's the point. The Lies of Locke Lamora is a strong start and I truly hope it only gets better. I'll start nitpicking when it is a trilogy. ;)"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"It moves quickly and doesn't fall into the trap of being obvious. It reads well. Ultimately it is just genre fiction though. That isn't a put-down -- I certainly haven't written anything anywhere near as good. I just mean that you'll grab another book from the pile and move on. You'll remember \\"Lies\\" and probably recommend it to friends, but I don't think that two years from now you'll return to it."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"It took a while for the book to kick into high gear, but when it did, it was unstoppable!! Locke, his band of merry men, the Grey King, the Bondsmage, the Don Corelone type guy...all very engaging and entertaining. I think i was expecting a bit more \\"fantasy\\", but that's a minor nitpick. It also slowed down during parts, but there were so many really cool moments that it was OK. All in all, I'm looking forward to learning more about Locke and Jean, especially the love of Locke's life that is so often mentioned in Book 1 as an obvious tease for Book 2 :)"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Wow! Lies of Locke Lamorra defies description, but it also defies you to put it down. This crime-caper of a novel set in a world once populated by aliens, devoid of most technology, with a bit of magic kept me enthralled from the start. Lamorra is a bit like Oliver Twist; they're both orphans who fall into service with mentors whose goal is to teach the orphans how to steal. The book threads around two central plot-lines: Lamorra's newest and boldest scam, and an attempted take-over in the city's underworld. The chapters are broken up with past vignettes that show how Lamorra and his crew came to act the way they do.This is an intelligent, clever, and at times funny book. It is always entertaining."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Usually when people recommend a book to me by calling it \\"hilarious,\\" I end up throwing the poor volume across the room and letting it rot behind the couch, so I didn't have high hopes. Maybe underestimating the book to begin with influenced my subsequent swooning; maybe it's just as good as I think it is. Either way, it tricked, lied, cheated, joked, and murdered its way past every one of my other favorites until it was sitting on top of a pyramid built of the cold, bloody corpses of every other book I've ever loved.[...] Lies has everything I love in fiction: witty dialogue, heists, court intrigue, a protagonist who uses his brain more than his brawn, gritty noir, amazing filth, mafiosos, continuous action, angry sea creatures, irony that makes you kick your legs while you're reading, layers upon layers of backstabbery, and creatively torturous deaths. If that sounds good, your mouse should already be clicking its way toward the \\"Add to Cart\\" button.Trust me, unless you were actually about to hand that eight dollars to a starving, orphaned kitten with a wooden leg, there is no better way to spend it than buying Scott Lynch's \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora.\\""},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This wasn't the normal fantasy story. No wandering the roads, delving into dungeons, or snarks. It's a rogues tale, ancient Oceans Eleven, and a good one. I loved the characters and got attached to them. My only problem was that I wish there was a little bit more warning when jumping back and forth, telling Locke's past and future, there was a couple of times where I was a few paragraphs in before I realized it wasn't the timeline I'd just been in. Other than that a good book."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"It's been several months since I've read The Lies of Locke Lamora, but it remains one of my favorites still. Loads of action, great dialogue, very creative writing, and very humorous characters. It compares very much to a late medieval Ocean's Eleven. I enjoyed it thoroughly and would recommend it to anyone. The sequel is just as good, and I'm looking forward to reading the 3rd book in this series soon."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"A refreshingly different setting, interesting characters with detailed back stories, and an engaging plot... what's not to like?OK, a couple of things... there was some extraneous writing here and there - for example the scenes of Locke trying to find new clothes were long and, in the end, unnecessary; and there were a few silly bits (fighting leaping sharks from platforms? Really?), but is fantasy after all.A high point for me was the world building. The thought put into the political and cultural infrastructure is outstanding. In fact it could have easily been a longer book had the history been explored more. The writing is also very good, in my opinion. Lots of humour mixed with generous dollops of pathos.It definitely left me with an appetite for more. I'll be getting the next in the series soon."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book was recommended to me by my brother. It's a solid fantasy novel with a well-structured plot.GOOD: The book is well-written and fast-paced. There are many interesting twists and turns. The author is good with descriptions and expository narration. It takes intellect to understand a lot of the allegory and other literary devices the author uses throughout the book.BAD: The book seems to be a mile wide and an inch deep. There are lots of characters, locations, institutions, etc. introduced throughout the book without in-depth background explanations. I never developed a strong attachment to any particular character, including the protagonist. I found the ending a merely satisfactory conclusion to what was a pretty fun ride.Overall, I think this book is good entertainment for fantasy fans, but I did not have enough interest in the overall universe Lynch created to pick up the sequel. There did not seem to be a logical avenue for him to continue the story; I will refrain from spoilers to expound on that point, but that was my opinion.If you are thinking about picking up this book, I would go with the bigtime fantasy authors (Tolkien, Martin, Zelazny, etc.) before reading this one."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I purchased this book because it kept being mentioned along with other book that I've enjoyed so I decided to finally give it a read... wow !! am I ever glad I did. This book contains non-stop intrigue, suspense and plot twists sprinkled with generous portions of violence and profanity. I am currently reading the second book of the Gentleman Bastards series and plan on purchasing all 5 remaining books, plus the prequel, when they become published."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Locke Lamora is an orphan, raised in a gang of thieves and given over to a priest/con-man who teaches him and a small group of chosen young children to be trained as one of a group of Gentlemen Bastards. This is fantasy, of course, with an alternate world in which we vaguely recognise elements from varying different times and places. Lamora and his cohorts are a likeable bunch, with good qualities alongside their love of stealing and violence. The book is slightly long winded in places, with long flashbacks which do not always add much to the plot. Also, although the priest has set his group of young thieves on a path to concoct elaborate plots and amass great wealth, they do not seem to use the money for much. As a group, they seem slightly stuck in a vacuum, working for more and more money, but not really getting much from it apart from the joy of the chase.The plot of the book is long and involved, with many different characters either posing as other people, seeking vengeance and being involved in various plots and side stories. Lamora basically has many people after his life and has to try to dodge through various dangers, while attempting to keep his group together and in one piece. There are magical elements, extreme violence, a great deal of intrigue, action and edge of the seat excitement, as the author expertly weaves a complicated plot together. Although this is a great action adventure story, I did think the characters were slightly weak in places - we know where Locke Lamora comes from for example, but little of what he feels about it. However, this is apparently a series of books and the author may address deeper character detail in future books. If you like a lot of action and fast paced writing, with dark fantasy and a touch of crime, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This was my second time reading this book, and I promised myself I'd write a real review of it this time. I loved it the first time I read through it. I still enjoyed it a great deal the second time, although perhaps a little bit less, because the surprises in it lose a bit when you can see them coming. And that's one of the things that was so great about it. It was full of real surprises that I couldn't predict. Usually, in most fantasy books, I can predict the supposed surprising twists and turns of the story. With perhaps the exception of Song of Ice and Fire, but Martin's surprises are always horrific. And Lynch's surprises tend to be more, well, exciting as opposed to horrible. Martin only seems to know how to shock his audience with more death, and Lynch shows that there are many other ways to keep the readers guessing.The characters this book is about are not good people. They're thieves and con artists, operating in a ruthless city filled with corruption. I fell in love with Locke Lamora as I read it. I enjoy him, because although he is a bastard, he yet does have a code. Despite the way he screws people over, he actually does care about the little guy. And his friends are more dear to him than anything in the world. This is the sort of character I can enjoy. He's also smart. And while it's great fun to watch him outwit his enemies, it's also perhaps even more fun to watch him screw everything up and have his plans blow up in his face. Make no mistake. Locke Lamora is not a Mary Sue who can never fail. He is a smart but fallible anti-hero, which becomes apparent if you manage to make it past the first third of the book, which is spent demonstrating to the audience how awesome he is.I could say a few more things, that I loved, and perhaps a few things that could have been better. (Perhaps 4.5 stars is what I'd really give this.) But they are things that would really ruin the book for you, and as I said in the beginning, it becomes a bit less enjoyable if you see the surprises coming."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The book starts off a bit slowly. Locke is involved in an intricate scam to relieve a wealthy couple of some of their fortune and in its own right it is interesting how the deception is played out, but the book tends to linger too long on this part. Once past this and into the meat of the story, I found it was fast paced and entertaining. Lynch does a great job with dialog. The thieves are sarcastic and funny, but they respect and love one another and the dialog sounds natural. The characters are well fleshed out and feel real. Lynch weaves chapters in that tell the back story of our main characters. Sometimes it is off putting when you want to keep reading the main plot, but the back stories are interesting and are usually tangible to the plot at hand.I have a gripe with the bondsmagi which are the magic users in this world. They seem way too powerful and could pretty much do whatever they want. I don't know what keeps them in check or why more people don't buy their very expensive services to obtain their goals, although the final encounter with Locke and the bondsmagi is well written if not a bit graphic.The other gripe I have is that things fall into place a bit too tidy. The last 75 or so pages clean up alot and move at a very fast pace.I would recommend this to any Fantasy reader. Good start to a series and I'm sure I will pick up the 2nd adventure."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Scott Lynch is a narrative genius! He uses perfect imagery to create a world in which the reader can come to love a character as flawed as Locke Lamora. His attention to detail when creating the plot and circumstances of the book really make it stand out as more a work of art than a novel. Every character comes to the book fully imagined and fleshed out down to the last quirk and nuance. Locke is just enough parts innocent, mastermind, loyal friend and mystery to keep anyone guessing what his reactions will be. Like all the best books, there is no black and white or right and wrong in Locke's world, only grey, which of course, he uses to his advantage. I was hooked after the first paragraph and didn't stop until the end... and then on again to the end of the second book...!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book is set in a fantasy city that is described as being very much like Venice. Most of the city is on many islands with a network of canals around them. (The Kindle edition contains a map, but I have head the printed version does not? That's a little strange.) It's an interesting city to be sure and Lynch's descriptions are very well thought out.The main protagonists are thieves, but not the common kind that you find in Fantasy novels. These are are more like con men who pull of elaborate schemes in the style of 'The Sting' or 'Oceans 11'. It's an clever twist to an old theme and cleverly written. The pace of the book picks up half way through as the thieves become involved in something they had not anticipated. Not going to say what here.. go out and read it for yourself, I think you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This is an interestingly conceived world with believable characters--thus the four stars--but I didn't finish the book, which is very unusual for me. I can't truly explain why, but I suspect that it was because all of the characters were so foreign to me, aptly realized or not. I never felt connected and thus was easily distracted by moving on to another book. Nevertheless, it is an exceptionally well written novel and you should see what you think for yourself."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"For some reason I had a bit of a slow start getting into this book, but once I did I just loved it. I can't wait for the next one to come out in the summer so I can see what Locke Lamora will do next (although this one can certainly be read on it's own, if you're not a series kind of reader). Thank you Scott Lynch! I'll be recommending this others."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"A fun read with the hope of more novels along this story line to follow. This page turner would make a good movie. One of those books to savour over a vacation or long weekend. A great addition to my guest room bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I mean really really enjoyed it. It was witty, interesting, unique and unpredictable. The characters were facinating, detailed and amusing. The details were what made them real for me. Many of the people wear glasses, for instance. I also appreciate the strong female characters in every facet of politics, social status, leadership, warrior status and underworld. The world itself was really unique and interesting. I read a lot of books, and its bene a very long time that I was so thuroughly engulfed and surprised by one. But, it was the sarcasm and wit that won me over. I found myself giggling or laughing outloud in delight in places. I'd give this book 10 stars if I could. I resently read Peter Hamilton's Judas Unchained, and I gave that 5 stars. I thought this book was twice as good.I bought the audible audio version. The reader's voice is perfect. Great inflection and voice deliniation - perfect for the characters and the sarcasm in this book. The female and child voices aren't nasal like some reader's make them."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Locke Lamora is orphaned at the age of 5 where he is taken up by a Thiefmaker. Thieving in the city of Camorr is a regulated activity under the auspices of the brutal Capa (read:Godfather) Barsavi. Thieves can steal from commoners but can't steal from nobility, a practice known as The Secret Peace. At the tender age of 5, Locke is a gifted thief, actor and inveterate schemer. He also manages to break the secret peace much to the dismay of the thiefmaker. He is sold to a blind priest named Chains (who is neither blind nor a priest). Chains is the leader of a small gang known as The Gentlemen Bastards.Under Chains, Locke learns a lot more than simple petty thievery. He undergoes a whole new type of training that allows his own personal skills to flourish. Over time Locke becomes the leader of the Gentlemen Bastards and creates elaborate long cons that bilk the nobility of thousands and makes the Gentlemen Bastards very rich. This breaking of the secret peace remains very covert. The nobility who are bilked do not report their losses for fear of looking stupid. And Locke has created just as elaborate of a cover for the Gentlemen Bastards. In the thieving community, they are considered unimportant, low level break in artists who are unworthy of real notice of the Capa.But a new player named The Grey King has entered the game and is killing off high level thieves in Barsavi's organization. Although he is counseled to get out of town until The Grey King is caught, Locke refuses. First he believes his cover as an low level thief will be beneath the Grey King's notice and second he is in the middle of one the biggest and best cons of his career. Sadly, Locke is mistaken. He is most definitely on the Grey King's list and things that have been going so very, very right start to go impossibly wrong....I did not know what to expect when I picked up this book. I got it because someone in one of my reading groups rattled it off as a recommendation and others seconded it enthusiastically. I LOVED it the minute I started reading it. I was quickly immersed in the setting (feels like Renaissance Italy) and the words and voice of Scott Lynch. The writing is exquisite and the tone takes just takes one captive.The architecture of the story is well done. It starts out when Locke is five years old, introduces you to this engaging little scamp through a comically woeful retelling of his exploits by the Thiefmaker who is trying to sell him to Chains. Then the story leaps forward to \\"present\\" time where Locke is the leader of the Bastards and he and his band are right at the beginning of their latest caper. Every few chapters or so, we go back and revisit young Locke and watch him progress in what can only be considered a finishing school of thievery where he and the other Bastards learn other languages, accent, make-up, mummery, cooking, society manner etc. I know some people dislike this structure but it served to keep the story interesting on two fronts,imo, moreso than a simple linear narrative would have done. And it allows some suspense and character development in what is otherwise a strongly plot-driven narrative.And at the start, you feel like you are along for the ride on a rollicking, effervescent adventure. The Gentlemen Bastards are fun and funny. They engage in quick and witty repartee. You can't help but be reminded of George Clooney/Brad Pitt in Oceans 11, complete with the dry raillery and practice scenarios. Or while reading about the fabulously twisty con being pulled on the Count and his wife, I couldn't help but be reminded of the complex theatre that played out each week on Mission Impossible. Or during the scenes with Capa Barsavi of picturing Marlon Brando's Don Corleone from the Godfather. This book is like all of these things and none really. Lynch has built a complete world and describes the city of Camorr and the various populations and parts very well. Again, his language and ability to draw in the reader is brilliant.So if I loved it so much why did it take me forever to read it (I started this book like a frigging Month ago!)? I honestly don't know. This books is not a deep or thought provoking book, it is high fun for the most part. And I can usually bang out a book I like in about three days or less. But this one took me a while. I do ascribe a bit of my malaise to the fact that the bite and wit of the story falters with the advent of the Grey King. Strangely enough I was enjoying a fantasy book that did not include magic and sorcery. But it was introduced with the Grey King along with what I felt was some clunky motivation, some plot points that made me truly regretful and sad, and an ending that was a bit bittersweet. Not enough to make me dislike the novel by a long shot, but enough to slow down the momentum a bit.No matter, really. Just smallish quibbles in what is otherwise a very well written, nicely plotted, purely enjoyable book. And I am looking forward to reading the next installment."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch is the first book in the Gentlemen Bastards series. Not only is it the first in the Gentlemen Bastards series, but this novel happens to be the first novel published by Mr. Lynch as well. When I first heard that this was a debut novel I was slightly hesitant, but it came with a glowing recommendation so I took the chance. Let me say right off the bat that I am very thankful that I took the chance on this new author as this novel is absolutely fantastic.There are several aspects of this novel that I think need to be reviewed.The characters really allow this novel to stand out and shine. The characters are well developed and vivid. Each character is done in such a way that they all appear unique, anything from their look to their dialog. While Mr. Lynch has added many curse words, which at times, for me anyway, shocks the reader out of the dialog, it also seems to bring a grittiness to the characters. There are quite a few characters in this novel, but I didn't find any difficulty in keeping them separate and knowing what each was doing. The main character, who I would struggle to call a hero, is a rogue who is bent on stealing from the nobles of the cit. A Robin Hood type character if you will. Mr. Lynch goes to great detail to explain and develop Locke throughout the book, and he pulls this off very well. The other assortment of characters are developed at varying degrees. This just makes sense or else the book would be huge. In my opinion the supporting cast of characters are done perfectly, not too much and not to little. There are many truly memorable characters in this book.The plot, on the surface anyway, seems rather simple in that the main character is a rogue set on fleecing the nobility out of their wealth. However, there are many things that Mr. Lynch tosses into the mix to make this a much more complicated story than just your typical steal from the rich story. This story follows Locke from when he was a very young boy all the way up to his involvement with the Gentlemen Bastards and the escapades that he routinely pulls on the noble class of the city. There are several twists and mysterious characters that are slowly added to add more depth to the story. Even though there are multiple elements added throughout the book they are not done so to cram things into this novel. It has a very steady pace and was obviously well mapped out. It's a well written plot and one that certainly leaves room for further development in later books.This novel is set up in an interesting way, in fact I have not seen a novel like this to my memory. There are regular chapters, but interspaced between these chapters, or sections really, there are flashbacks or as Lynch calls them interludes. Were he harkens back to past events that helped shape the characters actions and choices. This is certainly a unique way of putting a novel together and at times it works beautifully, but there is at least one point where I read an interlude and was a little unsure why it was included in the story or at that point in the book. For the most part though, this idea works rather well and adds a certain depth to the book.There are a few things that I wish would have been better developed, such the way magic works as well as a little more explanation of the \`thirteen'. Since this is the first book in this series I expect that these things may be explained in greater detail later.Overall, this is a fantastic book and one I am sure to recommend to many other people. It really is a gem and a surprising first release from a new author. I wonder just how good Mr. Lynch will become if this was the first release from him. I am eagerly looking forward to the second book in this series as I am sure many others will be once they give this novel a chance. Have no fear in picking this up, I think it will appease many a different fans. Certainly fantasy fans, but also others will probably like this as well."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I enjoyed the last quarter of the book better than the first three quarters. The first half was a mix of back story and slow pace storyline. The back story could have been better had the author had some point to its vast detail but there wasn't. It even missed stuff like the love of Locke's life, Sabetha who is eluded to many times but you never actually see her ever. It lengthened the book but did nothing for the storyline. He didn't even seem to have fun with it. But the last quarter is where its most tense and moves fastest. For the last quarter I will buy the next one because I hope we got all the backstory done although I doubt it. He couldn't hold intensity in the book at all and it was a bit of a chore to read it until it got good. If you want a better book that will hold you through read Mistborn. Locke is a great character but the editing of scenes could have been much better."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Imagine The Arftul Dodger (Oliver), Johnny Hooker (The Sting), Vito Corleone (The Godfather), and James Bond rolled into one. Lynch has done a superb job creating the protagonist Locke Lamora and the world in which he lives. The plot is fascinating, unpredictable, and easy to follow. I couldn't put the book down. It's a real page turner. If you like fantasy, action, sci-fi, suspense, historical fiction, mystery... you will LOVE The Lies of Locke Lamora. I did!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"It took me a good 60 pages to get this book. I put it down at page 30, and page 40, and all of the sudden, it's my favorite book of the year. I'm part way through book #2 now. If you like Pratchett, the Belgariad, etc it is not to be missed. Read it, but don't be surprised if it starts out a bit slow. the book is about lies, it takes a while for the first few to be revealed..."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I received this book from a friend when looking for something new to read. I had never heard of Scott Lynch or the series before. So I had no preconceived notions of what to expect. So I sat down and started to read.I could not put that book down! It was a great ride. Ups and downs throughout. The attention to detail was just perfect. You could really get a good sense of the surroundings these characters played in. There were twists and turns not easily figured out. (I hate being able to figure out what is going on before the answer shows up in the book!)I do hope Lynch opens up a little more in the next few books. I am really looking forward to the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book took me two months to read, because many factors made this book read very slowly. While the book does have great characters, the structure of plot and writing decisions Scott lynch makes drags down the otherwise strong foundation he has created.-Misplaced narrationLynch decides to frame his story in a strange fashion. We are shown Locke Lamora as a kid, then an adult, then a kid again, etc. It feels odd, and at times I felt like I knew too much of what Lynch was trying to do by writing the narrative in this way. If he needs a certain amount of back story, he makes the reader jump back in time, then once established, he makes the reader go forward in time and use that back story to explain a current event. It's not as successful as laying out the narrative in a linear fashion, then letting the reader recall something important to their own satisfaction. In some ways I felt like the author was not exactly shoving things in my face, but not giving me some credit that I am invested in the story.-Very slow plotThe plot isn't very complicated in this book, but due to the narrative style as before mentioned it moves slowly. You don't find out whats going on till the last hundred pages or so, and until then there isn't much action. The bad thing about this was that in the end things felt like they happened too fast in comparison with the rest of the book, and the emotional attachment I had formed to the characters that died, felt a bit cheated. It would have been better to have it in a linear fashion, so as a reader we could grow with the characters, instead of being forced back into the past to see what has happened.-Too much lyrical and dense prose to explain settingLynch spends a lot of time outlining the city that the characters live in. None of these parts are quite as effective as his simpler exposition about specific elements in the story. Instead at the beginning of most chapters he uses a style that shifts into a more poetic and dense form. It's not as clear to read as the rest of the novel, and requires much more focus. In effect, it bogs down the narrative and gives the book too many excess pages. He goes on and on about certain things, and I cannot recall much of the setting that he put so much effort into creating. There a few good strengths in this world building, but it is elsewhere found than in the prose that you will find at the beginning of every chapter.-Loose ends not tied upThere are a few things that never get cleared up in this book. I won't mention them, but don't expect romance of any kind. I was waiting throughout the entire book to at least get a flashback, or a surprise twist.Despite the books flaws, it still gets three stars. There are a few interesting twists, brutal scenes, and cunning characters that thrilled me enough to get through the rest of the boring parts."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book is not usually my style of book but it is pretty awesome ^_^ It kept me interested throughout and made me want to find out more!

Locke and his companions are lovable young rogues. The novel has the readers racing along with the young thieves and championing their cause though a Renaissance-inspired city reminded me of a fantasy Venice. I love it..."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"There are many different types of people throughout the port city-state of Camorr. You've got the gentry who living high above the filth and grime of the lower city. You've got the yellowjackets patrolling the town, who seem to be more willing to take a bribe than to actually do any policing. There are priests and priestesses of the Twelve, some more pious than others, but all respected by the cityfolk. There are pawnbrokers and money lenders, sailors and spice merchants. There are many people in Camorr, many honest folk trying to make an honest living. And then there are the thieves.Locke Lamora has had a knack for stealing things ever since he was a young lad. Taken by the Thiefmaker at an early age, the orphan boy proved to be more than the Thiefmaker could handle. Locke was traded (sold) off to another man, the Blind Priest of Perelandro named Chains. Here, under the tutelage of the \\"blind\\" wizened man, Locke began to learn the true art of thievery and deception.The Lies of Locke Lamora is a fast-paced yarn that guarantees to keep the Reader up long past bedtime. Locke is a fascinating character, instantly sympathetic and charming, but he's not the kind of man you'd necessarily want to be hanging around with. He's gifted at slight-of-hand, as is obvious from his introduction to the story, but he's also got a knack for bringing trouble. Lies is, at its simplest, a heist story about Locke and the Gentleman Bastards (the name of his gang) trying to rob a certain wealthy noble. The story is, however, not simple, and when one man tells lies for a living, life's bound to get complicated.There are many memorable things from the book. What comes to mind first is the humor. Scott Lynch writes bloody brilliant dialogue (albeit rather blue) that more than once had me cackling like a loon. What's more, the dialogue comes across as genuine, almost as if Lynch spent some time with some con men in his day and picked up on the lingo. Even under pressure, Locke never loses his sarcastic mouth, and it was this humor that really shined.Another piece of the book that was equally enjoyable was the fantastic world building. The city-state of Camorr is built on the ruins of some ancient civilization known as the Eldren. Not much is revealed about these mysterious ancients other than the ubiquitous glass structures that they left behind. Man does not know how they lived or what they did, and Lynch doesn't offer much (any?) assistance to the Reader, either. He hints at magic and arcane secrets, but hints are all we're given. This offered a lot of depth to the book, but it also leaves one a bit frustrated, too, as answers aren't forthcoming. I could go on and on about the world building, but I'll leave it with just this one piece, so as not to spoil anything.Scott Lynch has sold me to his world from just one book. I'm curious to know so much more about so many things, but I'm also eager to get back with Locke again, too. The book is presented in an interesting way, following a Chapter-Interlude-Chapter method. Each chapter deals with the present, that being the heist story, while each Interlude deals with something else. For much of the book the Interludes are like a flashback for different characters, but as the book progresses, these sometimes become folktales or history lessons on the world. I thoroughly enjoyed this, and felt that it did wonders with the pacing of the novel.The Lies of Locke Lamora has been out for a few years now. If you've not read it (or never heard of it, for that matter), then I suggest that you remedy that. The story telling is impeccable, the characters are unforgettable, and the action is high. There's humor aplenty, but sadness and despair aren't strangers, either. All in all, I'm not sure why it took me so long to read this book, but I'm ever so glad I did. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book was really entertaining but felt kind of shallow. It's more of an event based story than one driven by character development. You'll care more about what happens next than how what happens next will effect the main characters.The main point I want to make about this story is that I read it and I liked it. But I don't want to and won't be ordering the sequels. Why? Mainly because I didn't really connect to anything in the book. I should have been sad when people died but I wasn't. The Lies of Locke Lamora is a page-turner that I didn't regret reading but won't be reading again."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book has recieved way too much hype and just isn't good enough to deserve it. The begining of the book was excellent but the story turned away from Locke's early time living under the cemetary much too quickly. Could have been much more and much better had it not tried so hard to be the Oceans 11 of fantasy and stuck to the Dickensian beginings of the character. I may or may not read book two but the reviews for that one are not very promising so not really sure."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Lynch creates a wonderful world, almost tactile in its descriptions. And there are some clever side characters. But I never grew to know, or care about, the main characters. I didn't cheer for them, didn't worry about them, and so this book ultimately disappointed me. Pretty phrasing, a very creative imagination, but it left me thinking that it could have been much more."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"For a plot synopsis, please see the review below this one :-)While I didn't find this to be the new frontier of fantasy novels that many people have made the book to be, I did find Lies of Locke Lamora to be entertaining and enjoyable. Scott Lynch creates a world with his words- lush descriptions filled with simile and metaphor, well-constructed characters, and a somewhat tangled plot. There are also several tantalizing hints at an unknown past that readers are not privy to but that, I hope, will make it into future offerings, if this is the first book of a series (for example, Locke's complex love life).An example of Lynch's marvelous way with words: \\"The voice was clipped and precise, scrubbed of Locke's natural inflections. He layered the hint of a harsh Vadran accent atop a slight mangling of his native Camorri dialect like a barkeep mixing liquors.\\"Clearly, Lynch knows how to write a simile. The book is littered with such fine turns of phrase, and makes the entire read very enjoyable. The dock of one star is because I thought the book took longer than necessary to get started. But once I caught the rhythm of it, it kept my interest very easily.The Lies of Locke Lamora is like joining the poetically vengeful nature of the Count of Monte Cristo with the good fun of Ocean's Eleven in a fantasy element. And, as is his creation Locke Lamora, Lynch is as good a mixer as any barkeeper. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book had so much potential. It has an interesting culture, it has a few characters that could glow, and a plot that could go places with volition. It does none of those things.There are flashbacks galore, interludes a plenty, and language that is gaudy. There are no cases in this story where a character uses a small word where a large one, or several large ones can be used instead. Worse, it feels as if the author has tried to shove an extra-superduper-extraordinary line of description every eight or twelve pages. The language clunks. It tries to be lyrical, it tries so hard and it fails. On top of this _all_ the characters have the same fulsome vocabulary, which seems a bit off. Sure, the group the title character is a part of is explained well, and the nobles are too, but the rest of the thieves, cut throats and petty criminals?This book is what I imagine it would be like to watch The Nutcracker be performed in plate armor and clogs."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"There is a lot to like in this debut novel. The pseudo Venice of Camorra is richly realized. The characters are vividly drawn and their dialogue is salty and entertaining. However, the main story arc, the development of the Gentlemen Bastards from street orphans to the premier confidence ring of the City, is severely hindered by the book's timeline. Lynch dribbles out the back-story bit by bit with flashbacks which rarely correspond to the \\"present time\\" story. These digressions are ultimately maddening. If I read this book again, I will bookmark the flashbacks and read them through in chronological order.Another really annoying problem with this book is what I call \\"the case of the missing character\\". Throughout the book there are references to a sixth member of the gang, and Locke's sometime girlfriend...BUT SHE NEVER SHOWS UP! Ok, so we all know there's going to be a sequel, but really. I kept wondering when she was going to appear (She's the one shadowing them from the rooftops. No, wait! Maybe she's the Gray King in disguise!)."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I've read many of the thoughtful and honest responses to the book. Although I agree that there are too many flashbacks and some superfluous scenes, this book kept me rapt until I finished the last word. A phenomenal first effort and a great mix of excitement, intrigue, and pure fun. I recommended it to my brother (who is not a F&SF fan by any means) because it has the ability to resonate with non-fantasy folk. He LOVED it. I couldn't help but get attached to Locke and his artful dodger antics. Not a children's book, but appealed to the child in me. I highly recommend it!!!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Wow. It has been years since a book grabbed me this hard. It reminded me of my misspent youth reading Fahferd and the Grey Mouser.I run a D&D; \\"Thieves\\" campaign in a large fantasy city I created. After reading this book I wanted to junk all my hundreds of hours of work and steal this city! I am going to force all my players to read this book so they can see what REAL thieves do!Imagine a city built on the ruins of an enigmatic lost and forgotten race who built with unbreakable glass. This is a decaying metropolis with canals between its various sectors and alchemical trees floating in them to clean out the filth. Picture festivals with highly trained female gladiators who battle jumping sharks on an arena of open water with posts for them to leap about upon.Locke is an amazing character; clever, non-descript, a master of disguise, at once capable of horrific crimes and amazing compassion.The dialogue had me laughing out loud more than once. Every character in it seemed to trigger some emotion with me, whether it was great affection or extreme hate. There are few boring people in this city!Read it you won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I picked this up on a whim after seeing it in my Amazon recommendations. I am absolutely relieved that I did! It's a keeper. I am not going to reiterate the plot line as that has been done very well in previous reviews.What makes this story really work for me is that the main characters are completely human. They are warm and humorous, mean and faulty. I am so sick and tired of the deus ex machina resolutions to plot lines and you won't find them here. The characters are extremely well drawn through interesting flashbacks and they triumph and most importantly, they also fail. Spectacularly, I might add. This is no fairy tale ending novel!This book is also truly enjoyable for me because when things get down and dirty everyone actually bleeds. Usually by no quick, clean method. Incredible detail, but not drawn out. Lynch actually puts thought into the battles and the characters get hurt, badly, instead of taking out their opponents with a slice or two with little hurt to themselves, and you see every moment of it. This makes it much more realistic and exciting than the usual superhero fare. There is a consequence to everything and some people pay with their lives.To me this was not a story about a mind-bending, perfectly put together and executed con as I thought it would be when I read the synopsis, but what happens when that perfect con falls completely and utterly to pieces!Excellent first and I am off to buy the second immediately."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"In his debut \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora,\\" Scott Lynch tells an intriguing story that, more than anything, depends on his ability to sell the reader on the main characters' abilities in the art of the con. Before the meat of the plot ever reaches the reader, we are deep into a connected subplot that is, in itself, thoroughly enjoyable and absolutely critical to our belief in what happens later in the novel. Because this initial confidence game is so well detailed, Lynch hooks his readers by giving them an intimate knowledge of the characters and their skills. He does this in one way, in particular, that is worth mentioning. Lynch makes clever use of time in this novel, and doesn't write it as if it must pass, from beginning to end, in chronological order. His primary device are the interludes - chapters between the primary plot advancing chapters, that relate relevant bits of the primary characters' pasts - which help the reader to understand the motives and means of the characters. His secondary device, used mostly in the opening chapters of the novel, is in allowing a single chapter to be read in a non-linear fashion. This allows for a part of the plot to be carried forth prior to the explanation of what the characters are planning. It's a clever device, and one that makes these earlier chapters all the more intriguing. I also appreciate that Lynch avoids clich&eacute; characters. The character of Locke Lamora could have easily been everything we want in a roguish character: intelligent, charming, witty, and very deadly...in other words, James Bond as a thief. But, rather than making such a predictable character, Lynch creates characters with flaws. Lamora is a great thief, but not a perfect one. And this makes him more believable.Additionally, I enjoyed the scope of this novel. Having read this on the suggestion of noted fantasy author George R.R. Martin, it goes without saying (to his fans, at least) that I can appreciate a novel (or series) with an enormous scope. This, however, had a very limited scope - one coastal city - that allowed for a more detailed telling. The city itself becomes a character.This is not to say that the novel is perfect. Lynch has many sub-chapters (each chapter is divided into many interrelated parts) wherein characters outside of the primary group of cons and thieves are the primary focus. This, then, highlights the relative lack of detail given to these parts of the story. That is not to say that these parts are undetailed, but that there aren't enough of them to make them seem as relevant to the entire plot or to contribute much to the realization of the city Lynch has created. For example, and without spoiling the plot, more detail regarding the worries or consequences, perhaps even the political problems, surrounding being conned out of a fortune would have made the story a deeper one. While we have a good deal of detail about the city's wards, its celebrations, its clothing, and so forth, we have relatively little about its politics, great or small, and these would have made for a broader and more complete tale.A secondary criticism, and this is really just a pet peeve, is Lynch's use of profanity. My criticism is not about the general use of it. After all, the primary characters are thieves, not priests (a little joke for those who've read it, already). My criticism is that authors manage to create cultures, geographies, cities, nations, religions, and any number of other things, and yet characters resort to the exact same curse words I might utter after hitting my thumb with a hammer. At the beginning of a story, when we desperately want to believe in the world Lynch has created, and the story is doing all it can to aid that belief, a sudden \\"No s***\\" is like a cold smack from reality that briefly jars a reader (or at least this one) out of belief in the story. But this is a minor criticism and, as the novel progressed, I became used to it.Overall, I would strongly recommend this novel to readers of fantasy. It is quick paced, engaging, and altogether different from much of what's out there. A good read, for certain!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Untruthful little Bastich has a surfeit of problems.The major problem with this book is that it appears to be padded to get up to 'the length the editor wants', it seems. This makes the start boring. Like Jimmy the Hand in the Raymond Feist books, the main character is a smart, alone kid that falls in with thieves, and has a flair for being different. However, rather than an interesting an entertaining introduction such as Fritz Leiber may have delivered, we get about four flashback incidents of what the kid does that is clever and lacking in common sense. By that time, you are about ready to say 'hey, why don't I lie down and you can hit me with a hammer that will imprint in big neon letters on my forehead \\"Locke Lamora is a clever reckless brat\\".Other than that, though, once the boring kid stuff is finally dispensed with many pages later, and kept a lot more brief later on the book is quite entertaining. You have an urban Italian style setting, with no firearms and a carts/ships/crossbows level of tech, and the odd hint of fantasy as Locke as his fellow band of thieves look to lay in a long con.This is shortcircuited by what is basically a gang war, and revenge plots, and draws in both the official and unofficial sides of the city into the bloodshed.I didn't notice until almost finished as on the back in faint type is 'Book One of the..' but it says sequence, not trilogy, so given the ending, it may be a sequence of adventures, as opposed to a trilogy given that is how it is worded. This would also explain some of the padding.I would go so far as to call this one a 3.75, with the really slow start dragging it down from a 4, and an inventive faster moving end bringing it back up in that direction."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"There are so many bad fantasy books out there. Often times, I pick one off the library shelf to give a book a shot and am disgusted by the pretentiousness of the \\"story.\\" More often then not, an author is trying to create a different sort of civilization or theology, but neglects the characters in the process.Not so with The Lies of Locke Lamora. For the first 100 pages or so, there are few indications that it is even a fantasy book. The story is captivating and you care about the characters. Scott Lynch still manages to do what other authors attempt at: create a new civilization and theology, but it's not in your face.Two plot lines are interwoven throughout the book. The first is about Locke Lamora's childhood and how he grew up into his life of crime, his mistakes and other foundational information about the society he lives in. The second is a tale of Locke as an adult, leading his gang, and some complications, ending with a big finish. Plot one adds the necessary background to what is happening in plot two, like well done flashbacks in a movie.I highly recommend this book, especially if you've been frustrated by pretentious fantasy for too long."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"\\"Richer and cleverer than everyone else!\\"That's the cry of the Gentleman Bastards, in The Lies of Locke Lamora by debut author Scott Lynch.Lies is the first volume in a planned seven book series called the Gentleman Bastards.Set in the canal city of Camorr, Lies is part Oliver Twist, part heist movie and is as fun of a romp as you could want to read. The prologue starts with our young protagonist, Locke, being sold from one gang of thieves into another where he is trained into adulthood where most of the story takes place. Scott uses interludes between the present day chapters to tell more of the backstory of the Gentlemen Bastards. Its a toll he uses very well, at least for the first 3/4 of the book. The flashbacks set up action in the present with a wonderful sense of timing and flair. However, the last few interludes, are not flashbacks, but more history lessons, and while they were informative, they felt a bit out of place to me.While some of the plot elements are fairly standard, the way they are executed keeps them from seeming cliche. In fact and exciting as the plot was, I don't think its the best part of the book. Its the dialogue that I fell in love with, the witty banter that brings to mind some of the best I've ever read, like GRRM's Tyrion Lannister. The thief with the heart of gold would be all to easy of a trap for Lynch to fall into, but he manages to avoid all pitfalls, and deliver a book that should be heralded as a classic of the genre twenty years down the road.I loved this book, it has all I could want, action, drama, suspense, plot twist, fun characters, witty dialogue. Do me a favor, do yourself a favor, read this book. Buy it now. If you cant buy it, beg borrow or steal it. The Crooked Warden will reward you. :p9.5 out of 10"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I liked the characters and I think the story line would have been good. I hate reading books where the authoir keeps switching between past, current and future. It gives too much away about the past, and just gets irritating. Just as you get engrossed in the current story you get whisked forward or back and lose the momentum. Scott Lynch does so much of this that for the third time in my life I abandoned a book half way through."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"A very high energy book, The Lies of lock Lamora follows a swashbuckling con artist from his start as a small child to his rise in power in his twenties.

When his plans impact and endanger political and criminal leaders alike, his world is rocked in ways he didn't expect.I liked this book, but it's hard to get too attached to any of the characters as so many (friends and enemies) die before the end. Not to give too much away - enough characters survive for a sequel - but no one is safe. Letting characters live longer would have allowed deeper, more nuanced personalities and relationships to emerge."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Since Christmas I've been blasting through book after book on my new Kindle and it's been really fun. Unfortunately, the string of great books ended with this one. It's not that this wasn't a good book, it just wasn't engaging until about the last third; and, by that point I already felt like I was finishing the book just to say I had.The problem, for me, was really the way the story was written. The chapters alternate between the past and the present so I never really got lost in either story line. With a good book I get completely engrossed in the story and kind of forget that I'm reading - but that could never happen with this book because of the choppy alternating style.To be fair, the last third of the book focused more on the present and got a lot more interesting. The alternating chapters continued, but they got shorter and covered more random topics rather than a second storyline from the past. Even with the good ending, I'm not sure I'd recommend this book to anyone - my only recommendation is once you've started it you might as well finish. It really does get better (unlike some books)."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"To fans of Charles Dickens' timeless classic \\"Oliver Twist\\", at least the opening scenes of Scott Lynch's ground-breaking epic debut novel will seem familiar. Locke Lamora, an impoverished, hungry orphan on a distant world reminiscent of medieval Venice, is captured off the streets and sold into servitude to the Eyeless Priest, a thief and con who, like Fagin, feeds and houses his crew of urchins while teaching them to live off the avails of thievery.Lamora's precociousness, his easy-going flamboyance, his skill and intelligence, his artistry and imaginative ability to craft rock solid confidence games, his audacity and cock-sure bravado combined with his obvious love of life ensure that when the Eyeless Priest passes on, he falls naturally into the role of leadership of a group of best friends and clever cons who style themselves \\"The Gentlemen Bastards\\".Lamora's plans to fleece the nobility out of their wealth put him into a difficult conflict with \\"the secret peace\\", an unwritten truce that exists between the Duke of Camorr and Capa Raza, the de facto ruler of all of the gangs including, of course, \\"The Gentlemen Bastards\\". Basically, crime is accepted and the local constabulary looks the other way provided, of course, the crime is directed at only the common people and the nobility are left alone.When a shadowy character known only as \\"The Grey King\\" assassinates Capa Raza and usurps his position as the local crime boss, Lamora and the rest of his gang find themselves truly between a rock and a hard place. Now they are hunted by both the Duke's secret police, The Midnighters, and the Grey King's relentless enforcers that include, among other things, a powerful mage and an all-seeing fierce pet falcon with poisoned claws!It is difficult to say enough good things about this incredible novel without appearing to actually froth at the mouth!Characterization is positively brilliant and every character seems to be developed to such an astonishing degree as to actually leap off the page and into reality in the minds of the reader. I won't spoil the story by saying who dies, but when a couple of the good guys meet their nemesis, the characters have been so firmly built in the psyche of the reader that the effect is positively devastating!Dialogue also deserves a full set of superlative compliments! Ranging from hilarious, comical strings of vulgar, medieval profanities that would make a longshoreman blush to upper crust court-speak that would be the envy of a Shakespeare in full blossom, Lynch's dialogue shows he is a master of conveying his story through conversation as well as descriptive narrative. And his descriptive abilities, by the bye, are not exactly low key either. Camorr is brought fully to life and Lynch's readers will have no trouble at all picturing a fully-realized jam-packed setting as his characters move from place to place in this fast-paced story.Hie thee to the purveyor of fine books closest to thy hand and, with all due haste, read \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\", a picaresque fantasy of epic proportions in a gorgeous medieval setting. It's not mere hyperbole to suggest that this is the most exciting book I've read for quite some time.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book promises the scope and scale of an epic fantasy, but without the epic.It is about a human population in some distant realm. The characters are well drawn. There is suspense and good plotting, (although, it seemed to drag in places). Locke Lamore is an intriguing rogue, but never do we really see this character confront a really terrible, cataclysmic situation.The whole tension between Gentlemen Bastards (Lamore's group) and the lead up to the final fight left me wanting something more. Unfortunately, this book doesn't provide it."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Scott Lynch along with Patrick Rothfuss (The Name of the Wind) will rock your world!!! two of the greatest first novels from two of the greatest promises in the literal fantasy world.

You will be transported to a different and raw world. A world where you better be alert or you could probably loose all of your money or worst, your life.Scott Lynch has created an incredible world of MAFIA, assasins, dark magic, and dark humor at its best. This wonderful and well plotted book will leave you wanting more and more. I've already ordered the next book \\"Red Seas under Red Skies\\".

It had a \\"Count of Monte Cristo\\" type of feel, which was really interesting to read in a book in the fantasy genre. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The hero of this tale, one Locke Lamora, could easily be recognized as a new world Oliver Twist with his urchin-like characteristics; badly done by, his upbringing and his training as a thief carried out by an updated Fagin. But the writer- whose prose I much admired- carries his hero much further than that into an adult world where only the strongest and most devious survive; where a dog eat dog mentality is imbued into most of the residents of Camorr, excepting those born into privilege.The story sweeps one along at a rollicking pace and the denouement is carried out well except I personally would have liked a more liberal use of the 'F' word. Overall an enjoyable romp from an author destined to go places."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Trained from childhood as a thief and con-artist par excellence, Locke Lamora employs a silver tongue and quicksilver mind to divest the rich of Camorr of their excessive wealth. No sooner do Locke and his associates initiate their latest scheme, however, than they find themselves at the mercy of the mysterious Gray King, who intends to use them as pawns in his bid to take over the city-state's underworld. As the Gray King's diabolical plan unfolds, Locke finds his skills tested as never before as he struggles not only for his own survival, but also for the survival of his friends and Camorr itself.In this scintillating debut novel, Scott Lynch establishes himself as a rising star of fantasy fiction. Like Patrick Rothfuss (The Name of the Wind), Lynch is a natural storyteller with a keen intellect and a gift for richly detailed, imaginative world-building and intricate plotting. Lies is a fast-paced, entertaining, stilettos- (and hatchets-) against-sorcery tale that is both self-contained and well-positioned as a cornerstone for further adventures. It does have its share of weaknesses: excessive and gratuitous profanity; good but not deeply developed characterization; a few locales that are either too complex to describe or else inadequately described; and a lack of any comment on the human condition or truth that will change one's life. In short, it's a tale intended as pure entertainment ... and as such, it admirably succeeds.Highly recommended for fans of thieves, caper movies, and well-written sword-and-sorcery. Recommended with a caveat to fans of high fantasy and anyone distasteful of profanity and violence. Four gleaming white-iron stars."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"As many other reviewers will tell you, this is an amazing first book by Lynch. Probably the most telling factor is the pace with which the book moves. The first 10 aside, the 700 pages disappear and dissolve into an engrossing story. This will be one of those books that keeps you up all night, makes you late for work, and gets you behind on your chores. Perhaps this is the work of a good editor, but the job is done!Also of note - this book serves as a great introduction to the genre of Fantasy. No dragons, no knights, no overblown romance. The use of magic, though critical in the book, isn't really dwelled upon until the second half, and the world never truly feels impossible. Locke does the impossible, but he does it with the most mundane tools and a great heap of wits.Built up from so many existing motifs - pirates, the mob, cops and robbers, magic, secret societies, torn worlds, ancient mysteries - you might think tLoLL has no surprises, but you'd be very, very wrong."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I've ready many fantasy novels over the years, although admittedly not as many recently. As an aspiring author in the genre, I was looking for something to read for character development techniques. After much fruitless searching among other purely plot-focused writings, I stumbled upon this offering from an unknown (to me) writer. A single glance at the synopsis on the back cover was all it took to sell me. Actually reading the book itself proved to be far more rewarding than I had expected.From the opening chapter I knew that Scott Lynch was not your typical fantasy author. He is possessed of a talent the likes of which I have not seen in years. There is nothing cliche, and very little that is predictable, about his characters, settings or story lines. The characters are invariably colorful, unique and memorable. The settings are at the same time believable and realistic, yet fresh and enticing. The story itself, well, it's one of the most engaging, pleasantly twisting and suspenseful yarns I've read in many years. I'm so refreshed to see a hero who is not trying to save the world from destruction by the forces of overwhelming evil (e.g., the standard offering from a Terry Brooks or a Robert Jordan). He's just trying to protect himself, his friends and his turf from others who seem to be meaner, tougher and more determined to take them from him.Locke Lamora and his world are a delightful place to lose oneself. The reader will find gritty, realistic action and an intricate plot with all manner of twists, turns and surprises. The dialogue is always credible, frequently witty and occasionally downright humorous. Although some reviewers have opined that the ending of this novel is a bit weak, I disagree. Without getting into spoilers, I will say that the final encounter between Lamora and Raza ended most poetically. One word of caution, however, is that the book is chock full of rather colorful language that makes it unsuitable for young readers. Overall, however, I enjoyed this immensely, and would summarize it as a blending of the best elements of Glen Cook (the Black Company series) and Steven Brust (the Vlad Taltos series). I'm very much looking forward to the sequel."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"If you travel to the canal city of Cammorra, be warned it's a city thick with thieves and gangs. And the cleverest of them all is Locke Lamorra and the Gentleman Bastards, but their schemes go very badly array when the mysterious Gray King and his sorceries companion move in on the ruling crime boss.The Lies of Locke Lamorra is one of the best and most unique fantasy stories I've read. It's grand swashbuckling tale of adventure and revenge. For once believe the blurbs, because they are all true this time.Think Thieves' World in Venice with Don Corleone as boss of the crime syndicate, Farhd and the Grey Mouser as the resident trouble-makers."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"You know, I actually put this one aside the first time I started it. But the raves it was given by my fellow bookie lovers and the fact that it kept staring at me in the book store convinced me to give it another try. Oh my. I am certainly glad I did. This is so different from the standard sword/sorcery/dragon/elves fantasy: it reminds me very much of Scar Night (another gorgeous piece) and The Blade Itself (another absolute keeper). Even though they are all quite different from each other they are similar in that they introduce us to an entirely new genre in fantasy literature. All three of these books are NOT TO BE MISSED. I can't recommend more highly. I am a confessed bookie lover addict-- read these and savor the habit."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The Lies of Locke Lamora was genuinely fun to read. The author created a fast-moving plot, memorable and amusing characters, and a criminal underworld that appears like it really could exist.The dialogue and prose, in particular, need to be singled out for their quality. It was alway amusing to hear any of the main characters speak, particularly on something they were angry about. In addition to that, the prose was nice and clear, with the quality of George R.R. Martin's work.The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because of the ending. It's not a bad ending, but it seemed just slightly contrived for a character like Locke to do the act he did.Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone, fantasy fan or not. It's a quality piece of work."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Take one typical street-urchin turned master thief (but make him small, feisty, loyal, funny and foul-mouthed). Place in one standard crumbling, decadent Renaissance-Italy type city (but be sure it's as corrupt and vile and grand as any such city, real or imagined, ever was). Combine with loyal henchmen and various layers of scum of the earth (but differentiated them from each other with loyalties, speech and all variety of unique mannerisms). Cover with rarefied air of Machiavellian nobility (but make them both above-the-fray and wallowers therein). Bake until golden brown.Such is the basic recipe for Scott Lynch's exceptionally tasty (and rather long) The Lies of Locke Lamora.Lynch has given writers a textbook example of how to raise the stakes for characters. Every time Locke encounters a threat, the next thing you know he encounters an even greater threat, and on and on. And it's well executed, too: don't think that it's an absurdist Calvin-and-Hobbes kind of \\"what's more frightening than Tyrannosaurs? Tyrannosaurs in F-14s!\\" thing.I would be remiss if I did not object to the two small holes that Lynch leaves in the story, one about Locke's long-lost love and one about how Locke came to replace his mentor. Both emerge from the backstory that informs the book, and neither is necessary for the realization of the plot. Indeed, these holes leave open possibilities for further adventures of Locke Lamora, which I would welcome. But those holes are irksome to me."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I just didn't enjoy this book. I found it hard to get into, and the plot was not very good. Much ado about nothing to sum it up."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Actually, I believe the phrase is \\"hella impressed.\\" I've been let down by the past few books I've chosen based on reviews, and went into this book with a few pouting expectations. I should not have worried. Although the language is definitely adult--no Harry Potter here--the game's afoot and the story unique. I am looking forward to adding many Lynch novels to my fiction collection.Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I am an avid reader who had never heard of Scott Lynch. I ordered this book up on a capricious whim thinking it might be a fun read. But I was instantly mezmerized by this story. I knew by the tenth page that this would be one of the most developed books I will read this year.And cover to cover it was wild. Lynch's characters are gloriously comprised, their plot wierdly thick and always their quick wit drips with honest humor. Read the Lies of Locke Lamora, learn to curse like thief in gentlemans clothes. I have nothing but praise for this book and I am very happy to add it into my library."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The Lies of Locke Lamora is an excellent first novel by what appears to be an extremely promising new author. This book is probably the most entertaining read I have ever had. The characters are well fleshed out, the plot is interesting, and reading about uppity nobles (among others) being bilked out of money makes for interesting nights.From first to last, The Lies of Locke Lamora delivers on all the hype and will you keep you engrossed til you come out the other end ready to don a mask and thief a little on the side."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I don't understand how this book received such stellar reviews. It is just plain boring from the very first word of the very first chapter. I tried, I really did but if you find yourself skipping entire paragraphs or pages from the fist chapter, well then you already know it sucks. Didn't care about the main character, didn't care about his crew, and ultimately never finished this book."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Mr. Lynch has some decent ideas but this book is a tough read. The story jumps around with very little transition and can be tough to follow. It is also filled with gratuitous vulgarity from curse words to obscene comments. I am not easily offended but the language shocks you away from the story. This book desperately needs an editor and a rewrite, until that happens don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This was a different from what I normaly read and that is more Tolkien like books. The Author writes about young men who are brought up to be thievs and con men in an world where magic exsits but not in an magic world. Not a book about big strong heroes, and magicians but more about a Dikcens kind of fantasy world. I found it a bit on the hard side to read for some reason or another. I fealt that I had to push my self through the book, even that I was a interesting book to read."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"It was very dull and the flash backs seemed to get in the way of the story."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This was one of those books that I thought was going to get 5 stars from me, but eventually ended up as 'merely quite good' in my mind.The absolute best part of the book are the characterizations, including the dialogue. The characters are definitely individuals, and they have wonderful banter with each other. That said, I do have a few problems with some of these interactions. Certain characters seemed just a bit more capable of dissembling, especially around other characters which supposedly should be quite good at knowing if another person believes them or not.The writing itself is excellent. I don't recall any obviously awkward turns of phrase. The imagery is quite well done. Action scenes make sense within the story, and have real consequences as opposed to just being thrown in for some excitement.The plot itself presents a bit of a problem. It's one of those books that appears to be going very strongly and focusedly in one direction, and then all of a sudden it takes off at a right angle. If you were really getting into the first part of the story, as I was, it might seem a bit of a letdown to suddenly lose the thread. While the thread of the first part of the plot is picked up again near the end, to me it didn't have quite the same interest as it did previously. The middle part of the book definitely has a different feel than the first part, and I didn't think it was as interesting, even if it was pretty realistic. Some people complained about 'jumps in time'. The main flashbacks all have an 'Interlude' as part of the chapter name, and thus are pretty easy to spot. There was one not so obvious time jump, but I thought it was quite cleverly done and not much of a distraction.I actually didn't have too many problems with some of the 'luck' that Locke Lamora seems to have near the end. And I really enjoyed the convoluted plot that Locke came up with, all for a set of clothes. I also didn't have any problems with the swearing that I've seen show up in a lot of negative reviews. One of the complaints is that the swearing is 'modern English' (American style modern English anyhow). Well, they're _speaking_ modern English in the book. What should they swear in? Now if you have a problem with them speaking 'Modern English' in general, then that's one thing. As far as the swearing itself, well, the people who do it aren't nice, genteel, cultured people (and I've seen nice, genteel, cultured people drop a curse once in awhile too). I found it refreshing and it made the dialogue truer than it is in many books.I also usually hate 'obvious mysteries'. By this, I mean a mystery that other characters know about but that the reader is never brought into fully. This book has one, and I actually liked it a fair bit. The key element here is that it really has no bearing on the book itself, but meshes VERY well with how groups of people act and talk in the real world. Close groups who have someone who's left the group, often talk about them or remember them even if they've been gone for awhile, and this is basically the 'obvious mystery' in this book even though you never meet the individual they refer to. Just one more touch that I like.So in the end, I really enjoyed this book, primarily because of the characters and dialogue. The writer is far more accomplished at his craft than one would expect from a first time author. There were a couple of missteps along the way which dropped the rating for me down a notch."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"If you enjoy a good revenge tale, one with cunning, guile, and dash, this is for you. Not the usual sword and sorcery tale. High marks."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This was an excellent read. The story was fresh, the characters were real, and the world was very well realized.For the reviewers who complained of the level of profanity used through out the novel, all I can say is that it brought even more realism to the story when taking into consideration the class of society that the story revolves around. It's unfortunate that this could be offensive to some people, just understand that the whole world isn't as proper as the little bubble people have a tendency to form around themselves.With that being said, This book does have a high amount of profanity in it. So keep that in mind!Excellent Book, all around!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Maybe not the best book ever written but it kept me in my room on a saturday night which tells for itself ,I like the character, the atmosphere and the plot"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"After reading more traditional fantasy novels, it took me a while to get hooked in this book. After 100 pages, it was over, I WAS HOOKED!! This book is like reading Ocean's Eleven based in a medieval Spanish setting. Mind you I bought this book on the review from George R. R. Martin, and at first I was like, \\"Is he serious?!\\" But for the first 100 or so pages the book builds up character, plot, and background. You don't even realize it was necessary until certain things start appearing and making you say, \\"Oooh, that's why...\\" AWESOME!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Scott Lynch weaves a very entertaining tale of mischief, mayhem and chaos in this story about a cunning thief, Locke Lamora. The Gentlemen Bastards are a very unassuming and seemingly insignificant gang of orphaned thieves trained and raised by a sage priest, Chains. Locke Lamora leads this gang, but not by steel, not by strength, not by magic, but by his cunning, deceptive mind.THE LIES OF LOCKE LAMORA stands out for its cunny, witty dialogue, hysterical humor, deceptive legerdemains, and of course for the funny, yet gritty, characterization of Locke Lamora.As Locke tells us at one point in the novel, \\"...there's no freedom quite like the freedom of being constantly underestimated.\\" One of his cohort-brothers answers, \\"Gods, yes...If we were any freer we'd float away in the the sky and fly like birds.\\"Unfortunately, our unassuming, yet richest, gang of thieves receive some undesired attention when a mysterious Gray King arrives at Camorr (the city serving as the backdrop for the entire novel). Our cunning Locke and his Gentlemen Bastards' schemes and thievery go terribly, terribly awry as they face one complication after another. Locke - short and skinny - must exercise his wit to get him out of the complications that start piling up for his gang.Scott Lynch's worldbuilding is very thorough, if not prodigiously overdone at times. His city of Camorr and outlying city-states comes alive vividly, from the feel to the looks, from the smells to the tastes, from the languages and accents to the trade and economy, from the political bureacracy to the entertainment.I do have two complaints.It took me two weeks to get through the first 200 pages, while two days to finish the last 300 in this hardcover edition. It wasn't until after Chapter 5, The Gray King chapter, that events seriously started spiraling out of control for our band of thieves. I was reading other books during the first 200 pages and I just lost interest in LIES OF LOCKE LAMORA during this time. But man, do things pick up after Chapter 5.And secondly, the interludes really bring the momentum of the story to a screeching halt. Although they were mercifully shorter later in the novel, they were still jarring to me. The long interludes in the beginning of the book really, really slowed things down.Otherwise, a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable reading experience, one I would unabashedly recommend to everyone..."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"A lot was expected of Scott Lynch's debut novel. There was a buzz around the 'net abuot it, from the story of how he was signed, to his multi-book deal to the Hollywood connection. For the most part, this book lives up to the promise. Lynch clearly has a good command of language and a fantastic ear for dialogue, and his breezy style is a joy to read. The action and plot twists come thick and fast, making the book a good, old-fashioned \\"page-turner\\". The central characters are well-drawn, more than mere caricatures and one is easily drawn into their lives and their rich, nuanced world.All of this pales in significance before this fact: the book is a heckuva lot of fun to read. Go forth and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book was excellently written with a great depth in characters. The vivid detail of the surroundings sucked you into this world, which leaves me wanting more. Can't wait until the next book."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Scott Lynch hit the ball out of the park with his 1st book. This is one of the best books Ive read in recent times."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Excellent fun.The characters are real, the setting is beautiful and gritty, the plot both convoluted and believable.The book is like a well done rather expensive meal. Filling, rich, full of flavors, spice, and fascinating textures. The kind of meal you savor. Particularly the wit."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Nothing I hate more when it comes to media than a story that really could of been good and ended up mediocre, Lies of Locke Lamora ended up being bad, hence the 2 stars. The book started out with an interesting secret that kept me turning pages but when it was reveled on page 23 or so I was bored. An interesting cast of characters were introduced and we never heard from them again. The character development is null, the main character, Locke, is a great thief and a good friend. That's all he's got, no soul, no thoughts, no feelings.What really kills this book is the constant descriptions, at lavish parties ( theres maybe a dozen of them) you read about 2 paragraphs about the food, then the decorations. No one has any opinions of the food, wait I take that back, at one point a character says \\"It's all wonderful\\" or something close. There are also pages and pages about the architecture. On and on and on....No one in the book has any opinion on how the buildings look. That's what really got to me all this stuff about setting an environment and the characters have no opinions on it. No opinions about anything! It killed the author for me.Check out the Night Angel Trilogy instead."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I'm completely baffled by the large number of glowing reviews here. It seems to me that a great number of readers are looking for a very light and amusing style of fantasy. Perhaps this book has broad appeal for the same reason that movies like Ocean's 11 have broad appeal. Any tale of a gang of hipsters acting cool and pulling the wool over the eyes of the rich seems enough to satisfy many people.Personally I tire of the thieving anti-hero who spouts endless one-liners. Unless there is some real substance beneath the hip banter it just starts to seam silly. But I read the first hundred pages or so of this book and I could not find a hint of substance.We first encounter our anti-hero as a very young boy, orphaned, living on the streets but possessing great thieving skills. He is apparently completely uneducated and spends his days engaging in petty theft. Suddenly we skip ahead a decade or more and our anti-hero is now plotting elaborate cons. He speaks many languages. He can pass himself off as a rich merchant and converse knowingly with nobles.This is where the book totally lost me. If you want me to believe that a grubby little guttersnipe grew up to be a master con man you really have to show me how this happened? But is this book it seems we are just supposed to accept it.I think I would have loved this book when I was sixteen. But these days I prefer a little more depth, believability and continuity in my fantasy."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"WOW! By reading all of these fabulous reviews I would have thought this was better than A Song of Ice and Fire by George Martin! Sorry, not even close. I certainly liked R. Scott Bakker's \\"The Prince of Nothing\\" better. I like Greg Keyes \\"The Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone\\" better. I like Paul Kemp's Erevis Cale series better. Finally, I am reading Acacia by David Anthony Durham and it's better.Maybe I am just not too huge a fan of an \\"Oliver Twist\\" tale. Still, it was good enough for me to continue the series. I am just in disbelief by how many \\"glowing\\" reviews this book has recieved."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"You HAVE to read this book if you like dark fantasy. It is humorous, sharp, and the plot is gripping.Lynch is the best writer I've read in fantasy in a long time, and along with Brent Weeks new novelThe Blinding Knife (Lightbringer), \\"Lies\\" stands as a unique fantasy with a strong voice. These novels are a stark contrast to most efforts being churned out of the fantasy mill now, and Lamora is a character you will simply not be able to stop reading about (go ahead and budget some cash for book 2, because you'll be forced to buy it the second you close the book)."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, there were some really great things about it. For example, the fantasy world was fully formed and described, and the main character was a highly-entertaining, unapologetic liar and confidence man. But on the other hand, some things just did not work for me. For example, I felt bogged down in the numerous and overly thorough descriptions of the world. And the fantasy elements were too sparse for my taste.The Lies of Locke Lamora is a story about a confidence gang that happens to exist in a fantasy setting. Outside of the world itself, the only remnant of fantasy found in this book a single character who is a Bondmage (i.e., sorcerer bad-guy dude). The Bondmage makes the gang's plans rather difficult to carry out. The Bondmage was fun, in an evil bad-guy sort of way, and I appreciated his presence in the story.Other than the Bondmage, the fantastical elements of the story were nothing more than a backdrop. I found this quite frustrating, because the fantasy backdrop was amazing, and I wanted so badly for it to be relevant. The land in which the story took place had been previously inhabited by some alien beings, who left their alien buildings behind. Also, lots of lighting and nature described in the book were provided by \\"alchemical\\" means. But these fantastical elements were never integrated into the plot. Rather, they were simply things for the author to describe--in great detail through which the reader must suffer despite the lack of direct relation to the story. While reading, I eventually wished that the world was a little less fantastical, so that I wouldn't have to hear about it all the time. I found myself skimming over descriptions in order to get back to the story.Let us now pretend that this book was about two-thirds a long as it actually was, and all the superfluous, irrelevant world description has been excised from the text. . . . I liked the story. It wasn't really a fantasy story, but I liked it nonetheless.Locke Lamora is a likable, flawed character. I loved the idea of his being a priest of the Nameless Thirteenth god, of whom the other Twelve gods are ashamed. The Nameless Thirteenth is the Crooked Warden, the God of Thieves. Love that! As a priest of the Nameless Thirteenth, Locke was able (to my great amusement) to justify his dubious actions by asserting his devotion to the will of the Crooked Warden!Locke Lamora always had another trick up his sleeve. He devised plots to steal money from the nobility and to squeeze himself and his gang out of tight spots. And when tragedy struck, he turned his attentions to plans of revenge. It really is a wonderful story, and Locke is a wonderful character.Despite the things I liked about this book, I do not see myself reading any other books in the Gentleman Bastards series. I simply do not look forward to suffering any more descriptions of that world."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I liked the idea of the story , but was disappointed with the way it was written.I actually enjoyed the way the story went back and forth between future and past, I did not find this annoying as other readers have.I did get very bored with the endless description of the architecture and clothing, I skipped so many pages!!!!!!As I mentioned, I think the story was a great idea, but I feel - for me - something was just missing, it never really delivered. There seemed to be a lot of writing about stuff that didn't matter.... as if the author had been tasked with writing a certain number of pages. Maybe if the characters would have been developed a bit more, or those events that actually impacted the story had been developed more, I might have felt pulled in.I was really annoyed with the \\"case of the missing character\\", as other reviewers have referred to her. Throughout the book there are references to a sixth member of the gang, a female who seems to have had a serious relationship with the main character and has left him heartbroken. All though all the characters in the story knew of her, the reader is never enlightened ..........I just didn't get the point.I am not going to recommend it at the current price $7.99 Kindle, maybe if it was .99, also I will not be reading the second book."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Premise: Locke Lamora is an orphan and a sneak thief, but one with tremendous ingenuity and potential. He is brought into (and up by) the Gentlemen Bastards, possibly the most unusual gang of thieves in the complicated underworld of Camorr. When a newcomer threatens to overthrow the head of all the gangs, the Gentleman Bastards - and their current confidence scam - are caught in the middle.I don't say this often, but I have a sneaking suspicion this would be a better movie than it is a book.I enjoyed this book, but not as much as I hoped to. I think it largely comes down to style, though. It's an action-intrigue caper plot, with plenty of double-dealing, late reveals, close calls, death and bloodshed. It does this perfectly well, but I never really connected with the protagonist. Locke is a skilled thief, con artist and actor, and very little ink is spilled on developing the man under all that. There are moments that seem to touch on his feelings for his friends or his profession or his city, but they never felt fully realized to me. He just wasn't anyone. He had no personality under his talents, beyond the broadest most obvious strokes.The characters didn't seem to have examined their own lives very closely when we meet them, and while the developments of the plot challenge their health and their ingenuity, they never really challenge their morality or cause them to grow in any way.Now that said, the world is interesting, the characters are colorful, and the plot is nicely twisty. Camorr as fantasy Venice is fantastic, and the constantly shifting plots and alliances are exciting. In a movie, when you can just trust the character to be in the eyes of your lead actor if he's cast well, this could be an awesome experience.The present-day story is interwoven with flashbacks that show how the group came together and trained, and while these are all interesting, and many are important for later plot points, it did mean that the book took a lot of pages to ramp up the pace. Some characters who are hinted at being important early on never even show up in this volume.There's a seriously dark turn at one point that really took me aback, and I had trouble enjoying the book afterward. I guess I'd rather if it had earned it with more character depth. You don't need character depth for a caper, you do if you are writing something you want to have dramatic weight.Still, it was fun for most of the ride, and the ending was fairly satisfactory."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I purchased the audio book version, because now I rarely have time to sit down and read... and I found myself sitting in the car to get just 'one more page'. I love this book! I've heard it described as Ocean's Eleven meets Venice, and I feel like that's a good start. It's really a fun ride, you're always guessing what comes next, and just when you think things can't get more complicated they get a LOT more complicated. Thunderous ending that wraps everything up, but is a good prelude to the next, and I already have that one in my audiobook lineup.I want to address one thing - some people seem to think that the writing is too 'made for Hollywood', but I really disagree here. Sure, it's really entertaining but I do think there is some character depth here, although it isn't evenly dispersed with every character. I think that the author balances the plot threads so well that you just don't notice how crazy it's all getting, and I feel like the world is well defined and rich without belaboring the point."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"So I picked up this book because I had seen it recommended on some \\"best of\\" lists, and the caper angle seemed fun. I really enjoyed the first section of the book before the actual plot kicked off. The main character in particular seemed well rounded if not completely novel, and the caper was entertaining with enough mystery to keep you hooked. Certainly something different than the normal fantasy fare. I read the first part very quickly, and if I had stopped there I would have given the book 4-5 stars. Unfortunately, the main plot doesn't in my mind live up to the promise of the first part of the book.&lt;Minor Spoilers Ahead - I won't give away important plot points, but I will discuss the general direction of the book to express my issues.>I was interested when the main plot line started up about 1/4 the way in to see where it would go. At first, the mystery was intriguing. However, as more and more of the main plot was revealed, the more disappointed I became. Mainly, for a book that focuses on a \\"brilliant\\" protagonist, nothing really smart happens. The hero doesn't really ever outsmart anyone in a notable way except one character to get a new set of clothes (one of the better sections of the later part of the book). He essentially lucks out several times by not dying when he should, and the one time he does truly outsmart a villain, it is because that villain makes a foolish assumption that almost made me go \\"really?\\" out loud when I read it.By the time I was finished I couldn't help but feel somewhat frustrated. The book starts out as Oceans Eleven and basically ends as a Die Hard sequel. Again, I thought that the author skillfully created an interesting world and colorful characters. It is okay for a main character not always to be in control or to have all the answers, but the main character didn't need to be an amazing thief for the plot to unfold as it did. If you want an interesting and unique fantasy world with a hard to predict direction, you may enjoy this book, but if you are looking for a well orchestrated caper where the main character outclasses his enemies and leaves you appreciative of the subtleties (as the first part of the book indicated) I can't recommend it."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch is a fantasy fiction novel about rogues and thieves in the city of Camorr. Locke Lamora is an orphan boy who finds himself in the hands of a thiefmaker who decides even in his world of troublemakers Locke is too troublesome and sells him to Chains, a priest of one of the temples in Camorr. Chains is actually a conman who takes in promising children and teaches them his trade.The chapters change between Locke as a child learning how to con people and Locke as an adult running a gang of thieves known as the Gentlemen Bastards. The book is fast paced and switches perspectives throughout. This can be a little annoying when a major heist is being pulled in the present and the perspective is changed at a pivotal point.I'm a sucker for heist stories and Locke Lamora and his Gentlemen Bastards pull off some of the most intricate and audacious jobs imaginable. The reader is let in on the central heist as it is being executed and the cleverness of the deception is shocking. Then one of the villains traps Locke in his own heist surpassing the original deception.The strengths of this novel lie in the complex plot and fully realized world. Some reviewers have pointed out a lack of character development but for me this didn't detract from the story at all. The world and the plot took center stage. There weren't many fantasy elements in the story and magic was presented without much explanation. Possibly because it would have been a distraction from the plot. This is a complete novel on its own that doesn't require a sequel though there is one.I would recommend this book to those who like the modern take on fantasy and a fast-paced read."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I enjoyed the book, but it felt a bit slow up until the middle. It wasn't until you met the story's main antagonist, the Grey King, half way through, that the book actually got good. Before that, it was just Locke running around doing his business and character background information.I will admit that the ending was a bit disappointing. It was a bit over the top. The ending is a bit like cheesy action movies where the actors takes 50 bullets, 200 stab wounds and multiple beatings and yet somehow has to strength to get one good hit on his enemy and lives to tell his tale.I'd recommend this book but I wouldn't would it on the top of your list, maybe towards the middle. For a very good fantasy series, I recommend the Mistborn Trilogy by Brandon Sanderson.Oh and one more thing, for those of you looking for magic, there isn't much in this book."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I found this book to have great dialog (reminiscent of Jack Vance), interesting characters, a picturesque setting with good world building, and a good plot. It is a great first effort for a new author. I would give it 5 stars except it dragged a bit for me and perhaps could have been better presented in a slightly shorter length. Never the less, I look forward to tackling the sequel."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"After \\"Lord of the Rings\\", this has definitely got to be my favorite fantasy novel of all time. I was worried in the beginning as it started a bit slow and was too reminiscent of \\"Oliver Twist\\" with the hordes of beggar children working for the old thief, but that introductory minutia was easily overlooked once the proper plot started up, and oh what a thing of joy it was. I won't spoil any details, but really the main thing I love in ANY book is an intelligent main character and we have that in spades with Locke Lamora. Unlike other books who profess to have intelligent characters, I was rarely if ever able to outguess Locke Lamora, but his actions fit so neatly into the overall scheme he worked on that it was just a beautiful thing and a wonder to behold.The second book is almost as good as the first, and I can only hope that more will follow as soon as possible."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I enjoyed reading this book so much! The plot is different and the start was a bit confusing but it gets clearer and more exciting as the story progresses. I haven't read any book like this: fast paced, intriguing ang thoroughly enjoyable. I have to read the whole series!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book, thanks to George Martin's review, emerged with a lot of hype. The first reviews came in positive, and expectations could scarcely have been higher. That is usually the recipe for a major letdown, but this book lived up to the hype, and then some.This is a rock 'n roll romp; fantasy fiction as imagined by Jimi Hendrix, Fritz Lieber on speed. Lynch uses familiar tropes, which for a lesser writer would be derivative, but his wordsmithery is at such a high-level that they are invigorated with new energy.Unlike Martin's work, I don't know that it has cross-genre appeal. It might not appeal to those who don't regularly read spec fic. For those who do, however, it's frenetic, fierce, fantastic prose is a treat for all."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I picked this up due to George Martins recommendation on his website and from the cover blurb of this book, which Martin also wrote. It also didnt hurt that Martin wrote one of my favorite series of books in my life. Now, i wish i could high five or chest bump Martin on a recommendation spot on.Locke Lamora is a highly entertaining and interesting new character in fantasy. His adventures, and misadventures, with Jean and his other friends are a joy to read. Lockes humor and sarcastic tones are highly amusing, funny, and gets him some choice reactions with his enemies. His bout with the barrel and his first interaction with the bondsmage, after a very intimidating back story on their powers, were real stand outs. Lockes personality and charm are second to none and really makes for some great scenes. I also love the name Locke, for a thief, and i cant help but thinking about Locke from Final Fantasy, which is always a good thing.The author, Scott Lynch, can also write. Along with George Martin and Patrick Rothfuss, he has some of the best adult writing talent and realistic dialogue out there. Plus the dark humor and action scenes are marvelously realized.But after all the praise, why not 5 instead of 4 stars? Well, for one, the books many coups plot points can get a tad hectic and confusing and while i love Lynchs adult dialogue, there are a lot of curse words and foul language in this book. I know, i know, Locke and his buddies are street kids who grew up in a hard environment, but still, there are A LOT of curse words.Locke and his antics come highly recommended and are the second best current fantasy novels out there, after George Martin of course. Pick this up, you wont be sorry."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"There are a number of things that make this an excellent fantasy book. The characters are interesting and fun, but they still have flaws; after all, they are thieves. There is humor and tragedy, and the sheer pleasure of seeing how Locke's various schemes play out. This book contains both a main story arc and numerous flashbacks, and I was surprised to find that I enjoyed both sections; normally when a book has split storylines, I'm always skipping to get back to the narrative that I find more interesting.The story deals with the ingenious Locke Lamora and his small band of followers who has been trained since childhood to rob the rich through elaborate confidence schemes. The first half of the book details Locke's childhood and latest plan, and is quite entertaining. About halfway through a strange figure arrives into the underworld of this city, and things in general start to go very sharply downhill. There is also some magic involved here, although I thought that was one of the weaker aspects of the book, as it was not very well explained.Although I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy and good writing, you should be aware that this book contains a significant amount of profanity. Although I personally didn't enjoy that aspect of the book, I understand the purpose it served, and it didn't detract significantly from the book. Overall, a great mix of exuberant fantasy and realistic elements."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"It's not every day that you get introduced to a new author's work and you get wowed.This is a book that _will_ wow you.It's technically a fantasy novel. It's not really fair - there is almost no \\"fantasy cliche\\" elements in it. What I mean to say is - there are no elves, wizards, typical storylines, etc. Hey, I like that stuff. But I also like it when an author can come up with something fresh. That's what you get here - a new author with a fresh take.The story is set in a medieval world. No surprises there. But it's NOT a carbon copy of other worlds previously done. Furthermore, the main character is not a prince; he's a criminal! Yes, the hero is a thief, part of a ring of lovable criminals. Well developed, they all speak with their own voice, have their own motivations. By the end of the novel, you know them so well you can anticipate what they'd think, how they'd react, what they'd do. This is a very well written book.The story is a good one - it's the beginning of a saga centered around Locke Lamora and Jean Tannen. Two friends and conspirators, up against the world. They are strong and intelligent, and ambitious. Their larger than life jobs catch the wrong kind of attention, though -- too successful for their own good, and now they're stuck between a rock and a hard place. How will they get out of it?The pace of this novel is so exciting that you might stay up all night to find out. I loved this book. Fortunately, I purchased it a while before getting to it -- so the next one was soon to come out. You have it even better - the second book IS out. Pick 'em both up!Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I'm a long time fantasy fan, and have been hearing about this book and this author for quite some time now on various internet discussion boards. I am really glad I finally made time to sit down and read it.I really enjoyed the setting - a faux Middle Ages Venice built atop the ruins of an alien civilisation.The book is about a precocious orphaned thief who is carefully trained to become a world class con man. Large parts of the book are in the form of flashbacks where we get to see that training take place.Lynch has courage in writing a book about people - professional thieves (for whom thieving is an actual religion) - that some readers might not be sympathetic with. He also has the courage to kill/injure important characters when his story calls for it.While I have a couple of small quibbles - one character is frequently referred to but never actually appears in the book despite her obvious importance to the other major characters - I thought that this book is a lot of fun in the way of a good heist movie or James Bond movie can be a lot of fun. Perhaps it lacks the depth some other major fantasy books/series have - but makes up for it in sheer enjoyment factor."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Locke Lamora is not your typical epic fantasy protagonist. He's not broad of chest. He does not wield astounding magical abilities. He's not good with a sword, or particularly heroic. In fact, he doesn't excel at most of what one might consider typical heroic activities. What he does excel at is the art of the con. He's a conman extraordinaire, and along with his gang of Gentleman Bastards, he robs from the rich, but before you go comparing him to Robin Hood, note that instead of giving the loot to the poor, he keeps it for himself. (Though if you do want to compare him to Robin Hood, it's fair to say that Locke does have his roguish charm.)Although Locke was naturally drawn to thieving as a youth, his thieving was too much even for Camorr's thiefmaker, so Locke is sold to Father Chains, the Eyeless Priest of Perelandro; the thiefmaker says it was either that, or slit the boys throat and throw him in the bay. Thankfully for Locke (and the reader), Chains takes the boy in, and teaches him to steal in a more productive way: by conning people. If that might seem an odd thing for a priest to do, consider first that Chains is not really eyeless at all. The Temple of Perelandro is really nothing more than a front for criminal activities. The god is real enough to Camorr's citizens, though he is a sort of outsider god--the thirteenth member of a pantheon of twelve--and he is the patron of thieves and beggars.The city of Camorr, which is said to have been built of \\"Elderglass\\" by a long forgotten race, is a vast, sprawling metropolis, riddled with canals and crime, quite reminiscent of ancient Venice, if ancient Venice were overrun by gangs and run by royalty, merchants, and criminals (actually, perhaps it's not so different). On the surface, Camorr appears to be ruled by a Duke, but in reality it is run by the crime boss, Capa Barsavi. But there's someone stalking the city--a man calling himself The Gray King--who thinks it's time for a regime change. Through a series of events, Locke finds himself matched against this man, who has been murdering Barsavi's garristas (or captains, if you're familiar with mob-parlance). And if Locke has any hope of coming out of his encounter with the Gray King alive, he's going to have make the most out of all his wits and cunning, for the Gray King is no easy mark.Above I mentioned how Locke Lamora is not your typical epic fantasy protagonist. Well, in many ways, the novel itself is not your typical epic fantasy. The entire story takes place within the city of Camorr, and the entire world is not threatened by some evil malefactor. Also, there is very little in the novel, aside from its secondary world setting, that is actually fantastic. In fact, the first third of the novel or so is almost entirely devoid of fantasy elements, leaving aside mention of gods (which the people believe in, but don't manifest themselves in any way) and the use of various medicinal tinctures. The first third is also almost entirely character-driven, and it isn't until then that the plot truly gets moving. Once the plot begins in earnest, fantasy elements enter the story--a wicked Bondsmage in the employ of the Gray King wields some magic--but even then, the fantasy elements mostly stay in the background. Which is not to say that any of this is a flaw, quite the contrary; the minimal use of fantasy elements allows Lynch to focus on making his world seem like a very real place, and allows him to make his characters remain at the forefront of the novel, rather than relegating them as subservient to showy pyrotechnics (though of those, there are some).The book starts with Locke as a young boy, still learning the ropes from Father Chains, and once Lynch shifts to Locke as an adult, he continues to weave in a series of interludes in which the reader gets to see more of Locke's past. And here's why the fact that the plot doesn't really get started until a third of the way through is not a flaw; I found most enjoyable the parts of the book detailing Locke's youth, and relished getting to each interlude to continue reading about him. Adult Locke is a lot of fun too, and he continues to be a compelling character, but there's something special about Locke's younger days. I can only hope that we continue to see more of these interludes in future installments in this series.But that's not the only element of the book that can be further explored. Lynch's worldbuilding is truly outstanding, and even though he paints quite a vivid picture, there remain enough subtle hints and mentions throughout the book that leave him room to explore the world more fully as the series continues. For instance, the fact that Camorr is said to have been built of \\"Elderglass\\" by a long forgotten race is interesting, but who they are or where they've gone is never really covered. It's touches like this that lends the world an air of mystique, and fills the reader with curiosity for what will come next.And speaking of future installments, it's worth pointing out that although The Lies of Locke Lamora is book one in a projected seven-book cycle, the novel stands alone remarkably well. There is a definite and complete story arc from first page to last. But here's where Lynch pulls off a extraordinary feat: although the book came to a satisfying conclusion, I found myself wanting to pick up book two immediately.Many of Lynch's influences are clear--the first and obvious debt Locke Lamora owes is to Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and Gray Mouser stories--but despite the fact that much of the style and tone of the novel is reminiscent of prior works, Lynch borrows (or perhaps pilfers would be a better term, considering the protagonist) with deft skill, taking inspirational bits from a variety of sources and melding them together into something that feels wholly original.The Lies of Locke Lamora is a vibrant, engaging epic fantasy of the highest order. And to hear that coming from me is really saying something, because of all of the subgenres I read in, epic fantasy is perhaps the hardest to sell me on. Move over Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind--here's a big fat fantasy that'll actually make you glad it's epic-length."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"What a wonderful book. Intelligent. Rich. Funny. Complex. And I couldn't put it down. This is the sort of rich fantasy George R. R. Martin writes. And yet Lynch's book is radically different; his world is smaller, simpler, more rooted in humanity. I picked this up on a whim. ($6.99??? Of course it's worth it!) I was moved by the critic's praise (including Martin's). And they were right on. Lynch IS A MAJOR NEW TALENT. I can't wait for the next book in what I hope will be a long, successful series."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Locke Lamora is a brilliant thief and a legend in his own lifetime as \\"The Thorn of Camorr\\". He, and the rest of his gang, The Gentlemen Bastards, steal only from the rich - but they aren't quite Robin Hood, and the underworld they move in is a brutal place to exist.This is a complex, multi-layered novel that charts the life of Locke and his friends until they embark on a sting that will, unexpectedly, change their lives forever. I very much enjoyed this novel and I am eagerly awaiting the next instalment in this projected seven book series. This novel means that the author will need to keep a high standard for the rest of the series if it is to be at least as good as this book.If you enjoyed this novel you may also enjoy \\"Mistborn: The final Empire\\" by Brandon Sanderson which is another underworld/thief fantasy novel that is very well written."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This is a very rare kind of book,most seem to follow a particularly formulaic genre- hero, villain , love interest. same-old, same -old. This one breaks the mold.All the characters are well developed. The book is witty , funny and tragic. I can't wait for the next one. I hope this guy doesn't pull a L.Hamilton on us down the road i.e write a couple of great books and then just deteriorate into sickening drivel.For the first time in years I actually re-read a book immediately after and still enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This is a great debut. I loved this book and can't wait to read more by this author. Hugo nom? Maybe... prolly will win the John Campbell award this year. It's a awesome and fully entertaining swashbuckling revenge thriller. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This has been one of the best books I've read in the last 6 months, rivaled by Name of the Wind. It took me about 6 months to read this book because the plot was painfully slow in the beginning.It does a good job creating the history and setting the stage for character development and for the plot to unfold, but when I hit a third of the book and still nothing has happened, I let it sit on the shelf for a few months. I'm not the most patient reader.However, once I got past that slow third of the book, the plot all of a sudden picked up. There were layers upon layers of intrigue, and just as I thought I'd figured out the evil scheme, something else didn't fit. It was for sure a roller coaster to the end. I can't wait to read the second book! I heard the second book's not as good, but I'll let you know when I read it."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Most fantasy isn't very good, and a very small portion of what is worth reading isn't worth purchasing, but Scott Lynch has really created a fantastic book in The Lies of Locke Lamora. A humorous tale of a band of rogues and the well-described city they inhabit, this novel starts off as self-satisfied as its hero and is easy to write off. Given time, however, it becomes apparent that Lynch isn't arrogant; he's merely confident, and the story gets better as it goes, all the way through the rousing climax. The characters in this book leap out of the page, and the recommendation from master author George R. R. Martin is well-placed. If you're tired of sorcerors and knights and kings and their kingdoms, give Locke Lamora a chance. It's like Perdido Street Station but without the deadly seriousness."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Another book I picked up while waiting for George RR Martin to finsh writing Dragons. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This is a very good book. I would suggest you purchase Red Skies at the same time because you are going to want more as soon as you finish book one. This is a very interesting world Lynch creates."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Scott Lynch has woven a spell-binding tale set in a detailed fantasy realm. Locke Lamora lives the adventures most only dream of, and does so in style. For lovers of fantasy stories like those of Raymond E. Feist's Midkemia or David Eddings, this is a book not to be missed. Lynch goes beyond the limits of a standard fantasy book and imbues his characters with vivid humanity. The story combines high adventure with fantasy and a compelling personal tale, switching from intense combat to elaborate schemes in moments. Be sure to add it to your collection."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This is my favorite book of the last several years and I probably read 20+/year (mostly fantasy). The book moves along very quickly with a caper like quality to it that was unlike any book I have every read. The plot was ingeniously put together even though at times it did stretch plausibility. While certain aspects of the book could have been better developed, such as magic and several of the characters, it did nothing to detract from the story and leaves a lot of room for development in further books. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have loaned it out to several friends who greatly enjoyed it as well. I look forward to more from Mr. Lynch."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I recently started this book at the beginning of the semester and can't put it down! It is a hell of a fun ride of a novel. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good fantasy novel. Great new author, can't wait to read what he has ahead for us."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"All told, I'd probably rate this book as a 3.5. Seeing as I can't, I suppose I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.A caveat-- many reviewers here are reacting to whether this book did or didn't live up to the \\"hype\\" it apparently enjoyed upon release. Seeing as I came across this book at random, and wasn't under the impression that this WAS \\"hyped,\\" I didn't have any expectations going in.I have to admit that the first third of the book was kind of rough going-- I wasn't really hooked into the characters or the world Lynch was building, and the flashbacks WERE much more interesting than the story set in the present. Once the plot started moving, though, it really hooked me. There's a lot going on here, including con games, double crosses, organized crime, secret police, deadly magic, villains you love to hate, heroes to (ultimately) root for, and a thankfully satisfying conclusion.Lots of people seem upset by the levels of profanity in the book, and while it took some getting used to, it didn't bother me in the least. Was it \\"necessary\\"? Is it ever? The book COULD have been written without it, but it works just fine as a stylistic choice.In the end, this book made me want to read the sequel. Can't ask for more than that."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book I easily rate 5 stars on the Amazon scale, but if it were possible, I would give Scott Lynch and this book a 10 on a scale of 1 to 5!!!I am very picky and hard to please as an avid reader of fantasy, sci-fi, fiction, children's books, fairytales and more, and having read hundreds upon hundreds of fantasy books over the years, while I may not be a book reviews person (but I used to review movies online), I believe I am an expert on the area of fantasy, and I would liken Scott Lynch and this piece of work to greats such as Robert Jordan and his have to read \\"Wheel of Time\\" series, Steven Erickson and his wonderful series with amazing characters \\"The Malazan Book of the Fallen\\", Rowling and \\"Harry Potter\\" (always fun), and even the great J.R.R. Tolkien and his amazing epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series and \\"The Hobbit\\" to!Scott Lynch is I would say, an expert who has reached and accomplished the 3 things that I think a book needs to be a success. For a story/book/series to be a success the 3 things it needs to captivate readers and make them want more are: 1. a story (you didn't see that one coming did you!;) and I mean a good story, as unfortunately there are many works that are just blah in the story and are not really entralling. 2. Character, Great Characters! and 3. A great ending. Scott Lynch has all 3 of these things, and more, with a creative and fun story that is fantastical and a bit cheeky and a lot of fun! He has created really wonderful characters that you really have fun reading about and enjoy! He also has some little quips and great pieces of humor in there to. And with the end, let's just say the end is great, full of action and the entire story along with the end, has many twists and turns and the end is pretty darn good by Scott Lynch with his wonderful story!I am just starting to read the sequel, \\"Red Seas Under Red Skies\\" and only a few pages in it already looks great and I am happily and very enthusiastically reading and will post a review of the sequel once finished, but for now anyone who loves a good, fun fantasy story and adventure, with great characters, lots of twists and turns and a great ending, check out \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" and you will not be disappointed!And to Scott Lynch, thank you so much for the wonderful book and please keep them coming, I look forward to more!!!James"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This book was far more than I ever expected! The Lies that Locke Lamora weaves throughout the entire story will leave you guessing until the very end. There are more plt twists and turns than I can even remember and I just fininshed the book. One of the most creative and engrossing writers I've read in my life.Very great new artist, whose book will keep your spell-bound and reading all night. At first the book may be a little slow and hard to understand. Just note that some of the chapters are about the young Locke and some are about the older Locke and that they alternate and feed into each other in a way that is very clever and very engaging.Recommend this to anyone (although the long page count does take a toll after a while). For it's length, the book did not ever really seem to drag. BUY this book! I went on the recommendation of a friend and I'm glad that I did! Can't wait to get my hands on the sequel!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This is the most entertaining fantasy I've read this year and probably the best from a writer new to me that I've read in years.Locke Lamora is a scam artist. An expert con-man. He and his band of _Gentleman Bastards_ prey on the rich in the city of Camorr (clearly styled after Venice). The stakes however soon grow higher and their plots spin out of control when they get tangled up in the schemes of the Grey King.Lynch has a great balance between character, plot and background. The fantasy world feels solid even though very little of it is really detailed and the background we do get springs naturally from the story and while the plot starts slowly it is put to good effect in establishing the closeness of the _family_ that the Gentleman Bastards have formed amongst themselves.Lynch is not sentimental with his characters. They suffer and some of them die. They're also not pure heroes in any way. The nobles, the merchants and the thieves are all guilty of something. The world he creates is dangerous. Magic is deadly as is alchemy in it's own way.I'd call this one a must read and I'm already hunting down the sequel."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I read that someone described this book as Ocean's 11 in a fantasy setting and I think that pretty well sums it up. A fun and interesting take on a fantasy novel; this book read more like a crime novel that was incidentally set in a fantasy world. I'll confess that I never really got into the world that much. It was quite complicated and the descriptions were kind of hard to follow, but that did not detract from the overall enjoyment of the tale.This story was about the characters and there is no more fitting description than Gentleman Bastard. Somewhere between a medieval rogue and a modern international conman/super thief, these characters were some of the more unique that I have read. These characters had the benefit of more education than just about anyone else in their world and yet decided to use it to steal rather than make a living. This story almost feels like the invention of the confidence job. The dialogue between these characters alone made the book worth reading. They truly were gentlemen and they truly were bastards.The writing in this book was just exquisite. It took me a while to figure out what was going on as I acclimated to the author's style, but once I did I was richly rewarded. Chapters and subchapters flowed through different time streams that would eventually converge upon a major plot point. So many twists and turns and a couple I did not see coming. While the dialogue was my favorite, there is still plenty of action, magic, backstabbing, and death (they are rogues after all). Even though this is book one of a series it is a completely self-contained tale with no real cliffhanger. I don't know if I plan to continue the series but this book is complete so I don't have to. This book is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I was so involved and so enthralled. This book just wrapped itself around me, I could not put it down. I was thinking about the characters and their situations when I was away from the book, excited for when I could pick it up again. I found myself reading it so fast, I had to slow myself down, because I did not want it to end. I see the author has one sequel out, with others planned, but a little slow on publication, so I just did not want the book to end. I can't decide whether to start the sequel or not, since it may be so long before the third book is out.I am not going to explain the plot, that is done in other reviews, but I will say if you like characters that grab you and won't let go, even the villains, this book is for you. If you like stories that make you laugh and make you cry, and keep you on the edge of your seat, this book is for you. If you like plots that surprise you and make you feel as if when you keep reading, something will change or turn, that keeps you wanting to read, this book is for you.The author is to me just a great story teller and isn't that why we read to begin with? For a good story? This book is the real deal. Loved it."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Why is this novel not being lauded more?! This book is fantastic and the story is entrancing. I read TONS of books and this one took me by surprise. There are rich and expansive characters, the city is a character unto itself and the staggered timeline makes for a great read. Anyone who is on the fence should just go for it and buy this book, buy this kindle or even download the audio version (which is well done by Michael Page)."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"\\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" is brilliant. The rich depth of the main character Locke, and his band of cohorts, the Gentlemen Bastards combines the best of Patrick Rothfuss and George R.R. Martin.You quickly find yourself immersed in Locke's never certain personality and clever games. Camorr,the city where the action takes place is a vividly imagined Venician metropolis, the perfect breeding ground for the Right People- thieves, cut-throats, and the like. Lynch builds the foundation of his city on a rich ancient history. The spacing of the novel is excellent; it's a perfect mix of the history of our cast, the city itself, the current adventures of the Gentleman Bastards.Something I really enjoyed about the novel was the obscenely low length of each chapter. It's constantly fresh and exciting, Lynch really outdid himself with the pacing of the story.Of course, nothing is perfect. I found myself bored at times, trying to skim past all the intricate details of the city's architecture. Nevertheless, the rest of the novel easily outweighs these small segments. I highly recommend it for anyone :)"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"With \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\", Scott Lynch has created a unique, genre-blending world that melds together elements of fantasy/crime/spy/picaresque in a wonderfully detailed re-setting of Renaissance Venice. Throughout my reading, I was thoughtfully and enjoyably immersed in the colorful descriptions of the streets and narrows, the intricacies of the organized crime underworld, and the gradual unveiling of Camorri culture. The hallmark of a good fantasy, to me, is that I lose sense of the words on the page and watch the story unfold in my minds eye; by that standard, \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" succeeded admirably.Unfortunately, I found the setting of this book a lot more compelling than what was going on within that setting. The plot of is fairly predictable and edges on unoriginal. The characters - even our protagonist, who is unveiled to us in past and present juxtaposed storylines - are 1-dimensional and underdeveloped. Lynch's prose, particularly the dialogue, moves briskly, which is more than I can say for some genuinely excellent fantasy series like Gene Wolfe's \\"Book of the New Sun\\"; but I still found his actual words to be unimaginative and cliche. If not for the novel setting, this book would feel like another forgettable Forgotten Realms book.This is Scott Lynch's freshman novel, and it is a commendable work. I am genuinely interested in the world he's created and his own development as a writer, so I've decided to invest myself in this series. Despite my misgivings on the plot and characters, I found this a light and enjoyable read, even at its 700+ pages. Lynch is in danger of becoming another RA Salvatore - somebody who gives us wonderful characters and setting, but doesn't employ them effectively. I sincerely hope he doesn't go that route; \\"Red Seas Under Red Skies\\" is due in the mail today, and I'm eager to find out."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"A beautifully written tale that kept me reading into the early morning on numerous occasions.

I am absolutely relieved that I did! It's a keeper. I am not going to reiterate the plot line as that has been done very well in previous reviews.What makes this story really work for me is that the main characters are completely human. They are warm and humorous, mean and faulty. I am so sick and tired of the deus ex machina resolutions to plot lines and you won't find them here. The characters are extremely well drawn through interesting flashbacks and they triumph and most importantly, they also fail. Spectacularly, I might add. This is no fairy tale ending novel!This book is also truly enjoyable for me because when things get down and dirty everyone actually bleeds. Usually by no quick, clean method. Incredible detail, but not drawn out. Lynch actually puts thought into the battles and the characters get hurt, badly, instead of taking out their opponents with a slice or two with little hurt to themselves, and you see every moment of it. This makes it much more realistic and exciting than the usual superhero fare. There is a consequence to everything and some people pay with their lives.To me this was not a story about a mind-bending, perfectly put together and executed con as I thought it would be when I read the synopsis, but what happens when that perfect con falls completely and utterly to pieces!Excellent first and I am off to buy the second immediately."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"In his debut \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora,\\" Scott Lynch tells an intriguing story that, more than anything, depends on his ability to sell the reader on the main characters' abilities in the art of the con. Before the meat of the plot ever reaches the reader, we are deep into a connected subplot that is, in itself, thoroughly enjoyable and absolutely critical to our belief in what happens later in the novel. Because this initial confidence game is so well detailed, Lynch hooks his readers by giving them an intimate knowledge of the characters and their skills. He does this in one way, in particular, that is worth mentioning. Lynch makes clever use of time in this novel, and doesn't write it as if it must pass, from beginning to end, in chronological order. His primary device are the interludes - chapters between the primary plot advancing chapters, that relate relevant bits of the primary characters' pasts - which help the reader to understand the motives and means of the characters. His secondary device, used mostly in the opening chapters of the novel, is in allowing a single chapter to be read in a non-linear fashion. This allows for a part of the plot to be carried forth prior to the explanation of what the characters are planning. It's a clever device, and one that makes these earlier chapters all the more intriguing. I also appreciate that Lynch avoids clich&eacute; characters. The character of Locke Lamora could have easily been everything we want in a roguish character: intelligent, charming, witty, and very deadly...in other words, James Bond as a thief. But, rather than making such a predictable character, Lynch creates characters with flaws. Lamora is a great thief, but not a perfect one. And this makes him more believable.Additionally, I enjoyed the scope of this novel. Having read this on the suggestion of noted fantasy author George R.R. Martin, it goes without saying (to his fans, at least) that I can appreciate a novel (or series) with an enormous scope. This, however, had a very limited scope - one coastal city - that allowed for a more detailed telling. The city itself becomes a character.This is not to say that the novel is perfect. Lynch has many sub-chapters (each chapter is divided into many interrelated parts) wherein characters outside of the primary group of cons and thieves are the primary focus. This, then, highlights the relative lack of detail given to these parts of the story. That is not to say that these parts are undetailed, but that there aren't enough of them to make them seem as relevant to the entire plot or to contribute much to the realization of the city Lynch has created. For example, and without spoiling the plot, more detail regarding the worries or consequences, perhaps even the political problems, surrounding being conned out of a fortune would have made the story a deeper one. While we have a good deal of detail about the city's wards, its celebrations, its clothing, and so forth, we have relatively little about its politics, great or small, and these would have made for a broader and more complete tale.A secondary criticism, and this is really just a pet peeve, is Lynch's use of profanity. My criticism is not about the general use of it. After all, the primary characters are thieves, not priests (a little joke for those who've read it, already). My criticism is that authors manage to create cultures, geographies, cities, nations, religions, and any number of other things, and yet characters resort to the exact same curse words I might utter after hitting my thumb with a hammer. At the beginning of a story, when we desperately want to believe in the world Lynch has created, and the story is doing all it can to aid that belief, a sudden \\"No s***\\" is like a cold smack from reality that briefly jars a reader (or at least this one) out of belief in the story. But this is a minor criticism and, as the novel progressed, I became used to it.Overall, I would strongly recommend this novel to readers of fantasy. It is quick paced, engaging, and altogether different from much of what's out there. A good read, for certain!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"Scott Lynch has created an amazing story. The world he describes is fully fleshed out and so very real; part fantasy, part alternate universe, he creates a fantasy world that is both alien and yet immediately accessible, filled with magic, old world technology, and current world pop-culture. The characters are each unique, flawed, courageous, humorous, and very, very real.I love fantasy-based stories, but grew tired of the typical quest style writings (as great as they are, this includes Tolkien's, Edding's, Donaldson's, Jordan's, and Martin's works). It was such a delight to read something that was both immediate, fantastical, and yet not bound by the traditions of typical fantasy styles.I cannot speak more highly of this book. It may not be the greatest fantasy novel ever written (as the aforementioned authors still rightly own those), but it is genre defining. I expect in the years to come we will see more authors throw off the restrictions of past fantasy-novel structures and innovate as Lynch has done with his book. It is funny, tragic, exciting, interesting, and exciting (did I say that already?). What an amazing book (and I just got done reading the prologue for his second book,Red Seas Under Red Skies, and saw that he continues to impress).Let me just finish by saying: this book demands to be read. And to Scott Lynch: thank you for writing the best book I've read in years, and for renewing my love for books that truly transported me to a different place."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I received this book as a gift last Christmas from some friends. The writer, Scott Lynch, is their cousin and had given them a number of signed books to distribute as they saw fit. Historically speaking my experience with books that have been gifted to me by friends or family (excluding my direct family of course) have not been all that great. So I put off reading this book for quite some while.Once I did start reading the book I was pleasantly surprised. This is a good book! The writing is tight, the descriptions are crisp and really take you to the scene. It is a clever book overall and I really enjoyed it.The book details, as the title suggests, the Lies of the main character Locke Lamora. Locke ends up an orphan after a plague kills his parents. He ends up being sold to an old priest known as Chains. Chains isn't exactly a priest though; he is more of a con artist. Chains teaches his initiates the finer aspects of conning people. The book jumps between the training the Gentlemen Bastards (Chains' gang) go through and Locke's latest scheme to usurp large amounts of money from the nobility of the city.This book is fun and clever. Initially I found the chapters alternating between present and past to be a bit irritating. It felt like as soon as you got back involved with the main story you were switching back to the past story and visa versa. Then I realized that the interludes to the past were usually revealing something about the characters that was vital to the next part of the current story. Then these interludes became pretty clever.The book is non-stop action and is a fun read. It is not a quick read; there is a lot of description in these books and a lot going on. You definitely have to keep your wits about you when you read this book. I am definitely interested to see what the next book in the series, Red Skies under Red Seas, brings."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"The Lies Of Locke Lamora began creating a buzz several months ago and first time author Scott Lynch sends it out of the ballpark.Stellar on many levels; characters,plot,action,and humor (I laughed out loud in a couple of places)This is ADULT fantasy not for kids.People die and when they get hurt they're in a world of pain.I for one,don't read fantasy as a rule.The only fantasy writer I make an exception for is George R.R. Martin and in a way Scott Lynch reminds me of him,so now I've added him to my list.I'm most definitely on board for Book 2 in this series!"},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I want to give this book better than four stars, but there are a couple of HUGE implausibilities that prevent me from doing so. Notwithstanding this, I still wholeheartedly recommend LOCKE LAMORA.This is the kind of fantasy I like. There is no quest, no arch-evil. It's gritty, largely realistic and fast-paced.As with most fantasy novels, LOCKE LAMORA is set in a medieval-type setting. The story focuses on the exploits of Locke Lamora and his crew of thieves. But these are no mere pick-pockets. No, these are skilled con-men that play a high stakes game. What a fresh perspective in the fantasy genre!This novel seemed to swing back and forth between sweet and sour. Parts of the story were brutal and dark; other parts were lighthearted and sweet. These swings in tone didn't detract from the book. What did detract from the book was the author's use of magic. Its use is sparse, but not well thought out. Any reader that dwells too much on its use may find that it ruins the story.I'm willing to give it a pass since the rest of the book was so imaginative and fun. LOCKE LAMORA is a great start for Scott Lynch. It's well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"This is caper fiction at its finest, with something for just about everybody: Lies. Con games. Fantasy. Mystery. Sword fights. Impossible odds. Unbreakable friendships with all-too-breakable hearts. Honor. Betrayal. Revenge.The cons dreamed up by the title character are as notable for their ingenuity as for how often they go horribly wrong. But in the end this is more than the story of a con artist, it's a story of brotherhood and honor among thieves. The author's world-building is vivid and lush, and his characters have you rooting for them despite their somewhat lax morals. Granted, they sometimes feel like they were sent over from Central Casting--\\"Hey, gimme a Fagin, an Artful Dodger and a couple of Musketeers!\\"--but they're no less lovable for it.If I have one complaint, it's that female characters are given short shrift in this novel. A love interest for Locke is hinted at but never seen, and all of Locke's partners in crime are men--this despite how handy it would be for a gang of thieves and con men to have a woman to play certain roles in their deceptions. But that's a small quibble, and given the aforementioned hints, I am confident Locke will meet his feminine match in a sequel."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"\\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" arrived last year with all the usual hype. But it also arrived with much more than the usual merit. This book is the book we've all been waiting for. It's the one that cooks up a brand new fantasy world starkly different from anything seen before, and stews it together with outstanding plot, characters, and writing. The next great fantasy author is here in the form of Scott Lynch, and with luck he'll be with us for years to come.\\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" is about crime. The title character is a con artist who leads a small band of crooks through stealthy schemes to rob the rich nobility. Their tactics are amazingly clever, well worthy of what appears to be a high fantasy \\"Ocean's Eleven\\", complete with disguises and even glittering skyscrapers.That, however, is merely the beginning. Half way through, \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" turns in wholly unexpected directions. Abandoning its caper tale roots, it becomes a serious drama in which the main characters confront pride, arrogance, and their own mortality. The closing stretch of the novel is one of the best ever, mixing astounding action sequences with equally amazing character-based drama. It's certain that Lynch outpaces almost any living fantasy author in this category. It's equally certain that many authors of supposedly 'real' literature should read \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" to see how a master does it.I don't have space to adequately praise Lynch's skills with prose. He excels in every category, from dialogue to action to humor. I can point out that certain tactics which seem stale and pointless in other fantasy novels spring to life here. Lynch employs non-linear storytelling, flashing back from the main story to episodes in the characters' childhoods. The flashbacks are not only witty and charming, but they blend seemlessly into the story. Likewise with the map of the city at the beginning. Maps may often be seen as a staple of weak fantasy, but Lynch's vivid descriptions bring every part of the city to life. No word is wasted, nor is any place within the fictional setting. His understand of space and of how it affects everything within the tale is fantastic.My praises could go on, and doubtlessly they will once I read the sequel. For now, I want to mention one last thing. Lynch begins each section of the book with a quote from a great poet or some other worthy source. This is another trick that looks smug and pompous in other books, but works magnificently here. In particular, the quote chosen for the final section is a masterpiece all by itself. But enough about that. Buy \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" and get to work."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"I have, over the course of the past two years, encountered some very wonderful and awesome fantasy novels and series. However, many of them share the same archetypical plot: Boy is special, finds \\"good\\" object, old man mentor, etc. etc. This novel is different.The Lies of Locke Lamorais a wonderful addition to the fantasy genre, and I am here to tell you about it.In the island city of Camorr, of 16th century Venicean style, there are various gangs, theives and criminal organizations. Under the Capa Barsavi, these gangs and whatnot have prospered, under something called the Secret Peace which allies royalty with the criminals. In one of the Capa's groupings, an orphanage-esque place where orphans are taught the art of thief and cutthroat, a five year old boy arrives, new to Camorr altogether. Its leader, called the Thiefmaker, has trouble with the boy, and after a year, sells him to the Eyeless Priest of the Order of Perelandro and the Gentlemen Bandits. He is raised there.After twenty-two or so years, the Eyeless Priest dies, and the child, Locke, is the new garrista. Not a child anymore, he and his fellow members, Calo, Galdo, Jean and Bug go wreak havoc upon a new royal family (the Salvaras) by conning them of four hundred thousand crowns (currency). When everything is going right, he is hired by a mysterious Grey King, and everything goes wrong.My favorite part of this book was the gritty, unarchetypical characters, especially Calo and Galdo. They had a hardiness to them that I have never seen in any book before. The setting was interesting, as it wasn't the classic 12th century medieval place based on Britain and Ireland, it was a new, different place, one I hadn't visited, one not on the map. The book is filled with alchemy, with no or little magic, just things that actually are plausible. Also, the climax is thrilling. You'll be up really late, I can tell you that much!On last thought, the book is part Robin Hood, part Tom Clancy, part Age of Empires, part Thief Lord and part George RR Martin.MSLPS: Not for faint hearted or those who cannot handle language."},{"Title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","review":"What can be said about The Lies of Locke Lamora which has not already been said? In many ways, this is THE fantasy novel of 2006 and certainly THE debut of that year. All respects given to Naomi Novik and His Majesty's Dragon (the other major debut), but THIS is the one ring to rule them all. Yes, The Lies of Locke Lamora is just that damn good.Unlike many novels, fantasy in particular, we are being asked to root for a criminal. Locke Lamora is a thief in the city of Camorr. He is a young, clever, talented, and extremely audacious thief. In short, if you or I wished to be a thief, we would dream of being Locke Lamora. Most fantasy novels which feature thieves will tend to feature a wisecracking sidekick of a thief. I'm looking at you, Jimmy the Hand, entertaining as you were. Or, you, Silk. You know who you are.This brings an entirely fresh perspective to the storytelling. Scott Lynch bucks another fantasy convention and to great results. More often than not an epic multi-volume fantasy will begin with several hundred pages of introduction to the protagonist as a boy and before the big adventure begins. Scott Lynch does not do this with The Lies of Locke Lamora. Lynch gives us a bit of an alternating pattern. We do get the childhood forming of a thief which we would expect where Locke is being trained by a thief / priest named Chains. But, in semi-alternating sections we are given Locke as a young man running a con on one of the rich nobles of Camorr, Don Salvara. Through this con we see Locke and his group of Gentleman Bastards and how Locke has grown into an amazing thief leading something of a double life. We also get hints of something bigger going down in Camorr with mentions of a Gray King. This is important.The Lies of Locke Lamora is a wickedly entertaining novel, let alone a debut. This is a fast paced, action packed, clever, funny, dangerous, sad, beautiful piece of fiction and a novel which I did not want to put down. Not for sleep, not for food, not to go to work to pay the bills, not to bathe. Reluctantly I put the book down for each, but when I wasn't reading The Lies of Locke Lamora, I was thinking about The Lies of Locke Lamora. This is outstanding fantasy in the greatest sense of the term. It is the work of a wicked imagination and one thing that Scott Lynch has apparently figured out which other authors have not is how to end a novel. As great as everything was throughout the novel, Lynch has a nearly flawless ending to the novel.I would normally groan a bit at the thought of another seven volume fantasy series, but Lynch wrote such a strong opening that I am relieved he is writing more novels about Locke Lamora. Red Seas Under Red Skies is officially my most anticipated novel of 2007, and yes, this includes A Dance With Dragons even should George Martin finish the novel in time to publish this year, which thus far he has not. That is how excited I am about The Lies of Locke Lamora and the future work of Scott Lynch.Any questions?-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Spiritual Clarity","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and would definitly recommend this book.

The first section is a biographary on Joe Lewis, considered by many in the martial arts world as the gretest karate fighter of all time; hence the title of the book. This section is at times, written in the first and third person, so the reader gets an idea as to what goes inside the mind of Lewis. This part is frank and sincere and many things said may not be well like by traditionalist.Lewis speaks about his training in Okinawa, the states and with Bruce Lee. He talks about pioneering full-contact karate (aka kickboxing)and point karate. The next section, American Karate Fighting is the bulk of the book.It also is a let down. The quality of the photos is average. The book works, but for someone who has studied the martial arts for over 20 years, nothing new is really mentioned. The traditional fighter may see something new, but, I doubt many traditionalists, who are not into contemporary fighting ideas, will probably not be interested in this book anyway.The book is average at best (Probably could rate it lower but think that to get a little inside the mind of Lewis is worth the average rating)and for a skilled writer like Dr. Beasely (The Way of No Way), I expected a lot more."},{"Title":"Greatest Karate Fighter Of All Time: Joe Lewis And His American Karate Systems","review":"Joe Lewis and Dr. Jerry Beasley provide insight to Joe's American Karate System, starting with Joe's youth to his USMC days to his training with Bruce Lee and finally on to Joe's own personal system.

I have known Joe Lewis personally for many years and have attended his Black Belt Conferences; I have observed him up close on many occasion and I still find this book is well worth the cost.

Joe had a room there. He liked be close to the gym and his training partners. I went down to train with the karate legend often in the eighties. Usually we would spar for an hour or so, clean up, go out to eat and then return to his room to record an interview. I had rolls of photos and hours of tape so I decided to type up the interviews and organize the chapters for a book. I kept the better photos for magazine articles that appeared in many of the martial arts magazines in the eighties and nineties. I think we may have had 20-30 Joe Lewis articles published over the years.As Joe was talking about his early life I could tell there were good feelings and bad. I focused only on what I thought would be favorable for his public image. Joe has a sense of humor that I tried to convey. He was very proud of the book and sent copies to his friends.The title was a given. In 1983 Karate Illustrated magazine had queried 22+ former karate champs and asked each to list their top ten. Joe's name appeared on every list. Chuck Norris' name was on every list except one or two. About two years later Black Belt ran the same article but deleted the two that did not include Norris. So technically Norris and Lewis tied in the Black Belt rewrite. I felt like I should put Joe as the lead author since I basically edited the interviews I had recorded into a book. I think Joe wrote the last chapter on American Karate. I also signed over all royalties to the champ. It was a fun, quick and easy book to write. I considered it to be a publicity piece but everyone seemed to enjoy it. I think it's worth reading. It is out of print so if you can find a copy better get it."},{"Title":"Greatest Karate Fighter Of All Time: Joe Lewis And His American Karate Systems","review":"As someone who has been around the martial arts scene for quite some time, I still have old Black Belt issues from the 1960s when a young Joe Lewis just out of the Marines began competing in Karate. I recall he made black belt in six months when he was stationed in Okinawa. This book presents a closer look at Joe Lewis but it did lack depth. I know he was initially into wrestling but there was little information on that part of his life. I have always admired him for entering the full contact kickboxing field and becoming a champion in that full contact sport. Since I began my karate training with Shotokan, and we never entered outside tournaments I never had an opportunity to see him in action in those early years of karate.In any case, this is a book that will be of interest to anyone who desires to know something about the historical karate legend Joe Lewis.Rating: 4 Stars.

In my volunteer bike building/repair workshop, it has been an invaluable reference for us - the pages got many grease marks on them. The particular advantage of this book is that it might be the ONLY manual out there that still covers mechanisms particular to bikes of the 60's-70's vintage, namely the coaster brakes and multi-speed hubs of the old cruisers. We would study the diagrams in great detail.However, I had a lot of trouble actually understanding the language of this book. it just comes across as esoteric, technical, and just VERY difficult to comprehend. I just looked at this book for the pictures. But maybe that's the tradeoff of having an extremely detailed book."},{"Title":"Glenn's Complete Bicycle Manual: Selection, Maintenance, Repair","review":"I need instructions to operate a wheelbarrow, but this book made it easy to overhaul a Schwinn 1963 Traveler.

However, many bikes today are made the same way and this book is an invaluable reference.After checking out book after book in the local library and finding that most covered today's bikes and purchasing Park Tool's book since the library did not have this book in the catalogue, I began searching the internet and found several references to Glenn's.Comparing the Park Tools book with its wonderful color pictures, I found it a bit skimpy compared in the explanation area to Glenn's detail. Also the Park book did not cover topics related to the bikes of yesterday that have simple components and did not cover how to disassemble a coaster brake or the front hubs on old style Schwinn type cruisers or even ball bearing bottom bracket servicing, as it only covers the modern bikes.However, coaster brake and simple cruiser bikes have made a come back and most currently published books on the market do not cover servicing of simple coaster brakes or even a bearing bottom bracket as opposed to the modern cartridge bottom bracket.Glenn's is not only an excellent reference for yesterday's bikes that are still around waiting for some TLC, it applies to today's simple bikes as well.After paying the local shop $30 to overhaul my son's bendix brake and front hub on our recently acquired vintage Stingray, before I acquired a copy of Glenn's, I found out it was something so simple I could have done myself with reference to Glenn's. Now that I have a copy of Glenn's I will attempt the service myself on my 1995 Schwinn coaster brake cruiser.While there are multiple publication dates for Glenn's, I purchased a later 1986 edition and do not know if this edition differs from the 1970s editions."},{"Title":"Glenn's Complete Bicycle Manual: Selection, Maintenance, Repair","review":"Much better and informative than most of the other manuals I have purchased.

He is not for everybody. He is for those who are interested in the mind, in desire, in language. Specifically, for those who have developed an interest in &quot;theory&quot; or &quot;post-structuralism&quot;, which he helped to develop. In this volume Lacan sets out some key concepts in his thinking - but he does not do so systematically! Do not expect him to explain everything to you in a clear, linear fashion. Rather, he plays on words and on ideas, he maneuvers and evades, he skirts around the issue, and comes back to it. Have patience if you choose to read him - discuss his writings with others. If you do this, you may come to understand why Lacan is regarded with so much respect in France and has virtualy reared an entire generation of first-rate theorists and thinkers.It will help (but will not guarantee understanding) if you have some background in Freud, even if it is only a slight one. Good luck!"},{"Title":"The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis (The Seminar of Jacques Lacan , Book 11)","review":"First, let me start off by saying that I am an intellectual historian with a great passion for the history of ideas, especially those dealing with the mind and how it works-- psychoanalytic thought in particular. I'm well used to reading works that are dense, difficult, and jargon-laden. I'm also quite familiar with intellectual traditions that Lacan is responding to, borrowing from, and those that he himself has inspired (most notably the tradition of French psychoanalytical feminism a la Irigaray, Cixous, Kristeva, etc). I say all this not to pat myself on the back, but to provide some context for this review: I am *not* someone who hates books just because they're difficult, or because they're about such rarefied subjects.However, I cannot in good intellectual faith recommend this book to anyone. Partly, I freely admit, this is because I really don't think Lacan has really all that much to say. While I don't deny the fact that he *was* instrumental in putting a structuralist (and then post-structuralist) turn in psychoanalysis in some of his early essays (such as appear in &quot;Ecrits&quot;) as well as pioneering contraversial new techniques of therapy, such as the variable-length session). But since those early daysthen, his reputation was due more to his charismatic personality and his influential friends within the French academic world, rather than because he had all that much to say.This book is a perfect example of that. Taken from one of his mid-period seminars (essentially series of lecture courses), Lacan babbles, obfuscates, metaphorizes,and jokes his way through a set of vaguely philosophical points about the mind that could probably have been adequately summarized in a single lecture, or maybe 20-30 pages. (Note to readers of Freud, Jung, Adler, etc. Please be aware that, unlike those guys, Lacan makes no references whatsoever to practical therapeutic experiences to back up his claims; this is pure theoretical speculation. Also, don't expect Lacan's use of terms like 'drive', 'unconscious' or 'transference' to have anything in common with the more conventional psychoanalytical meanings of those terms.) His use of metaphors has a haphazard quality to it that, at times, borders on the nonsensical-- particularly when he starts borrowing them from fields that he clearly doesn't understand very well himself, such as topology. That said, it's undeniable that Lacan's audience was enamoured of his performance. The questions and answers that are included here show a rapt and almost fawning reverence for the man they affectionately refer to as &quot;The Master&quot;. But what does a reader, not able to bask in the warm glow of Lacan's personal charisma, get out of this? Not much.... a tiny handful of rehashed ideas, and a few witty phrases here and there, but mostly one gets a lot of dense, pointless verbiage from a man who seems like he's trying to hide the fact that he's got nothing new to say .If you're going to read Lacan, read some of the real stuff-- when he was actually putting forth new (and at the time, revolutionary) ideas like his essays on &quot;The Mirror Stage&quot;, &quot;The Form and Function of the Letter&quot;, and &quot;Agressivity in Psychoanalysis&quot;-- or, if you must, some of the early seminars. But by this point, Lacan had long since ceased to be someone worth paying attention to-- and this book simply isn't worth the trouble it takes to get through it. (There are a lot of difficult works that *are* worth the trouble-- Hegel's &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;, Marx's &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, Heidegger's &quot;Being and Time&quot;, and even a lot of works by the other post-structuralists with whom Lacan is often associated-- but believe me, this just isn't one of them)."},{"Title":"The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis (The Seminar of Jacques Lacan , Book 11)","review":"Lacan is not easy to follow, by intent, yet the elegance of his thought processes bring real depth to psychoanalysis and the limitations of language in expressing our evolutionary struggles to identify the conflict between our internal processes and the world outside.

You'll be better off. Let me explain:In Kevin Smith's film, \\"Dogma\\", when God (Alanis Morrissette) speaks, all those in the know, angles and such, cover their ears. They do this for good reason. In full harmonics, God's voice is just a horrendous blast of noise that can't be understood. It hurts the ears to listen and therefore it's not worth listening to. The same might be said about Lacan.In the 1950s and 60s, Lacan conducted a series of lectures, in French, to explain his psychoanalytical theories. \\"The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis\\" is a transcription of a series of lectures from 1964. In essence, it's Lacan speaking. If I were able to read and understand the original French text, perhaps I would have a better impression of the work, but I highly doubt it.Like God in the film \\"Dogma\\", when Lacan speaks it too is a horrendous blast of noise that's not worth listening to, or in this case, reading. My intuition tells me that Lacan's ego (yes, in the Freudian sense) would appreciate being compared to God--his \\"objet petit a\\", so to speak.As God, or Lacan, you're not required to explain yourself to anyone and even when you try, it's only heard as noise anyway. Many scholars study the word of God and search for meaning in their interpretations--so too with Lacan. Butler, Copjec, Feldstein, Fink, Zezek and perhaps a dozen or so others have all tried. While many have tried, in my opinion, all have failed. And I like to believe that the both Lacan and God would agree with me. Because, really, how could any beings with such depth be ever completely understood with language? It's too base a medium to even attempt it.Since we are equating Lacan and God, I suggest that the Old Testament makes for the best comparison--a place where the power-over subjects is the preferred MO rather than offering the power-to. After all, isn't this the place where God's \\"jouissance\\" is at it's best?Turn the gaze toward the mirror and remove the mask. Who's behind it? Is it Lacan as Freud or Freud as Lacan? Is it God as Lucifer or Lucifer as God? Or are they always one in the same depending where in the picture, I, as subject, am placed?At this point all I have left to say is: good riddance to psychoanalytic blather such as Freud's id, ego and superego and to Lacan's Imaginary, Real, the symbolic order and the big Other. Just as the notion of a flat earth or the application of leaches as a cure-all came to be just crazy talk, so too will the theories of psychoanalysis. They enable and maintain power-over for some rather than providing the power-to for all. Such methods no longer serve humanity's higher potential and it's time to move on.Hooray for neuroscience!"},{"Title":"How the whale became and other stories","review":"For my child who loves stories, I like to give nice books that are both picture books and that have long-ish stories to read out loud.

I have always been attracted to it, simply because of the title. I love all things Egyptian. Granted this deck was copyrighted in 1978. It belongs in the serious collectors library. I wanted to believe this was the deck was copies of the original papyrus discovered in some forgotten temple of Egypt. It is not. This theory has been disproved since the discovery of the Rosetta Stone. Yet, Papus and others keep this train of thought alive. Indeed, the romantic view still favors an Egyptian connection. After much study and research on my behalf, I cannot accept the evidence that these images came from Egypt. This pack is part of the reason.Lets begin to look at the images. The major arcana is stiffly drawn with similar poses found in the classic Marseilles deck. The titles are all renamed and embellished with mysterious names that could never be translated to the Egyptian. Honestly, Saint Germain was a contemporary of \\"Etteilla\\" who was basically a fool. These earlier \\"Occultist\\" did one thing-they brought many elements of the \\"Western Tradition\\" to the tarot. The Hebrew alphabet, astrology, and other cross-cultural elements that that may be seen as coincidence.This pack presents theory and not hard evidence that a series of papyrus was recovered from the Library of Alexandria. Indeed, the ancient Egyptians daily life included divination in one form or another. Something similar to Tarot cards may have been used. This deck is one of the best models you may find of this \\"tarot\\". Egypt has yet to give up all of its secrets. It may never. We cannot speculate, however..."},{"Title":"Egyptian Tarot Deck","review":"This is the only Tarot deck I use. There are a few reasons why this is the best Tarot deck. First, it's a traditional tarot deck, in that is has the required 78 cards. You'd think that would be a must for any Tarot deck but surprisingly, many Tarot decks don't even have that going for them. Second, it's non-interpretive, insofar as the minor arcana cards have only a picture of two swords or two pentacles (I prefer this deck's pentacles to pentagrams and coins) and NOT a picture of someone doing something with two swords or pentacles. Third, the drawings are in black and white line, which I believe conveys the proper aura of mystery that Tarot cards should have. Finally, the little booklet that comes with it is well written and useful. I've been doing Tarot card readings in public for years using only this deck and have never had any complaints."},{"Title":"Egyptian Tarot Deck","review":"These cards really are not all that great. Here are my notations: 1. Many of the Major Cards have their names changed from one of the standard two that are common place in real tarot decks; 2. These cards are pretty small for being Tarot (like skinny playing cards); 3. You can't relate to most of these cards because the Minor arcana is just the stuff drawn out and not being applied; Pretty meaningless for an Expert and hella confusing for a Beginner! 4. The instruction booklet is TERRIBLE, and I mean complete BS! Almost every single card description is not just off, but completely random most of the time! Its like the author knows NOTHING about Tarot! These will be fine cards for Tarot CARD GAMES, but NOT for Divination!I bought this cards online along with another deck at a much more expensive site, and am pretty disappointed overall. What attracted me to this deck was the very crude, but simple drawings along with Roman numerals being used on every card instead of just with the Major Arcana. I thought perhaps they would help me in a different way, but I agree with another reviewer that these cards do have a slightly negative vibe to them, and its not coming from the person in question! The instruction booklet is VERY negative, WRONG, and just useless...I am thinking about burning it because its so small that I can't even write in the real meanings."},{"Title":"Egyptian Tarot Deck","review":"TOP QUALITY TAROT DECK, THUS FAR !

Its quite a little collection:The Man Who Returned * Edmond HamiltonSpider Mansion * Fritz LeiberA Question of Etiquette * Robert BlochThe Sea Witch * Nictzin DyalhisThe Strange High House in the Mist * H. P. LovecraftThe Drifting Snow * August DerlethThe Body-Masters * Frank Belknap LongPigeons from Hell * Robert E. HowardIf you have read any horror, or even genre fiction broadly, you should know all of those names. What's more, these are not exactly the least of their works: Stephen King was impressed by Pigeons from Hell as a true American horror story, and it is pretty good, and really creepy in a Southern Gothic way. Dyalhis' Sea Witch was excellent and moody, Hamilton's piece a nice little non-supernatural horror story, and if you don't like spiders, don't read Leiber's contribution. There is also a short introduction looking back on Weird Tales as a magazine, which is interesting if not groundbreaking (today, nearly 50 years after it was written).This is a great way to get to read these works in print for not a lot of money, assuming you can find it secondhand."},{"Title":"Weird Tales (Eight Stories of Demonic Horror)","review":"Pyramid Books published three paperback anthologies of stories from _Weird Tales_ in the early 1960s: _The Unexpected_ (1961), _Weird Tales_ (1964), and _Worlds of Weird_ (1965). All three credit Leo Margulies as the editor. But according to _The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction_ (1995), Sam Moskowitz ghost edited the last two. This seems likely. The first book consists of more modern-- and generally better-- stories. The latter two books are more old fashioned and uneven in quality. But perhaps they come a bit closer to giving the reader the flavor of the magazine during its golden years._Weird Tales_ (1964) consists of eight stories published between 1931 and 1942. The stories are: Edmond Hamilton's \\"The Man Who Returned,\\" Fritz Leiber's \\"Spider Mansion,\\" Robert Bloch's \\"A Question of Etiquette,\\" Nictzin Dyalhis's \\"The Sea Witch,\\" H.P. Lovecraft's \\"The Strange High House in the Mist,\\" August W. Derleth's \\"The Drifting Snow,\\" Frank Belknap Long's \\"The Body Masters,\\" and Robert E. Howard's \\"Pigeons From Hell\\". Only the Leiber and the Bloch were not purchased by Farnsworth Wright, the greatest editor of _Weird Tales_.Let us dispense with several stories straightaway. The Howard is absolutely awful-- from its ridiculous title to its silly plot to its purple prose to its blatant racism. The Derleth is less offensive, but it is little more than a stock variation of a vampire story. The Long is a heavy-handed science fiction satire of the sort that became obsolete after the thirties. The Bloch is mildly amusing but trite and fairly predictable. The other four stories, however, deserve a bit more attention.Nictzin Dyalhis was a chemist and short story writer who sold a small handful of stories to _Weird Tales_ over the years. I believe that he has been somewhat overrated as an author, but \\"The Sea Witch\\" is still a good story-- a pleasant romance with well-rounded characters.I am not a keen admirer of H.P. Lovecraft, especially his dream stories. But \\"The Strange High House in the Mist\\" is one of his better yarns; and the sights that you will see through the leaded bulls-eye windows will stay with you, even if they slip away from the mind of the hero. It is a sort of companion piece to \\"The Terrible Old Man\\".The plot of the Hamilton story is outlandish and unbelieveable if you stop to think about it. But it is still a nicely done character study. It begins where a lot of Edgar Alan Poe stories end. A man returns from the grave. But he then discovers that his life was not what he thought it to be.\\"Spider Mansion,\\" like \\"Pigeons From Hell,\\" is an Old Dark House story. Most ODH tales are patently ridiculous, and so it is here. But this dish is served up with panache and style and a poker face. Leiber actually gets away with his nonsense. This is the most entertaining story in the anthology.How much you will enjoy this book will depend on how much affection you have for what was billed as \\"the unique magazine\\". If you have a weakness for ghosties and ghoulies and things that go bump in the night, for cemeteries and haunted houses, for slavering batrachian monsters in shuttered rooms, and for eldrich horrors waiting in jungle temples for luckless travelers... Well then, you may find that this book will provide you with a pleasant hour or two."},{"Title":"2500 Anecdotes for All Occasions","review":"The product was as advertised and arrived as scheduled.

In this line, and pursuant to this work, i) although the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were a period of profound change for the noble elite of most European countries, the process of formation put new resources at their disposal, successfully employed by them for their own ends; ii) it is truth that the authority and status of noblemen was defined less in terms of autonomous power and more in terms of privileges granted by the state, and that the emphasis on physical and military prowess was toned down, and social pre-eminence was based on cultural superiority; however iii) there were decisive elements of continuity: noblemen continued to define their position in society by reference to a specific code of honour intended to set them apart from the rest of society.And throughout the period examined, the fisco-militaries exigencies of the age brought monarchy and nobility into close interdependence: the exploitation of the population to the mutual profit of rulers and ruling classes underlay much of the co-operation between them (as shown by Hillay Zmora's \\"Monarchy, Aristocracy, and the State in Europe, 1300-1800\\").The book is no very engaging, but it is not dry either. It can be savoured by the professional historian, and perhaps, by the educated layperson too.Therefore, my rate is 5 (content) and 2/3 (pleasure of reading).In addition to Hillay Zmora's work, other books that I would recommend to read would be \\"Myths of Power. Norbert Elias and the Early Modern European Court \\" and \\"Vienna and Versailles : The Courts of Europe's Dynastic Rivals, 1550-1780 (New Studies in European History)\\" by Jeroen Duindam (whose books present a more accurate view of monarchy, nobility, the court and the state contrary to that provided by Elias's \\"The Court Society\\"); \\"State and Status: The \\"Rise of State and Aristocratic Power in Western Europe\\", by S. Clark; and \\"The Persistence of the Ancient Regime\\" by Arno J. Mayer (covering approximately the 1815-1914 period)."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"Carson McCullers is a great writer.

Her theme may always be the same, but the depth and sheer inventiveness of her stories never ceases to make her so readable and painfully true. 120 odd pages of magic-a great introduction to McCullers if you've not read her before."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"I was able to read this book in about two hours. The short read time is my only complaint about this extremely interesting and mind stimulating story.It deals with very interesting and complex characters. We have the two military couples, both of which have very bad marriages. The first because the husband (the Major) just shuts out his sickly wife. The second because the husband (the Captain) is an intellectual who seems to have married a fairly simple-minded woman whose only interests lie in material things and the carnal spirit. The four of them are drawn together in a weird relationship where the Major is having an affair with the Captain's wife. Both the Captain and the Major's wife know about the affair but seem to enjoy the get-togethers for Bridge and parties that the couples constantly happen together.Meanwhile, the Captain's wife is being watched by a very strange enlisted man, who the Captain both hates and seems to be attracted to at the same time. The enlisted man spends nights watching the Captain's house to get a glimpse of the Captain's wife. Eventually, he starts to regularly enter the house to watch over the sleeping form of the Captain's wife.The Major's wife seems to be worshipped by her Phillipino servant. Her additional confidante is an army lieutenant who she knits sweaters for.A great deal seems to be hinted at (ex. The sexuality of the Captain), but never fully explained, probably because most of the subject matter was considered very risque when the book was written. I really wish this book could be written in an expanded form. All the characters seemed very complex and the life and psyche of each could be greatly explored in a much larger book.I also think there is a lot of fodder to foster some really good University discussions on each of the characters. I wish we had explored this book when I was in college."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"The main character in this story is Private Ellgae Williams. It is set in an Army Post. Private Ellgae Williams is a shy but determined young man. He is very dedicated to the army and his assigned work. Even when not on duty the private likes to hang around the post. The antagonists in this story are Captain Penderton and his wife. Captain Penderton is a very hostile man. He comes off as a strong man, but in reality he is very weak. He is a coward in many ways, he never stood up for himself especially to his wife. Mrs. Penderton isn't a modest person at all. She is the strong person in the family and takes advantage of that in every way. She is the kind of person that runs around on her spouse and doesn't even think twice about it. Carson McCullers used flashbacks in this book as well as metaphors. She portrayed real problems that happen in real life. McCullers did a very good job on this piece of work. The way she described the characters, I could picture each one, vividly. McCullers did a very good job at proving that the world was not only all about the \\"American Dream\\" and the people's goals toward that, but also the ones that rebelled and were not afraid to do the unusual. If you like books with twists and turns from the usual plots then you will enjoy this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"Carson McCullers (a woman, by the way, despite another reviewer's assumption to the contrary) wrote much fiction involving the nature of love. She was never quite as romantic as that may sound: McCullers was one of the masters of the Southern Gothic genre, and Reflections in a Golden Eye is her best work. Her characters are stark and clear, her style crisp, and the action visible. While this is an easy novel to read in some senses, it is more of a prose poem in a novel form. The story deals with two couples on a drab and dull Army base and a young private's animalistic &quot;awakening.&quot; His awakening coincides with those of the Captain and the Major's frail yet strong-willed, and bordering-on-insane, wife (whom McCullers seems to identify with most). McCullers dips in the consciousnesses of the five major characters and the result is chillingly beautiful. It's a shame this, McCuller's second novel and most unique of all her works, is out of print."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"Reflections in a Golden Eye was the second story I've read by Carson McCullers, the first was Ballad of a Sad Cafe which I didn't have much use for.

The first is a caption who is battling homosexuality among other things. His wife is having an affair with the Major who lives next door. Neither of them love each other. The second couple is the Major and his wife. His wife is disturbed after the death of their baby and wants nothing to do with her husband. There is also Private Williams, an insisted man who is obsessed with the Caption's wife while the caption is obsessed with him.

On this last topic, it should be noted that the novel (her second) was not nearly as well received as McCullers' debut masterpiece, THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER. Williams points out - and rightly so - that \`...in her second novel the veil of a subjective tenderness...was drawn away.' What readers and critics were left with was a chilling - and compelling - portrait of six people wrecking together at a fog-shrouded emotional intersection in their lives. It's not a pretty sight - but McCullers' incredible writing simply will not allow us (or her characters) to turn away. The characters slam together completely out of emotional control - mainly because none of them really know themselves deeply enough to understand what they're feeling or experiencing. It's excruciating - and fascinating - to watch.The book may not have been well received critically when it was new - but time has shown McCullers' talents to be long lasting. She is truly one of the giants of 20th century literature."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"This novella is a brave, bald exploration of homosexuality and infidelity in the military. It presents itself as a rare event that disturbs the routine dullness of peacetime military life.The small circle of characters is individually and collectively self-destructive. There's Captain Penderton, who comes to nurse ambivalent homosexual yearnings for Private Williams, who fancies his wife. Meanwhile, Mrs Leonora Pederton is sleeping with General Langdon, whose wife, Alison, eventually succumbs to a complete breakdown of sanity. Got that? Good. It's compulsive stuff.In this narrow social circle, author McCullers sets \\"normal\\" domestic events such as cooking delicious Southern dinners, and card evenings, against sexual episodes (both overt and latent). These range from Private Williams crouching in Mrs Penderton's room all night long to observe her sleeping naked, through to the tormentedly homosexual Captain Pemberton wrecking the body and spirit of his wife's horse on a particularly brutal ride.In some ways, the strangest character is the Langdons' Filipino houseboy, Anacleto. Effete, devoted and fastidious to a \\"T\\", a would-be dancer and artist, he provides tragic Mrs Langdon with a kind of love. And it is Anacleto's artistic vision of a peacock with grotesque reflections in its golden eye that explains the title.Typically of McCullers's Southern Gothicism, the writing infuses poetry with a feeling of utter menace. At times it's scarily bald, yet lyrical: \\"In the sky there was a white brilliant moon and the night was cold and silvery.\\"Some have found it too short, but I don't see that as a problem. It's a quick, chillingly stylish read that plumbs hidden psychological depths and doesn't shrink from uncomfortable truths."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"Written in 1941, Carson McCullers' second novel probably qualifies as a novella or long short story. Surely it was light years ahead of its time as Ms. McCullers takes on homosexuality-- latent and the other kind, masochism, adultery, voyeurism, self-mutilation, a nervous breakdown and animal cruelty in fewer than a hundred pages. In the hands of a lesser writer, this tale would have degenerated into a trashy detective story. Ms. McCullers, however, manages to make the characters, with all their warts, believable, and for the most part, sympathetic. Captain Penderton, for example, is tormented by his hidden feelings for other men-- he is simultaneously attracted to both Private Williams as well as Major Langdon and hates Williams, even though he ought to despise the Major since he is cuckolding the Captain who, along with everyone else, knows about it. But Penderton is a real person, unhappy, lonely but capable of murder.Ms. McCullers keeps this story first class with her spare, though poetic language. \\"An army post [the story is set on a military post in the 1930's in the South] in peacetime is a dull place. Things happen, but then they happen over and over again. . . At the same time things do occasionally happen on an army post that are not likely to re-occur. There is a fort in the South where a few years ago a murder was committed. The participants of this tragedy were: two officers, a soldier, two women, a Filipino, and a horse.\\" With those opening lines, the story begins and never slows down.I never had an English professor who would give Carson McCullers the time of day. Her novels were too gothic, her plots unbelievable, there were too many kinks in her characters. Could it have been that her stories were too close to home or were they jealous of her popularity with the reading public from the publication of her first novel THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER?REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE holds up well on a second reading. Made into a movie by John Houston in 1967 starring Marlon Brando-- in one of his best roles-- and Elizabeth Taylor, this novel is ripe for a remake now by someone with the talent of Mike Nichols."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"Carson McCullers' often critically overlooked but excellent second novel, 'Reflections In A Golden Eye' (1941), represents the author at the height of her creative powers. At the time of its release, Anais Nin thought the book betrayed the influence of D. H. Lawrence, but a more likely inspiration was fellow Southerner Erskine Caldwell, whose early novels 'Tobacco Road' (1932) and 'God's Little Acre' (1933) shared McCullers' tart black humor. Like Caldwell, McCullers parted the heavy curtains of social respectability and looked human nature unsentimentally in the face: 'Reflections In A Golden Eye' examines infidelity, madness, sexual frustration, emotional insensitivity, erotic obsession, the failure of self actualization, voyeurism, homosexuality, and bisexuality with perfect calm and assurance.As the first paragraph bluntly reveals, 'Reflections In A Golden Eye' is a tragedy involving \\"two officers, a soldier, two women, a Filipino, and a horse.\\" The novel takes place on a microcosmic army base in the Deep South: and \\"an army post in peacetime is a dull place.\\" Despite the insulation of the setting and the generally grotesque inner lives of the cast, the smoothly critical tone of the book suggests that McCullers' characters are largely everymen, and thus essentially no different in any specific manner from the average American man or woman.The novel's predominant theme is the general lack of self-awareness which, in the author's vision, most members of society, at all levels, enjoy or suffer. The book begs the question, \\"Which is the greater burden, consciousness or unconsciousness?\\" McCuller's answer is clear: for most people, the burden of consciousness is by far the heavier cross to bear.Adulterous, lust-object Leonora Penderton is not only \\"a little feeble-minded\\" and inherently \\"very stupid,\\" but emotionally coarse as well, while her stolid married lover, Major Morris Langdon, keeps \\"very recondite and literary\\" books by his bedside but privately longs for the \\"pulp magazines\\" featuring \\"wild, interplanetary superwars\\" hidden in his bureau drawer.Alison Langdon, Morris' tense, cuckolded, and perpetually ailing wife, suffers from fits of \\"madness\\" which drive her to acts of self-mutilation. Sadly, Alison, the proverbial 'eye among the blind,' is the single character capable of making an accurate assessment of the terrible events unfolding around her. When the exasperated Alison finally announces what she has witnessed, she is diagnosed as mentally ill and taken away, a theme McCullers admirer Tennessee Williams would adopt and develop to great effect in the following decade.'Reflections In A Golden Eye' is also dominated by characters who are, to varying degrees, homosexual in some capacity of their natures. The book's main character, secret aesthete, figurative eunuch, and kleptomaniac Captain Weldon Penderton, is vaguely aware of his homosexual instincts, and routinely and masochistically becomes enamored of his wife's lovers. Pompous and absurd, Captain Penderton, who was raised by \\"five old-maid aunts\\" and who is known as \\"Flap-Fanny\\" among his subordinates due to his flabby buttocks, receives the brunt of McCullers' often hilarious scorn.All of the book's homosexual elements converge and are caricatured in Alison's mischievous house boy, Anacleto, who spontaneously creates and performs ballets, wears \\"a blouse of aquamarine linen,\\" speaks rudimentary French to Major Langdon's annoyance, and whose paintings, which are at once \\"primitive and over-sophisticated,\\" lay \\"a queer spell on the beholder.\\" Like a folkloric animal trickster, Anacleto is continually described in physically atavistic, monkey-like terms. But McCullers allows the effeminate Anacleto a revenge of sorts: he is the only character who is both self-aware and self-accepting.Rounding out the cast is the introverted Private Williams, a somnambulistic young man--and undetected murderer--who awakens to a new level of consciousness and strange longing after coming into contact with Leonora, whose horse, Firebird, he stables. Unfortunately for all concerned parties, Captain Penderton becomes as uncomfortably enamored of Private Williams as Williams is of Leonora, with fatal results. Though Private Williams clearly develops a definite sexual attraction for Leonora, he also becomes oddly mesmerized by Captain Penderton's halting overtures, which in turn lead him to spasmodic acts of irrational violence.Though McCullers slightly loses her tight focus as the story winds to its conclusion, 'Reflections In A Golden Eye' is so pristinely and economically written that it feels organic: there is barely a false note in any of its deft 124 pages."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"One would expect a 20-something year old in 1940s southern USA to be all prim and nice, with no knowledge of such things as deep emotional trauma and burning homosexual desires. Well Carson McCullers defied conventional wisdom and not only was aware of such matters but deftly encapsulated it in a short, brutal novel. Reflections in a Golden Eye is a painful examination of the wrecked lives of two couples (, and other characters, ) on a military base in the South. There is little in the way of action or story per se, but it is her examination of characters which makes this novel such a winner.This novel is not for everyone. It is rather depressing, with everyone leading neurotic lives. No happy endings, and one has to wonder if there is moral to the story. But those who can tolerate looking at the world without wearing rose-colored glasses will appreciate this masterful work.PS - the novel is MUCH better than the film. And I enjoyed it better than her other famous novel The Heart is a Lonely Hunter."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"With its short page count, \\"Reflections in a Golden Eye\\" is more of a novella than a novel. What is disappointing about it is that it takes about fifty pages (the majority of the novella) to get involved in the characters and the plot. It starts intriguingly enough, with the promise of a murder involving the central characters (\\"two officers, a soldier, two women, a Filipino, and a horse.\\"), but McCullers' prose is so cold and distant that it makes the plot inaccessible to the reader. The descriptions of the setting benefit from this and become starkly beautiful -- \\"Then suddenly the sun was gone. There was a chill in the air and a light, pure wind. It was time for retreat. From far away came the sound of the bugle, clarified by distance and echoing in the woods with a lost hollow tone. The night was near at hand.\\" -- but the characters are rendered so abstruse by it that it feels slightly maddening. After thirty pages someone asked me how the book was so far and the only word that came to mind was bizarre. The violence (both subtle and overt) is startling and seems too unreasoned.But stick with it. In the last thirty pages or so you begin to comprehend the pathos of the characters and their situations, and suspense begins to build as the novella heads to its shattering climax. What McCullers is exploring is how repressed desire can turn to intense hatred, and how that loathing can turn to violence in one sudden moment. The characters are all stuck in their own traps, and most of them are being driven mad by desperation. At the center is Captain Weldon Penderton, a repressed homosexual whose desires are so internalized that the only expression they can find is rage and despair. When his colleague, and his wife's lover, remarks that another character would do better in life if he conformed to the mainstream a little more Penderton angrily disagrees, bitterly wondering \\"that any fulfillment obtained at the expense of normalcy is wrong, and should not be allowed to bring happiness. In short, it is better, because it is morally honorable, for the square peg to keep scraping about the round hole rather than to discover and use the unorthodox square that would fit it?\\" When you consider the ramifications that a life of trying to scrape into a round hole have had on him, you can't help but feel for Penderton. This becomes all the more resonant when you consider that \\"Reflections in a Golden Eye\\" was written at a time when McCullers' own marriage (to a bisexual soldier) was failing as a result of their homosexual affairs.In the end \\"Reflections\\" is a startling and intelligent, not to mention socially important, work. I just wish that it wasn't so hard to get into in the first place, because its initial heartlessness is a misgiving. There actually is a lot of emotion and depth in this novella, and yet it is only toward the ending that it truly shines."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"This book was written in 1941, and deals with homosexuality as well as infidelity in the military. Now being a former Marine and I know what that is like. That alone was enough to make me read it, and I was suprised as to how tastfully it was done. I loved the characters McCullers created and how she was short and to the point with there feelings. A quick read and a ...honest one at that. Very honest about gay supressed passions.

The participants were: two officers, a soldier, two women, a filipino, and a horse.\\"So starts ms mccullers novel, \\"reflections in a golden eye.\\" This novella was written in 1941 and its underlying sexual tones are well ahead of its time. From extra marital affairs to homosexuality with a little voyeurism mixed in, we get a very unique picture of a southern army base in the 1940's.The story is told with great precision and limited verbiage. As a result I enjoyed this more than I did ms mccullers more famous \\"the heart is a lonely hunter\\". Captain penderton's battle with his demons-which include his wife, her horse, and a private for whom he has unwanted feelings-is interestingly contrasted to the singular and more simple desires of the other characters.A very well written book which, by the way, was made into an excellent movie starring marlon brando and elizabeth taylor. Don't miss either."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"This short novel, is extremely well written, not a word out of place. Carson McCullers I very economical with her descriptions, evoking a drama of odd circumstance that must have been a taboo topic when the book was first published. McCullers doesn't seem to really like any characters in the book but she treats them fairly as she surgically dissect each one, revealing repressed feelings, narcissism, shallow intellect, emotional fragility, and dangerous sublimation of emotion.Repressed homosexual Army Major Penderton is the most complex character in the novel, an unloved and unlovable shell of a human, who is barely able to sustain a rigid mask of sanity as homosexual compulsions eventually, drives him to rash acts of violence against himself, his wife's horse, and others. He is the victim of Venus, the goddess who infects humanity with sexual obsession. He is struck by a vision of a handsome young man, Private Williams, and vacillates between fantasy of sexual encounters merged with combat and struggle. The Major's wife, Leonora, is not a complex thinker, but is a bold, beautiful spoiled military brat who has married a career officer with a repressed secret that undermines their entire relationship, making them enemies. As a sexually frustrated wife, she meets her sexual needs with an affair that is so open that everyone on the military base knows it is occurring, with the possible exception of Major Weldon Penderton. Major Penderton may know about her affair with Lt. Colonel Morris Langdon, their next-door neighbor, but he sees it as punishment for his dark secret. She releases some of her pent up passion through horseback riding on her beautiful white stallion, Firebird, an animal that her husband sees as somewhat of a rival.Some may indicate that this is a dark Southern Gothic tale by a Southern writer. It takes place in a post-World War II army base in Georgia where officers and their wives make use of a stable of horses, maintained by the enlisted men. When riding, there are multiple trails in the southern forest that surrounds the Army base. It is here that Leonora and Colonel Langdon frequently go to have sex among the blackberry bushes. It is here that Private Williams, a handsome animal force from nature, rides a black mare nude. It is here that Major Penderton pushes his wife's horse into panic and frenzy in a wild ride of desperation to escape his life condition.Private Williams is a fascinating character, his actions bring about the crisis of identity for Major Penderton for he becomes the object of male obsession. He is a force of nature drawn to nature and destined to appeal to the nature hidden within others. He is as one with horses and the forest where he takes off his clothes and either rides or naps in the nude. He recognizes in Leonora an animal instinct and animal passion that is unreleased and seething. As a voyeur, he observes Leonora taunt her husband while she is nude. However, Private Williams has his own secret, for he becomes obsessed with Leonora and enters the Penderton home nightly to watch her sleep and to smell her clothing. There could also be a Jungian interpretation of Private Williams, for he acts as a shadow archetype for Major Penderton. He nightly enters the home of Penderton (which is the symbol of the psyche) as if the repressed homoeroticism is breaking through the unconscious into consciousness.Alison Langdon, the mentally disturbed wife of Colonel Langdon, watches as her husband courts Leonora, hating both but too weak to escape. As is many classics, she may be mentally ill but she sees all. She sees that her husband is unfaithful and she sees that Private Williams enters the Penderton home on a nightly basis. She is tended to by an effeminate butterfly of a man, Anacleto, who is the houseboy for the Langdons. Alison lost a female child in childbirth and mutilated her nipples afterward in an act of grief and an emotional break from reality.Much story is told in this short novel. The weaknesses of every character are revealed. We are swept away by McCuller's beautiful writing into an odd story of repression and violence."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Golden Eye","review":"What makes a southern novel? There was, of course, a golden age of the southern novel, with the O'Connor, Welty and McCullers as the holy trinity, along with Faulkner. In the 80s there is resurgence, with Lewis Nordan, Clyde Edgerton and the rest of the Algonquin catalogue. After reading FEBRUARY HOUSE I had decided that I wanted to delve into the work of McCullers, having only read THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER, and that was in high school. I started with book two, 1941's REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE, with that incredible opening line: \\"An army post in peacetime is a dull place.\\" The question is, is this a Southern novel? The edition that I read has an afterward by Tennessee Williams, who goes into detail about the gothic sensibilities, but not so much as to how it relates to this slim novel. An army post can certainly take on the flavor of the local geography, but with such a mix of people here seems to be little cohesiveness of spirit. The army base in REFLECTIONS is home to odd Captain Penderton, his lusty wife Leonora, the enigmatic Private Williams and the Pendleton's neighbors, Major Langdon and his wife Alison. Most interestingly, and perhaps the most gothic, is the effete Filipino houseboy Anacleto, who is Alison's strange confident. For 1941 the book is quite an envelope-pusher, with its sexuality and violence. I am sure the book was rampant with symbolism (horses, shears, adultery) but I wasn't keen enough to pick up on all of it. FEBRUARY HOUSE sets up McCuller's writing of this story, and of the almost-positive universal reception (although her father was apparently so repulsed he threw the book across the room). The idea of being lonely in marriage, a constant theme in some of my favorite authors (Updike, Roth) is on full display here. The book is set in the South of the 1930s, but as I said, the inclusiveness of an army post overrides the kudzu and magnolias. I am looking forward to marching through McCuller's canon over the summer and continuing to explore her twisted worlds."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Ships of the Line 2006 Wall Calendar (Star Trek (Calendars))","review":"The months are not laid out in the standard 7-day week format, but instead list a seemingly random number of days across, starting at whatever day the month started out.An example is February, where the days are laid out in two rows of 14 days each, starting on Tuesday.Ridiculous."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Ships of the Line 2006 Wall Calendar (Star Trek (Calendars))","review":"These Ships of the Line series have been top heavy with TNG 1701-D.

The emphasis with this series of star trek calendars is to showcase the excellent almost movie quality art in the widest format as possible on a calendar. As a result the images nearly have a poster quality look to them and hence the 16*9 reminiscent layout. This calendar is not supposed to be used for writing stuff up as the images will loose their \\"epic paranomic quality\\" if they are in horizontal format. Go buy a $1.99 flatback calendar if you sooo need to write stuff up on your calendars but leave us trekkies alone to enjoy the star trek art the way its supposed to./rant offAs always an excellent star trek ships of the line calendar. I have been buying these calendars since 2002. The last two calendars were tad bit disappointing as they were focused on just one series. This time around we have orginal enterpise, NX-02, NCC1701-C & E, the prototype ships shown in Voyager, the hypothetically refitted NCC-1701-C among others. The images are far better in quality than the last two years. Though bit hazy in some shots but they are more epic and action oriented than the previous two calendars. I will whole-heartedly recommend this calendar to any Trekkie or Trekker out there.As with past ships of the line calendars this one agains adorns my office wall. I just want to make sure that no one ever forgets(atleast in my company) that I will forever be a Trekkie or Trekker no matter what."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Ships of the Line 2006 Wall Calendar (Star Trek (Calendars))","review":"Those of you expecting the 2007 calendar to be exclusively dedicated to the Next Generation in keeping with the 2006 format are in for a surprise. A splendid & varied assortment of scenes from the entire Star Trek universe are represented instead. Included are reinterpretations from all five series & the TNG movie era minus the Enterprse E (she doesn't get enough respect I say) and some interesting \\"What ifs?\\" The only real dissapointment is the centerfold scene which should have provoked the most awe... the infamous Borg Battle at Wolf 359 is rather uninspiring. Other than that, I am very happy with this year's entry!

As a functional calendar, however, this item fails completely. The weeks of the month are not shown separately, but seem to be broken up at random intervals. You cannot tell at a glance the starting date of a week without looking verly closely for the small text \\"Sun\\" listed by the number. Imagine listing the 30 days of a month with three long rows of 10 days each. There are no boxes near the dates to write reminders in. The holidays for the month are listed separately from the weeks of the month, so if you are looking at the date on the calendar, you cannot tell if it is a holiday or not unless you look down at the very bottom of the page at the very small text that says when the holidays for that month are.If you are only interested in the pictures, you'll be happy, if you're after a functional calendar that you can glance at and tell if it is holiday and what day of the week it is, then this is not the Logical choice."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Ships of the Line 2006 Wall Calendar (Star Trek (Calendars))","review":"The pictures are beautiful, but the calendar is useless.

Mostly the same type of images we've been seeing in this series--which is, as usual, still a bit disappointing. Only a couple of real standouts this time, both from ST:Enterprise: a really cool shot of the Arctic One vessel over the North Pole encampment from the Borg episode \\"Regeneration\\" and a great image of the NX-01 flying over 1940's New York (in sepia tone!) from the season four two-part opener. The big disappointment comes from the centerfold image. Just a re-use of the cover of last year's Ships of the Line hardback. Yes it's a fine image but nothing new. Most surprisingly (or perhaps not surprisingly) only a single picture that utilizes new imagery from Star Trek Remastered--a shot of the old NCC-1701 protecting a couple freighters (like the one shown recently in the remastered \\"Charlie X\\", itself based on a ship from the 70's animated series) from the often shown D-7 Klingon ship. And why, oh why are we getting yet another image of the Enterprise in drydock? A quick flip through the SOTL hardback and you get at least six previous calendar images of ships in drydock. With so many years' worth of material you'd think the artists could come up with something else. This years' non-canon conjectural vessel is a strange looking ice-shuttle (sort of a Starfleet shuttle-snowmobile combo). I really wish they'd leave these flights of fancy out. And, as previously mentioned elsewhere, DS9, TNG and Voyager are barely represented here.I've been purchasing this product since its inception and chances are, if you are considering buying it so have you. It is exactly what you'd expect, no more, no less. I'd like to say that the featured artists' compositions have gotten more imaginative but sadly (and predictably) I cannot. Not to say that's bad (it's just a calendar after all).

This calendar only has art work from the original (Captain Kirk) series.The art work itself is significantly inferior to that of previous calendars and the ideas behind the pictures show no imagination, no indication that the artists tried to take any risks, no sign that anyone tried to illustrate the Star Trek universe in a different way. If you want an example of what I am going on about get your hands on a copy of the Ships of the Line 2002 calendar done by Mojo Lebowitz and Robert Bonchune - superb.

The images were just too darn small.Complaining about the note space is a little off, too. No one ever said you had to be able to take notes on a calendar to find it useful.

A lot of the closeups do not have the kind of detail that I would expect, given where we are in our current level of cg illustration technology, there was not a very good representation of ships from the five live action series, particularly in the individual month illustrations: there was only one illustration of the Voyager, NONE of the Defiant or DS9, yet FOUR different months were devoted to either the NX-01 from \\"Enterprise\\", or other ships from that show! (The only appearance of the Defiant from DS9 and a second of Voyager, was in the \\"Ode to McCall\\" spread between June and July, which wasn't really much of a \\"scene\\", so much as a lineup of various ships.) They even had a couple of ships from the animated series, none of which looked detailed or interesting, so I'm totally confused by how they made these choices.The decision to include a couple of ships never before seen onscreen was somewhat interesting: An Earth transport ship flying at the scene of the discovery of the Borg Cube remains in \\"Regeneration(ENT)\\", and that Ice Station Alpha TNG era ship for May was really nice looking (I'm wondering if it's intended to have been used off-camera during the events of \\"Timeless(VOY)\\").Still, I was looking for more detail in closeup shots, and a better distribution of ships from the various series.

I had no idea that it would be exclusively Original Series (TOS) art. I enjoy all the series, but TOS isn't my favourite, so I would have passed if I'd known this ahead of time. Furthermore, while I do enjoy CG at times all of these pictures are blatently computer generated.They aren't horrible pictures, they just do not have the visual crispness and clairty that I associate with Star Trek visual effects shots--they were clearly not commercially produced, but made by fans. Again, this isn't something necessarily very bad, but neither of these facts was advertised and so I feel quite cheated.If TOS is your favourite Star Trek series and you don't mind CG then go for it, you'll love this calendar.

These calendars have always showcased great star trek art over all these years and has been a must have for trekkies or trekkers. However in last few years I think the art lacked imagination and there was too much emphasis on just one Star Trek series. They didnt really capture 'To boldly go...' feeling of star trek. Well this year I must say I am pleasently surprised.This time around all of the calendar art has a imaginative feel to it and also a wow factor. They cover nearly all the Trek series this time around with Enterprise series notably missing(finally). Some of them show-cases nice shots of ships while others are more action oriented with ships engaged in battle. The action driven pieces appear to be the most attention drawing. Now as before they appear to be drawn rather than being photo-realistic but the depth and creativity of the art more than makes up for it. One of the art 'To reach the quadrant in 80 days' will adorn my wall as a poster in the near future.In a nutshell this calendar has great imaginative art with that Star Trek feel to it.

The pictures are fabulous, no arguing that, but the \\"calendar\\" function is completely unusable. First off, the calendar opens sideways, so you need 2 hooks to hang it and it will take up more horizontal space than you may have planned for. That's strange, but not an insurmountable issue. The main problem is that the \\"calendar\\" printed on each page is not a standard Sunday-Saturday calendar format. The months are displayed starting at the first day of the month, sometimes in only 2 lines, not the standard 2 week format. For example, if the first day of the month is a Tuesday, the calendar starts with Tuesday and may have 2 weeks worth of dates printed on 2 lines, instead of 4. This is not useful as a calendar.

They publish many calendars every year--2006 was the 40th anniversary of TOS, so they dedicated the Ships of the Line calendar to it. As opposed to the people who disapprove of this, it's the entire reason I got it in the first place.

I do understand this calendar is wholly devoted to the Orginal Star Trek TV series but now with Star Trek off the air, I think it doesn't really make sense to mix match different series. Each year should be completely devoted to a particular series in a choronological order. 12 images as compared to one or two will be a much better memory jogger in my opinion.Anyway...the reason i gave this calendar 5 stars is the excellent imaginative quality of the art presented in the poster wide-screen format. Though cgi like the previous two calendars; but the scope of these images far exceed previous 3 years calendars in my view. Only one image in my view is of sub-standard quality actually and gladly enough comes at the very end of the calendar(felt like they lost steam or something).You get to see the orginal NCC-1701 in action in either a reimagination of orginal series sequences or new ones alltogether. Some images especially the ones about 'Romulus', and the two battle sequences with Klingon crusiers are so detailed and crisp that i want to think how good the orginal series might look today if redone with the current state-of-the-art FX.Well here are my 2 cents. If you love the orginal series than there is no excuse for you not to get this calendar. Even if you are not the fan of the orginal series, gave this calendar a shot for some really well done sci-fi art.Here hoping for even more 'Epic' calendar for 2007. Atleast with these calendars the memory of Star Trek still flourishes in our minds.

The 2008 edition has some truly great renderings. (As I true Trekkie, I can point out, with my tongue firmly planted in cheek, the one mistake I noticed so far, of using a Generations style shuttle instead of the correct movie-era Galileo) However, my only real caveat, is that with only 14 renderings (counting the cover & centerfold) that too much space is dedicated to the Original Series & Enterprise. The Original Series gets 6 entries & Enterprise gets 4... Leaving only one page each for Voyager & Deep Spece Nine. C'mon guys... Share the space more evenly! There is also one very interesting Federation large shuttle/runabout style non-canon ship image which I don't mind at all.

First off, the side-by-side design. You need 2 hooks on the wall to hang one calendar, and you can't get it to hang well. One side is always sticking up more than the other, except of course during June.Second, the printed dates are pretty darn small. It's less than 3 feet away, but I can barely make out the numbers, forget about the days of the week.You might be asking, \\"Why would you need to see the days of the week anyway? It always starts on Sunday and ends on Saturday.\\" Not so for this calendar. Whatever genius designed this thing decided that doing it the way everyone has for their entire lives made no sense for his design taste. The first line of each month starts with the first day, then goes a seemingly arbitrary number forward, presumably not to \\"mess up the artwork with this ugly calendar thingy that we have to stick on here.\\" Then the next line starts with whatever day you left off with at the end of the first line, which means if the first line started with a Thursday, the next line, underneath the Thursday, could be a Monday, or a Saturday, or a Tuesday. So you can't even rely on the columns. Oh, and forget about holidays. They're in a footnote printed at about 8 point font at the bottom of the page you're on, entirely disconnected from the calendar dates themselves. So you have to go look those up. You can't just see them at a glance.But hey, if you want some Star Trek artwork with a fairly useless calendar printed in the middle of each piece, then be my guest and buy this calendar! Oh, and don't forget that your artwork will also have a big crease down the middle.Seriously, don't buy this calendar. It will only encourage them to make another one. If they wanted to make a poster calendar, then do it in the right format, and don't pass it off as an actual practical calendar. The second star is for the artwork, and since I assume it's not the fault of the artists that their work was used on a completely impractical calendar."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Ships of the Line 2006 Wall Calendar (Star Trek (Calendars))","review":"I bought this item as a gift for my son who is a huge trekkie.

I have been purchasing them since 2001. This year is mixture of pre generations and beyond star trek art though the emphasis is on the rather forgetable tv series Enterprise(for some odd reason) and the orginal star trek(very understandable because of the upcoming movie). As always some of the art is really very appealing while some are rather forgetable but as always brings out the star trek fan in me. I especially like the wide-screen layout which really brings out the best of the art by displaying it in paranomic format. My only gripe is(and has been for last 3 years) is the non-photo realistic but rather a drawn aspect of the pictures. Theses calendars really used to stand out when an emphasis was put to make the art photo realistic like the TV shows and movies.Well I think the calendar was worth the purchase price but they are rooms for improvement namely photo-realism and moving away from Enterprise era."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Ships of the Line 2006 Wall Calendar (Star Trek (Calendars))","review":"Another in a great line of the Ships of the Line product!

While it at first blush seems like a campaign setting sourcebook for d20, it's primarily a collection of adventures with a good dollop of background material. It shouldn't be mistaken for a book along the lines of Green Ronin's outstanding Mythic Vistas line, which included a number of fairly historically accurate settings like ancient Rome or medieval Europe.Rather, this is a book that takes the bare bones of Mesopotamian history and mythology, and uses them as a framework on which to construct a set of adventures that evoke the mood and feel of some of the great pulp writers, specifically Robert E. Howard and H.P. Lovecraft. In addition, this book provides material that would fit comfortably into the Wilderlands, a classic campaign setting originally published Judges Guild in the 1970s and 80s, and now published by Necromancer Games.I found this book to be a unique addition to my RPG library, one that draws upon a background not often explored in RPGs."},{"Title":"Ancient Kingdoms Mesopotamia (Sword Sorcery)","review":"For someone who considers Old Empires to be the BEST Forgotten Realms accessory ever made, it should not come as a surprise that I'm giving Ancient Kingdoms: Mesopotamia, 5 Stars!

Although there was familiar material in Mr. Bonsall's work, (the arrival of a new full-sized car just as the first import craze was beginning was the product of a decade-long lead time to launch the new make), there was also much I've never seen in print anywhere before--such as Robert McNamara's statement that the decision to discontinue the Edsel had been made even before its formal introduction! From the company's internal politics, to the design process, to the challenges of setting up the dealer network, no aspect of the Edsel's history is omitted. This profousely illustrated work is an absolute must for Edsel lovers, and should be worthwhile to anyone interested in the Ford Motor Company or automotive history in general.--William C. Hall"},{"Title":"Disaster in Dearborn: The Story of the Edsel (Automotive History and Personalities)","review":"Bonsall's treatment of the Edsel story is unique in that he first sets the historical stage and market conditions under which the Edsel program was conceived and executed. He does an excellent job of describing the reasons Ford needed the Edsel program, and why the program missed its mark. As Bonsall methodically moves the Edsel story forward, the reader is filled with a sense of impending doom, much like reading about the maiden voyage of the Titanic. Bonsall does an excellent job of drawing together the many disparate influences and elements that together charted the fateful course of the Edsel."},{"Title":"Disaster in Dearborn: The Story of the Edsel (Automotive History and Personalities)","review":"Disaster in Dearborn: The Story of the Edsel by Thomas Bonsall is easily the best piece of automobile journalism I have ever read. If you are interested in the Edsel, or just cars of this era in general, Bonsall will simply have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Not only will you come away with a thorough understanding of the Edsel itself, the author artfully puts the whole Edsel saga into context with what was happening with the rest of the American auto industry during time before, during, and after the Edsel's brief lifespan. I honestly could not put this book down once I started it as Bonsall truly lets you feel the anticipation and excitement surrounding Edsel's conception, design, and launch. Quite simply everything about the Edsel and the people who created it is covered in this book. In closing Bonsall impartially takes you through all the theories on why the Edsel failed and brings the book to a very satisfying and thoughtful conclusion. And although primarily not a picture book, you'll find gathered here a small but exciting group of Edsel prototype photos and sketches I have never seen in print anywhere else before. A terrific book for anyone interested in auto history in general and an absolute must for anyone fascinated with the Edsel."},{"Title":"Disaster in Dearborn: The Story of the Edsel (Automotive History and Personalities)","review":"Unlike many current automotive books with some nice photos and tired, re-released copy, this one is fresh and fascinating.

Five stars from a tough critic."},{"Title":"Disaster in Dearborn: The Story of the Edsel (Automotive History and Personalities)","review":"The 1958 Edsel has received a lot of lampooning from the time it was introduced because of its front design (&quot;a fish sucking a lemon&quot;) and this has generally been attributed as the reason it was regarded as a flop. Certainly Ford lost $100 million on it at the time (and its advertising agency and most of the dealers also took baths) but here it is revealed that in reality the car achieved the market penetration in relative terms that was expected of it. The reason for the losses were due to organisational mistakes and the fact that people like Robert McNamara (the archetypal bean counter) pulled the plug on it prematurely. The author also demonstrates that the production capacity created for the Edsel was actually utilised to the full in the 1960s with the Falcon and the Mustang.This book is a great read, and the illustrations include many interesting design proposals. I would have given the book 5 stars if the illustrations had been printed on coated paper and included at least a few in color."},{"Title":"Disaster in Dearborn: The Story of the Edsel (Automotive History and Personalities)","review":"This book is timeless. Yesterday's problems are today's problems. The book is as well written as any book analyzing a corporate strategic failure in any industry in any decade. The author combines a deep understanding of the history of the U.S. auto industry with excellent research and lively writing.He covers all the usual topics about the Edsel - the decline mid-price class in the mid-1950's, the recession of 1958, the introduction of a 1958 model before the competitive models were announced, etc. well enough. The strength of the book is in tracing the deeper roots of the failure in company politics and personalities.It is fun to compare the issues discussed in this book with the current turmoil in the U.S. auto industry. Many industry issues of the last few years - GM dropping Pontiac, GM canceling dealers, Ford trying to decide what to do with the Mercury brand, Toyota introducing full sized pickup just as the market collapses, corporate infighting between Chrysler and Mercedes Benz executives - are echoes of issues that surrounded the Edsel."},{"Title":"Disaster in Dearborn: The Story of the Edsel (Automotive History and Personalities)","review":"Disaster in Dearborn: The Story of the Edsel (Automotive History and Personalities)I was looking for this book, and saw it come up on eBay.

You'll figure out \\"who done it\\" early on, but that doesn't stop the fun. This book is like reading a Saturday serial, there are a variety of plot twists to maintain your interest throughout the book."},{"Title":"Dead men's money,","review":"Dead Men's Money is my first J. S. Fletcher mystery. The novel dates to the golden age of mystery writing, the nineteen-twenties and -thirties, and is an appealing \\"cozy.\\" When I read books from this era I always enjoy picturing the hissing steam engines, compartmented passenger coaches, and smoky railway stations that were such a romantic aspect of the time.The story is set mostly in Berwick-upon-Tweed, a town on the English side of the border with Scotland, but the characters walk and bicycle about the surrounding countryside (often at night!), visit a stately home, and do a fair bit of travelling by rail. There is even an episode aboard a sailing yacht. The changing locales keep the unfolding mystery fresh and absorbing.We see events through the eyes of a rather slow-witted but sincere young man, Hugh Moneylaws, who works in a lawyer's office. His employer, Mr. Lindsey is the brains of the piece. He is always there to ask the sharp questions and shrewdly put two and two together while young Hugh dreams of marrying his sweetheart and tries to find the money to furnish a home. While none too swift - one wonders how he ever got a job with a law firm - his direct honesty and simple decency make him likable. I found myself rooting for him as he works past the obstacles standing between him and his girl.Hugh becomes central to the tale entirely by accident. He hopes to earn some much-needed cash while running a mysterious nighttime errand for a sick lodger in his mother's house, but instead stumbles into murder. The law firm gets involved and Hugh accompanies Mr. Lindsey on his various investigative rounds. The young man also sneaks in a bit of snooping on his own. Who the guilty party might be seems at first obvious, but the situation quickly becomes more complex, and a lot must be uncovered before the murderer's true motive is revealed. A second murder adds a wonderful plot twist to what is already an engaging story.Fletcher is a capable writer well equipped to handle the ins and outs of the mystery genre. I especially enjoyed the unfamiliar border setting and the book's relatively brisk pace. Hugh's obtuseness may occasionally try your patience, but the novel never bores."},{"Title":"Dead men's money,","review":"I discovered this accomplished vintage writer through Amazon recommendations. Although he's little-known today, J. S. Fletcher wrote over 100 detective novels. The immense popularity of his work encouraged him to be prolific.Fletcher weaves a dark and complex mystery, and gives us a smart, courageous, warm-hearted hero who experiences various adventures and horrors. The hero of this tale is Hugh Moneylaws, nineteen-year-old clerk to the clever and fatherly lawyer Mr. Lindsey.Hugh finds a dead body while performing a mysterious errand for a mysterious stranger in a lonely spot late at night. This is just the beginning of a sinister train of events. The very gripping plot encompasses all sorts of puzzling behavior on the part of many people, from the local baronet to the local marine store dealer. There are mysterious appearances and disappearances, carefully planned frauds and spontaneous murders, and dramatic confrontations with thoroughly bad people. Hugh escapes death more than once.The action centers in a little English town on the border of Scotland. There are lots of great characters. Some have stereotypical Scottish traits. The lawyer is shrewd and observant and keeps his own counsel while getting to the bottom of the crimes. Hugh's widow mother can be sharp-tongued and hates to see money spent. And there's an element of romance. Hugh's devotion to his spunky sweetheart is quite touching.People have wonderful names, like Moneylaws, Gilverthwaite, Portlethorp and Elphinstone. Although there are motorcars around and lots of riding of bicycles, the story is redolent with the atmosphere of old England.I loved Dead Men's Money and expect to be reading more by this obscure British novelist.This Forgotten Books edition is pretty good for a digital reprint. There are some cut-off letters initially, but you can still easily make out the words."},{"Title":"Dead men's money,","review":"I went four stars on this one. Good plot, with excellent plot development, and some very good character development, particularly with the minor characters. There is a rather high body count for a story from this time frame. The story moves along briskly, with lots of twists and turns, and, a rather surprising ending that you probably won't see coming. As with most novels from that era the plot in the end seems a little contrived, but not nearly so contrived as many novels of that era tended to be. The story starts out with a man taking rooms at the lodging house run by our hero's widowed mother. There is a murder, then the story really starts to take off and the mystery is on. I think this was probably the 1st or 2nd Fletcher novel I read, and it is a very good example of his style of story telling.Fletcher, like E. P. Oppenheim and Edgar Wallace, looms above the run of the mill hacks of that era. Their stories are original. They move the plot along nicely, and they don't get caught up in so much of that upstairs/downstairs schism, and M'Lord this and M'Lady that, so common to fiction from the late 19th and very early 20th centuries. They also don't have some super sleuth wrapping everything up in the end so that it all seems so simple to the likes of Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot. In many cases I see the seeds of modern crime and mystery fiction in the writing of Fletcher. He tells the story through action and dialog, and he doesn't impose an omniscience upon the reader to guide them along through the slow spots and fill in the holes in the plot. After reading this I suggest reading The Middle Temple Murder to fill out your appreciation of Fletcher's style and approach.I got this one for free on Kindle, all I was out on this story was the time I spent reading it, and I thought that it was time very well spent.

Kind of 'boy's own' adventure meets with a less verbose Conan Doyle."},{"Title":"Dead men's money,","review":"I love historic mysteries, especially those set in late 1800 early 1900 British Isles. Although this is the first mystery that I have read by J.S. Fletcher, I plan to read all I can find because he is a very good writer, an excellent story teller, and is very accurate in his place and historic descriptions. He was made a member of the Royal Historic Society during his lifetime, and his writing shows his keen attention to historic detail. In this story, he brings the reader along on the tale with a character who is the unlikely hero, giving the reader a sympathy with a likeable character from the very beginning, and therefore in tune with the emotions of the main character as we discover clues, live through horror and adventure along with him. Very fun tale and quite an adventure!"},{"Title":"Whistle","review":"you might enjoy this Third volume of Mr. Jones opii[sp?].

I found the book to be good but the totally mature and X-Rated content was offensive and totally horrible to be seen by me, a teenager. Some people might disagree with a teenager reading this book but I read it anyways. Parents if you are letting your teenager read this book, I suggest you think twice. The book was good though"},{"Title":"Whistle","review":"After having read FROM HERE TO ETERNITY and THE THIN RED LINE, I couldn't figure out what would be so interesting about an army war hospital(the setting for WHISTLE). I was dead wrong proving once again that a great writer makes anything interesting.The guys are back from Gradualcanal and suffering both physical and psychological effects. They are happy to be alive and ashamed they didn't die along side their buddies. It's hard to believe that so many people they meet know nothing about the war being fought out there. They believe in the other men from their old company, but little else.It could be argued that it is the weakest of the trilogy. Jones hurried to write the book before his early death at age 55. It was published more than 20 years after the war's end and suffers somewhat from the knowledge of those 20 years. The references to the songs seem more nostalgic than informative. His analysis of the sexes would have been brilliant in 1946, but easily made in the 1970s. But those are minor points, because the book is every bit as honest as gritty as anything that he ever wrote. Good enough that you don't want it to end, but harsh enough that you're afraid to read it a second time."},{"Title":"Whistle","review":"No author captures the mind and plight of the ordinary soldier better than James Jones, and \\"Whistle\\" is the third book of a trilogy that includes the indomitable \\"From Here to Eternity\\" and the gritty \\"The Thin Red Line.\\"From Here to Eternity portrays barracks life in Hawaii just before the attack at Pearl Harbor; The Thin Red Line is a wrenching account of island fighting in the South Pacific; and Whistle is the story of four men from the same infantry company, all wounded in battle, who are brought back to the U.S. on a hospital ship and then sent to an Army hospital in the South.The book does a fine job of portraying the complex relationships between the four men and the inner demons each has to face. First Sergeant Martin Winch is a cynical, but superb leader who struggles with congestive heart failure while trying his best to protect the other three men. Mess Sgt. Johnny Strange is the nurturer who looks after the others while he struggles with the infidelity of his wife, and the injustices of the Army pecking order. Buck Sergeant Marion Landers tries but fails to handle the monstrous fury that wells up inside him. Corporal Bobby Prell fights to save his legs from amputation and copes with feelings of guilt over a Congressional Medal of Honor that he does not believe he deserves.This was Jones&#8217; final book, and he was unable to finish the final three chapters before he died of congestive heart failure (his death is portrayed in the movie \\"A Soldier&#8217;s Daughter Never Cries\\" based on the book written by his daughter, Kaylie.)Unfortunately, the last book of the trilogy doesn&#8217;t measure up to the first two, and it pains me to write this because I am one of Jones&#8217; major fans. The story, the writing, Jones&#8217; unique ability to get into the head of the GI just aren&#8217;t as sharp in this work.There is also the matter of his preoccupation about a man performing oral ... on a woman&#8211; he goes on and on and on about it throughout the book. The ... is graphic, even by today&#8217;s standards. All well and good, but the preoccupation with oral ... stretched and exceeded the limits of its role in the story line. It&#8217;s like Jones&#8217; had a statement to make, and he made it too often; and he made it too important for credibility.And then there is the end of the book, which should have been handled differently. Jones was unable to complete the final three and one half chapters, but he let his intentions for the finale be known in detail. A friend and neighbor, Willie Morris, wrote the last chapters from notes and recordings. They are not written as fiction, but as a summary of what the author intended to happen. The novel would have been much better had a skilled writer done the end as a continuing fictional narrative, imitating Jones&#8217; style. (Of course, there would need to be an appropriate explanation of how it was handled at the beginning of the book.)Whistle is not James Jones best work. But it&#8217;s still a fine story by one of America&#8217;s most underrated authors."},{"Title":"Whistle","review":"&quot;Whistle&quot; is one of the best books I have read. WWII is my favorite story genre. James Jones has never been disappointing in showing the reality of the soldiers' character. There were parts of the story where I audibly gasped at what had taken place. Although some of the language was Army technical and foreign to me, it was an easy read. The sexual encounters and explicit descriptions of them, was not offensive,but enlightening. It was very real and a breath of fresh air compared to the sugar coated versions of what happened during the war in other stories and films of the same time period. The main characters, Winch, Landers, Strange and Prell are so different from the stereo-type &quot;war hero&quot; It is a story of WWII which reveals the horror but does not dwell on it with blood, violence &amp; gore and shows it from so many different perspectives."},{"Title":"Whistle","review":"James Jones, wrote this, the last book of his World War II trilogy (From Here to Eternity, The Thin Red Line) right before his early death at 55. The men have returned to Tennessee from guadalcanal as casualties. These are basically the same characters from the earlier books, carried forward with different names. As their physical ailments heal, we begin to realize that their psychological ailments are worsening. Their wives are distant and their girlfriends are shallow, but there is plenty of whiskey.An army hospital may not seem the setting for an exciting story, but this book is every bit as compelling as Jones' prior installments. It's difficult for these men to come back to the mainland to be surrounded by people who understand nothing of their experiences. They are happy to be away from the fighting, but the men they shared those days with, seem to be the only reality they accept.Jones passed away before the book was complete, and the last few chapters read like cliffs notes, but it doesn't lessen the power of this story."},{"Title":"Whistle","review":"Whistle completes the trilogy started in From Here to Eternity and The Thin Red Line. Four characters are carried over -- the 1st Sergent, the clerk, the mess sergent, and the misfit. Here, they return stateside on a hospital ship, each with their own wounds, and the novel follows their intertwined and separate destinies. It may be one of the best attempts to outline Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, but Jones never dips so low as to call it some buzz phrase like that.Recommended to those who have read either or both of the first two books. Maybe a tough slog for those without that background. Out of print for a long time, I read a copy in the library. This useful reissue is presumably being driven by the film of The Thin Red Line. I found that book and film moving. Whistle can be immensely *more* saddening in comparison, esp. the film, which is almost hopeful compared to Jones. -dB"},{"Title":"Whistle","review":"I found this book to be a worthwhile conclusion to the trilogy featuring &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; and &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;. I read all three in 1999 and can say that James Jones has written a masterful set. The book is a pioneer in its field because it deals with the recovery, rehabilitation and the daily routines of wounded soldiers at a hospital in Luxor (a fictional city on the mainland of the USA during the middle of World War II). I am not familiar with any other book that deals with this topic. The charecters in this book were all wounded on New Georgia, which was the campaign after Guadalcanal, and so Whistle picks up where The Thin Red Line stops. Based on James Jones' own experiences, Whisltle makes a memorable conclusion in the very last chapters."},{"Title":"Whistle","review":"Although Whistle takes place in 1943, it is really about post-war America and the effect it had on the psyche of American males. We have met all of the four main characters (with different names, but the author identifies them in a foreword)in earlier volumes of James Jones great trilogy: From Here to Eternity and The Thin Red Line. Now they are in a hospital in Tennessee.They all come to bad ends, but it isn't really the war that destroys them. It is the peace and their inability to live with the changes wrought by the war. One can't cope with his inability to protect his men, one rebels when he is forced to become a public relations flack in order to stay in the army, one rejects the honor and traditions of the military ethos only to regret it and the other one is appalled by the nihilism which he sees as the wave of the future.Jones fought a battle to complete this book before he died. He didn't quite succeed - a few chapters toward the end are sketched out in summary form - but this is a complete and important work by one of the greatest American writers of the Twentieth Century and a very worthy finale to a trilogy comprised of masterpieces."},{"Title":"Whistle","review":"I was unaware of the Trilogy and of Whistle when I came across it on Amazon / Kindle and appreciated the opportunity to complete the story. Whistle is different from the ENTERNITY AND THIN RED LINE in that it is after they leave combat and are rehabing in the hospital. The story sheds insights to how our Vets come back from the wars to follow as well. Jones really gets into the characters deeply, but the last 3 chapters close out the story without this depth as Jones had died prior to completing them.I recommed this to WWII buffs and Jones Fans, but it is a different story line.TDB"},{"Title":"Whistle","review":"I loved the final book of the trilogy.

When I saw that all the Amazon.com reviews of it were either adoring or vituperative, I knew I had to buy it right away. Why had that happened?Well, now I know. This is a book with prerequisites, and if you don't have 'em, you're going to find the book very difficult. You need to know something about Jewish life in America, particularly the panoply of stereotypes to which they've been subjected (one that gets a lot of play in the book, the idea that Jews somehow smell bad, is not quite so current as it once was). And it helps to know something about the 19th century American brand of crackpot people and crackpot groups.Finally, you need to know how to read Ben Katchor. If you expect a linear read you'll be frustrated. Each panel needs to be scrutinized carefully, and pages will pass before you catch the significance of certain details. You'll need to learn to like that centered panel that one reviewer hated so much...it's used for reasons, sometimes esthetic, sometimes dramatic.In the end, I was disappointed in _The Jew of New York_ because I'd hoped for a book first about people and feelings rather than about ideas. The author's aim (my informed guess here) is to show how the majority can simultaneously fetishize minorities and hold them in contempt, certainly a notion with relevance to 1999. But I wish he could have told me about that with more emotion; instead, we get a range of exceedingly eccentric characters, whose hearts we don't really get into.Anyway, I don't regret my purchase, but if I weren't a Katchor fan, I might."},{"Title":"The Jew of New York","review":"Well, first of all, I have to say I'm really surprised by the people who don't like this book. Certainly I don't expect it to be universally loved, but I really disagree with the reasons I've read below. For example, one reviewer criticized it by calling it a \\"book of ideas.\\" Yes, exactly! And not your run-of-the-mill ideas either. I found it very inventive, original, thought-provoking, and culturally/historically accurate. That's a lot to pull off in less than 100 pages--pages that are largely taken up by drawings. Pictures do say 1,000 words. Second, I completely disagree with the reviewer who noted that you have to know something about Jewish stereotypes. I'm a black African female living in 21st century America, and I had no difficulty understanding the stereotypes or warped values behind them. Maybe it would be safer to say that you need to understand or have been exposed to some type of stereotype in your lifetime. But I have to think that most people who would even pick up this sort of book, would be literate enough to know that the stereotypes depicted, are exactly that. I even disagree that the page layouts were difficult to read. I think if you have ever read sequential art, it's pretty straight-forward. And if you haven't, the process of figuring it out--and it really does become intuitive very quickly--adds to the telling. You *do* find the significance of certain details by kind of puzzling over the images and layout. So I guess if you need hand-holding narratives, then this probably isn't the book for you. But this is the first work by Katchor that I've read, and I am very impressed by his ability to say so much in so few words about capitalism, nature conservancy, race relations, religiosity, sexuality, theatre, etc. and how these things comprise /conflict with \\"progress\\" and the belief every age has that it is the epitomy of advanced human development.I first heard of Katchtor when reading The Narrative Corpse, a story told by 69 artists and edited by Art Spiegelman. Unsurprisingly, a lot of people who had a negative reaction to it, had similar comments as can be found here. That the \\"story,\\" as such, wasn't linear, etc. But again, I feel like those readers really missed the point. Anyway, I'll save that review for that book, but if you're not so hung up on context, The Narrative Corpse is another that you might enjoy, though the two books couldn't be more dissimilar."},{"Title":"The Jew of New York","review":"Katchor seems to define his own idiom. While other reviews have focused on the &quot;graphic novel&quot;, &quot;The Jew of New York&quot; goes far beyond this genre, and offers a unique dream-like perspective of Katchor's own strange world and masterful character portrayals.Each Character is in fact developed brilliantly, and the whole complex story, from its Hebrew speaking Indian, to its gastrically obsessed Kabbalist, all form threads that seem to come together into a single and perfect ending.This book is not only a pleasure to read and reread, but it's a pleasure to get lost in; to wander with the characters through an imaginary old New York, and see thier lives, schemes, and very human reactions, their triumphs and their pitfalls. I have bought two copies for friends already!And, to anyone who doesn't know about castoruem, it's a must have book."},{"Title":"The Jew of New York","review":"I feel like a traitor writing this review because I'm huge fan of Ben Katchor's work. This book this is series of non sequiturs that never turned into a coherent work of fiction. In the first 30 pages I thought there might be some hope of an interesting idea emerging. But by page 50, out of a hundred pages, I had given up hope. When I got to the end there was nothing positive I could say about the experience. I think Katchor's forte is brief snippets revealing the mystery of urban reality. In this longer work, staged in post-colonial America, Katchor seems out of his element. Some might presume that perhaps I don't understand the social and political milieu of this era. Such is not the case and I still found this narrative indecipherable. I understood the significance of the isolated incidents and characters but it never solidified into a meaningful narrative. But I do understand the fine line between mysterious and indecipherable. Perhaps others won't have my difficulty.The author did bring up many idiosyncratic and strange moments in American history. But I had little sense of what was tweaked reality and what was pure invention. In small doses that can be quite mysterious, but at some point the author has to give clues as to his intent. I love hisJulius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer. I think Katchor is one of America's most intriguing cartoonists and comic book writers. He just couldn't pull this one off."},{"Title":"The Jew of New York","review":"If you're even considering buying it buy it now. \\"The Jew of New York\\" is a work of comic genius on par with Infinite Jest or The Dice Man for its shear unrelenting absurdity and satirical power. All I can say if you don't like this book is YOU ARE NOT PAYING CLOSE ENOUGH ATTENTION. A graphic novel that conflates anti-semitic stereotypes with the unstoppable rise of industrialization and consumerism in America? You mean that book actually exists? And it's so funny I literally hurt myself reading it? And you can buy it right now on Amazon.com?! Seriously do it. This would easily land on my short list of comics I would use to prove that comics can be brilliant works of art. Buy it. You need to read it. It is so good you have no idea."},{"Title":"The Jew of New York","review":"Ridiculous book that had me cracking up at the first page. If you like Katchor, then this will delight you. If you're unfamilar with him, then this may get you interested in his other work. Especially effective if you are 'of the faith'."},{"Title":"The Jew of New York","review":"All of Ben Katchor's work is incredible and a joy to read and look at. This book, the Julius Knipl books, Cheap Novelties, etc are no exceptions. But this book, and like, everything else that Katchor is involved with."},{"Title":"The Jew of New York","review":"Ben Katchor's magical, sketchily precise illustrations lead us through a grey other world where people face problems none of us will ever know. Or fathom. But who cares! Every step of the way is uniquely Katchor's, grounded in a strange logic that seems to make perfectly good sense... at least to his characters. A wealth of invention infuses every page, conjuring exotic maladies, bizarre business enterprises and wierd obsessions."},{"Title":"The Jew of New York","review":"What an amazing book. I found myself torn whether to linger over particular panels or rush on to find out what happened next. Katchor clearly inhabited the archive for a long time before putting this together, and he really captures the beauty, strangeness, and confusion of Jewish life in the early republic. Complex and funny storyline, often surpisingly moving. And although the drawing style is a bit crude, the design is always subtle -- the overall effect only adds to the weirdness. Just brilliant, brilliant work."},{"Title":"The Jew of New York","review":"This book is one of the greatest graphic novels ever made! A must read! As good as Maus and Ghost World! Sure to be the Best Book of 1999!"},{"Title":"The Jew of New York","review":"This book is terrible. First the story. It weaves several different story lines together. A production of a play 'The Jew of New York' by a questionable director (guess what happens to him in the end), a plan to carbonate Lake Erie, and a guy reading 'Lost Tribe' pamphlets in a rubber suit. There's a button importer and an Indian who speaks Yiddish. Sounds inventive. Sounds squirrelly enough for a graphic novel. But the author, caught up in his own casting brillance, forgets to make the characters say and do inventive and brilliant things. Instead they plod. In the beginning you do find yourself wondering if the plots are historical, but by the end you're just screaming to have the book done with. The art? Every character looks like they were morphed out of one base character. It's impossible to tell them apart. Also you should have a good magnifying glass because the panels are too small. It would have been nice if the publisher would have included one. There is also this repetitive center panel that appears every six or seven pages. It distracts and is annoying. The author should have known this. I think the actor Maynard Daizy (a character in the novel) sums it up the best as he discusses the up and coming play with the scenic director Samson Gergel...&quot;The dialogue itself is devoid of humor. Waiter! A bowl of turtle soup...&quot; I couldn't have said it better myself."},{"Title":"The Jew of New York","review":"From the reviews and supposed reputation of Katchor I was expecting a thunderous resurgence of the graphic novel. It seems a shame that the glowing reviews it has garnered in no way reflect the sloppiness of the story or artwork. As a artform the graphic novel has been richly exploited in the fantasy world of comics. However as a mainstream novel method it has been largely ignored. But if employed with skill, as evidenced from Japanese authors, it can be a compelling format.However this book falls far short of that mark. The story is stock and uninteresting, and the characters and ending are sadly predictable.The only redeeming feature of the book is its binding. It is unfortunate, though, that every page the covers hold in place, lacks soul, skill, and imagination."},{"Title":"A Voyage through Humanity","review":"I enjoyed reading this poetry and wanted to express my enjoyment in some of the mechanisms the author employed in getting his ideas across. Allegory and metaphor are the bridled workhorses that draw the writer's truths to their destination. The expression, the discovery by the writer of how he is going to convey his truth, serves to illuminate and obviate the message. The following are but a few of the poems in his book that I cite as being quite provocative:\\"Freedom\\" prisoner leaping to an ignominious death upon seeking to imitate the bird; the futility of trapping the beauty in ourselves, in the \\"Butterfly\\"; the fleeting instant of joy in despair in \\"The Paralyzed Child\\"; the need for planting knowledge in a fertile element in, \\"A Seed\\"; the certainty of courageous movement, in \\"Steps\\" (a confident tone \\"Let me tell you something\\"); the observation that all life's experiences are useful and should not be confined to the useless wardrobe, in \\"Confronting Illnesses\\"; the spoiled fruit of unfulfilled expectations, in \\"Energy Of Life\\"; the aspiration for second place in order for progress to exist in first place, in \\"Achievement\\" -- all of these were impressive and provocative expressions.I enjoyed all of the poems and ideas in Mr. Seidman's work greatly and wish him continued success on his journey.Well done, good luck and thanks."},{"Title":"A Voyage through Humanity","review":"I have got this poetry book without knowing anything about it, just by a chance. It came out that it was a very smart choice. The poems have so many interesting ideas about life. I am not sure that from one read I am getting the full depth of it all. I definitly need to read it again. Some of the poems I do not agree with, but I have learnt a lot from the most of them. If you are thinking of getting a good poetry book this one is worth it. Interesting poems about being a child and then and adult and an old person. I believe we all have to deal with these issues.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Earth Under Fire: Humanity's Survival of the Ice Age","review":"Earth under Fire: Humanity's Survival of the Ice AgeBy Paul A. LaViolette, PhDISBN: 1-59143-052-6 (Inner Traditions, 2005)It's not a matter of \\"if\\"; it's a matter of \\"when\\" will we go through the next cataclysmic upheaval on Earth. Putting aside the debate of whether or not it's manmade or natural, with the mounting information pointing to the fact that Earth is rapidly approaching a major shift, we would do well to learn from our ancestors, who recorded through myths and monuments the destructive forces that nature can and has unleashed in our past. A compilation of well-documented science, from ice cores and astronomical evidence, to indigenous myths of when their ancestors faced extinction, could possibly make this information crucial for our own survival.Rahasya Poe, Lotus Guide magazine [...]"},{"Title":"Earth Under Fire: Humanity's Survival of the Ice Age","review":"We should all be extremely grateful to Mr. La Violette, and the many others like him who are helping us understand ourselves and the world we live in. He has an eminent background in physics, geology, electromagnetics, and astronomy that lend enormous credibility to his writing. But on top of that, he's able to piece together a huge array of sometimes obscure data and express his analysis and conclusions in an extremely clear manner, with logic, many references, and illustrations. Most thoughtful people realize that generally accepted theories of our planet's distant past are woefully inadequate. Evidence is fragmentary, dots left unconnected, and personal and cultural biases interfere with understanding. DIscovering the true facts requires enormous research, creative thinking, rigorous analysis, and an open mind. It takes genius, surely, but that's not all. It requires a truly scientific approach, and by that I mean putting aside preconceptions that may interfere, and letting the facts and analysis speak for themselves. Mr. Laviolette does this very well in his books. So, we need books like this, and courageous writers like him, to help us understand.This book's primary focus is a series of immense astronomical events that affected all life on our planet, in particular over the last 200,000 years or so. These cosmic events, in the form of massive outbursts from the center of our galaxy have been the source of countless myths and legends from around the planet concerning global catastrophe and the rebuilding process that has taken literally thousands of year to recover from. Loads of animal species were totally wiped out, and it's incredibly fortunate that at least some people survived.Cosmic rays and dust from the center of the galaxy swept through or solar system on many occasions. These events created both ice ages and periods of intense heat. Then came the end of the most recent ice ages, and it happened fast. When the great ice sheets melted at the end of the last ice age, there were occasionally huge waves of icy water that rolled down off the glaciers, truly flattening everything it their path and washing it out to the deep ocean or dumping it rudely in heaps here and there. Humanity survived in mostly isolated pockets of small populations. Many had to hide in caves, away from the scorched earth or screaming winds If there had been an advanced civilization anywhere on earth at that time, ( and I believe there certainly was ) it would not have survived except in memory. Mega-tsunamis rolled across the atlantic and pacific oceans, depositing piles of debris, bones, everything, far from it's source. Mammoths got frozen with food in their mouths. Some of these waves went right into the mediterranean sea, sweeping inland and devastating entire regions. Sea levels rose dramatically. Even now, on Google Earth, you can see huge \\"continental shelves\\" that long ago were the coastlines. Off the west coast of India they have found huge cities under hundreds of feet of water. and these waves also carried fine silt, which covered everything. Is it any wonder we can't find the \\"evidence\\" of past civilizations, even though the mythology is absolutely clear.. we are not the first great civilization on the planet. Let's hope we're not the last.I highly recommend this book, definitely, but please also see and read... Graham Hancock, Joseph Farrell, John Anthony West, John Major Jenkins, Zacharia Sitchin, Walter Cruttenden, and many others who do this type of extraordinary research. I know I'm not alone in my earnest desire for answers to some of the most profound questions about humanity, our planet, and our cosmos. Answers come from an interdisciplinary approach that looks at all sides of the issues, and this is what Mr. Lavioltte does in this and his other books."},{"Title":"Earth Under Fire: Humanity's Survival of the Ice Age","review":"This is a reworking and rehashing of the catastrophe evidence collected by previous writers such as Donnelly, Velikovsky, Allen and Delair, etc, but lacking in the logic and sound scholarship of these tomes.The idea of a code hidden behind astological symbols is preposterous.Furthermore, although the author is correct in claiming a catastrophic end to the Pleistocene, the cause he identifies is unconvincing. Traditions from throughout the globe make it quite clear that a comet or comet-like body gave the earth a near miss and triggered the calamity. Again, the author's acceptance of the conventional date of ten to fifteenth thousand years ago for the end of the Pleistocene is at fault.

I flatter myself this purchase falls in that category.Paul A. LaViolette, Ph.D, is without a doubt a very bright fellow. If \\"Earth Under Fire\\" is intended as a parody of junk science, it most certainly attains the author's lofty goal, in spades. Seldom have I had the pleasure of reading such fulsome, literate, and totally meaningless gibberish as is contained in this beautifully illustrated tome.The sardonic premise is that a combination of Tarot cards and a tortured deconstruction of astrology provide the keys to all the secrets of advanced physics and theories of the universe.As one might suspect, Dr. LaViolette gives his satiric theories a millenarian cast: we are doomed, doomed, I say, by a civilization-ending event of cosmic proportions to which I (Dr. LaViolette) alone have the key.The event alluded to, long story short, is a kind of death ray emanating from the center of our galaxy that's going to make us all mighty sorry we were ever born.I'm a fan of millenarian schemas, still unsure of which doomsday scenario I most prefer: earthquakes, super-volcanoes, catastrophic floods, strikes by huge meteors, global pandemics, fiery global warming, alien invasions, cockroach mutations, or instant glaciers that render North America an instant massive ice cube. The death ray idea is one I'm going to add to the list.Should you buy this book? If you're a fan of this sort of thing and enjoy obsessing over the irreducibly inane, you will heart this book.

It's a tour de force that leaves one speechless. I had already read LaViolette's Genesis of the Cosmos -- which in my view was the biggest breakthrough in Egyptology since Champollion deciphered the Rosetta stone. In it LaViolette essentially decoded the ancient Egyptian religion. He showed that it was anything but a primitive pagan cult. It was rather a kind of time capsule: based on a physics so advanced that it was not until the 1970s that our modern science progressed enough to decipher it. The implication of course is that a remote culture with an advanced physics had to be a high civilization. OK. So what happened to it?The author answers the question in Earth Under FIre. Understand, LaViolette didn't crank out this book in a year or even two. He's been working on this superwave theory for probably 30+ years. In a nutshell he's proposing that the galactic center periodically goes into a violent phase and releases vast amounts of cosmic radiation. Which spreads out across the galaxy triggering supernovae events and God only knows what all else. When the superwave reaches our solar system it encounters our sun's dust/gas nebular cloud which is far out beyond Pluto -- and it pushes lots of dust into our solar system. With results that are catastrophic for our planet.The author does a fine job presenting his case. He has gathered reams of evidence -- and while I personally take issue with several points these are peripheral to his main argument. Indeed, I was tremendously impressed with the author's science acumen, his skill as a communicator, his eloquence in marshaling the evidence, and with the argument itself. I came away convinced. And it made me damn angry to learn that the bureaucrats have treated LaViolette so shabbily. He is doing important work and deserves to be fully funded.One last point to show how all of this relates to your life: If you know your physics you will know that high energy photons, i.e. cosmic rays, behave like particles. They have mass and momentum. Which is another reason why these superwaves are so dangerous. There's a real possibility they are preceded by a horrific gravity wave. What's the relevance? It seems we had a minor event -- a gamma burst -- from the galactic center that arrived 44 hours after the Dec 2004 tsunami that leveled Sumatra and the Indian basin, killing 250,000+ people. Well, the quake that caused it may well have been triggered by the gravity wave that preceded the burst.Enuf said. Brother, this is heavy medicine."},{"Title":"Earth Under Fire: Humanity's Survival of the Ice Age","review":"In recent years, catastrophism has become somewhat more respectable in scientific circles, but marginalization of scientists avowing this theory is still happening. Paul LaViolette, who holds degrees in physics and systems science, has his own story to tell about bias in supposedly objective science.Admittedly, he started out with a distinct handicap by basing his astronomical investigations on a decryption of the zodiac, as transmitted through traditional lore. According to him, the ancients bequeathed to us knowledge of an astronomical disaster that occurred toward the end of the last ice age: a massive explosion at the core of our galaxy, which caused a superwave of subatomic particles and rays that upon entering our solar system pushed huge amounts of debris toward the Sun leading to a significant decrease of sunlight.He is of course not alone in postulating such a catastrophy some 15,000 years ago, but his explanation of the event is quite unique. Using mythology, star lore, astronomy, astrophysics, geology, archaeology, La Violette has succeeded in painting a colorful and fascinating picture of what he believes happened just before the emergence of the early civilizations. Clearly, something extraordinary happened and, if LaViolette is correct, it could happen again. It makes sense to generously support further research.This work is best read in conjunction with Richard Firestone et al.'s The Cycle of Cosmic Catastrophes, also published by Bear & Co.Copyright 2006 by Georg Feuerstein.

As the book says on page 50 \\"Some astronomers believe that these outbursts are part of an ongoing process in which matter and energy come into physical manifestation at galactic centers.\\" LaViolette's theory of subquantum kinetics is expanded on in his book \\"Genesis of the Cosmos.\\"The third main premise is that when this explosive event happens, a spherical shell of dust and radiation radiates outward from the black hole. These \\"galactic superwaves\\" are always expanding outwards from the center; a galaxy like ours probably has two or three cruising along right now like ripples on the water of a pond after something falls in, except these are expanding in three dimensions and are much more energetic. The intense superwaves probably occur every 12,900 years, which is half the 25,800 year cycle of the precession of the Earth's axis. There may be a link between precession and galactic superwaves. When the combination of an electromagnetic pulse, a gravity wave, radiation, and dust enter a star system, the effects on stars and planets are intense.*(Additional evidence of this is the supernova event horizon. Which basically means that when we analyze most supernova, and consider when we saw them from Earth, and subtract their distance in light years from that date, and again subtract their distance from the galactic center, we reach approximately the same date every time - and that is when a superwave started. They trigger intense reactions in stars on the edge of instability, and lesser reactions in stable stars.)The fourth main premise of the book is that these superwave events have happened to our planet and our sun countless times before, and that the last one or more events have been recorded and at least partially understood as agents of destruction. The galactic center would light up like a big blue star, bright enough to be visible even in daytime, and could have led to names like the Blue Star Kachina of the Hopi or the Eye of Ra in Egypt. Civilizations are devastated, climate changes, magnetic poles shift, a crustal displacement or rotational pole shift may also occur, and many species die off, (probably including Neanderthal Man one precessional cycle, or two superwaves back.) Myths are created to explain all the cosmic and terrestrial phenomena observed, often as a wandering or wounded sun god, and as battles among gods who cast lightning bolts and bring down floods.As an author on related topics myself (prophecy, mythology, pole shifts) I found LaViolette's books fascinating. His superwave theory seems to have a lot of evidence backing it and in all probability such galactic superwaves are the trigger mechanism for pole shifts. He details an impressive collection of world mythology describing what may be superwave events and their aftermath.LaViolette also (over)analyzes the zodiac. I must agree that only two zodiac signs point at anything; and that both the stinger of Scorpio and the arrow of Sagittarius both point at the same spot in the sky - the black hole at the center of the galaxy. I believe this does indicate that ancient peoples knew its location many, many thousands of years ago, and this either indicates it was very visible to our ancestors, or that they had science and technology equal to at least our late twentieth century levels in order to detect its location.But it is not so clear to me that the rest of the zodiac carries information on a dozen scientific processes which lead to creation, nor that they describe his theory of subquantum kinetics, whereby all 3D matter is created from fluctuations in the building blocks of matter that exist in a 4D plane of ether, or that the slight difference in the cosmic microwave temperature gradient, or the background temperature of the universe (a fraction of a degree more in one direction compared to the other, both near absolute zero) are all encoded in the zodiac.Overall this is a great book, but the author does have a lot of theories, many of which seem a lot less credible than the main galactic superwave theory."},{"Title":"Earth Under Fire: Humanity's Survival of the Ice Age","review":"LaViolette starts discussing the Great Sphynx, astrology, and tarot, and tries to show that the people who created the Sphynx, the zodiac, and the tarot recorded in them the effects of interstellar dust-storms and solar flares caused by explosions at the galactic core, 12,000, 18,000, and 58,000 years ago. Whew!Well, the earliest known date for any Tarot cards is about 1415.The Great Sphynx of Giza is conventionally dated to the 26th Century BCE. However, based on evidence of water erosion, American geologist Robert M. Schoch has theorized that the structure dates from the 5th to 6th Millenium BCE.The divison of the ecliptic into 12 zodiacal \\"signs\\" of 30-degrees originated in Babylonia between 1,000 and 700 BCE. Asterisms (selections of stars to form a \\"figure\\") near the ecliptic were named. The author heavily references the Dendera zodiac, inscribed on the ceiling of an Egyptian structure about 50 BCE, but also uses zodiac images from much later star-charts to illustrate the zodiac.The chronology makes it completely impossible to hold that the same unnamed people designed all three, sphynx, zodiac, and tarot. The discussion of the zodiac makes much of stellar alignments that point to the Galactic Center, and to others that point directly away from it, and others that point to spots on the ecliptic one radian away from it. However, one could select sets of stars that point to anything at all. La Violette, in his writing, constantly seems to imply that the asterisms that form zodiac figures were designed; that is, that the stars were placed in specific points, rather than stars in specific places being observed, and imaginative figures created to use those fixed points.The text shifts to discussion of astrophysics, and the \\"Galactic Superwave\\" theory; but it goes back to an eclectic grab-bag of mythologies and traditions from around the world, attempting to show that they are composed of eye-witness accounts of interstellar - and terrestrial - catastrophes that occurred up to 58,000 years ago. The anachronisms pile higher and higher - at one point, the Younger Edda is supposed to be describing events 10,000 years earlier than those described in the Elder Edda.I'd like to see something on the \\"Galactic Superwave\\" theory that stuck to astrophysics. It's an intriguing hypothesis, and there might be something in it. I can't really tell from this book.\\"Earth Under Fire\\" is mostly an eclectic and anachronous mish-mash of mythic fragments.At least Velikovsky generated a coherent (albeit disputed) chronology to allow his epic and scriptural sources to be eyewitnesses of the same events 5 millennia ago, and posited an explanation for why succeeding civilization forgot the events. La Violette has cosmic catastrophes secretly remembered by a hidden few for 58,000 years, but forgotten in the last millennia or so with no explanation.Scotch Verdict: Not Proven."},{"Title":"Earth Under Fire: Humanity's Survival of the Ice Age","review":"LaViolette holds degrees in physics and systems science and is president of the Starburst Foundation, a scientific research organization based on his stunning theories about the cosmos. For a number of years he was praised by conventional scientists for his brilliance and creativity. Now he is viewed by these scientists with some suspicion.LaViolette's papers still appear in mainstream science journals. But he makes the establishment nervous, because he believes the Big Bang Theory is obsolete, and because he is convinced that the earth has been - and will continue to be -- slammed periodically by cosmic-ray \\"superwaves\\" from the core of our galaxy, the Milky Way.These superwaves, according to the theory, are generated by periodic galactic core explosions. They push vast quantities of cosmic dust to the far reaches of the galaxy's disc. The explosions are said to occur about every ten thousand years. The last one, according to LaViolette, heated up the sun and brought on a period of global warming that ended the last Ice Age. That cosmic event occurred about twelve thousand years ago, and lasted \\"anywhere from several hundred to several thousand years.\\" He suggests that we may be overdue for another one.LaViolette was the first to discover high concentrations of cosmic dust in polar ice cores dating back to the Ice Age. This discovery has not gone unchallenged; some opponents have claimed the ice samples were somehow contaminated - but no one has been able to prove it.\\"Earth Under Fire\\" argues that human memories of the last galactic superwave and the cataclysms it wrought are encoded in a wealth of ancient legends and myths, including those of the ancient Egyptians, Sumerians, Greeks, Hindus and even Native American peoples like the Mayans and Aztecs.LaViolette has been developing this hypothesis since the 1970s, and has marshaled an impression array of information to support it. He was first drawn to this notion by the celestial zodiac, when he discovered that the arrow of Sagittarius and the stinging tail of Scorpio were both pointing toward the center or core of the Milky Way. Of course, when we deal with myths and legends, we are in the realm of metaphor and imagination. It's pretty unstable territory.On a scientific level, LaViolette paints a fascinating picture of the cosmos, once the reader has mastered his often-complex fundamentals. Basic to his cosmology is a physics theory he calls subquantum kinetics, which still has far to go in winning support from the scientific establishment. Subquantum kinetics provides the justification for the galactic core explosions. He sees these eruptions not as evidence of black holes, as some Big Bang theorists would assume, but as examples of the continuous creation of matter and energy, a hypothesis advanced years ago by astronomers supporting the Steady State theory of the universe, such as Sir James Jeans and Sir Fred Hoyle.To understand where LaViolette is going with this book, it helps to read his earlier work, \\"Beyond the Big Bang: Ancient Myth and the Science of Continuous Creation\\" (1995). A concept explained in that book, etherons, furnishes the underpinning for the constant creation of energy and matter in the galactic center of each galaxy. LaViolette describes etherons as extremely small subatomic particles that constitute the \\"transmuting ether\\" permeating the universe. Etherons, which have neither mass nor charge, can change from one state to another in \\"chemical-like\\" reactions, and in fact are responsible for the creation of matter and energy.Readers may recall that the \\"ether\\" is an ancient concept that goes back beyond Aristotle. The concept of a pervading substance in the universe has been largely rejected by modern science, but it can't totally be ruled out, as LaViolette argues. His etherons, however, have a problem that this reviewer hasn't been able to resolve.LaViolette says that because etherons have no mass or charge, they cannot be measured or even detected, and \\"thus we cannot know for sure the true nature of etherons\\" (Beyond the Big Bang, p. 61). If that's so, then we have to take the very existence of etherons - and the entire theory of subquantum kinetics -- on faith. That doesn't leave us much to be certain about.[A version of this review appeared in Mysteries Magazine in 2007.]"},{"Title":"Earth Under Fire: Humanity's Survival of the Ice Age","review":"The central thesis of this book is that the nucleus of our galaxy, the Milky Way, is physically active and from time to time gives rise to highly energetic cosmic ray waves. Given this premise (a scientific hunch - really) the author marshals arguments from a variety of fields to support this thesis. The view is synthetic, i.e. a valiant attempt has been made to use the results of discoveries in multiple specialized areas of science and human knowledge to create a coherent picture of Earth's global history over the last 30 thousand years.There are 3 sorts of arguments that he discusses; broadly speaking: astronomical, geophysical, and cultural. His astrophysical arguments consist of demonstrating the plausibility of the existence, in his terminology, of a \\"super-wave\\" (of cosmic rays) based on recent discoveries that indicate QUASARs to be galaxies with highly energetic and active nuclei, on the observational radiation patterns of super-nova remnants, etc.Additionally, he discusses certain features of the solar systems that could best be explained by a super-wave theory.His terrestrial arguments are based on empirical evidence from geophysical research that bring in several science together: Oceanography, Glaciology, Climatology, Paleontology, Zoology, and so on. These arguments, in my opinion, form the strongest section of the book since they are firmly tied to an interpretation of existing data. Here he discusses the global glacial flooding that took place about 13,000 years ago and ties that to anomalies in tin and iridium isotope deposits that have to have had an extra-terrestrial origins; which, in turn, could best be explained by the super-wave ejected from the galactic nucleus.His cultural arguments are based on interpretation of human cultural artifacts of myth and legend. This is by far the weakest part of the book. As the author himself notes, \\" To draw inferences from ancient myths about past astronomical events is indeed a risky business...\\". I think the author should heed his own observation in this case! I am specially doubtful of his analysis of the astrology as a coded science of creation of the ancient people - on the same par with our modern sciences. I do not think he has succeeded in making a case for the validity of his interpretation - in this book as well as in his other books.I think the author has succeeded in establishing a coherent explanation of Earth's past geophysical history. I find his arguments based on astronomical and geophysical data and observations persuasive. I think his hypothesis is definitely falsifiable and indeed there are many predictions that he has made that can be tested with the proper expenditure of funds for carrying out those observations and researches (more ice core samples, more satellite observations, larger astronomical observations in optical, radio and Gamma-ray regimes).I think what detracts from this book and its remarkable scientific synthesis, ironically, are the parts that seems to be very dear to the author: sub-quantum kinetic physics, Astrology as Ancient Science of Creation, etc. The author's achievement in exploring what a synthetic point of view is capable of achieving is marred by his insistence on explaining the mechanisms of the galactic super-wave as well. (There already are matter-creation theories out there; see for example the works of Hoyle and Narlikar on the Quasi-Steady State Cosmology).I think it will be a good idea for the author to drastically revise this book in future printings. I suggest a book that concentrates on the developing the synthetic point of view (true Natural Philosophy) solely on basis of the scientific data. The story that the author tells in the present book is one of scientific detective work. He could have reached a larger audience by having a two-track book; track one at the level of a science popularize and track 2 at the level of a review article for a journal such as Rev. Mod. Phys. Or Ann. Rev. Astro. The author claims that he was led to the idea of the super-wave through his understanding of the ancient cipher that is the zodiac. Kepler \`s mystical leanings and his knowledge of the relationship among the Platonic solids led him to discover his laws. But once the Kepler's Laws were formulated the world moved on and we had Newton and others.Overall, the book is worth reading for the synthesis that it effects. One has to discard the astrology, mythic part; those parts are not germane to the book.[...]"},{"Title":"Earth Under Fire: Humanity's Survival of the Ice Age","review":"Many people besides the Christians, Jews and Moslems have experienced the same recurrent nightmare ... the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Maya, the Buddhists, the Hopi, the Aborigines, the Fulani, the Hindus ... The beauty is that what we see as our tragic end allows life to begin again. I believe Dr. Paul LaViolette has found some of the main forces behind the Darkness that leads to Light.In a word, he would probably call it \\"The Superwave.\\" I'm a grandfather, and I call it Teenagers - the idea that our Galaxy is probably a Seyfert Galaxy (immature and given to occasional rants) ... and our Sun may be a T Tauri star (immature and given to occasional rants). LaViolette's theory is that the Galaxy and the Sun seem to have a relationship in which the Galaxy periodically overpowers our solar system neighborhood (and lots of other stars) each 26,000 years or so. A giant cosmic duststorm comes in past our heliopause barrier ... possibly blasted in while the Sun is reversing polarity, or blasted in by supernova, or blasted in by gamma ray burst. The mechanism isn't as important as knowing that there are very definite climatic cycles; and C14, iridium, tin, nickel and beryllium-10 levels that show up in ice cores and the geologic record.I am still terribly interested in the phenomenon. It seems that we are due for this Superwave that Zoroaster called the Renovation and Aristotle called the Greatest Year. One can call it the season of Kali Yuga. Some call it the Second Coming. It is the Fifth Sun of the Maya and the 10th Age of the Erythraean Sibyl. It is the season of our rebirth!One day, the Teenagers will grow up and stop their temper tantrums.

It has been written so even the mother & housewife looking for truth, knowledge, enlightenment & hidden history of science could understand!"},{"Title":"Earth Under Fire: Humanity's Survival of the Ice Age","review":"I stumbled upon this book while doing my own research about past catastrophes in Earth's history for my bookMayan Calendar Prophecies: The Complete Collection of 2012 Predictions and Prophecies. I kept finding evidence of multiple catastrophes (super solar flares, comet impact events,etc) all happening simultaneously which seemed to defy logic. Over and over again the ancient myths I was researching noted the appearance of a new star in the sky followed by major solar storms and impact events. How could so many catastrophes happen simultaneously...the odds seemed against such a thing UNLESS there was some underlying cause behind them all. Earth Under Fire provided the answer: eruptions from the center of our galaxy occasionally emit massive vollies of cosmic rays, which the author termed Galactic Superwaves, and these vaporized comets in the Oort Cloud surrounding our solar system, home to long period comets. This Superwave would push this debris into the inner solar system where it would fall onto the sun causing it to enter a T-Tauri like active phase spitting off coronal mass ejections and super solar flares. This cometary debris would also crash into the earth. The galactic core explosion would appear to people on earth as the sudden appearance of a bright blue star between the constellations Scorpio and Sagittarius where our galactic center is located. This finally explained all the evidence I was finding not only in ancient myths but also in ice core data, etc.Interestingly, the author noted that one such minor superwave happened in 3300 BC and this was likely the origin of the Mayan calendar start date in 3114 BC. Apparently the author was not aware that the Maya actually recorded a massive catastrophe happening on Earth in 3300 BC! This \\"myth\\" was recorded inside Temple XIX at Palenque. I decoded this myth along with several similar myths from around the world in my booksMayan Calendar Prophecies: The Complete Collection of 2012 Predictions and Prophecies|Mayan Calendar Prophecies| Part 3: Cycle of Cosmic Catastrophes&Mayan Calendar Prophecies| Part 4: The 2012 Prophecy. The myth records the appearance of a new star followed eleven years later by a super solar flare, comet fragmentation event, and oceanic impact events that led to multiple mega-tsunamis that inundated Earth's coastlines.Curiously, the Maya noted that a green sky serpent (comet) they named Kukulkan/Quetzalcoatl acted as a herald or messenger of such events. One green comet, Comet Machholz, actually appeared in 2004 and was found to have a 12,500 year orbit and would last have appeared in 10,500 BC around the time of the last major superwave event. Interestingly, it became naked eye visible around the time of the Indonesian tsunami which the author of Earth Under Fire says was caused by a gravity wave that preceded another superwave that hit earth at the same time as the earthquake. I discussed this in my bookMayan Calendar Prophecies: The Complete Collection of 2012 Predictions and Prophecies|Mayan Calendar Prophecies| Part 2: 2012 The Return of Kukulkan.Overall I think Earth Under Fire has finally created a scientific theory that appears to explain ALL the data, both physical and cultural/mythological, that records a cycle of catastrophes on our planet.

This expansion of their business mirrored the changes that took place as the mega grocery store phased out the local family grocer. This book is slightly different from the usual company sponsored recapitulation as there is some dirty linen exposed on occasion.

First it is the story of a young girl, an only child born in 1920, growing up with middle-class parents, but in a fashion which combined the usual practices and mores of the time with the unusual. As she was crippled (her word) at the age of three, her mother insisted on bringing her up herself rather than delivering her to a nanny, and, due in part to her disabilities, and the long periods of treatment made necessary, she had little formal education. However, she discovered books at an early age, initially through being read to, and was a consummate observer of both people and landscape, particularly on a small scale - the play of light on a dagger blade, the petals of a flower. Second, it is story of the development of a writer, up to the time her first book was accepted for publication (what a pity she stopped there - I wanted her to go on!) Third, for me as the child of Service parents (father in the RAF) it is the best representation I have ever seen of the life of the Service child. Rosemary's father was a naval officer, and she, like me, absorbed unconsciously the traditional values and mores of the British Armed Services while moving every two or three years according to her father's postings. These values, which have a timelessness about them, in particular the reciprocal loyalties of officer to man and man to officer, the duty of an officer towards his men, come through very clearly in all her fiction. As with all her books, the descriptions are superb (she trained as a miniature painter. The fourth element, I suppose, relates to the disability and her acceptance of it, in an atmosphere very different from that of today. She says that her mother in particular sought as far as possible to bring her up as a normal child, and so she never really thought of herself as crippled, even though in practical terms she was quite badly disabled. I was lucky enough to correspond with her, and to meet her on one occasion before she died, and I was quite surprised to see how disabled she actually was - she was a person who was incredibly alive."},{"Title":"Blue remembered hills: A recollection","review":"Five stars aren't enough for this wonderful book.

I have reviewed many other books and have yet to find one to use in place of Conceptual Blockbusting."},{"Title":"Conceptual Blockbusting, a Guide to Better Ideas","review":"Perhaps it was the high recommendation for this book that left me a little disappointed. I have seen this book recommended in a number of software developer books (most notably perhaps, Code Complete 2E). The author discusses possible obstacles (mental, cultural, etc.) to creativity, some of the psychology behind creativity, and some 'vehicles' to greater creativity. All in all probably very worth reading, but the reading is dry, with the occasional exercise breaking the monotony slightly. I highly recommend this book, until I can find a book that says the same thing in 25% of the space, which I think is possible."},{"Title":"Conceptual Blockbusting, a Guide to Better Ideas","review":"Perhaps more for the layman than the professional scholar, this book can help you to see why you keep coming up short in finding answers to the recurrent problems that plague you. I have bought at least ten copies since it's first publication because when I loan it out, I seldom get it back."},{"Title":"Conceptual Blockbusting, a Guide to Better Ideas","review":"This book approaches from a different prespective the question of how a person or an organization can become more creative. Most creativity books give you techniques that will trigger creative ideas - brainstorming, picture prompts, role playing. These are all good techniques, but Adams addresses creativity by answering the question: What are the factors (conceptual blocks) that keep us from being creative in the first place? Knowing these factors - cultural or professional bias, fear of looking silly - for example, allows us to move beyond them. To my mind, this knowledge and the use of creativity techniques are a one-two punch that gets you creative results. The book does have its share of creativity techniques, but the most important knowledge to walk away with is the knowledge of those things that hinder our creativity. Edward de Bono, another creativity guru, also explores on the reasons why people's creativity is stifled, but his approach is somewhat narrower, focusing more on the default mechanism of the mind that tends to focus on pattern recognition and therefore on pursuing the routine rather than the different (seeMechanism of MindandLateral Thinking: Creativity Step by Step (Perennial Library). Adams' book, in contrast, is more comprehensive in dealing with the various conceptual blocks. If you want to be more creative, I highly recommend this book as a starting point or as a close companion to other books that have creativity techniques and exercises."},{"Title":"Conceptual Blockbusting, a Guide to Better Ideas","review":"This book is great for a lot of different industries. I am in the software industry. James Adams has some great ideas on creating great ideas. This is a book that makes the phrase \\"think outside of the box\\" make sense and puts some content to the cliche. This book is a very good book for inventors or anyone in the creative frame of mind. We all have some values we hold and it is the ability to re-evaluate these values to create that breaks us out of our molds. In other words, our perspective on the world can actually inhibit or assist us with creativity. Mr. Adams helps to put these values in a container to assess what is helpful and which are not. I keep a copy of this book for occasional reference."},{"Title":"Conceptual Blockbusting, a Guide to Better Ideas","review":"This is mostly a list of why people can't create.

For the rest of us who are by nature creative and are looking for ways to expand our self expression and method of thinking this book is a few steps back on that road. Maybe it was because it was assigned to me in a design class, but I found the exercises and commentary very 'right-angled' and redundant."},{"Title":"Conceptual Blockbusting, a Guide to Better Ideas","review":"According to my experiences and learnings of many expressions in books, my individual opinion is, that those expressions are depending very closely on what has been harnessed in their 'brain neurons' while that makes ones peception of what has been unfolded by the author's intelectual and perceptual recorded facts of experiences. The sensitivity of receiving information through 'objective' and 'subjective' dimensions are obviously supported when persons don't have negative stress that could interfere in the 'inner management of thoughts'. I'm a lecturer for the Indonesian territory of 'Psychorientology', since 20 years, named popular 'The Silva Mind Control Method'. I'm very convinced about what has been unfolded through his coursework 'Basic Lecture Series' and the 'Ultra Mind ESP'. It's a system that indeed changes behaviour and attitudes into high morality and ethics, as results of scientific research of nearly 56 years, that now a days are declining very fast in this world because of 'Stress' as the main reason which could ampel be solved by the lack of 'Mind Control'. If every human being, naturally uses the right and left brain hemispheres at a balanced way, the world would be a planit of peace and harmony throughout all the phases of human evolution. It's worse to try and not to critisize without having a thorough inside on what the exact meaning and results are of a certain system that has been developed through scientific research without any 'modifications' of other systems. This is my contribution of thoughts coming from a 'subconscious management'. Regards and Success."},{"Title":"Conceptual Blockbusting, a Guide to Better Ideas","review":"I found this book excellent for expanding one's intellectual arsenal of problem-solving skills. As the author himself admits, no single person will benefit from all the techniques described in this book, since every person has a unique way of thinking. Nevertheless, becoming familiar with the existing techniques will allow you to pick and choose the ones that work for you. Personally, I found many of these techniques to be applicable in every-day situations, in addition to solving scientific problems.As an added bonus, the book includes a list of excellent references to cognitive science and psychology material for the interested reader.The only minor complaint I had was that the material could be a bit better organized. Sometimes it reads more like an enumeration of techniques rather than a coherent text."},{"Title":"Conceptual Blockbusting, a Guide to Better Ideas","review":"If you're interested in learning about problems people encounter that keep them from being as creative as they might be, this book is for you. If you are looking for ways to overcome these problems and to be more creative yourself, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Conceptual Blockbusting, a Guide to Better Ideas","review":"The ideas in this book apply to creating art, executing science experiments, exploring history, contemplating religion, developing hardware, writing software, reading books, crafting emails -- anything that requires the use of the brain.We know that training is required to be good at all sorts of things: games, sports, theology, plumbing, technology, languages, and even watching and analyzing movies. Thinking itself is also a skill -- it is a skill that requires training. This book is a beginner's grammar for that skill.With a professor from Stanford (James Adams) leading the way, this book is good for the student of thinking. For the humans who are done thinking, or who have never started, this book will be reviewed as poor or useless. As for the rest of us, this is fantastic stuff.One application I derive from this short text is something that might resonate with the internet community. Recall any of the internet conversations/debates you have had/read where the discussion tanked into non-creative attacks. Usually someone with a new idea presents the idea, then the non-creative sharks move in and chew up everyone in the water. Such sharks are conceptually blocked from having their own creativity (well, not always but many times). And if we have been the shark, or have been chomped by a few, there is a benefit in the analysis in this book -- if nothing else, it brings awareness to what it means to attack creativity.The range of discourse, the field of applicability and the space of usefulness of this book is large; it applies to anyone who has to use the brain. Ironically, it sheds light on the world that has been critiqued by the Dilbert cartoons. Scott Adams could be brother to James, for the comic strip is an exploration of creativity road-blocks. And, like many of the pointed haired bosses, those who most need this book may never benefit from it (even if they read it)."},{"Title":"Conceptual Blockbusting, a Guide to Better Ideas","review":"I read this book back in 1974 as a ne'r-do-well accounting clerk dreaming of life as a scientist. Soon after, I returned to school for a B.S., and have now recently retired from a long career as a software engineer. The \\"conceptual blockbusting\\" ideas and mindset that I received from this book have stuck with me throughout, and have helped in two ways. It gave me creative resources that my coworkers did not have, and it gave me the insight to identify the human techniques that I used to solve the software problem at hand, and then incorporate them in my, now simplified, software solution. Interestingly, I never saw another programmer do this, and I think it accounts for the unnecessarily complex and unintuitive heuristic software solutions that we are forced to use today.I am now engaged in research identifying and applying humanity's problem solving abilities to machine intelligence, i.e., AI. Interestingly, while the techniques in this book enhance my personal, human creative skills, they are not very applicable to AI, and probably won't be until our thinking machines exhibit near human control over their own thinking. This book trains us to be humanly creative, in abilities that distinguish us from machines. This book is about what makes us human, at least for the time being."},{"Title":"Conceptual Blockbusting, a Guide to Better Ideas","review":"I wish I had read this book 20 years ago!

The majority of its bulk is taken up describing various blocks people have which inhibit creativity -- cultural, societal, emotional, and so on. The author never describes how one can work past these blocks. Later on he points out that people have five senses and we should try to use all five of them when solving problems. All in all hardly groundbreaking stuff. In the end his message seems to be: you have to exercise your imagination if you want to be more creative but he doesn't include enough exercises to do that with this book.

L. Styan has a master's eye for nuance. He works with the text, envisions the text, draws on his extensive experience with Shakespeare's plays on stage, on screen, and on paper to create a marvellous, readable, enjoyable document for drama lover and playgoer, student and scholar alike. There's always something to be gleaned from one of his books. This is the latest, I hope not the last. The book consists of articles written over several years, now culled, revised, and brought together to create an overview of performance techniques, stage-to-audience-to-stage communication, and significant details conveyed via dialogue that the scholarly approach to the plays often forgets to consider. ROMEO AND JULIET will never be the same after reading this analysis of the balcony scene. The awareness that we folks of the year 2000 just do not have generally of the intricacies of all Shakespearean women being played by boy actors is explored, and also just what that might convey . . .

Not only does it work well as a period piece, but its portrayal of people, of the body blows dealt by life, and of the way this country doesn't live up to what immigrants think they are going to find is relevant today. I felt the publisher's blurb on the edition I had and some other reviews may have oversimplified or misstated some of the characters. Frank is not some remorseless sociopath who walks in to rob, rape and pillage. Frank is a complex person who for much of the book is caught in a vicious circle of doing wrong, experiencing tremendous pain of conscience, determining to make right what he has done, getting into difficulties, and doing wrong again to get out of a jam. At one point, he is described as a man of morality, and there is hope for him. He's not a thug; that would be Ward, the police officer's son who returns to the neighborhood to commit crimes. Helen takes a long time to realize that she isn't entirely blameless in her involvement with Frank. Whether a rape takes place is somewhat ambiguous, but Helen believes this is what happened. Helen is caught in the trap of waiting for nothing, in her own words. Frank looks better and better given the other choices she has. Morris, Helen's father, looks at his mom and pop grocery store as a prison. Morris is a victim, yet if he had made a little effort to help himself, things may have turned out better for him. He is a terrible businessman, he makes foolish decisions about his health, and he is taken advantage of by everyone. The whole family is caught in a trap by the failing store and grinding poverty that has them in a downward spiral. Morris and Ida are Russian Jews who came to America with the hope of finding something better. It appears the only thing that is better is the absence of pogroms. The people in this book are Italians, Germans, Poles, Norwegians. Today the immigrants come from different countries, but I'm willing to bet that quite a few have the same experience in this country that Morris's family did. Today it may even be worse. Aside from the characters, the author gives a wonderful description of a 1950s Brooklyn neighborhood. The reader can picture everything in such detail it's like watching a DVD in one's head. A book like this will always hold up, and I'm anxious to read more of the author's work. Finally, this novel made TIME magazine's Top 100 novels last year, which is why I picked it up."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"The word \\"Assistant\\" includes the letters S.A.I.N.T And, the person who is the assistant herein well reflects Christianity's concepts of sainthood or someone who is \\"born again.\\"A simple ground floor grocery man, Morris Bober, lives in a simple second story flat with his wife, Ida, and beautiful 23-year old daughter, Helen. Business is worsening, and while it falls, he meets Frank Alpine - an Italian goyim.Frank works for peanuts for Morris and manages to raise the business from its ashes. Things begin to look good - but Ida's fears of a goyim living so close to her very Jewish daughter are well deserved.Frank is not a saint by birth. Frank is an orphan who lived an abusive childhood, and he merely wants to be loved. He practically enslaves himself for Morris - partly to be loved and partly for penance. But, whatever his evil ways were, he is almost devoid of the same after meeting Morris. Malamud probably intentionally chose Frank to be Italian - and incorporates what the Roman Catholic Church associates as \\"being born again\\": baptism. Working in the grocery for Morris is Frank's baptism.What makes this book so fascinating is the concept of rebirth after criminality. Really, criminality's born again Christianity became vogue a decade or decades after publication of this novel (1957) with the 1976 book written by Charles Colson of Watergate fame.This insightful work on Christianity becomes even more fascinating when one considers the source - a young Jewish writer who grew up in a delicatessen with an impoverished father who is much like Morris. And, the greatest part of the rebirth arises in the end when Italian Frank - learning about Judaism - converts. He is a born again Jew.The grocery is commonly referred to as a prison which confined Morris and later confines Frank. But, from that prison others benefit. And, most particularly we learn of the goodness of those imprisoned in poverty - something espoused by Saint Francis who is mentioned numerous times in this book.This is a great story. This is a great book with many layers. And, this book could be assigned to religion students as well as the obvious English or literature students."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"If ever there was a verbally-tight book, it is this. Every page is interesting, every word, and there is never a dull page. In true Melamud style, the stories are short but powerful. The superb writing of the plot moves consistently. However, I did get the feeling toward the end that a number of dramatic sequences seemed crammed at the end, and without the minute attention paid to the earlier part of the story.The plot evolves in post-war, a neighborhood in New York among an aging Jewish grocer whose deli/food store business struggles amidst modernism and greedy competition. The main characters, Morris, his stoic wife Ida and a grown daughter Helen live above the store and work long hours to keep it alive. Daughter Helen yearns to have a loving man and an education.Enter Frank Alpine, a young Italian man who after a criminal act upon Morris, and unbeknown to Morris, Frank lands a job in the store to pay his debt. Here, he continuously fends off his demons while attempting to follow a morally correct life and in his command, the store goes through economic and physical changes that fluctuate greatly, not always good or bad. And, as expected, he falls in love with the daughter and their relationship takes turns and twists too.Immediately, Melamud gives us a distinct picture of the desperation the family endures. You can grasp with ease the images and separation of personalities. This is done with precision applied by the finest authors. We get more than we anticipate, when Melamud provides extensive insight into his character descriptions, and most important, to their thoughts. Above that, he provides us with questions and answers we might need to further develop the characters thoughts and actions.After absorption into the story, I still had questions and I'm sure you will too and maybe it takes another read. Overall, the short classic is excellent. ........MzRizz"},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"It's sad to me that Bernard Malamud's novels seem to be falling by the wayside lately. After reading The Assistant recently, I've been reminded of just how excellent Malamud's writing is. In particular, Malamud is excellent in The Assistant, his best novel. This is definitely one of the must-read novels of the twentieth century.The novel centers around the characters affected by Morris Bober's grocery in a poor neighborhood in Brooklyn. The middle-aged Morris has lost his life working in the unsuccessful store. Because of the economic/spiritual struggles caused by the store, each member of the family has been scarred. Morris's wife Ida has become bitter and cynical. His daughter Helen searches longingly for love and laments the failed realization of her dreams. Then, into their lives comes Frank Alpine, a troubled, depressed man who will become the assistant at the store. The four struggle with one another, attempting constantly to overcome their harsh fate and to obtain some sort of fulfillment together.It's a fairly simple story that reads really well, and remarkably quickly, in my opinion. Despite the simplicity of the story, however, meaning, almost archetypal meaning, ebbs at every moment. It's a beautifully conceived and constructed work touching on themes of morality, justice, redemption, and love. It's very much about what it means to be human. The Assistant is definitely one of those novels that serious readers should catch."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"As a teacher of literature for 23 years, I have watched students from age 16 to 80 become fully engaged with The Assistant. After they finish, they feel fulfilled, uplifted, enlightened, and even (God forbid!) more knowledgeable. The main characters -- Morris, a modest Jewish grocery store owner in New York, and Frank, a young Italian hoodlum trying to change into a mensch--steal your heart away. Of course, Malamud is never sentimental. He uses your mind to reach into your heart. It's not just Frank who changes for the better in this book; it's all who read it well."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"It seems impossible, yet somehow Malamud made magic. Here is retold the story of St. Francis of Assisi through the life of a failing Jewish grocer. Allow me to rephrase: the story is not retold, it is taken apart, reapplied and subtly explicated. The life of a Catholic saint applied to the interaction of frustratingly flawed characters leads to a perfect conclusion and examination of, surprisingly, what it means to be Jewish and what it means to be good."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"This is Bernard Malamud's best book. It is written with a kind of understated beauty . The story of Frankie Alpine the assistant who works in the grocery of Morris Bober , and connects himself in suffering with Jewish identity contains the heart of Malamud's 'universalization of his own Jewishness'. The book is a moving story, including the love story between Alpine and the elderly grocer's daughter. Malamud's tender and humane ironic tone informs his warm relation to his characters.One of those rare books which seems to fully make concrete an abstract ideal of human goodness."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"The store of Morris Bober, in twenty-one years, had moved from being a delicatessen to a poor grocery. Bober's wife hoped he would sell the store. Morris had lost many of his customers to a new store in the neighborhood.The harder Morris Bober worked, the less he seemed to have. On the day Bober took in ten dollars he was robbed. The robbers thought he was holding out on them. Afterward he was in bed with a thick bandaged head and his wife tended the store.Frank Alpine appeared in the neighborhood. Frank Alpine worked at Morris's store when Morris was sick. A salesman told Frank that the store was a death tomb and that if he stayed for six months he would be there forever. Storekeepers knew when times were better.With Frank in the store business was better. There were, however, other reasons for the uptick in business and Frank was not all he seemed. He had a history and his motives were mixed. Later the characters underwent various changes of fortune, but Frank's adhesion to Morris's family and enterprise was remarkable.It is not so much the plot, which is serviceable, but the setting of the small failing grocery store that gives the novel its pathos. Furthermore, the means the author uses are strictly realistic touches, culled, it seems, from the facts of his upbringing. Ending on a wave of hope, the novel, at the close, pictures a harmonious world for the characters, briefly. The storytelling is elegant, and the intensity is nearly Russian."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"Morris Bober struggles to keep his independent grocery store open, as new competition drains what little business comes from his run down neighborhood. His troubles are relieved by the arrival of Frank Alpine, a down-and-outer who decides to make good by working for nothing at his store. The blessing of Frank's presence is complicated by his past and by his interest in Morris' daughter, Helen Bober.That would summarize the basic plot of the novel. Yet to say that this is what the book is about would miss most of this book's underlying meaning.To the extent that I can explain it, Bernard Malamud has given Morris some Christ-like qualities. The rest of the characters, in turn, demonstrate some of the responses that people make to the life of Christ.I say \\"to the extent that I can explain it,\\" because I am not a professor, or even a student of theology. I think this is one of those books that would reveal a lot through a second reading, or through the guidance of a professor. My guess is that Frank Alpine, in the context of the New Testament, could be seen as one of the Pharisees. He is always trying to do the right thing -- trying achieve salvation through austere living and devoted work.I feel less certain who Helen represents. I hesitate to speculate here. Nevertheless, I hope that anyone reading this would not take that for a sign that this is not a stimulating novel. I found that the plot compelled me to pick it up. My sense of its meaning, in turn, grew when the book reached its resolution.I suppose many already realize that Bernard Malamud is Jewish. I think that makes the symbolism of this novel even more interesting. Malamud's writing is careful, in the best tradition of realism.I think this book would be incredible for book clubs."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"This book was one of the few I have read that seem to just flow.

I admired the economy of Malamud's writing style, especially since I had to read two very long novels by Saul Bellow for the same class. I thought all the characters in this book were sympathetic: the grocer, the thief/assistant, the daughter, the wife. Each had their own hopes, dreams, fears, desires, all of which crashed against one another in a tiny grocery store in Brooklyn.One thing about this book bothered me: that Malamud had Frank keep repeating the same mistakes over and over, and at times it seemed as if the author didn't know when and where the novel should end. Too many mini climaxes of action aren't as interesting as one major one. I was also bothered by the religious ending: It didn't seem to flow naturally from what came before."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"I read this book in high school.

Seeking out something more, I found this novel, and, after reading several 'stellar' reviews, bought a copy. Well, I felt initially that the opening of the book was very different from the 'voice' of the short story that compelled me to begin with, but chalked it up to being an entirely different genre and storyline. Long story short [no pun], I found myself treading water to keep afloat within this tale of endless woe, self-pity, indifference, greed, envy, and martyrdom...Yes, that is a mouthfull but I wanted to get it all in there for a comprehensive feel.It astounds me that this novel is spoken of with such praise for being so heartfelt and 'real'. Gritty is one thing, perennial misery, longing and regret is something else. After a while I'll tellya, I got to feeling a bit like a voyeur with a front row seat of characters' thoughts and action s I'd just as soon not know, given the stifling dreariness of it all. And please know that I appreciate a story with all its edginess and mood and needn't be walked through the 'yellow brick road' experience [ie: read A Gesture Life by Chang-Rae Lee--a story that takes you many places that you might not want to go but it is necessary to the whole..] But The Assistant seems to be on a nightmarish wheel that left me glad/grateful/relieved to get off. Even for a vintage urban tale this seems too far flung in one direction, leaving little in the way of balance from a reader perspective.Have never read a book that left me feeling that 'dismal' is underrated...until now."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"Halfway through &quot;The Assistant&quot; I felt confident enough to make a prediction about its ending. The prediction turned out to be only partly correct, but that is beyond the point. That prediction is at all possible is a sure indication that the author failed to engage me as a reader. Once the prediction is made the book is trapped: if it comes true, then the book is predictable; if it doesn't, then one has the full right to complain about contrived plot twists.Why did I feel confident enough to guess the ending? Because the story is painfully obvious. The story - and the outcome - are evident immediately after the first few pages. A struggling Jewish grocer is robbed, but one of the robbers has a conscience and clandestinely comes back to the store to work off the damage. We aren't told this in these exact words until page fifty or so, but it's obvious as soon as we see the character of Frank Alpine. Here is a character that is engaged in Deep Moral Struggle. Since this is a predictable book, all that is necessary to find out the remainder of the plot is to ask a few questions: Will Frank gather enough self-control to become a decent person (Y/N)? Will the store do better with him around (Y/N)? Will he fall in love with the grocer's daughter (Y/N)? And so on, and so forth. It was with a sinking heart that I guessed the beginnng and the ending, and then beheld the two hundred pages in between. What else could possibly happen? Read on.In those two hundren-odd pages, the book turns into the absolutely sappiest melodrama ever written. To be sure, &quot;The Assistant&quot; lacks a main conflict. Yes, the store is a shambles; yes, these people have been slaving away for nothing; yes, they live in poverty; yes, they're Jews. Those themes almost never surface. Instead, Malamud fills space with the most contrived, cliche mini-conflicts imaginable. I'll leave it up to you to find out what they are, but each of those conflicts is written like it is the end of the world. Of course, it can't be, since there's still 2/3 of the book to go, but the characters gnash and lament like there's no tomorrow anyway. Malamud frantically stitches viewpoint characters, often three times in a single page, to illustrate their grief from all perspectives. Rule #1: the author can only cry &quot;wolf&quot; so many times before it loses punch. It took us four &quot;Scream&quot; movies to get this down. Of course, Malamud predates &quot;Scream&quot;. The book reminds me of a scene from a Simpsons Halloween special, where Homer purchases a birthday present from an occult curio store (shades of Matheson's short story &quot;Prey&quot;). The toy is evil. &quot;That's bad&quot;, Homer replies. But it comes with a free frozen yogurt! &quot;That's good!&quot; The yogurt is also evil. &quot;That's bad.&quot; But it comes with your choice of toppings! &quot;That's good!&quot; The toppings contain potassium benzoate. Homer stares stupidly. &quot;That's bad,&quot; the clerk helps him out.The book wouldn't have been as bad if the characters were more solid. The grocer and his wife are stereotypes: Morris is gruff but forgiving, while Ida is the precursor of every strict Jewish mother that ever was. Frank, on the other hand, is a walking collection of human traits that are only loosely connected. He's street-smart and ruthless, both patient and impatient, a gentleman and an animal, frigid and lustful, caring and obscene, both with and without a conscience. He's so diffuse that the reader cannot identify with him.&quot;The Assistant&quot; cannot choose one of its numerous running themes to center on. It tugs the reader this way and that. Characters fall in love, and break up, and fall in love again. Malamud throws so many things at the reader, that after a while the only effect of reading the book is a dull heartache."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"Arguably one of the greatest novels of our time (up there with Steinbeck's \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" ... Should be a must read from high school through college. This was my third read (over a 30 year span) ... I expect my next few reads to be even more fulfulling."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"This was a very enjoyable read. The characters were painted as real people, and each of them had flaws, and most of them had an admirable quality. The dialogue, the descriptions of New York (Brooklyn) post-war struck up my own memories of that period, when people struggled with the changes of the past decade, when changes occurred in everyday things (like milk in cartons rather than in bottles) and when neighborhoods started to change, in some cases to something approaching the sinister.The story's protagonist just couldn't get a break, and is a personification of the maxim that luck favors the well-prepared. His wife was a classic example of those who see dark things everywhere, and expect them only to get worse, essentially reveling in self-fulfilling prophecy. As a counter to her parents, perhaps the daughter was too trusting, too optimistic. The dark hero of the story shows that many men are neither good nor bad, but are a mixture of the two, ruled by conscience and a universal humanity which transcends background, intent, and associations."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"Frank came from out West, now looking for a new life in New York. But unfortunately at first he has no luck so he must steal from a local grocer. However, no one would expect that Frank would help run the grocery store and eventually become like a son to the grocer he steals from.The Assistant is a book about a man named Frank alpine who helps out an immigrant, Morris Bober, run his grocery store. Frank often takes over managing the store while Bober us away and at the end he eventually does take full responsibility after Morris dies. All the while, Frank falls in love with Helen Bober, daughter of Morris and he sturggles to change from his criminal ways into a good person.The Assistant is a very descriptive book. It is also filled with many captivating events that keep the reader intrigued. Another good thing was the important themes included which made the book even more meaningful. As a result, I would reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys elaborate, event-filled, and significant books.The book was very elaborate, with its detail making you picture what was going on at all times. For example, one time this happened was when the author described how the gas was leaking out of Morris' radiator, even describing the manner that it was trickling out.In addition, it was very eventful, with numerous things happening to keep the story flowing. For example, som of the events are: when Morris slips and falls unconscious while bringing in milk crates, when Morris radiator is leaking in his apartment room, and when the grocery store gets burned down.Another reason I liked the book is because it had many important themes. For example, the characters Morris and Frank depict the importance of a father-son relationship with the way Morris takes Frank under his wing. Another example is the struggle for an immigrant to suceed in America when opening their own business.In conclusion, The Assistant is an descriptive, meaningful, and action-filled book. All of these features combined contribute to making The Assistant a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"'The Assistant' might be a bit dated in depicting the struggling Jewish shopkeeper as universal sufferer, since time and place and circumstance change social and ethical foundations and hierachies. Some people might see the book as too allegorical/parabolic and symbolic as well. But is that a fault of the book or of the benign neglect of many thoughtful people toward suffering and raw expression? The characters make it above the level of stereotype, albeit not by much, and the New York of the early 1950's is not the one of today (even the Brooklyn of the 50's isn't). Nevertheless, in creating a modern parable of suffering and redemption within a circumscribed world of a few blocks of a Brooklyn neighborhood inhabited by the local Jews, Italians, and Irish, Malamud has created a book that is accessible to anyone with a heart and interesting enough for anyone with a literary bent. It can also give pause (to anyone who is wanting to give pause) to those caught up in the hypermaterialist world today. John Lennon said \\"life if what happens what you're doing other things.\\" This book can help bring you down to earth in between reading brochures on M.B.A. programs."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I hope my work endures as well as the work of Bernard Malamud. THE ASSISTANT is a simple novel that captures perfectly its time and place. It is also a morality tale. It features a street thrug named Frank Alpine who thinks he might want to turn his life around. He takes a job at a Mom and Pop grocery store to privately atone for a crime against that store (as well as other crimes elsewhere). He agrees to work for room-and-board. There is ethnic tension between the Jewish grocery store owners and the Italian criminal. These tensions grow more severe when a romance develops between Frank and the grocer's daughter. This novel comes as close to being perfect as any I've read in recent years."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"As I recall, this was a pretty good book. It is not the most readable novel featuring a pretty ordinary story filled with pretty unextraordinary characters. However, I liked the way it was delivered - tough, realistic, rarely embellished. It tells the story of a Jewish grocer's relationship with an Italian thug in Brooklyn. I read with the same feeling I might have of my own daily life. Every inflatable theme is curbed by sober reality - friendship, love, sex, marriage, crime, duty, &quot;redemption.&quot; A recommended read."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"'The Assistant' is clearly an interesting read. Set in 1950s New York City, a young gentile enters the lives of elder Jewish shopkeepers and their daughter. The gentile is a tormented soul with questionable morals. The shopkeepers distrust him, especially around their daughter. But this gentile ultimately affects their lives in profound and everlasting ways. Certainly 'The Assistant' is rich in dialog, characterizations and in capturing anti-semetic feelings during that era. However the author seemed to have overreached in making the ending to the story to be something profound, almost of biblical proportions. For me it was too contrived. But this was only a slight distraction from an otherwise pleasant reading experience.Bottom line: an interesting and moving drama that teeters on melodrama. Strongly recommended nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I hope my work endures as well as the work of Bernard Malamud.

Those who refuse have been warned."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"Thank goodness this is not an abridged version of this masterpiece. It takes time to build the complex characters and the moral universe they are living within. Which is not to say the story is not dramatic - it is that, and the reader/hearer is grateful for every riveting detail. Most of all the performance of George Guidall is a masterpiece in itself. Every character has a distinctive and compelling voice. A great experience!"},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"I enjoyed this story. It never felt dated even though the book was first published in the 1950's. The story takes place in New York around 1925 and focuses on one family, a poor Jewish grocer and his wife and adult daughter. The economy is bad, so times are tough, and the grocer has never been a particularly inspired businessman. Under strange circumstances he takes on an assistant he really can't afford. The relationships that develop between this assistant and the grocer's family is intense, in both positive and negative ways, and transformative for all involved. I liked the way the story ended also. Elements of the story include the religious biases of the time between Jew and non-Jew, the economic struggles in the poor economy, the disappointments borne by the daughter who is in her twenties but without prospects, the disappointments of the grocer who has struggled all his life with nothing to show for it, and the internal struggles of the assistant with himself regarding the kind of person he is and how he always manages to ruin his luck. The character development is impressive. There's a great deal going on in this tale."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"A Jewish immigrant grocer , Bober, struggling to survive as the world around him changes suddenly takes in an Italian-American vagrant to work in his store following Bober being injured in a hold-up. This simple transaction sets in motion a series of events that causes havoc in both of their lives and in the lives of Bober's wife and daughter. Frank Alpine , the Italian mentioned above, while seemingly a malevolent force in the lives of the Bober's is the character in this novel who goes through the most transformation. In the end The Assistant is a redemption story. In Malamud's hands, these characters suffer both physically and psychically and yet their humanity and the basic characteristics that drive them in the end render them all as sympathetic characters despite the overall tragic circumstances of their existence. Masterfully written , The Assistant , is a book that brings the reader into contact with a period and a lifestyle that resonates powerfully and universally. Great Book."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"I purchased this book for a college class. Normally I'm not much of a reader.

This brilliant work examines the obsession that drives the protagonist to his eventual salvation in the hands of compassion and forgivness. This is a truly remarkable and oddly reminiscent of real life as it captures all the conflicting emotions that often hinder humanity."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"Frank Alpine ends the novel as Morris began it, serving mankind. Frank has become Morris, and in that, he has found his redemption as well as a place in life. The question remains...is Frank a hero at the end of the book or a martyr?"},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"Malamud paints a dismal picture of life in Brooklyn as a struggling Jewish grocer works with a dark, troubled Italian. The conflicts they face are very real and the mistakes they make all have painful consequences. At times the story moves slowly, perhaps to enhance the dreary life in the dreary store, but there are enough tragedies (such as a robbery, rape and worse) to keep the reader on edge and nervous. Ultimately this tale works on an internal level, where the reader must look within and question the basis and nature of morality. There are no easy answers in this story, but plenty of pain and heartbreak. A solid story, well worth the few short evenings it will take you to finish."},{"Title":"The Assistant","review":"Malamud comes up with a gritty look at surviving with the times and how age can trap you into a life of heartache. The small 2-story grocery store is his prison and Frank is his ray of hope but it does'nt shine bright for long. Malamud seems to chastize gentiles as self centered and makes judism the only basis of a true life which works in this book but has ruined other books for him. A gritty story though that will make you think about your future."},{"Title":"Best of the Best from New York","review":"Congratulations to the ladies who thought up the idea of combining the best recipes from cookbooks from every state, then listing the cookbooks they got their recipes from at the back of their own book.

The authors Dubeck and Dunn use a vast amount of resources to create a highly valid book that adresses gender and race inequality (from a female perspective).

He strolls in I think on Day 2 of K-18 with Chef Theo Roe. We were told about him coming and being an active participant in our class but mostly would stay out of the way and ask questions for an up coming project. He hung with us for a couple of days and we all enjoyed sitting around the dinner table talking about ourselves and he enlightening us with his journey and interaction with Chef Pardus, who at the time we were not assigned but did eventially get him. He stayed in touch with me mostly wanting updates of my CIA class clear through graduation. I see him on tv now with the likes of Anthony Bourdain, Tom Keller and his own show.

Also, my copy had problems with the binding, so that I had to hold the book together while reading it; it was not a major problem, but was a constant distraction to keep me from being absorbed by the content.It is a discussion of being a chef in the age of the celebrity chef and how various people have handled it. I enjoyed the first half of the book, which seemed to be very much like \\"Soul\\", but then the second half seemed to drag to me. I don't know if it was the content - the discussion shifted to the lives of TV chefs and then the growth of the high-end restaurant chains run by successful chefs - or just something about when and where I was reading.It was interesting to learn about some of the challenges that Thomas Keller, Emeril, etc. have faced as their careers have advanced, but I guess I wouldn't say it was enjoyable.My final judgment on this is to advise reading The Soul of a Chef and only reading this if you really enjoyed that one."},{"Title":"The Reach of a Chef: Beyond the Kitchen","review":"I'm a huge Michael Ruhlman fan, from his cookbook work to his Making of a Chef story of studying at the Culinary Institute. The Reach of a Chef certainly is not his best work; it seems to lack a clearly defined story so it becomes a bit overly expansive. But if you are a foodie and a reader who is interested in what's happening in the restaurant world-meets food television world of modern America, this is certainly a book that will entertain and educate."},{"Title":"The Reach of a Chef: Beyond the Kitchen","review":"Michael Ruhlman did a great job of giving laymen a peek into the glamorous, precarious, risky and difficult world of professional chefs. He follows all kinds of chefs, ranging from uber celebrities and public figure chefs such as Emeril and Rachael Ray to the more humble and less flashy ones embodied by Masa and Alice Waters. It is fascinating to read about how these successful chefs get their start and develop their craft (or brand) over the years. It is also pretty cool that Ruhlman contrasts this with the trajectory and ambitions of current culinary school students, some of whom have only seen the glitz and glamor of the modern era chef. The book serves as a reminder to chef-wannabes that professional cooking has to start with the passion of an artist with the plate as canvas, not the desire for fame and riches, because that rarely happens to the \\"average\\" chef.Rulhman's style is very approachable and readable; I couldn't wait to turn the page while I was reading the book. However, the organization of the book was a little chaotic in the beginning.

His smart, sensible and timely book deserves readers and a paperback edition. I admire his finesse and his honesty. He writes the way the best chefs cook, with passion, restraint and precision. And he's witty, too. I'll never see Rachael Ray quite the same way again -- he's fair, but he makes the point, which is why I grit my teeth when I see her bouncing around and shouting. At least Martha is calm.More, please, Mike! His blog is great, BTW."},{"Title":"The Reach of a Chef: Beyond the Kitchen","review":"My first Michael Ruhlman book was \\"Making of a Chef\\" It was simply amazing. He wrote in such an accessible way that I wrote him a gushing email (something I had never done) which he was gracious enough to answer. I have since read all of his other books, including Boy's Themselves and the French Laundry Cookbook. He has become one of my favorite authors and this latest book is one of his best. If you haven't read them, I strongly suggest you read Making, and Soul of a chef first. Altough it isn't necessary to take the journey in the order it was written, it is more enjoyable.I have always been interested in food, cooking and especially restaurants. My mom worked in, and owned a few, as I grew up. All of the jobs of my youth were in them. Her strongest desire was for me not to make a career in one. I followed her wishes and have had a successful non-restaurant career, but a part of me will always dream of what could have been. As clich&eacute;d as it sounds, the happiest and most exciting times of my life were spent in restaurants. I wish she could have read Mr. Ruhlman's books.As an aside, I also love Anthony Bourdain's books. They really heighten the nostalgia for my crazy, wild restaurant youth. You can't go home again, but you can reminisce about the bad old days, and smile. I was intrigued about the reference Mr. Bourdain made, in his review, about Mr. Ruhlman's wild side. You get a reference to it in his latest book, The Nasty Bits. I would love to see some of that wild side in his next book."},{"Title":"The Reach of a Chef: Beyond the Kitchen","review":"First let me tell you, I was not the kind of person who read chef-lifestyle books. I picked up Mr Ruhlman's 'The Making of a Chef' at my local library a few years ago and was enthralled by the day to day lives of CIA students described therein. I ended up reading all of Mr Ruhlman's books, and each one pleased me more than the last. This author's writing reminds me of Tracy Kidder, another writer who is able through his writing to make the reader visualize people performing their activities in the environment he describes. The Reach of a Chef is a continuation of his discussions on chefs and food, and is a pleasure to read. Something I should stress: I am from South Asia, and Mr Ruhlman's writing makes me keen to sample many kinds of cuisine he describes in his books. He brings the knowledge of good food not only to the people of the United States, but to the whole world. PS: After reading Mr Ruhlman's book \\"The Soul of a Chef\\" I happened to read \\"Kitchen Confidential\\". Food books, chef books - bring 'em on, baby!"},{"Title":"The Reach of a Chef: Beyond the Kitchen","review":"It's not that obvious from the outset exactly what trip Ruhlman wants to take the reader on, nor if one wants to journey. Beginning with story of Keller of French Laundry fame losing his shoes at his new NY/NY outing, he begins to unfold the sudden and dramatic shift of what it means to be a chef in this sudden gush of American infatuation with food and a whole new burgeoning generation of foodies. Certainly worth the read to keep going, especially through CIA changes and exotic space age stuff done by Achatz in early chapters.Being one of them who started back with the Galloping Gourmet and thinking real eating was Steak Diane or some flaming dessert, certainly the revolution in gastronomy has made this new chef breed into celebrity status.For those who have experienced this excellent author's previous books on chef (Soul of, Making of; even this reviewer read and loved his work on infant heart surgery) you'll see this change in careers of old friends such as Keller, Polcyn, CIA, etc. plus become acquainted with some new names: Masa, Achatz, Kelly.Most impressed with the likes of Kelly and Masa, who simply love to do what they do, buy/grow own ingredients, then cook themselves, choosing not to become the CEO branded entity with all the emplire glamour, pace and rewards which cause those like pictured Keller here to pause and reflect just what is a chef these days.It's like for me with likes of Emeril and John McEnroe. Both great at what they do: cook/play tennis. But with respect for that, don't have to admire their personality on the TV, on the court. Encouraging that here expressed the same opinion on Emerial as I by many true chefs.Thus this read truly is reflective on chef direction. Evidence of all types of people who seek CEO status without passion for real craft/trade of being a cooking chef.Favorite story of Kelly and gender identity problem with purveyor delivery and subsequent making him wait outside in rain while she took her sweet time checking it in comfy, dry quarters. Go girl!This like previous Ruhlman reads is superb writing and storytelling. Flows well, excites and commands reader attention. He even admits he is still passionate about his cooking and relationship to it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Reach of a Chef: Beyond the Kitchen","review":"Yet another impeccably researched and insightful exploration of the world of chefs from Ruhlman, one of the very very few non-chef writers who \\"get it\\". His look at previously written about subjects--and what's happened to them in the strange new world of \\"chef branding\\" and multi-unit expansion--and the terrible lure of Vegas is thoughtful and on target. Chefs who famously never open up to ordinary journalists are remarkably candid with Ruhlman.While thoroughly entertaining for anyone interested in food, cooks and restaurants, this book should also be a standard text in Culinary schools. This is the world that well known and respected chefs who \\"made it\\" on the strength of their cooking abilities will live in the future.My only criticism is the dismaying lack of profanity and bile. Ruhlman in person is a viciously funny bagful of venomous snakes. Had he allowed a little more of his infamous Dark Side to leak into the text I, for one, would have been happier. C'mon, Ruhlman! A chef with a SAG card?!! That should be a red flag to a bull!Kill, kill Faster Faster!!In spite of his good natured, Cleveland-born even-handedness, another stellar performance. I plan to give out copies for Christmas."},{"Title":"The Reach of a Chef: Beyond the Kitchen","review":"We are in the midst of deep upheaval in American cooking. The Food Network, the explosion of cookbook publishing, the overnight blossoming of the culinary travel genre, and the celebrity chef phenomenon all mark our new interest in the culture of restaurant food, if not in food per se. The extent of this food-culture is startling. No longer is French cooking the domain of a few big-city Europeanized gourmands. It's everywhere. Heck, even some of the ten-year-old girls on the soccer team I coach spend water breaks yacking about their favorite food shows. My nine-year-old, when I asked what she wanted for supper recently, answered \\"Grand Aioli\\". It's downright nutty.So we should gratefully welcome cook/food-writer Michael Ruhlman's excellent new attempt to make sense of it all. He is almost uniquely situated in the celebrity-food world to give us a clear snapshot of what's going on. This book is a series of vignettes of the hectic lives and workplaces of an impressive list of chefs and food-show stars. Thomas Keller, Anthony Bourdain, Wolfgang Puck...even no-brow pom-pom girl Rachel Ray, among several others. Ruhlman's question to them is: what is your role? Haven't you left the kitchen now that you're on TV and being interviewed and promoting your books and traveling from coast to coast to open new restaurants? The answers are fascinating, and reveal more about the business of being a culinary star than any other book I've read. And what a strange, kinetic, exhausting, adrenalized world it is. I felt exhausted just reading about Thomas Keller's schedule.If you're curious about the explosion of the food culture, this is a great primer. It's well-written, anecdotal, entertaining, and riveting. I highly recommend it as summer reading whether you love food or simply love watching it on TV."},{"Title":"The Reach of a Chef: Beyond the Kitchen","review":"This summer I finally got around to reading Michael Ruhlman's books on the art of cooking, and those who seek to do it professionally. Now I have reached the third book, which expands upon the idea, and takes a deep look at how the recent culinary boom is affecting how all of us eat today.Ruhlman looks at the current phenomena that surround cooking, one of the most mundane tasks around. These days, food is very big business indeed. Flip on the television and not only are there instructional shows on nearly every sort of cuisine and course, but competition shows where the content ranges from sublime to just plain stupid, reality shows that have a famous chef or two wandering the world in search of new tastes and cultures, or watching another famous chef come in and revamp a dying restaurant. If that's not enough, visit any retail store or megamart and you have various celebrities pimping -- I mean endorsing -- cutlery, cookware sets, books, spices and even processed foods. You can't escape it, and I suspect that the wave is only going to get bigger as time goes on.This phenomena, known as 'branding' in the industry, is what makes chefs become super-famous and gets them rich. Most chefs can only dream of this, and most of them slave away in kitchens, working themselves into early retirement -- being a chef requires hard physical labour, and stamina, and most can't last beyond their fifties. It certainly has brought about changes in the American culinary scene, as Ruhlman shows in his book, increasing the average home cook's awareness of just what is good food, and the fact that yes, you can indeed do it at home.Ruhlman focuses in on several chefs here, with Thomas Keller, Grant Achatz, Melissa Kelly, Emeril Lagasse, Rachael Ray, and a surprise that takes it all, and blows it right out of the water. Most of the stories here focus on how they turned into superstar chefs, and their struggle to get to the top. Some of these chefs don't give a damn about the stardom, they just want to do the very best that they can. Unfortunately, this can mean barely breaking even, as we see in the story of Melissa Kelly, and her struggle to provide organic food in its best form. Others have that entertainer quality that defies the odds, and turned them into mega-chefs, with very lucrative television shows, product lines and cookbooks.It's here, I freely confess, that my natural tendency to sneer comes into play, and my hackles rose as I read. There's something in me that gets suspicious when someone gets fame, but they really don't have the talent or the training to back it up. I can respect Emeril even though his show makes me wince with the theatrical nature, he knows how to cook, he's worked the line and he knows what he's doing. True, it's entertainment at its most hokey at times, but he's done more to bring cooking back into the American household.Then there's Rachael Ray. Ruhlman shows her meteoric rise from being a buyer for an Albany NY supermarket, her talent for selling something and the fact that in the space of a few short years, she has managed to make to the top. But -- and it's a glaring spot that those who have cooked professionally notice -- she's not a chef. Oh, she throws stuff into pans, and she opens cans and packages and has a line of cutlery and cookware, all in bright day-glo orange -- but there's something false underneath all that giggling, sweet-girl personality. Ruhlman tries to be objective in his depection of her, but there's a hint of infatuation there too, and it was this particular chapter that almost caused me to fling the book at the wall in disgust.We follow along as Ruhlman describes restaurant openings, famous names, and finally, the restaurants that inhabit 10 Columbus Circle in New York City. Some of the biggest and best names in cooking have opened here, among them Thomas Keller's Per Se, where he's working hard to keep the perfection going that he made so famous with The French Laundry.And then, I got the surprise, and it redeemed the book for me.Beside Per Se there is a little sushi place. It's unremarkable, and the chef inside virtually unknown unless you have mega-bucks, and love Japanese food. Inside is Masayoshi Takayama. To dine there is an exercise in attention and the wonder of just how good very fine food can be. It's small, with ten seats at the hinoki wood sushi bar, and several tables beyond that. Expect to drop at least 350$US per person when you eat there. But what sets it all apart is this:If Masa isn't there, the restaurant doesn't open for the day. Period. He doesn't write cookbooks. He doesn't sell knives. What he does is make food, exquisitely crafted mouthfuls that are presented with respect and all of the passion that he can muster.And it's here that I found the deciding point. Sure, you can train others to fill in for you, you can open restaurants with your name on them across the country, do television, sell product, write cookbooks and make a bundle. But if your cooking lacks the urge to do the very best, it's going to show to the diner. Eventually you get lazy, sell out, let your ego rule, and down you go, propelled by hubris.I'll be honest. I don't mind shelling out for a cookbook by a chef that I respect, or taking a hard look at a product that they suggest. And I'm willing to shell out big bucks for a really fantastic meal. Ruhlman carefully skates along that thin line between praise, and gushing, slipping a few times in places. After all, he is writing about his own bread and butter here. Despite his evocative writing, and breezy style, this book really bothered me in places. While he certainly tries to keep the feeling of his previous two books on chefs and fame going, this one didn't seize my imagination the way the other two did.I'll leave it up to other readers to decide if they like it or not. I only found a few chapters of the book interesting, and it lacks the intensity of what it is to be a professional cook. It's a gossipy, name-dropping book, and frankly, it's a dud at the end, with the only exception being when he discusses Masa. Beyond that, I would suggest it only as a cautionary tale for those who want to be culinary stars, and what it really costs for that fame.Somewhat recommended. Three stars."},{"Title":"The Reach of a Chef: Beyond the Kitchen","review":"\`The Reach of a Chef' is Michael Ruhlman's third major journalistic investigation into the world of American culinary practice and personalities and his tenth book, which includes four important cookbook collaborations, especially the highly successful collaborations with the philosopher-king of American cooking, Thomas Keller and the king of New York fish cookery, Eric Rippert.This book is a logical next step after his essays on culinary education, \`The Making of a Chef', and basic levels of achievement in the American culinary universe, \`The Soul of a Chef'. This investigation explores the techniques by which the successful chef / owner expands their reach beyond the single restaurant and turn their reputation into a marketable brand. An ancillary object of this essay is an examination of culinary celebrity.His primary subjects are virtually all the major stars of the American culinary scene, including Emeril Lagasse, Wolfgang Puck, Thomas Keller, Eric Rippert, Jean-George Vongerichten, Charlie Trotter, Jasper White, Daniel Boulud, Bobby Flay, Mario Batali, Rick Bayless, Patrick O'Connell, Norm Van Aiken, Grant Achatz, Melissa Kelly, and Rachael Ray.The last name may not seem to fit into the same group as the others, and in some important ways, Rachael does not fit the mold that created Puck, Lagasse, Keller, Flay, and Batali. But, with regard to the matters addressed in this book, she is as much of an archetype as all the others. Like Martha Stewart before her, Rachael is turning her name into a BRAND based on accomplishment in the culinary world. Ruhlman even goes so far as to say that Rachael may be the first \`brand' which has the impetus to overtake Martha at her own game.The bookend's for the book's presentation of its theme is an insider's look at the recent opening of Thomas Keller's New York fine dining restaurant, Per Se, on the fourth floor of the new Columbus Circle Time Warner center. If this book does nothing else, it reassures us that Keller's kind of devotion to quality is rewarded by both critical and commercial success. I won't keep you in suspense the way Ruhlman does, Per Se comes out of the gate with four shining stars from the all powerful restaurant reviewer of \`The New York Times'. And, the highest score was not given grudgingly. The reviewer bewailed the fact that his last visit on which his review would be based would be his last time eating at Per Se for quite some time.Just as I always appreciate it when cookbook authors give fair mention to other cooks on which their work has been based, Ruhlman enhances the pleasure of his read by making several citations from fellow culinary journalists, all of whom are at the top of my list, with Ruhlman, of favorite foodie reads. Leading the pack is Tony Bourdain, a good friend of Ruhlman who, as Ruhlman puts it, is quite smitten with Thomas Keller's accomplishments. One merely has to read Bourdain's chapter on the French Laundry in \`A Cook's Tour' to understand his abject hero worship. Close behind, in a very important role, is New York Times food columnist and editor, Amanda Hesser. Present as the model of restaurant critic extraordinare is Ruth Reichl, presently editor in chief of \`Gourmet' magazine.The one thing Bourdain and Hesser have most in common is distaste for the style of Emeril Lagasse. Hesser's main claim to fame in Ruhlman's world is a long and very critical essay in \`The New York Times' on Emeril Lagasse which dissected his TV show cooking in painful detail. Oddly, most of Emeril's harshest critics among his colleagues and culinary journalists seem to be softening. Part of this may be due to the fact that his popularity among his audience has peaked and may be falling off just a bit. Part of it may be due, as Norm Van Aiken has said, to the fact that Emeril is really a very talented chef and his restaurants are quite good, and Lagasse had to go through all the tough times that every other successful chef / owner had to face. It is certainly due in part to the fact that Lagasse in person is totally cordial, as when he warmly greeted Bourdain, his worst critic this side of Hesser at an affair. Ultimately, I believe Emeril's mellowing among his colleagues is due to the recognition that modern culinary TV has brought huge numbers of average Americans into the kitchen to enjoy cooking, and it is Emeril, not Julia Child who fostered this trend.The nature of the trend is even clearer when we examine the career and style of Rachael Ray, whose primary attribute is that of very effective culinary cheerleader. She essentially says that if anyone really wants to get into food TV, they should not be studying cooking, they should be studying TV journalism and production. To me, the most illuminating aspect of this trend is the fact that the thing I like most about Jamie Oliver's shows and books are the way he communicates a love of food and cooking without the hokey Americans' exclamations and neologisms.For those of us who really enjoy reading about the culinary world, this has been a red letter period, as bad boy Bourdain has also just come out with a new book, \`The Nasty Bits' covering much the same ground, but from a much different perspective. Ruhlman, for example, does not confess to Bourdain's description of Ruhlman's staggering around a Las Vegas casino floor wanting a little cash advance from fellow journalist and roommate Bourdain.For those whose taste in culinary writing stops when the recipes disappear, this may not be for you, but for all who are really interested in what goes on behind the scenes, this book is for you. The only thing I missed was some discussion of Bob Kinkead's movement to support local instead of chain restaurants."},{"Title":"The Reach of a Chef: Beyond the Kitchen","review":"As the co-writer of the bellwether of gourmet culinary tomes, \\"The French Laundry Cookbook\\", author Michael Ruhlman has written an eminently readable book that should satisfy any foodie. His focus is rife with possibilities as he explores the development of the celebrity chef. What Ruhlman gleans with carefully gathered insider knowledge is the advent of the chef as an entrepreneur rather than an artisan, a trend that has been discernible for the past decade. This has a lot to do with the success of the Food Network and related lifestyle programming, but also playing significant roles are writers such as Ruhlman and Anthony Bourdain and the simple fact that perceived exotic ingredients are now available at local supermarkets.The author accurately tracks the rising commercial value of the celebrity chef through not only a comprehensive visit to the Culinary Institute of America (where he examined how a chef is trained in a previous book) but also studying a number of renowned chefs with whom he seems to know quite well. Unsurprisingly, he focuses on Thomas Keller, originally of The French Laundry and more recently, of Per Se of which he shows the daily operations in illuminating detail. As a point of comparison, Ruhlman looks at Keller's Time Warner Building neighbor, the most-expensive and possibly the most sublime sushi chef in the world, Masa Takayama, who owns the exclusive Masa where premium prices are charged for what seems to be the most original sushi concoctions. Operations could not be more different between the two restaurants.Ruhlman also looks at the new breed of chefs through two contrasting personalities. The first is Keller's brilliant prot&eacute;g&eacute; Grant Achatz, a technically-oriented creator of futuristic-looking foods, who set up the deluxe Trio restaurant in the Chicago area. No less stellar is Melissa Kelly, who is presented as a back-to-basics American chef who makes art out of home-style dishes like pot roast and roast chicken. She has followed Alice Waters' example of using fresh ingredients at Primo in Rockland, Maine and recently opened restaurants in Tuscon and Orlando in conjunction with the Marriott.Perhaps the most interesting sections look at the breakout stars at the Food Network, especially Emeril Lagasse and Rachael Ray. Both have reinvented the concept of the celebrity chef to include extensive cookware lines, a growing library of branded cookbooks and hosting duties on multitude of TV shows that are aired on a daily basis. Lagasse has gone further by opening up nearly a dozen restaurants under his name, while Ray has received sponsorship from Oprah Winfrey to host a daily lifestyle talk show in the fall. It brings up the intriguing question as to when these celebrity chefs stop teaching cooking and become multi-hyphenated conglomerates.The fascinating evolution of the culinary industry is in good hands under Ruhlman's microscope. He obviously loves his subject, as his enjoyment comes off the pages in enthusiastic prose. He also is a proactive participant in these restaurants, a fact that provides instant credibility to his observations. In the end, the book is not really a scathing expose of egos running amok - as is clear in several passages of Bill Buford's \\"Heat\\". Instead, he brings to light the changing role of the chef and an in-depth profile of those who have achieved success whether it is the end game for them or a means toward broader spheres of influence."},{"Title":"The Reach of a Chef: Beyond the Kitchen","review":"I've become quite a fan of Ruhlman's writing, having first read his \\"Soul of a Chef\\" three years ago -- I couldn't put it down, and I continue to read it once a year. Hungry for more, I found \\"The Making of a Chef\\" at my local library, which I enjoyed, but the book (his first on the subject) definitely felt like he was still finding his culinary-literary feet. When I learned of \\"The Reach of a Chef,\\" I was positively giddy and snatched up a copy. It was fun being reintroduced to the world of Keller, learning about the author's experiences with Bourdain and Ripert, and discovering seasonal Maine cooking at Primo, but ultimately I was disappointed: \\"Reach\\" doesn't capture the same refined emotion and passion as \\"Soul\\" by any means.But perhaps it's just an accurate reflection of the subject -- how far does a chef's reach extend in America? The vast majority of our cooks aren't fascinating stars like Keller, Symon, Polcyn. They are instead the mediocre, spotlight-seeking Cat Coras and Rachael Rays who slither into our living rooms.Like the over-commercialized culinary world, \\"Reach of a Chef\\" is crowded and a bit confused. Choose Ruhlman's superb earlier works for a more satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Reach of a Chef: Beyond the Kitchen","review":"When Ruhlman sticks to descriptions of the working of a restaurant kitchen, the food, and the chef, his writing is engaging and compelling. Unfortunately he has a tendency to lapse into discussing his own feelings about cooking and how profoundly his life was changed by writing about it, and when he does this he gets pretentious and repetitive. In his 2 previous book on the subject, Making of a Chef and Soul of a Chef, this was also true but in Reach of a Chef there is so much of it that it made the book hard to get through. How many times can you read about how veal stock changed his life before gagging? It also seems like he was lacking material and so added large sections that simply rehashed the material in the 2 first books, like a review in case you hadn't read them. Overall, about half of this book was interesting, new material; the rest wasn't even worth the time it took me to skim through."},{"Title":"The Reach of a Chef: Beyond the Kitchen","review":"Michael Ruhlman has been our companion and guide as we've been the guides for our son, a recent graduate of the CIA's Culinary Program. Back when we were reading \\"The Making of a Chef,\\" our son was working lowly jobs in local restaurants. By the time we were reading \\"The Soul of a Chef\\", he was working for his first CIA grad, Paul Trujillo, who just happens to have been in Ruhlman's first class and is mentioned in this book. Ruhlman opened the door to this fascinating school, Trujillo told us that our son had the talent and drive to succeed in this demanding school, and a truly outstanding CIA grad, Chef Eric Erway, became our son's mentor at Job Corps. They all paved the way for a crazy kid to find out what he was really made of.This book is so rewarding on so many levels. Other reviewers have written eloquently about the chefs we meet in this book. For me, though, it's the return to the CIA that is most personally significant. Through this book, we get to see the school through an older man's eyes, one who knows how to ask even better questions. We can see how the CIA has evolved along with the profession. Most of all, though, we get to enjoy what I believe to be the evolution of Ruhlman's writing itself. The maturity he brings to this book is most evident toward the end - don't miss it!All I can say is \\"thank you, Michael Ruhlman\\" for continuing to shed light on this fascinating and confusing profession as our son wends his way through the journey of becoming a chef. He just started the Baking and Pastry program. Can't wait to see what comes next!"},{"Title":"The Reach of a Chef: Beyond the Kitchen","review":"The author's obituary, when eventually written, will start \\"Michael Ruhlman, whose signature workThe Making of a Chef: Mastering Heat at the Culinary Institutechronicled his time at the Culinary Institute of America...\\"That was a breakthrough book that essentially invented the genre of the 'meticulous examination' (as the 'Booklist' review calls it) of the chef as a profession. 'Reach' is Ruhlman's third in that series. He's really a great writer - as meticulous in his detail-gathering and writing as his chefs are in their cooking. You get to see that guys like Thomas Keller succeed not because of some fluke, but because of years of hard work, talent honed by that work and an obsession about details. Ruhlman's talent, in turn, is that he's able to convey that to his readers. The Newsday blurb on the book gets it right: \\"I'm sure [Ruhlman is] a pretty good cook himself, but I would urge him not to give up his day job, because he's a terrific writer.\\"Exactly.You also get the feeling that chefs trust and open up to this author because he has their respect - he went through the Culinary Institute with the express purpose of writing the book that would become 'The Making of Chef.' Now that's a commitment. The results are some fine moments of introspection - Ruhlman notes that with enterprises the size of Keller's, \\"(t)he chef had moved out of the kitchen permanently. Or could, if he or she wanted to, and ultimately would have to, even if he or she didn't want to, simply from the physical limitations in a physically grueling job.\\"Asked to comment on that, Keller wistfully notes \\"I miss the people. I'm sad. I miss being in the kitchen with them...I'm not a chef anymore and it breaks my heart.\\"It's revelations like that one - superbly transcribed and framed by the author - that make 'Reach' such a compelling read."},{"Title":"The Reach of a Chef: Beyond the Kitchen","review":"That question is perhaps the major leit motif of Ruhlman's latest work. \\"Reach\\" spends significant time revisiting the CIA instructors and classes that Ruhlman wrote about in \\"Soul of a Chef\\", noting the \\"wussification\\" (my word) of current students vs. those from just a few years ago.Ruhlman makes the point that the CIA is no longer simply about cooking, but also about the restaurant business. And the restaurant business is no longer simply about food. It's now about celebrity and riches.Despite this premise being threaded through the vignettes Ruhlman presents at restaurants such as Primo, Per Se and Alinea, as well as insider's views of Emeril and Rachael Ray, when Ruhlman gets to discussing the incredible Masa, the superficiality of any student designing a path toward celebrity seems an empty pursuit.The yin-yang of presenting Keller's Per Se story right before Masa's is genius on Ruhlman's part - and that the two restaurants are next-door neighbors in NYC is all the more amazing.At the end, we're left perhaps with a little more respect for Ray, a bit of sadness for Keller, a desire to drop $430 at Masa and a curiosity as to where Grant Aschatz is headed next - perhaps right past Ferran Adria as the most compelling working chef today.It's a great read. I'm in the business, but I think even those who aren't but just like food will love this book."},{"Title":"The Return of Lum * Urusei Yatsura, Vol. 3: Sweet Revenge","review":"Sweet Revenge is a title that may mislead some poeple into the story. Any revenge doesn't show up till half-way through this Takahashi work. But some of the stories are interesting. Tomobiki High holds a parent's day, and we see the introduction of LUm's mother, who speaks in Mahjoung tiles. There's also a funny little story of a female ninja, but this book is notable for the intro of Lum's childhood and revenge-bent friend Ran. A person who borders on ultra-cute and Frightening madness."},{"Title":"The Return of Lum * Urusei Yatsura, Vol. 3: Sweet Revenge","review":"Everybody has some skeletons in their closet -- and it's not surprising that alien princess Lum's are a little crazier than normal. In Rumiko Takahashi's \\"The Return of Lum: Urusei Yatsura,\\" the extraterrestrial gets a nasty shock from her past, which threatens to affect her \\"darling.\\"A very enthusiastic young teacher comes to Tomobiki High, and receives a shock when the new transfer student has horns and can fly. Lum soon joins the girl's volleyball team, not knowing that the captain LOATHES all men. Not to mention the parent-teacher day, when the cast's assorted strange moms arrive. Ataru's love for all things female pops up when a pretty female ninja, Kaede, desperately tries to get a secret document from him. He continues pursuing her when she leaves her job and is pursued by a number of inept ninja.And then a new girl, Ran, arrives at the school -- and turns out to be an old pal of Lum's. Unfortunately, she has a split personality -- one side is sweet and cute, the other is completely insane and vengeful. And because of some unfortunate childhood incidents (involving bedwetting and ice cream), she plans to get revenge on Lum, by stealing Ataru's youth. Since she does that with a kiss, Ataru is all too willing....Ran is one of the most entertaining characters in the \\"Urusei Yatsura\\" series -- she's completely insane. As a result, Takahashi's stories with her are among the most entertaining (with the exception of Rei, whom Ran has a \\"thing\\" about). When you have someone who's out for revenge and comically crazed, expect fun.This is one of the rare collections that has not a dud story in it -- Takahashi veers from strength to strength, be it psychotic ninja hags or a school play disrupted by Ataru and Ran. We also get the entertaining spectacle of Lum being joined to Ataru's hip even at school.We also get introduced to new characters, such as Mendo and Lum's moms. One is snotty, autocratic and abhors machinery, and the other is an upbeat older version of her daughter. And despite only brief appearances by fan faves Cherry and Sakura, we get Kaede the job-seeking ninja, and Mr. Hanawa, the overenthusastic young teacher who speaks in cliches.\\"Sweet Revenge\\" is indeed a sweet collection of \\"Urusei Yatsura\\" stories. And it introduces one of Takahashi's most memorable characters -- definitely not something to miss."},{"Title":"The Return of Lum * Urusei Yatsura, Vol. 3: Sweet Revenge","review":"I won't review the story since others have done it for me. What I will do is talk about the design of the book itself.For one, the binding on all of the Urusei Yatsura/Lum books is substandard. My copy of 'The Return of Lum' has the cover coming off of it, from the binding, like it's just peeling up. 'The Perfect Collection' is losing pages in the center of the book, and I have to replace my copy of 'Sweet Revenge' because it has lost EVERY SINGLE PAGE in it! There is just no excuse for this! I'm afraid to touch 'Trouble Times Ten' or 'Ran Attacks' for fear that they will come apart too!I'm not saying that you shouldn't get the books; this is a wonderful series and everyone should read it, Takahashi fan or not. But just be warned that the books will fall to pieces on you."},{"Title":"The Return of Lum * Urusei Yatsura, Vol. 3: Sweet Revenge","review":"Another day, another Urusei Yatsura book. Oh how I wish this series would never end... In this book we start by introducing a new teacher to the ranks of Tomobiki High school, then a nice two part tale of the girls' volleyball captain's love for Mendo (her and every other girl...ever), then move onto a long-winded multi-part story about a ninja. This is a nice story, and it contains the seeds of what eventually became Takahashi's popular series Ranma 1/2. After the ninja stories comes the main event.Ran-chanA sweet, demure red head with her heart set on Ataru.No, wait.An evil conniving alien from Lum's past with her heart set on stealing Ataru's youth so she can have revenge on Lum-chan. THAT's it. Ran is a fantastic character, who has two personalities, the sweet endearing Ran and the evil murderous Ran.Ran works so well in the story because she adds another level of sheer twisted brilliance, she's totally insane and her plans are completely off the wall, resulting in more trademarked Urusei Yatsura slapstick.Another book you need to own.

I have four other Revenge of Lum books on hold for me (I didn't bring much money the day I got this book, so I ended up getting whichever graphic novel was thickest!) It was GREAT. A really fantastic book with captivating plots. I felt, however, that the Ninja chapters ended up slightly...unfinished. Oh well! Does anyone know what order this series goes in? Does it even have an order?"},{"Title":"The Return of Lum * Urusei Yatsura, Vol. 3: Sweet Revenge","review":"Of the three books in the 'Lum' series that I've read (The Return of Lum, Lum in the sun, Sweet Revenge), this one is the funniest. This book starts out with a new teacher to Tomobiki High school - boy is he in for a few surprises! Ahh, the foibles of a new teacher. The next story revolves around Kaede the ninja. Kaede is very cute, and the story is hilarious. Finally, the book ends with a meeting between Lum, and her childhood friend, Ran. The first too stories were funnier, but this one certainly provides plenty of fodder for laughs. This book, though not one of my all-time favorites, was still very funny. I recomend it."},{"Title":"Mrs. Fytton's Country Life","review":"I travel annually to the U.K with my husband (he is British i am American) and I often go to the book shops and buy a suitcase full of books to take home. Mrs. Fytton's is the last of the run from my last trip and it is a fine read! Mrs. Fytton the first spends her early days as the queen of the household mother, business woman, wife, interior decorator, bon vivant a veritable whirlwind of activity. Just a little Martha stewart crossed with a dose of Delia Smith and just a dash of Erica jong. By keeping up the smooth external veneer of a woman firmly in love with the idea of woman's liberation whilst secretly harboring a desire to please her man at all costs she loses her husband to a &quot;younger blonder model&quot;. For revenge she leaves London, dumps her two teenage children off with her ex, his new wife and their new child and moves lock stock and pickling jar to the country to become a domestic goddess and win back the heart of her former husband. I have found myself on numerous occassions chuckling out loud on my commute on the train at the eccentricities of Mrs Fytton's neighbours. I love Mavis' style and will look for one of her other novels to read in the future."},{"Title":"Mrs. Fytton's Country Life","review":"Why can't more books be this funny, well-written and wise?

Read it twice, in fact."},{"Title":"Mrs. Fytton's Country Life","review":"At first I found this book hard to get into because of the style of writing - ancient household Goddess recipes and advice interspersed with the goings on in the life of Mrs Fytton, her ex-husband, his bimbette wife, toothy son and two teenage children - not to mention the extremely licentious happenings in the country!However, when I got into the novel I really enjoyed it!

This is one of the wittiest, brightest, funniest books I have read in a long, long time.With quiet, droll but absolutely side-splitting humor, Cheeks, a shining star if there ever was one, tells the tired old cliched story of a first wife whose husband has left her for a younger, blonder, bimbette. And after all those years of devotion, too! Before you groan aloud and stop reading this review, believe me when I tell you that this is NOT the ordinary tale!Angela Fytton, the spurned wife, is not one to take rejection quietly, and is not above casting aspersions on her (ex)-husbands er...manly equipment to wifey number two. Angela embarks on a diabolical plan to get her husband back. Part 1: Buy a huge, rambling house in the country that doubles as historic artifact. Start making one's own honey and talking to the hens (whom she threatens with coq au vin recipes if they don't behave). Part 2: Send one's obnoxious teenaged children (boy and girl) to live with Daddy and Bimbette and New Baby Brother. Part 3: Well...you have to read the book.Does Angela get her husband back? Does Binnie the Bimbette (yes, Binnie) survive her predecessor's truly outrageous onslaught? Will the baby survive his teenaged siblings? Will Ian the ex-husband survive both wife number one and wife number two without resorting to bondage (one of the shortest but funniest paragraphs I have yet to read)?Read it and find out...and rejoice that there is a wildly funny British wit on the loose!

Survival factors of new businesses include the owner's age, higher education, and previous experience in their field, with most business owners between 35 and 64, having 10 to 19 years of work experience prior to self employment4. To help you choose a business, make a list of your hobbies and interests, and then list all the possible ways you can make money with those hobbies/interests5.

These institutions make my city what it is: The cultural capitol of the world. Many of these cultural palaces were founded by members of America's Secret Aristocracy. Author Steven Birmingham presents a VIVID portrait of this group and it's history.It is an elite group, whose roots go way back to the founding of this nation. It's members have married each other, fought in wars, endowed universities and cultural institutions, made policy decisions, held elected office, and in some of their less guarded moments, gotten themselves involved in scandals.We learn, and start to understand how American aristocrats think and what their values are. What we learn is that these people live by a code: Noblesse oblige. They are all about serving their country, community families and friends. They are about making a contribution to this nation.The Author spent several months conducting interviews with members of this elite group, from the east coast to the west coast, with stops in between. What he discovers and what we finally see, is the insiders view of the organizations &amp; secret societies that serve and support this group, as well as the strong and determined personalites that keep things rolling. We also get a rare behind the scenes history lesson. We learn more about John Jay, the Astors, the Randolphs of Virginia, the Browns of Newport and who the Boston Brahmins really are. Each story is truly fascinating.America's Secret Aristocracy is a real eye opener, and not just about a group of elites who have played mega roles for hundreds of years in this nation. It is a fuller history of this nation. It is a book that fills in many historical gaps, and that makes it well worth having!"},{"Title":"AMERICAS SECRET ARISTOCRACY","review":"I thought this was going to be about the shadow government with an emphasis on the old line new england ivy league blue blood families, Vanderbilts, Astors, Rockefellers, etc. Its about them but its more like if Robin Leach wrote a history book about these families.

It worked best once I'd seen the material in my class textbook. On the job, I find this handbook invaluable for most engineering disciplines involving physical system analysis.

Everything you learned in school and need to recall, plus everything you should have learned."},{"Title":"Handbook of Engineering Fundamentals","review":"Like I said, if you're an engineering major, this is THE book to have before you start your freshman year. I see that there's a 2009 edition, but it has quite a few less pages. I'd stick with this earlier edition, or mine. I had the 1975 edition when I started at R.I.T. in 1976 in mechanical engineering. All the basics are in this one book. There are all the necessary unit-conversion tables in what has to be the best layout I've ever seen; all the tables are very easy to use and EVERY possible conversion you need is there. There are all the basic mathematic formulas (e.g., areas & volumes of all geometric shapes) also in the best and easiest-to-use layout I've ever seen. And that's just the start. Just about every engineering topic is covered to some degree. Like another reviewer said, if you have just one handbook, this is the one to have. Actually, when I was in college, I was just about the only engineering student with a copy of this handbook. It's as if it's a well-kept secret. I was a mechanical engineering student, so I also had Mark's handbook for ME's. If you do get a copy, don't go telling all your classmates that you have it. Keep it to yourself, and hide it in your desk. I'm serious! Make it your \\"ace in the hole.\\" That's what I did, and I can't imagine going through engineering college without a copy! My grades directly reflected the fact that I had this book. And, once you're out in the working world, this book will continue to help you. This book is my \\"first-go-to-book\\" whenever I'm faced with something new. And when you're out in the world, you'll be faced with new and interesting things all the time. Why not read up on things in Eshback before you go into a meeting with the big-shots and wow 'em? If you're an ME, your list of reference books should read: 1) Eshback Handbook, 2) Marks' Handbook for ME's, 3) Basic Dictionary (e.g., Webster's Collegiate), 4) Basic Thesaurus (ditto on Webster's), 5) Machinery's Handbook, 6) Dictionary of Technical Words & Terms (e.g., McGraw-Hill). Remember, you need the latest edition of any course book, but your reference books don't have to be the newest. College is expensive, and any of these reference books can be 20+ years old and still do a great job in helping you out. After all, engineering doesn't necessarily change all that much from year to year. The basics are the basics in engineering, whether it's 1975 or 2015.

And though, certainly, none of these pieces attains the truly unique, Kushnerian glory of &quot;Angels&quot; (but Good God, does *anything*?) they are most definitely not to be put aside too hastily.His essays are enlightening, witty and thought-provoking, reminiscent of his drama. And though there are a few that I, admittedly, skip over periodically, most of them are fun, if slightly heavy, short reads.&quot;Slavs!&quot; is not one of Kushner's best plays, but I must recommend spending some time with it. Like &quot;Angels&quot; and &quot;Bright Room&quot; (and indeed, everything he writes or says), &quot;Slavs!&quot; is dense with political theory, history and humanity. And while it may seem forgettable at first glance (and even second... I acted in it a few months ago, and trust me, it takes a few readings to truly appreciate it) it proves its worth.Now I come to my favorite parts of the book: Kushner's poems. &quot;An Epithalimion&quot; holds a place (in my mind, at least) among his best writings. This poem is absolutely *alive* with imagery, both visual and emotional. To risk sounding like the cheesiest person ever, reading it just makes me happy; I can't recommend it highly enough. &quot;Second Month of Mourning,&quot; too, is beautiful, but in exactly the opposite way: it's truly heart-breaking.Kushner's prayer that concludes the compilation is one of my favorite pieces ever, ever. It thrills me to read it. It, like all the other works in this book, fits Kushner's mold perfectly: it is joyful and heart-breaking, political and scientific, historical and philosophical. It is the perfect end to this collection.I have recommended this book to all of my friends, whether or not they are fans of Kushner (though everyone should be a fan of Kushner), and do the same to you. Buy it, read it, love it."},{"Title":"Thinking About the Longstanding Problems of Virtue: Essays, A Play, Two Poems and a Prayer","review":"Kushner (perhaps the greatest poetic/playwright genius of our time) has assembled some of his more marginal works (though few of his works actually are marginal) and some of his most brilliant in this collection of &quot;essays, a play, two poems and a prayer.&quot; having read all of his plays, including his Tony Award Winning &quot;Angels in America&quot; two part masterpiece, i have to say that SLAVS, while it present a brilliant message, isnt the best of his works. Sometimes, also, these essays can be repetitive. however, some are brilliant, spiced with new meaning and metaphor, different ways of viewing the evils of capitalism and our society. They concern sex and life (as one? as a duality?), love, politics and food. (can we live without any of the above. the answer is never presented, but it must be a resounding no). best of all is Kushner's prayer, at the end of the book, which was delivered on the national prayer for aids day. full of anger and grace, compliance and vengence, this prayer eloquently asks and reasks the questions within all of us, directly to &quot;God.&quot; this book provides one of the most provocative and brilliant commentaries that i have seen in recent years."},{"Title":"Thinking About the Longstanding Problems of Virtue: Essays, A Play, Two Poems and a Prayer","review":"So I am not sure if I misunderstood but I was under the impression the play Slavs!

Dick's literary career consider the height of his art to be a string of amazing novels that he wrote in the sixties. But even Dick's earliest novels are at least very interesting. THE COSMIC PUPPETS, for instance, is one of Dick's earliest works, far from the great works of the sixties, but still utterly fascinating. TIME OUT OF JOINT is one of the last novels before Dick's narratives became more complex and polished in the sixties. But that \\"more\\" has to be qualified. As one critic has written, Dick never wrote a truly great book. As a pulp writer, he was under tremendous financial pressure to wrap manuscript up rather than polish them. Even his best books like THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE and DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? are filled with literary infelicities, awkwardly constructed characters, and sketchy narratives. But this same critic remarked that while Dick never wrote that one great masterpiece like LeGuin's THE DISPOSSESSED or Keith Roberts's PAVANE, he may have written more \\"good\\" books than anyone else in the 20th century. He may have been merely a pulp writer, but he was a brilliant one.TIME OUT OF JOINT, like so many of Dick's books from all periods of his career, reflects a preoccupation between what appears to be the case and what truly is. In a situation that other reviewers here have noted is reminiscent of THE TRUMAN SHOW, Ragle Gumm is at the center of a reality that has been constructed around him. He thinks it is 1959, but in fact it is 1998. He thinks he is the world's greatest champion in an ongoing newspaper contest, but in reality he is the central figure in the defense of Earth from attacks from Lunatics on the moon (it turns out the Lunatics are the good guys). The brilliance of the book comes from the way that Gumm's world is gradually undermined by bits of experience that don't quite jive with all the rest. Dick pretty much invented the alternative reality genre and while he would write even better examples in the sixties, few other writers would ever come up to the level of this book in any decade. In the world of alternative reality, Dick's main competition is himself.The great thing about Philip K. Dick is that it is so hard to go wrong with any of his books. Even his weakest books, such as COUNTER-CLOCK WORLD or VALIS, have a lot to recommend them. If you have already read a great deal of Dick but have not read this one, I enthusiastically recommend it. If you have not read any Dick whatsoever, this is a great place to break in. Only, make sure it is not the last thing you read by him."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"After reading this book, I was very paranoid about my surroundings. Are we all living in a dream. Initially, when I began reading the book, I felt as though the characters' paranoia was uncalled for and went as fart as calling them irrational, then as the storyline progressed, I realized that the reasons for why they were so afraid were valid. I recommend it to anyone who wants to dig deeper into 50's paranoia. I had to read this book for a lecture on 1950's television production and it's context with society."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"This was a very enjoyable book. Things slowly start to fall apart. The only weakness was the ending to me.** SPOILERS **One thing that kept hitting me as I read this, was several scenes were used almost exactly in The Truman Show. The filmakers should have given some credit to this book. I liked the way this book did it better than Truman Show though. In the movie, the viewer knows what is going on from the very begining. In this book, the story is told from the perspective of the protagonist, so you are in his shoes and are slowly made aware that something isn't quite right about this world, as it is slowly revealed."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"It's unfortunate that the blurbs on the backs of the Vintage editions are so spoilerrific, because the narrative hangs on a significant surprise. In fact, after browsing through my local bookstore, I've discovered that these chunks of info are more like synopses, rather than something enticing or mysterious.The story stands well enough, even when you already know what the mystery is (thanks, Vintage!), and it's a fascinating look at PKD before he began his long slide into metaphysical paranoia. The characters aren't particularly interesting, to the point where it's difficult to distinguish who is who, but this is not surprising given the era in which the novel came out. It's still leagues above its pulp brethren, and it's a nice companion to what Alfred Bester was doing around the same time. If you're looking for heart-stoppingly weird PKD, you'll be disappointed. But it's a compelling read with increasing tension. The climax is a bit of a letdown, and the story is hurt overall by other books and films that have explored similar territory in the decades since.Despite its flaws, I believe its overall quality is still head and shoulders above the hack work that clogs the shelves these days. It's a political piece, and one that explores the weaknesses of our perceptions, rather than hinging itself on gee-whiz technology or exotic planets."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"One of many of PKD books that deals with the \\"what is reality\\" question. Thoroughly enjoyable and populated with wonderful characters though it takes a little while to move from the mudane story of some denizens of 1950s suburbian to the fun house mirror of what's REALLY going on beneath the surface. Dick really takes his time tantalizing you with clues that lead to the expected unravelling at the end like a good mystery writer and that really kept me on the hook. However, once the truth was revealed it felt hurried and a little confusing to me which was a small letdown even though I enjoyed getting there immensely. Like others here, I am definitely seeing this book's influence on films like The Matrix, The 13th Floor, and (especially) Dark City."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"Although technically a science-fiction book, Time Out of Joint (1959) reads more like a strange hybrid of science fiction and the mainstream realist novels Dick was also writing at the time. The major part of the story takes place in a small town, rendered with much more detailed texture of description and characterization than in any of Dick's sf novels to that date. Dick throws out many tantalizing clues throughout the first part of the book that this version of the fifties is not quite the one we know. But it is an excellent imitation, aided by the fact that all the residents of the town have been hypnotized to believe they are living in the sleepy Eisenhower-era of the 1950s. The main character, Ragle Gumm, starts to break out of his hypnosis and realizes there is a conspiracy to keep him in ignorance. In one of Dick's most famous scenes, a soft-drink stand disappears and in its place is found a slip of paper that says \\"soft-drink stand.\\" The book is a powerful comment on the fragile nature of reality as well as a reminder that sometimes the paranoid is simply perceiving the situation accurately."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"This is not a PKD classic by any means - but it's a strong novel, well worth reading.Before I get into the plot, I'd like to point out how this book embodies the best aspects of PKD's writing. In the opening sequence, he sketches out the characters of the main players - Rigle Gumm, his sister Margo and brother in law Vic and their neighbours, the Blacks, with amazing vividity and economy.A few sentances is all he needs to make them real. Similarly, this book captures his ear for crisp, convincing dialogue. The economy of his writing again comes out in the fact that, even though he barely sketches in most of his settings, they are quite real in the reader's mental eye.The plot centers around Ragle Gumm, WW2 vet, who lives with his sister's family, makes a lot of money solving newspaper puzzles and flirts with his neighbours wife. But there are subtle discrepancies. He sometimes sees objects vanishing. A radio his nephew makes enables him to listen to mysterious conversations,including one about him. He finds an old magazine which mentions a famous actress called Marilyn Monroe - but he's never heard of her. He finds an entire telephone directory full of numbers that don't even seem to exist. Perhaps he's just paranoid,cracking up? The truth is far stranger.PKD masterfully explores the process by which the reality behind Gumm's oddly neat and tidy world is discovered -the conflict in Gumm's mind between the unfolding realisation, and the fear that perhaps he is just going mad.The revelation, when it happens is fairly unexpected and satisfying.I won't go into the details, but it's about space - where we SHOULD be going, but apparently many people disagree.So, this is a well-written, rewarding book. Not an absolute classic, but not one that's just for the PKD fans either."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"Often in his works, Philip K. Dick will attempt to tie together too many plot threads and mind-bending concepts. Such books, with \\"Dr. Bloodmoney\\" being the best example I can think of, render themselves ineffectual and unenjoyable. As \\"Dr. Bloodmoney\\" was the second PKD book I read, and \\"Time Out Of Joint\\" the third, I was expecting to have to follow a complex plot and sort everything out. I was pleasantly surprised by what I read.\\"Time Out Of Joint\\" investigates only one PKD concept- false reality being supplanted by true reality- but he goes far more in depth than usual. This allows him to develop his characters more than usual, and the decreased emphasis on sci-fi concepts causes the first three-quarters of the book to develop much like a novel. Given that that is not familiar PKD territory, it was also surprising how smoothly it developed. Toward the end, the book lost that smoothness, and the last few chapters went by very quickly and jerkily. This wasn't that bad, though, as Dick used that jerkiness to impart a sense of gradually increasing intensity. This helped, as dawning awareness of the situation corresponded to an increase in the urgency. The book's ending seemed rather abrupt, but PKD may have wanted it that way.I would recommend this book to anyone, PKD fan or no. The compelling premise and highly effective dawning awareness make it very easy for anyone to read and enjoy. PKD fans should buy this for completeness- not just completeness of their collection, but also completeness of PKD's range of writing."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"In this time tested fable Dick gives us a character who saw through the social conditioning that kept him insane. One of the gatekeepers to Ragal Gumm&#65533;s psuedo-city, Bill Black, was terrified that the psychic hero, Gumm, would recover from his insanity. By turning Gumm into an early warning radar mechanism Black kept the world safe from the moon launched weapons. Returning Gumm to his humanity would end the Where-Will-the-Little Green-Man-Be-Next Contest and Earth&#65533;s ability to defend against incoming moon based missiles.Dick&#65533;s obsession with the two questions: What is real? and What is an authentic human? were both answered in this novel, TIME OUT OF JOINT. When Gumm stopped believing in the artificial city, constructed around him to keep him insane, he discovered his real world. When he broke out of his fantasy land and returned to his old self he became a authentic human. Dick tried to understand the dissolution of his own reality much like Gumm watched a solid structured hot dog stand dissolve into colorless molecules, leaving only a slip of paper reading SOFT-DRINK STAND. After watching this happen Gumm remarks, &#65533;I think we&#65533;re living in some other world than what we see.....&#65533; As Afterword writer Lou Stathis put it, PKD came &#65533;to see all things as a unified energy field in which we are minuscule capsules entwined with tiny eddy-like pockets of wave-form energy manifesting itself in our personal realities.&#65533;(P. 263).When PKD&#65533;s earthly reality dissolved in 1982 no doubt he went to that other world that he couldn&#65533;t quite grasp while here. Is he now smiling at the attention and turmoil his &#65533;little slips of paper&#65533; have produced in this pseudo world? As for this little slip of a novel--definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"When he wrote _Time Out of Joint_, Philip K Dick was a very frustrated writer, having lots of luck selling so-so sci-fi for bargain basement prices to the pulps, and having no luck getting his non sci-fi work published. So a thought occured: &quot;Why not mix the two?&quot; It is this revelation that would change both his career, (which was never what it should have been, or is now) and what we think of as a science fiction novel.The book itself is a maze of self-doubt, which is apparent in all of Dick's better novels. Ragle Gumm, believing he lives in 1958 (When the book was written) watches as the town disintigrates, including a soft drink stand that turns into a piece of paper reading &quot;soft drink stand.&quot; The book is slow at first, but picks up fast. Unfortunately, after a cool sequence that predates &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;, it disintigrates into a political sci-fi mess. But don't let that distract you: This novel is as terrific as it is influential."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"Time Out of Joint is a very interesting exploration of a great deal of the ideas and feelings circulating in WWII (and post-WWII) America. Naturally, it contains the usual Dick-ian everyman who struggles with understanding how reality relates to his perception of reality, but there are thematic undertones that are far *less* common in some of Dick's more outlandish science-fiction tales such as McCarthyism (which undoubtedly Dick himself was struggling with first-hand), nostolgia for the \\"Golden Age\\" of pre-WWII America, Cold War paranoia, American hypocritical morality (i.e. Japanese Interment Camps), and so forth.Clearly, Dick had been reading a great deal of the linguistic and psychoanalytic theory that became prominent in the late 60's in academic settings as traces of post-structuralist thought as well as Freudian theory pop up all over the book.A very complex, yet easy-reading novel. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"The title of this review has a double pun involved...one is to the sheer masterpiece this book is...and the other to something the star of the matrix (which was GREATLY contributed to by this book) and his catch phrase...All puns aside...this is simply one of the greatest novels ever written...the plot is so obscure and oblique that it strikes remarkably close to home...and the overall idea of the entire book is enough to make you want to look over your shoulder when you are walking down that long corridor...(1984 pun...god im full of them tonight...)...this is one of the greatest books you can read...(and coincidentially a very hard one to find) if you like this book...i suggest you read &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; &quot;The World Jones Made&quot; &quot;Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep&quot;(book that the movie bladerunner was based on) by the same author...and also &quot;Brave New World&quot; by Aldous Huxley and &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;... by Ray Bradbury....and of course....&quot;Childhood's End&quot; by Arthur C. Clark.....ALL of these books i have mentioned and made puns of are awesome books...and should be read by anyone interested in seeing the future of the human race..."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"Saw The Truman Show in the cinema when it was out. Was perplexed, as I was getting a massive sense of deja vu throughout the film.So when I got home I began digging through the book collection. Eventually I found Time Out of Joint,the book I believe was the (unconscious?) memetic root of the film's ideas.Weird thing, in the book the hero is living in a perpetual 1958 (the book was written around then) where he is the centre of attention, and when he finally breaks out of the pretend town (some scenes, such as the wall of fire, are scene-for-scene the same as Truman Show) he finds out it's 1998 -- which is the year the Truman Show came out. Weird or what? In the book, I liked the description (from a 1959 person's point of view) of youth gangs in 1998. Women and men, with piercings and tatoos, the women with short hair and trousers were indistinguishable from the men.Great stuff, paranoiac exposition and crisp dialog put together in splendid economy. Great stuff."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"\\"The time is out of joint; O cursed spite!/That ever I was born to set it right!\\"...HamletSpeaking Vic: \\"The time\\" Ragle said, \\"is out of joint - I think we should compare notes\\" from Time Out Of Joint\\"Time Out of Joint\\", first published in 1959, is not one of his PKD's better known or critically acclaimed novels. Nonetheless it is a story I greatly admire. It concerns a man, Ragle Gumm, who makes his living by consistently correctly solving a newspaper puzzle contest: \\"Where Will the Little Green Man be Next?\\"At first this odd story appears quite mundane. Set against the background of small town suburbia life in the 1950's - nothing appears to out of the ordinary. Ragle Gumm's brother-in-law is a grocer, his young nephew gets into minor schoolboy mischief, he plays cards in the evening and there is an undercurrent of infidelity with the neighbor's wife. Slowly like a cat creeping across the lawn on a moonless night the weirdness starts to set in. Someone looks for a pull cord for a bathroom light they swore was always there and finds a wall switch. Small slips of paper with item names are found under or near where the item previously was thought to be located. Televisions are found in homes but no radios.A modestly paced story that engaged this reader as the plot unfolds but, unfortunately, marred by an ending that seem forced and out of place. It is my oppinion that the more you know about PKD the better you can appreciate this story.Additional comments August 2012I re-read this novel recently and it occurred to me that part of its charm is the \\"period\\" the story is set in. Dick wrote it in 1957-8 and peppers his story with references to then popular culture and politics. The seemingly abrupt \\"science-fiction\\" endings becomes more credible upon another reading.A strange and intriguing book worth another read if you're so inclined."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"I've read much of the Dick canon, and have great love for \\"The Man in the High Castle,\\" \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\", \\"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldrich,\\" \\"Martian Time-Slip\\" and others, but I think \\"Time Out of the Joint\\" is the one I just plain enjoyed the most. I love watching him trying out his \\"what's real\\" chops. And yeah, Andrew Niccol, you owe PKD for \\"The Truman Show\\" (which is a pretty good movie)."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"In the hands of the right director, Time Out Of Joint could be one of the best recent speculative fiction films of recent years.Equal parts Dark City and The Truman Show, this early Philip K. Dick novel touches on all that you expect from a PKD novel - \\"What is reality?\\" - and makes a real page-turner out of it. The pace after the lengthy into is blistering, the revelations exciting, and the Truth entirely strange and awesome. Predictable, maybe (I guessed it), but still quite a nice reveal. A real page-turner, this one, with some of Dick's best prose from his early days and a concept that has since been stolen a dozen times over. Never before has an uneventful drive in an 18-wheeler been so thrilling.Likely considered minor PKDick, and I understand why some might make that argument, but I was really caught im in this scenario. Among his better early novels and an excellent novel for the PKD novice to dip into before trying out his more heady, less accessible later work."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"Appearing in 1959 when P.K. Dick was 31 this book is set in a nameless town and centers around the gyrations, mental and physical, of Ragle Gumm, a paranoiac but proficient loner who lives nonetheless with his sister Margot and brother-in-law Victor, a supermarket employee. Other characters of note are Bill Black and his stunning but jejune wife Junie. Gumm is famous in his world, set contemporaneously in 1959, for the improbable skill of solving a daily newspaper puzzle, \\"Where Will the Little Green Man be Next?\\" He listens in a tree house with his nephew Sammy over a crystal radio set and detects people improbably discussing him. Since he is paranoid one might thing they are aliens but they are not. One of the biggest contributors to Gumm's paranoia is his world's tendency to alter precipitously. A maelstrom of things not being what they seem starts innocuously when he goes to the bathroom and reaches up for a string to pull the light off--a string which does not, and never did, exist in said bathroom. Far more radical is the tendency of things to turn into words. This slide down the Saussurean abyss is most startling after Gumm, taking time out from flirting with his neighbor Bill's wife Junie (he goes so far as to kiss her and tell her he loves her in the middle of the day as they lounge in public by an outdoor swimming pool), treks up a hill to a hotdog stand. \\"The soft-drink stand fell into bits. Molecules. He saw the molecules, colorless, without qualities, that made it up. Then he saw through, into the space beyond it, he saw the hill behind, the trees and sky. He saw the soft-drink stand go out of existence, along with the counter man, the cash register, the big dispenser of orange drink, the taps for Coke and root beer, the ice=chests of bottles, the hot dog broiler, the jars of mustard, the shelves of cones, the row of heavy round metal lids under which were the different ice creams. In its place was a slip of paper. He reached out his hand and took hold of the slip of paper. On it was printing, block letters. SOFT-DRINK STAND.\\" Ragle thinks he is being recognized and followed--and to an extent he is, because he is famous for his work on the puzzle. We realize we may be in a parallel universe when pictures of a girl (she had \\"heavy hair, well-groomed and quite long. She smiled in an amazingly sweet manner, a jejune but intimate smile that held him. Her face was as pretty as any hea had seen, and in addition she had a deep, full, sensual chin and neck, not the rather ordinary neck of most starlets but an adult, ripe neck, and excellent shoulders. No hint of boniness, nor of fleshiness. A mixture of races, he decided. German hair. Swiss or Norwegian shoulders\\") turn out to be Marilyn Monroe in England making a film with Sir Laurence Olivier. A series of coincidences spur Gumm to escape, despite the fact that Junie is ready to leave her husband for him, hijacking an eighteen wheeler. Without giving the ending away, let's just say that Dick's estate deserves royalties for The Truman Show, the Jim Carey show where reality turns out to be a huge staged production. In Time Out of Joint, leaving your home town takes you to the future-or what was the future, 1997-a time when Lunatics (moon settlers) are in civil war with Earth, where women wear boy's clothes and the height of young male fashion are tribal tattoos and \\"cones of hair, each with a sharp, colorful, spike stuck into it.\\" In addition to everything else, Dick seems to have predicted punk (anti-)fashion, almost half a century before its appearance."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"One of the smoothest, most charming, funny, and light-hearted books by PKD. Warning! Do not read the introduction! It spoils the book!The introduction gives us a new way to look at the works of PKD and I highly recommend it(after you have read the story.)If you like movies like \\"The Matrix\\" you might be surprised at their possible (subconscouis or otherwise) origins in stories like this one. Dick is to Sci-Fi movies what Lovecraft is to Horror movies. The going may be rocky, but what a spectacular view at the top!If you prefer the idea of science, over the idea of fiction, this may not be for you. If you suspect that the most creative science fiction was written before we went to the moon, this is definitely for you!"},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"Lost in all the mind-boggling 'what is real' question that would later flavor most of this master's work, is the groundwork he lays for relationship building. At the time this book was published--1959--sci-fi was, for the most part, hard science. This, however, is not the only 'gem' this book provides.Read the short scene with the youth--spiked, colored hair. Wait a minute. This book was published in 1959. Spiked, colored hair in 1959? I don't think so, not even California in 1959.In the annals of Dickdom, Time Out of Joint represents the same visionary mark of his talent as 'Meet the Beatles' did for The Beatles. A must read for any PKD fan."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"This is the first book that I read by Dick. Time Out of Joint has a quick plot, unusual plot twists, and a resonance throughout that hints at a far deeper meaning than what is being told. This is another work of true literature by a master writer."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"This fascinating novel presents a vision of 1950's America that is at once disturbing and eerily nostalgic. A small town slowly disintegrates before Ragle Gumm's eyes at the same time that his own sense of self is slowly stripped from him. The end of the book, which explains it all, is much less satisfying than the hallucinatory beginning which force the reader the face both the basic instability of identity and some of the dark undercurrents (such as sexual repression and the increased commodification of daily life) below the idealized image of small-town 50's America"},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"In my opinion, Time Out of Joint and Radio Free Albemuth - twodifferent sides of the spectrum as far as time is concerned -are the best Philip K. Dick novels. Radio Free has a crisp andunfortunately believable storyline, while Time Out of Joint isdelightfully free."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"I enjoyed _Time Out of Joint_. It is much simpler in structure andconcept than many of his later books, but you can see some of thethemes that came to dominate his later works here, too. The imageof a hot-dog stand dissolving into a slip of paper that says &quot;hotdog stand&quot; has stuck in my mind over the years."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"I enjoyed this book, It has some good ideas, even if wrong, promote deep thought on the qoutes. My only problem is that it got way too political way too fast (at the end).I would say 4 out of 5 stars since it is a good read, but not his best, still, it kept me hooked, and onto his next novel.Somethings dont get wrapped up really well, and some of the ideas are forgotten about. I have learned to accept that Dick's books will have a certain amount of politics in them, I try to ignore them and focus on the philisophical aspects.But overall, it provides good entertainment and, if youre lucky enough, good disscussion on the themes."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"\\"Time out of Joint\\" is definitely not one of Philip Dick's best novels. It's not awful or anything, especially the early parts of the book, but ultimately it just doesn't really hang together very well. Also, the book kind of fizzles and cops out at the end, which left me a bit disappointed and unsatisfied. Still, having said all that, there's some really good stuff in \\"Time Out of Joint,\\" including the usual, fascinating PKD-esian themes: the nature of reality; personal identity; memory; sanity vs. \\"insanity;\\" paranoia (or are they REALLY out to get you?); authoritarianism; war; conformity vs. individuality. And on the positive side, Dick DOES show flashes of brilliance during the early parts of the book, especially in the bathroom lightbulb scene and of course the disappearing hot dog stand scene, but to my tastes, Dick reverts to cliches and predictable plot devices in the last part of the book. He also lets certain narrative threads and characters just sort of unravel or disappear. All this doesn't completely ruin \\"Time Out of Joint,\\" but it does cause it to miss out on possible greatness and settle for just a \\"good\\" rating. Go ahead and take this one out of the library, but if you've never read Philip Dick before, I'd personally recommend that you start with \\"The Man in the High Castle,\\" my personal favorite so far."}]`),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:L},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],B={key:0},E={key:1};function j(n,o,s,c,r,i){const u=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(u,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",E,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",B,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const q=d(S,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-44f93a9f"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/46.md","filePath":"quotesmag/46.md"}'),M={name:"quotesmag/46.md"},F=Object.assign(M,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(q)]))}});export{R as __pageData,F as default};
